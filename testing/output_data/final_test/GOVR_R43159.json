    "content": "Title IV of the Higher Education Act authorizes financial assistance for students at eligible institutions. In the 2016-2017 academic year, 6,760 institutions were Title IV eligible, with 29.4% public, 27.8% private nonprofit, and 42.9% proprietary. $122.5 billion was available in federal student aid in FY2017. Institutions must meet criteria to participate in Title IV programs, including offering eligible programs. In order to participate in Title IV programs, an institution of higher education must meet the program integrity triad requirements, which include state authorization, accreditation, and certification by the Department of Education. The federal government relies on states and accrediting agencies to ensure educational program quality, with certification focusing on Title IV eligibility and additional requirements for institutions. Certification is a key component of the program integrity triad for Title IV eligibility. Institutions must meet various requirements related to fiscal responsibility, administrative capacity, recruiting practices, student policies, and program administration. Additional criteria, such as the 90/10 rule for proprietary institutions, may apply. Non-compliance may result in increased oversight or restrictions on Title IV participation. The HEA provisions affect a postsecondary institution's eligibility for Title IV student aid programs. Criteria include program integrity, Program Participation Agreements, campus safety policies, Clery Act compliance, return of Title IV funds, and distance education. Institutions must meet requirements related to programs, enrollment, operations, and program length to participate in Title IV programs. The HEA defines eligible institutions and program eligibility requirements. The Higher Education Act (HEA) contains definitions of institutions of higher education for Title IV program eligibility. Section 101 defines IHEs for participation in non-Title IV programs, while Section 102 is specific to Title IV program eligibility. Public and private nonprofit educational institutions must meet criteria to be considered IHEs under Section 101. Public institutions are generally described as those whose programs are government-operated. Nonprofit IHEs are educational institutions primarily supported by public funds and operated by states or government entities. They must be owned and operated by a nonprofit corporation, be tax-exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the IRC, and authorized to operate as a nonprofit organization by each state. These institutions admit students with a high school diploma or equivalent, individuals beyond compulsory school age, or those dually enrolled in secondary school. Institutions eligible for Title IV participation must be accredited, offer programs leading to a bachelor's degree or vocational training, and be authorized to provide postsecondary education within their state. Proprietary and postsecondary vocational institutions must meet specific criteria to be considered Title IV eligible IHEs, including providing programs for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. Postsecondary vocational institutions must offer programs for gainful employment in a recognized occupation and meet specific criteria to be considered Title IV eligible IHEs. These institutions must be accredited and authorized to provide the same educational program for at least two consecutive years. Foreign institutions can qualify to participate in Title IV student aid programs if they are comparable to eligible IHEs in the US, are accredited, and approved by the Department of Education. This includes foreign graduate medical schools, veterinary schools, and nursing schools, which must meet additional requirements. Foreign graduate medical schools, veterinary schools, and nursing schools may be proprietary institutions eligible for Title IV student aid programs, but must meet additional requirements such as admitting only high school graduates or equivalent, being legally authorized to provide postsecondary education. Additional requirements for foreign institutions are not discussed here. In order to be considered Title IV eligible, institutions must be legally authorized to provide postsecondary education, accredited by a recognized agency, and meet requirements related to course offerings and student enrollment. Institutions with more than 25% incarcerated students or more than 50% without a high school diploma must offer associate's or bachelor's degrees to be eligible. Additionally, institutions with more than 50% correspondence courses or students are ineligible for Title IV programs. Institutions must meet specific criteria to be Title IV eligible, including legal authorization, accreditation, and requirements on course offerings and student enrollment. If an institution has more than 50% correspondence courses or students, it is ineligible for Title IV programs. Additionally, bankruptcy filing or criminal convictions related to Title IV funds can also make an institution ineligible. Specific criteria apply to different types of institutions such as proprietary IHEs, postsecondary vocational institutions, and foreign institutions. To be Title IV eligible, an institution must offer at least one eligible program leading to a degree or certificate. Not all programs at an institution need to meet eligibility requirements, but students in ineligible programs cannot receive Title IV aid. The institution must ensure program eligibility before awarding aid to students. To be Title IV eligible, an institution must offer programs that meet specific criteria depending on the type of institution. Programs at public or private nonprofit IHEs must lead to degrees, transfer programs, or nondegree credentials for gainful employment. Programs eligible for Title IV funding include degree programs, transfer programs, nondegree credentials for gainful employment, certificate or diploma training programs, and teacher certification courses. These programs must meet specific instructional time requirements and prepare students for employment in a recognized occupation. Title IV eligible programs at proprietary and postsecondary vocational institutions must provide training for gainful employment in recognized occupations. Undergraduate programs require at least 600 clock hours of instruction over 15 weeks, while graduate or professional programs need at least 300 clock hours over 10 weeks. Short-term programs must have between 300 and 600 clock hours of instruction over 10 weeks. Title IV eligible programs at proprietary and postsecondary vocational institutions must meet specific criteria, including verified completion and placement rates of at least 70%. Programs offered by accredited proprietary institutions leading to a bachelor's degree in liberal arts must have continuous accreditation since October 1, 2007. Nondegree programs at public and private nonprofit institutions must prepare students for gainful employment in recognized occupations. The Department of Education issued final rules on gainful employment on October 31, 2014, requiring educational programs at institutions to meet minimum performance standards for preparing students for gainful employment. Institutions must disclose information about gainful employment programs to students and report data necessary for debt-to-earnings ratios calculation. The Department of Education issued gainful employment regulations in 2014 to set performance standards for educational programs. Implementation has been delayed, including data sharing with the Social Security Administration. Proposed rules to rescind the regulations may take effect in 2020. The Department of Education issued gainful employment regulations in 2014 to set performance standards for educational programs. Proposed rules could go into effect on July 1, 2020. The regulations establish a framework for programs offered by institutions of higher education to meet minimum performance standards for preparing students for gainful employment. The framework includes calculating debt-to-earnings rates to determine if programs are \"passing,\" \"in the zone,\" or \"failing.\" The gainful employment regulations set performance standards for educational programs based on debt-to-earnings rates. Programs are categorized as passing, in the zone, or failing. Programs failing in two out of three consecutive years or in the zone for four consecutive years will be ineligible for Title IV participation for three years. Disclosure requirements include warning students if a program may become ineligible based on debt-to-earnings ratios. The gainful employment regulations set performance standards for educational programs based on debt-to-earnings rates. Programs failing in two out of three consecutive years or in the zone for four consecutive years will be ineligible for Title IV participation for three years. IHEs must provide warnings to students about programs not meeting gainful employment standards and disclose specific program information. The gainful employment regulations require institutions to report on various aspects of their programs, including withdrawal rates, loan repayment rates, tuition costs, job placement rates, loan debt, earnings, cohort default rate, and annual earnings rate. Institutions must also ensure that each gainful employment program is accredited. The gainful employment regulations require institutions to report on program details such as withdrawal rates, loan repayment rates, job placement rates, and earnings. Programs must be accredited and meet state and federal accreditation and licensing requirements. Title IV of the HEA establishes the program integrity triad, consisting of state authorization, accreditation by ED-recognized agencies, and eligibility and certification by ED, to ensure compliance and integrity in postsecondary education. The state's role in program integrity at IHEs is to provide legal authority for institutions to operate postsecondary educational programs. This includes authorizing the IHE by name and having a process to address complaints. Institutions must also comply with state approval or licensure requirements. The state agency responsible for authorization must perform additional functions as needed. The state's role in program integrity at postsecondary institutions includes authorizing institutions to operate, addressing complaints, and ensuring compliance with state approval requirements. Institutions must provide information to the Secretary upon request, report fraud, and notify the Secretary of any revocations of authorization. Regulations issued by the Department of Education in 2016 require institutions offering distance education to meet state requirements where students reside, potentially through state authorization reciprocity agreements. The Secretary of Education delayed the implementation of regulations requiring institutions to meet state authorization reciprocity agreements until July 1, 2020. Accreditation by an ED-recognized agency is necessary for Title IV purposes to ensure quality in higher education institutions. Accreditation has been a voluntary process since its inception. Accreditation has been used as a form of external quality review to scrutinize colleges, universities, and programs for quality assurance and improvement. In 1952, the federal government began recognizing accrediting agencies to assess higher education quality for institutions to qualify for federal aid under the Korean GI Bill. Today, an IHE's Title IV eligibility is dependent on accreditation from an ED-recognized organization. Accreditation is necessary for an institution to qualify for federal aid under Title IV, and it is dependent on accreditation from an ED-recognized organization. Three types of accrediting agencies have emerged: Regional, National, and Specialized accrediting agencies, each focusing on different types of institutions or programs. Accreditation is essential for institutions to receive federal aid under Title IV, requiring accreditation from an ED-recognized organization. Institutions must be accredited by an agency recognized by the Department of Education to cover all programs. The accreditation process begins with a request from the institution or program. The accreditation process starts with a request from an institution or program. It is cyclical, ranging from every few years up to 10 years. A self-assessment is conducted to determine if basic standards are met, followed by an on-site visit by peers and the public. Accreditation is awarded, renewed, denied, or provisionally awarded based on the assessment and visit. Educational programs can also be accredited. Educational programs within institutions can be accredited by programmatic accrediting agencies, but for Title IV purposes, they only need to be covered by the IHE's primary accrediting agency. If an institution loses accreditation, it cannot participate in Title IV programs for 24 months unless the accrediting agency rescinds the loss. Religious institutions can maintain eligibility if the loss of accreditation is related to their religious mission. The accreditation status of an institution, whether it is related to its religious mission or not, is not determined by the HEA accreditation standards. If an accrediting agency loses recognition from the Department of Education (ED), the institution has 18 months to obtain accreditation from another recognized agency. The federal government requires institutions to be accredited by a recognized agency to be eligible for Title IV participation. ED's role is to recognize accrediting agencies as reliable authorities on education quality. The accrediting agency must meet specific criteria to operate within a state or region, including voluntary IHE membership and accreditation as a primary purpose. Additionally, agencies must be financially independent and separate from related organizations. The Secretary may waive the requirement for agency independence if it was ED-recognized before October 1, 1991, as long as the relationship with a related organization does not compromise accreditation independence. Accrediting agencies must consistently enforce quality standards for education programs, assessing student achievement in various ways such as course completion and job placement rates. Accrediting agencies must consider curricula, faculty, facilities, fiscal capacity, student support services, and admissions practices. They review an institution's operating procedures, policies for credit hours, program effectiveness, and conduct on-site visits. The final component is eligibility and certification by ED, which verifies legal authority, accreditation status, financial responsibility, and administrative capability for Title IV student aid programs. An institution's financial responsibility for Title IV student aid programs is determined by ED based on its ability to provide services, administer Title IV programs, meet financial obligations, and meet specific financial ratios. Public IHEs are deemed financially responsible if debts are backed by the state, while proprietary or private nonprofit IHEs must meet financial criteria set by ED. Financial responsibility is also contingent on meeting all financial obligations and debt payments. The Department of Education (ED) determines an institution's financial responsibility for Title IV student aid programs based on meeting specific financial ratios and obligations. If an institution fails to meet these requirements, ED may still consider it financially responsible under provisional certification, which includes alternative standards like submitting an irrevocable letter of credit or meeting specific monitoring requirements. An institution seeking certification must demonstrate financial responsibility and administrative capability to properly administer Title IV programs. This includes using electronic processes, resolving discrepancies in information, reporting fraud or misconduct, providing financial aid counseling, and maintaining internal standards. Institutions must have an adequate internal system of checks and balances for financial aid administration, including dividing payment authorization and fund disbursement. They must also certify staff eligibility, establish satisfactory academic progress standards for students receiving Title IV funds, and ensure no debarment or suspension by federal agencies. SAP standards set GPA requirements and time limits for students to complete programs. Failure to meet SAP makes students ineligible for Title IV funds. Institutions seeking Title IV participation must have a withdrawal rate below 33% and avoid high cohort default rates. Since 2014, ED has used a three-year CDP to calculate an institution's CDR. An IHE may be found administratively incapable if its CDR exceeds certain thresholds for loans under various programs. Institutions with high CDRs may lose eligibility for certain federal loan programs. ED can grant provisional certification for up to three years to institutions with high cohort default rates. If an institution is seeking initial certification, ED can grant provisional certification for up to one year or up to three years in certain circumstances. Institutions accredited by an agency that loses ED recognition can still participate in Title IV programs for up to 18 months. ED can conduct program reviews to ensure compliance with eligibility requirements. During a program review, the Department of Education (ED) evaluates an institution's compliance with Title IV requirements and identifies necessary corrective actions. Institutions with high cohort default rates, significant fluctuations in Pell Grant awards or Direct Loan volume, reported deficiencies by state or accrediting agencies, high annual dropout rates, or deemed at risk of non-compliance may receive priority reviews. If found non-compliant, ED may grant provisional certification, take corrective actions, or impose sanctions. ED has the authority to impose various sanctions. The Department of Education (ED) has the authority to impose sanctions and corrective actions on institutions that violate Title IV program rules or misrepresent their educational programs. Sanctions may include fines, limitations, suspensions, emergency actions, and terminations. Third-party servicers can also be sanctioned. ED can fine institutions up to $55,907 for each violation, depending on the seriousness of the offense. The Department of Education (ED) can impose sanctions on institutions for violating Title IV program rules. Sanctions include fines, limitations, suspensions, emergency actions, and terminations. Institutions may have to repay funds or make payments to students. ED can withhold funds if an institution misuses federal funds. The Department of Education can impose sanctions on institutions for violating Title IV program rules, including fines, limitations, suspensions, emergency actions, and terminations. Emergency actions suspend an institution's participation in Title IV programs for up to 30 days, while termination prohibits participation for at least 18 months. To request reinstatement, institutions must demonstrate corrections to violations. Additional requirements affect institutional eligibility for Title IV programs. Institutions must meet requirements for Title IV programs, including Program Participation Agreements, return of funds, and distance education. Failure to comply may lead to loss of eligibility or sanctions. Each institution must have a current Program Participation Agreement to participate in Title IV programs, listing eligible programs and expiration dates. The Program Participation Agreement (PPA) outlines key requirements for institutions to participate in Title IV programs, including acting as a fiduciary, not charging processing fees for eligibility determination, and maintaining proper administrative procedures. It also includes specific eligibility criteria and institution-specific requirements. PPAs require IHEs to derive at least 10% of revenue from non-Title IV funds, known as the 90/10 rule. Violations result in provisional eligibility status for two years, with loss of eligibility for two consecutive violations. Incentive compensation based on enrollment success is prohibited in PPAs, with some exceptions. The ban on incentive compensation in PPAs applies to enrollment and financial aid activities, with exceptions for certain recruitment methods. Direct student interaction roles are ineligible for incentive compensation, while marketing activities are allowed to receive incentives. The Clery Act (HEA Section 485(f) requires Title IV participating IHEs to report campus crime statistics and establish safety policies in an annual security report. This report must include data on offenses like murder, burglary, and sexual violence, as well as information on safety procedures and reporting mechanisms for criminal actions. The annual security report (ASR) required by the Clery Act must include information on campus crime statistics, safety procedures, reporting mechanisms, prevention programs for crimes, enforcement of alcohol and drug laws, and policies related to domestic and sexual violence incidents. The Clery Act mandates procedures for preventing and responding to campus incidents, including victim and institutional protocols, disciplinary actions, evidence standards, sanctions, and protective measures. It also prohibits the Secretary of Education from dictating specific policies and retaliation against those exercising their rights under the act. HEA Section 484B requires Title IV aid recipients who withdraw early to return funds to the Department of Education. When a student withdraws from an IHE, the institution must determine the earned and unearned portion of Title IV aid. Unearned funds must be returned to ED according to a prescribed schedule. Funds must be returned on a pro rata basis up to the 60% point of the payment period. After this point, all funds are considered earned. The return of funds depends on various factors, including whether they were applied to institutional charges. Loans are returned first, followed by Pell grants. Distance education and correspondence education allow for educational instruction with a separation in time or place between the student and instructor. Institutions use new technologies to offer a variety of courses, increasing student access to postsecondary education. Distance education utilizes various technologies such as internet, broadcast transmissions, and audio conferencing to deliver instruction to students separated from the instructor. Interaction between students and instructors must be regular and substantive. Correspondence courses, which do not involve regular interaction, are excluded from the definition of distance education. In 1992, Congress implemented the \"50% rules\" in response to fraudulent practices in correspondence institutions. These rules state that institutions are ineligible for Title IV aid if more than 50% of courses are correspondence-based or if 50% of students are enrolled in correspondence courses. The regulations for distance education programs require institutions to meet state authorization requirements, with a delay in implementation until July 1, 2020. Domestic IHEs offering distance education must be accredited by an ED-recognized agency for Title IV eligibility, while foreign IHEs are ineligible for Title IV if offering distance education. Ineligible for Title IV participation: distance education or correspondence."
