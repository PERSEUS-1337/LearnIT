    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia Diagnosis and Treatment Act of 2011\". The Congress finds that Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is a vascular genetic bleeding disorder causing abnormalities in blood vessels, leading to spontaneous hemorrhage or stroke. This disorder can result in disability and premature death due to arteriovenous malformations in the brain or lung. Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) affects 1 in 5,000 Americans, leading to increased morbidity and mortality rates. Lack of awareness puts 90% of affected families at risk of preventable life-threatening incidents like stroke. Early detection and treatment can prevent premature deaths and long-term complications associated with HHT. Timely identification and management of HHT cases is crucial for saving lives, preventing disability, and reducing healthcare costs. Without a new program for early detection, screening, and treatment, 14,000 individuals with HHT in the population today face premature death and disability. The Act aims to establish a federally funded program for early diagnosis and treatment of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia to reduce suffering, prevent premature death, and lower healthcare costs. It includes an amendment to the Public Health Service Act to address hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. The Secretary will establish an HHT initiative to improve early detection, screening, and treatment of HHT, focusing on research and increasing awareness. Consultation with NIH and CDC directors is required. The Secretary will establish the HHT Coordinating Committee within 60 days of the enactment, consisting of 12 members who are experts in HHT or AVM, including representatives from HHT Treatment Centers of Excellence and experts in vascular, molecular, or basic science. The HHT Coordinating Committee will consist of 12 members, including experts in vascular, molecular, or basic science appointed by the Secretary. The Chair of the Committee will be designated from among its members, and interim members may be appointed before the establishment of HHT Treatment Centers of Excellence. Names of the Chair and members will be published within 30 days of the Committee's establishment. The HHT Coordinating Committee will have 12 members appointed for 3-year terms, with vacancies filled by the Secretary. The Committee will develop and coordinate research on HHT across national research institutes. The HHT Coordinating Committee will coordinate research on HHT across national research institutes, including the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and others. They will also evaluate and make recommendations on research prioritization and awards. The HHT Coordinating Committee will oversee research grants for HHT, focusing on understanding, training programs, and genetic testing to improve accuracy. Definitions for Committee and HHT are provided. SEC. 5. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION. Part B of title III of the Public Health Service Act is amended by inserting after section 317T the following: \"SEC. 317U. HEREDITARY HEMORRHAGIC TELANGIECTASIA.\" The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will conduct activities related to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), including population screening, developing guidelines for diagnosis and intervention, creating a family history survey tool, and establishing an HHT resource center for education. The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will conduct activities related to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), including population screening, education programs for health professionals, and collaboration with medical organizations to improve HHT awareness. This will be done through collaborative approaches within the CDC, funding HHT Treatment Centers of Excellence, and disseminating information to the public. The HHT Treatment Centers of Excellence aim to improve patient access to care by HHT experts and conduct surveillance to accurately identify the prevalence of HHT, hemorrhagic and embolic stroke, and brain abscess. Screening questions for HHT will be included in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey to determine prevalence, and data will be disseminated to the Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Registry. The Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Registry will be used for analyzing the natural history of hemorrhagic and embolic stroke in HHT, developing screening and treatment guidelines specific to HHT complications. Programs will be implemented to increase HHT diagnosis and treatment rates through partnerships with HHT Treatment Centers of Excellence and the creation of an international patient database. The HHT Treatment Center of Excellence aims to integrate databases for monitoring hemophilia and stroke, involve various medical providers, and utilize existing databases to improve health outcomes and research priorities related to HHT. The HHT Treatment Center of Excellence may designate academic health centers with expert teams capable of providing comprehensive evaluation, treatment, and education for individuals with HHT. These centers must have sufficient personnel knowledgeable about HHT or collaborate with other organizations to coordinate patient care effectively. The academic health center designated as an HHT Treatment Center of Excellence must have a medical director with specialized knowledge of HHT and administrative staff capable of coordinating patient care efficiently. Staff should have sufficient knowledge to respond to patient inquiries promptly and have adequate financial support. The HHT Treatment Center of Excellence requires staff to dedicate 25-50% of their time to HHT, including specialists in otolaryngology, interventional radiology, genetic counseling, and on-site screening facilities. They must see at least 25 new HHT patients annually and have established coordination mechanisms. The HHT Treatment Center of Excellence requires staff to dedicate 25-50% of their time to HHT, see at least 25 new HHT patients per year, and have established mechanisms to coordinate surveillance and outreach with HHT patient advocacy organizations. SEC. 6. ADDITIONAL HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ACTIVITIES. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will award grants for analyzing Medicare costs related to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and recommending improved data collection methods. Authorization of appropriations is also provided. Authorization of appropriations totaling $5,000,000 for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 is provided to carry out specific sections of the Public Health Service Act. Additionally, $1,000,000 is allocated for a Resource Center to implement a particular section of the Act."
