    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. The Taiwan Relations Act is crucial for US-Taiwan relations, governing arms sales since 1979. It considers any nonpeaceful means for Taiwan's future a threat to peace in the Western Pacific. The Act aims to provide Taiwan with defensive arms and maintain US capacity to resist force. The Taiwan Relations Act ensures the US will provide defense articles and services to Taiwan for self-defense. Taiwan's Quadrennial Defense Review aims to shape regional security and deter conflict. The US aims to help Taiwan strengthen its defenses by transforming its military into a more efficient fighting force with sustainable capabilities. However, arms transfer notifications for various military equipment have not been sent to Congress yet, despite authorization in 2008. Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou has expressed the desire to acquire US-built F-16 C/Ds and other weapons on multiple occasions. Despite improvements in cross-strait ties, he emphasized the need to remain vigilant. China's military capabilities were highlighted in a 2009 Department of Defense report to Congress. China's military is rapidly developing coercive capabilities that could be used to pressure Taiwan and deter U.S. support in case of conflict. SEC. 2. MANDATORY CONGRESSIONAL BRIEFINGS. The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, must provide detailed briefings to Congress on discussions with Taiwan and potential defense transfers. The covered period is defined as the time between the enactment of the Act and the initial briefing, with subsequent briefings to follow annually. The term \"executive branch agency\" is defined as an agency in the federal government. The terms \"defense article\" and \"defense service\" are defined in the Arms Export Control Act."
