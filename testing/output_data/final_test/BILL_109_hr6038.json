    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Stop AIDS in Prison Act of 2006\" and includes a comprehensive HIV/AIDS policy. The Bureau of Prisons is required to develop a policy for HIV/AIDS testing, treatment, and prevention in correctional facilities to stop the spread of the disease among inmates, protect staff, provide medical care, raise awareness, and promote personal responsibility for health. The Bureau of Prisons is mandated to develop a policy for HIV/AIDS testing, treatment, and prevention in correctional facilities to prevent transmission, consult with relevant agencies, and implement regulations within a year of the Act's enactment. The Bureau of Prisons must establish a policy for HIV/AIDS testing, treatment, and prevention in correctional facilities to prevent transmission. The policy under section 2 mandates HIV/AIDS testing and counseling for inmates upon intake, including routine testing and post-test counseling for those who test positive. Medical personnel must also provide education on HIV/AIDS transmission risks and promote awareness to reduce transmission through educational programs. The policy mandates HIV/AIDS testing for inmates, with medical personnel allowing tests once a year or upon request if exposure is suspected. Confidentiality is protected to encourage testing. The Bureau of Prisons will develop procedures for inmates to confidentially request HIV/AIDS counseling and tests. Inmates who test positive will receive comprehensive medical treatment and confidential counseling. Testing, counseling, and referral will be provided prior to reentry. Prior to reentry, medical personnel will conduct routine HIV/AIDS testing for all inmates. Those already known to be infected do not need retesting. Positive inmates will receive confidential counseling on managing their condition, accessing treatment, and preventing transmission to others in the community. Medical personnel will conduct routine HIV/AIDS testing for all inmates before reentry. Positive inmates will receive counseling on managing their condition and accessing treatment. Referrals to appropriate healthcare providers and social service agencies will be provided to meet the inmate's individual needs. If an inmate refuses testing, it will be noted in their medical records without disciplinary action. SEC. 4. CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW. Amends Section 4014(a) of title 18, United States Code, to remove certain language regarding virus testing and require testing before release unless declined. Also amends Section 4014(e) to include initial testing as part of routine health screening at intake."
