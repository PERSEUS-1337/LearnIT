    "content": "The \"Earthquake Insurance Affordability Act\" includes provisions for eligible State programs, establishment of a debt-guarantee program, payment of losses, and regulations. The Act aims to address earthquake insurance affordability issues. Congress finds that major earthquakes are likely in the United States, with predictions of a magnitude 6.7 earthquake in California having a 99.7 percent chance of occurring in the next 30 years. Despite this risk, few homeowners have earthquake insurance, with 88 percent of homes insured for fire lacking earthquake coverage. The lack of homeowner earthquake insurance coverage after a major earthquake can slow recovery, create economic hardship, and increase the risk of defaults, affecting the banking system. States should improve affordability and availability of earthquake insurance. The Federal Government should help prepare and protect citizens from catastrophes like earthquakes. The Act aims to promote private capital for State earthquake insurance programs and expedite claim payments to aid financial recovery from earthquakes by allowing the Treasury Secretary to guarantee debt.

Eligible State Programs: A State program must be certified to comply with specific requirements, including offering residential earthquake insurance coverage and not pooling resources from insurers. Requirements for eligible State programs include a majority of governing body members being public officials, the State having a financial interest, and returning appropriated funds with interest. The program must also have received a written determination from the Secretary. The State program must not distribute net profits to participating insurers and must include provisions for loss prevention and mitigation. The State program must enforce building codes, seismic-design standards, and safety codes, as well as establish an insurance rate structure that considers measures to reduce insured losses. Cross-subsidization between different property-and-casualty insurance lines is prohibited, except for post-event financing or bonding charges.

Premium rates charged for insurance must be actuarially sound, and coverage and mitigation services must be provided on a non-discriminatory basis. The Secretary will establish procedures for certification and recertification as an eligible State program. Establishment of debt-guarantee program. The Secretary is authorized to guarantee debt issued by eligible State programs for earthquake peril coverage, with a limit of $5 billion in guarantees. Funding is appropriated for this purpose. Funds are appropriated from the Treasury to satisfy debt guarantee commitments for eligible State programs. A certification fee is charged to cover administrative costs, not exceeding one-half of 1 percent annum of the aggregate. The Secretary may expend funds for administrative expenses related to the debt-guarantee program, collected through certification and recertification fees. Guarantees are only issued if the Secretary has made a commitment. The Secretary issues a commitment to guarantee to a certified, eligible State program for a period of 3 years, extendable annually. The program must submit a report on how it plans to repay guarantee-eligible debt, and the Secretary must determine reasonable assurance of repayment. The eligible State program must enter into an agreement with the Secretary, committing not to use Federal funds for debt repayment. The commitment to guarantee includes payment of fees and limits the debt term to 30 years. The Secretary is mandated to provide assistance upon request under a guarantee commitment. The eligible State program can request a guarantee for insured losses exceeding 80% of qualifying assets, subject to a 30-year debt term limit.

The Secretary's guarantee under the Act is evidence that the debt qualifies, is valid, legal, and enforceable. Fees are charged to cover administrative costs and potential losses. Payments for losses are also addressed. The Secretary agrees to pay the Fiscal Agent for the eligible State program any unpaid debt guaranteed under the Act. Payments are made on the due date or the next business day after notice of insufficient funds. The Secretary is subrogated to the rights of the recipient and can recover from the State.

The cost of guarantees under this Act will be calculated by adjusting the discount rate for market risk.\n\nSEC. 11.
