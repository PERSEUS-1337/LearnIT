    "content": "The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill includes funding for various agencies such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Department of Energy, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and others. The FY2017 funding for these programs was provided by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, totaling $38.89 billion with $436 million in rescissions. This funding was higher than the Obama Administration's request and FY2016 levels. The FY2017 Energy and Water Development appropriations bill included $2.26 billion in new mandatory funding for the Department of Energy, which was not approved. Proposed reductions for the Corps, Reclamation, and CUP were also rejected. The Senate approved the bill with total appropriations $261 million above the request. The House bill H.R. 5055, which aimed to increase funding by $4 million, was rejected on May 26, 2016, due to controversial amendments. Funding for FY2016 Energy and Water Development programs was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, providing $37.3 billion, a 5.8% increase over FY2015. The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill for FY2016 allocated $37.3 billion, with increases for DOE, the Corps, Reclamation, and independent agencies. Congressional consideration is influenced by procedural and statutory budget enforcement measures, including limits set by the Budget Control Act of 2011. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 and 2015 established higher spending limits for FY2014 through FY2017, deviating from the original Budget Control Act process. Congressional debates on Energy and Water Development appropriations for FY2017 included controversial proposals. The Energy and Water Development bill for FY2017 included significant funding increases for the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. Congress rejected the Obama Administration's proposed budget reductions for the Corps and recommended increases over the FY2016 appropriations level. The House Appropriations Committee approved a reduction in funding for the Bureau of Reclamation from FY2016 levels, while the Senate approved level funding. The Senate also prohibited the Corps from changing the definition of \"fill material\" or \"discharge of fill material\" in FY2017. The Obama Administration objected to this restriction, but it was included in the final bill. Additionally, drought-related provisions from a previous House bill were incorporated into the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill for FY2017. The House Appropriations Committee proposed new provisions in H.R. 5055 for the Bureau of Reclamation, but they were not included in the FY2017 Consolidated Appropriations Act. These provisions would have authorized alterations to pumping restrictions for certain species listed under the Endangered Species Act, affecting water exports south of the Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta. The changes were similar to provisions in H.R. 2898, setting negative flows on the Old and Middle Rivers at -5,000 cubic feet per second. The House Appropriations Committee proposed new provisions in H.R. 5055 for the Bureau of Reclamation, including setting negative flows at -5,000 cubic feet per second unless lower flows are needed to protect species. There are differences between H.R. 5055 and H.R. 2898 in sections related to drought provisions and California water rights priorities. The Obama Administration requested a significant increase in funding for DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable. The Obama Administration requested a significant increase in funding for DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) for FY2017, totaling $2.898 billion. However, both the House Appropriations Committee and the Senate rejected the proposed budget increases, with the House panel approving a cut from FY2016 and the Senate approving level funding. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provided $2.09 billion for EERE. The Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated $2.09 billion for DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) in FY2017, with a $17.2 million increase from FY2016. DOE proposed a significant increase in funding for the Integrated Waste Management System (IWMS) to $76.3 million, focusing on developing storage and disposal sites for radioactive spent fuel. Research and development on used fuel disposition would also increase to $74.3 million. The DOE proposed a pilot interim storage facility for spent fuel from closed reactors, a transportation system, and progress on a larger storage facility. The Obama Administration wanted to abandon the Yucca Mountain repository, but the Trump Administration proposed to revive it. The House Appropriations Committee provided no funding for IWMS and approved $150.0 million for the Yucca Mountain project. The Senate approved $61.0 million for IWMS. The Obama Administration proposed changes to DOE's Fossil Fuels Research and Development program in FY2017, focusing on carbon capture and storage, advanced power systems, and fuel supply impact mitigation. The total funding request was $600 million offset by $240 million of prior-year balances. No funding was provided for Yucca Mountain in the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The Obama Administration proposed restructuring the fossil fuels budget with a funding reduction mostly rejected by Congress. The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in France raised concerns about management, schedule, and cost. The U.S. is to pay 9.09% of construction costs, estimated between $4.0 billion and $6.5 billion. Obama's proposed U.S. contribution for FY2017 was $125.0 million, $10.0 million above FY2016. The Obama Administration proposed restructuring the fossil fuels budget with a funding reduction mostly rejected by Congress. The U.S. is to pay 9.09% of construction costs for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in France. DOE recommended U.S. participation in ITER continue for at least two more years. The House approved $125.0 million for FY2017, while the Senate provided no funding. The Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated $50 million for the Weapons Activities account in DOE's National Nuclear Security Administration. NNSA Administrator Frank G. Klotz testified on the FY2017 budget. The FY2017 budget request for NNSA's Infrastructure and Operations was $2.722 billion, with facilities over 40 years old. The DOE budget request for Weapons Activities in FY2017 was $9.235 billion, approved by the Senate with an additional $8.4 million recommended by the House panel. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provided $9.246 billion for Weapons Activities, including $2.808 billion for Infrastructure and Operations. The Mixed-Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) was mentioned as well. The Mixed-Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) faced rising construction costs, leading to a proposed termination in FY2017. DOE considered a cheaper alternative of diluting surplus plutonium for disposal at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. The Senate approved funding for the dilute and dispose option, while the House panel voted to continue construction at the FY2016 funding level. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provided $335 million for MFFF construction, a slight reduction from FY2016. The FY2017 appropriations request for the Mixed-Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) was reduced by 1.5% from FY2016. Congress rejected proposals to place MFFF in \"cold standby\" in previous years, citing the need to fulfill agreements with Russia and South Carolina. The Department of Energy's Office of Environmental Management (EM) saw a $773 million (14.2%) reduction in funding for environmental cleanup and waste management activities in FY2017. The U.S. Enrichment Corporation (USEC) Fund, previously used by USEC as a government corporation, was considered for mandatory spending offset by fee collections from nuclear utilities for DOE uranium enrichment facility cleanup. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a slight decrease in cleanup funding, while the Senate approved a slight increase. Proposed offsets were rejected, and not included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, which allocated $6.42 billion for EM activities in FY2017. The Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill includes budget totals for FY2009 through FY2017, with four titles: Corps of Engineers\u2014Civil, Department of the Interior, Department of Energy, and Independent Agencies. Major programs are described in approximate order, with previous appropriations and recommendations for FY2017 shown in tables.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, under the civil works program funded by the Energy and Water Appropriations bill, plans, builds, operates, and maintains water resources facilities for navigation, flood risk reduction, and ecosystem restoration. Recent legislation, such as the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014, authorizes Corps activities. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 authorized new Corps projects and changed policies. Unlike other infrastructure programs, federal funds for the Corps are not distributed based on a formula. Congress identifies additional projects for funding beyond the President's budget request. Since FY2010, Congress has not added funding at the project level due to earmark moratorium policies. Instead, they have included \"additional funding\" for select categories of Corps projects in FY2016, totaling $1.257 billion. The Bureau of Reclamation built most large dams and water diversion structures in the West, while the Army Corps of Engineers focused on flood control and navigation projects. Reclamation's original mission was to develop water supplies for irrigation in the West. Today, it assists in meeting water demands while protecting the environment. Reclamation manages hundreds of dams and reservoirs, providing water to 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people. It is the largest wholesale water supplier in the West and the second-largest hydroelectric power producer in the nation, also offering flood control, recreation, and wildlife benefits. Reclamation's operations have significant impacts on fish and wildlife species and can lead to conflicts among water users during drought conditions. The agency's budget consists mainly of individual project funding lines, with the largest account covering traditional programs like construction, dam safety, and ecosystem restoration. Congressional earmarks for specific Reclamation projects are currently restricted due to a moratorium. The Bureau of Reclamation has received additional appropriations from Congress to address drought conditions in the West. The Central Utah Project is overseen by a separate office within the Department of the Interior. The Energy and Water Development bill has funded all Department of Energy programs since FY2005, including research on renewable energy, nuclear power, and environmental cleanup.
