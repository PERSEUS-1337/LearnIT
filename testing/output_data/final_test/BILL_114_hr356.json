Congress finds that despite an improving economy, the unemployment rate among wounded warriors is nearly 17.8%. These veterans need support to find work and thrive economically, with the Department of Veterans Affairs' vocational rehabilitation program being crucial. Only 20% of wounded warriors pursuing employment are currently benefiting from these services. In 2013, only 20% of wounded warriors pursuing education chose vocational rehabilitation, while 54% opted for the Post-9/11 Educational Assistance Program. Veterans prefer the educational program due to its easier application process and greater freedom to pursue career goals. The Department of Veterans Affairs faces challenges with workload management in the program. The Government Accountability Office identified challenges in workload management within the Department of Veterans Affairs program, including issues with staff allocation, decentralized administration, and training. Some regional offices are struggling with high caseloads, impacting service delivery to veterans.
