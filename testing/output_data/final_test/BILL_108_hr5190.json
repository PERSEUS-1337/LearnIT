    "content": "The Act titled \"Dam Rehabilitation and Repair Act of 2004\" focuses on the rehabilitation and repair of deficient dams. The National Dam Safety Program Act defines a deficient dam as one that fails to meet minimum safety standards and poses an unacceptable risk to the public. The National Dam Safety Program Act defines rehabilitation as the repair, replacement, reconstruction, or removal of a dam to meet State dam safety standards. Additionally, the Act includes a program for the rehabilitation and repair of deficient dams. \"SEC. 8A. Rehabilitation and repair of deficient dams.\" The Director will establish a program within FEMA to provide grant assistance to States for rehabilitating publicly-owned deficient dams. States can apply for grants by submitting applications according to regulations set by the Director. Grants may be awarded for dam rehabilitation projects that meet the specified criteria. The Director will enter into a project grant agreement with the State to establish terms for the grant and project. A risk-based priority system will be developed for identifying deficient dams eligible for grants. Funds allocated for grants to States will be divided equally among applying States and based on the number of non-Federal publicly-owned dams identified by the Secretary of the Army. The Secretary of the Army identifies dams in the national inventory as a danger to human health within the State. The Federal share of rehabilitation costs for deficient dams cannot exceed 65%. Authorization of appropriations includes $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2006 and $100,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2007 to 2009. Authorization of appropriations includes $100,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2007 to 2009 to provide for additional staff of FEMA as necessary. Sums appropriated shall remain available until expended. The Director of FEMA must issue a proposed rule within 90 days and a final rule within 120 days after the enactment of the Act regarding amendments to the National Dam Safety Program Act."
