The Congress finds that Americans value unspoiled wilderness and wildlife on public lands, especially the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. President Eisenhower initiated protection of this area. President Dwight D. Eisenhower set aside 8,900,000 acres in 1960 to protect the Arctic coastal plain for wildlife and wilderness values. In 1980, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was expanded by Congress through the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, doubling its size and extending wilderness protection. The House of Representatives passed legislation to protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, including the Arctic coastal plain, from industrial development. Americans support preserving the refuge and consider oil and gas exploration incompatible with its wilderness ecosystem. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, established for subsistence uses by local residents, is managed to preserve the wilderness ecosystem. Canada also protects the habitat of the Porcupine River caribou herd. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge aims to protect the Arctic coastal plain, allowing for energy development while preserving the wilderness ecosystem. Congress declares it a policy to honor bipartisan efforts in safeguarding this natural treasure for current and future generations. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge aims to protect the ecosystem for future generations by preserving it in its natural condition. Designation of approximately 1,559,538 acres of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska as wilderness under the Wilderness Act, to be administered by the Secretary of the Interior in accordance with existing wilderness areas within the refuge."
