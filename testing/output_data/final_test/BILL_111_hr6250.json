Requiring Congressional redistricting to follow specific standards and public notice requirements after apportionment of Representatives. Standards include equal population distribution in districts. Standards for Congressional districting include equal population distribution, using the census as the basis, contiguous territory, compliance with the Voting Rights Act, and preventing dilution of voting strength.

The boundaries of Congressional districts in the State must not dilute voting strength, except as required by the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Districts should avoid dividing local government units and follow specific standards to minimize such divisions. Congressional districts shall not cross multiple local government boundaries, with a limit of 2 fragments per district or local government unit. Congressional districts in a State must be compact and drawn to avoid bypassing nearby populations. The boundaries should not divide local government units and limit fragments to 2 per district or unit. The criteria for drawing congressional districts include ensuring each district contains at least 60% of the population, with boundaries formed by straight lines for compactness. The average population percentage for all districts in the state must be at least 75%. Only the state's population is considered, excluding offshore islands. The computation of percentages for determining Congressional district boundaries excludes offshore islands. The total population of a census block is attributed to a district if its geographic center falls within the district. The geographic center is defined as the point within the block used for labeling on a map. Public notice requirements are also specified. Public notice requirements for Congressional redistricting include making detailed maps available online, publishing boundaries of proposed districts, analyzing population data, and soliciting public comments. During Congressional redistricting, the government entity responsible for the process in a State must share population and demographic data online continuously. This information is used to develop redistricting plans and must be available from the final deadline provided under the relevant Act. The Clerk of the House of Representatives transmits the number of Representatives to each State for the following Congress, as per the 1929 Act. The Congressional redistricting plan must be enacted by the State before a certain date. SEC. 3. NO EFFECT ON ELECTIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL OFFICE. This Act does not impact how a State conducts elections for State or local office, including the establishment of election districts. SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act applies to congressional redistricting after the 2010 census."
