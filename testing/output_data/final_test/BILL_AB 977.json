    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 13480 of the Water Code is amended to allow the use of funds for specific purposes outlined in the federal act, including construction of treatment works, management programs, conservation plans, and financial assistance for grant-funded projects. The Water Code is amended to allow funds for projects authorized by the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Moneys in the fund can be used for loans at market interest rates with repayment starting within one year of project completion. Loan forgiveness is allowed based on federal capitalization grants. Require loan recipients to establish a dedicated revenue source for loan repayment. The combined interest and loan service rate for loans from the fund shall not exceed 50 percent of the state's interest rate on general obligation bonds. The rate will be calculated using the true interest cost method and rounded up to the nearest one-tenth of 1 percent. Loans used for facility planning must comply with federal regulations. Publicly owned treatment works must comply with federal regulations outlined in Section 603(e) of the federal act (33 U.S.C. Sec. 1383(e)). The loan interest rate for certain applicants is 0 percent if they provide matching funds. Refinancing of remaining unpaid loan balance at 0 percent is possible with a 20 percent repayment. The program also allows buying or refinancing debt obligations of municipalities at or below market rates. The fund can be used to guarantee local obligations, purchase insurance, provide revenue for bond payments, establish loan guarantees, and earn interest. The fund can be used for earning interest, administering fund activities, providing financial assistance for grant-funded projects, and offering various types of assistance authorized by federal grants."
