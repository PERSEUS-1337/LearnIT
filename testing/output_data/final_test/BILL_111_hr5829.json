    "content": "During World War II, President Roosevelt established the War Shipping Administration to build and operate civilian shipping vessels for the war effort. United States merchant mariners transported goods through contested waters to combat theaters. After the war, they were responsible for transporting various materials. During World War II, merchant mariners transported millions of US Armed Forces members back to the United States. The GI Bill Improvement Act of 1977 allowed service by civilians to be considered \"active service\" for benefits. In 1987, three mariners sued the Secretary of the Air Force for denying their veteran application. During World War II, women were denied official documentation affirming their merchant marine seamen status. Coast Guard Information Sheet #77 lists acceptable forms of documentation for eligibility under the GI Bill Improvement Act of 1977 and Veterans Programs Enhancement Act of 1998. During World War II, masters of tugs, towboats, and seagoing barges were relieved of submitting reports of seamen shipped or discharged, making certificates of shipping and discharge forms unavailable to eligible individuals seeking documentation. Coast Guard Information Sheet #77 states that deck logs were traditionally considered the property of ship owners. During World War II, the deck and engine logbooks of vessels operated by the War Shipping Administration were turned over to the agency and destroyed in the 1970s. This means that continuous discharge books are not available to all eligible individuals seeking documentation. Additionally, some World War II period log books do not name ports visited due to wartime security restrictions, making it difficult for individuals to document their eligibility. SEC. 3. METHODS FOR VALIDATING CERTAIN SERVICE CONSIDERED TO BE ACTIVE SERVICE BY THE SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. The Secretary of Defense may recognize an individual's service under honorable conditions in the merchant marine based on Social Security Administration records and validated testimony if no official records are available. The Secretary of Defense may recognize an individual's service in the merchant marine from December 7, 1941, to December 31, 1946, even if official records are unavailable. Other official documentation can be accepted to prove the service during this period. The Secretary may recognize masters of seagoing vessels or officers in command as agents of the United States for documenting individuals for merchant marine service from December 7, 1941, to December 31, 1946. Other accepted documentation fulfills eligibility requirements for this service period. The term \"primary next of kin\" refers to the closest living relative of an individual seeking recognition for their service. Recognition for service under this section refers to the closest living relative of the individual who was alive during the period of such service. This Act will take effect 90 days after its enactment."
