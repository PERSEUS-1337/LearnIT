    "content": "The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 aimed to improve health insurance coverage, combat fraud in Medicare and Medicaid, and promote electronic record-keeping. HIPAA included requirements for electronic transactions between healthcare providers and payers to protect electronic health information. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 mandated the use of specific code sets in electronic transactions for patient eligibility and claims processing. It also required the adoption of unique identifiers for healthcare providers, health plans, and employers. Additionally, HIPAA specified security standards to protect electronic health information. Covered entities under HIPAA include health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and healthcare providers. Lawmakers added language to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) instructing the HHS Secretary to submit detailed recommendations for health privacy standards to Congress within 12 months of enactment. If legislation was not enacted within three years, the Secretary would adopt privacy standards based on the recommendations. HIPAA ensured that these standards would not override state laws offering greater protection for medical information. The Secretary submitted a framework and recommendations for health privacy legislation to Congress on September 11, 1997. The HIPAA Privacy Rule was established after lawmakers failed to reach an agreement on health privacy legislation. The rule was published in December 2000 and modified in August 2002. The compliance deadline for covered entities was April 14, 2003. Additionally, a Security Rule was published in February 2003 with a compliance deadline of April 20, 2005. The HHS Office for Civil Rights enforces the Privacy and Security Rules under HIPAA. The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) administers and enforces the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules, establishing penalties for non-compliance. OCR refers cases to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution. HHS finalized a HIPAA Enforcement Rule in 2006, addressing investigation processes and civil monetary penalties. The Privacy and Security Rules under HIPAA have been a subject of ongoing debate since their implementation. Privacy advocates have raised concerns about the limited scope of the rules, prompting efforts to broaden their application to include business associates of covered entities. Congressional action has further expanded the standards to address these issues. The Privacy Rule under HIPAA aims to balance individual privacy rights with societal goals, allowing health information to be used for various purposes beyond routine healthcare. Researchers have criticized the rule for impeding their access to health information. The rapid digitization of medical information poses challenges, with the federal government investing over $30 billion since 2009 to promote electronic health records (EHRs). Researchers need access to clinical data for best practices, but patient privacy concerns must be addressed to ensure public trust in health data analytics. The HIPAA privacy standards, developed in the late 1990s, aim to protect health information, but concerns remain about digital data security. Implementation of the Privacy Rule is challenging for healthcare providers due to its complexity and the need to balance privacy with the use of patient information. Providers may sometimes be overly cautious when it comes to disclosing health information, mistakenly believing that HIPAA prohibits certain routine disclosures. However, the Privacy Rule actually allows for such disclosures and leaves the decision up to the provider. The Security Rule, on the other hand, has faced criticism for its standards in protecting electronic health data. These standards are technology-neutral and scalable based on the organization's size and complexity. The HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules are scalable and allow entities flexibility in implementation. The HITECH Act of 2009 strengthened privacy and security standards, focusing on enforcement and breach notification. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 also amended the Privacy Rule. This report introduces the rules, enforcement, and breach notification requirements, starting with an overview of each rule and discussing the impact of the HITECH Act. The HIPAA Privacy Rule established federal standards for protecting personal health information, requiring covered entities to safeguard data and outlining circumstances for disclosure. Individuals have rights to access and obtain copies of their medical information. The HIPAA Privacy Rule grants individuals rights to access, amend, and receive an accounting of their medical information. Protected health information (PHI) includes individually identifiable information related to health or healthcare payment. De-identified information must have specified identifiers removed or a low re-identification risk determined by a statistician. The HIPAA Privacy Rule grants individuals rights to access, amend, and receive an accounting of their medical information, including protected health information (PHI). De-identified information with a low re-identification risk is not subject to the rule's requirements. Covered entities can choose whether to disclose PHI based on their professional ethics and judgment, with only two circumstances requiring disclosure. The Privacy Rule under HIPAA allows health care professionals to use their judgment when disclosing patient information. Covered entities must obtain written authorization for any PHI disclosures not permitted by the rule. The rule includes a minimum necessary standard for PHI use, requiring entities to limit information to what is necessary for the intended purpose.Exceptions to this standard include sharing PHI for treatment purposes and disclosures to individuals requesting access to their information. The Privacy Rule under HIPAA allows health care professionals to use their judgment when disclosing patient information. Covered entities must obtain written authorization for any PHI disclosures not permitted by the rule. The rule includes a minimum necessary standard for PHI use, requiring entities to limit information to what is necessary for the intended purpose. In most instances, covered entities do not need to make a minimum necessary determination for each separate use or disclosure. The rule instructs covered entities to implement policies and procedures governing routine and recurring uses and disclosures of PHI. Health plans and health care providers routinely hire companies and consultants to help them operate as businesses and meet their responsibilities to patients and beneficiaries. These third parties provide claims processing. The Privacy Rule under HIPAA requires covered entities to manage their business associates through contractual relationships, obtaining written assurance that business associates will use PHI only for permitted purposes and implement safeguards to prevent misuse. This includes the need for a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) specifying the terms of use of patient information. The Privacy Rule under HIPAA specifies the information required in an authorization form. Initially, compound authorizations were prohibited, but this restriction has been loosened. Health care providers cannot require a HIPAA authorization for treatment, except in research studies. Health plans can condition enrollment on obtaining an authorization for eligibility or underwriting purposes. Covered entities can use PHI for treatment, payment, and routine health care operations. A covered entity can disclose PHI for treatment, payment, and health care operations with few restrictions. An individual can request restrictions on the use or disclosure of PHI, but the covered entity is not required to agree. The Privacy Rule allows covered entities to disclose PHI for treatment, payment, and health care operations with few restrictions. Individuals can request restrictions on PHI use or disclosure, but entities are not required to agree. In certain circumstances, individuals must be given the opportunity to object to disclosures, and there are exceptions for national priority purposes. Covered entities have administrative obligations, including providing individuals with written notices. Covered entities must provide individuals with a written notice detailing patients' rights, legal duties, uses of PHI, complaint procedures, notice revisions, and contact information. They must also implement safeguards to protect PHI from unauthorized access. Additionally, a privacy official must be designated to develop and implement policies for protecting PHI under the Privacy Rule. The Privacy Rule requires covered entities to train their workforce on policies for protecting PHI. Organizations with both covered and non-covered functions can become a \"hybrid entity\" by designating health care components. These components must follow the rule's requirements and cannot share PHI without authorization. The Privacy Rule allows for disclosure of certain PHI to employers for group health plan administration but prohibits its use for employment-related actions. This is to address concerns about inappropriate use of health information in making employment decisions. The Privacy Rule allows disclosure of PHI to plan sponsors for plan administration purposes, with restrictions on use for employment-related actions. Sponsors must amend plan documents to limit PHI use, certify non-employment use, and establish firewalls for data access. HIPAA established civil and criminal penalties for violations of its Administrative Simplification standards, including the Privacy and Security Rules. OCR can impose civil monetary penalties on covered entities for non-compliance, with a maximum penalty of $25,000 per year for multiple violations of the same requirement. The criminal penalties under HIPAA can be imposed for violations involving wrongful PHI disclosures, with fines ranging from $50,000 to $250,000 and potential prison sentences. There is no private right of action under HIPAA for individuals to sue covered entities or business associates for violations. HIPAA violations may lead to claims under state law against covered entities and business associates. Covered entities must comply with both HIPAA and state privacy laws, unless state laws are contrary to HIPAA, in which case they are preempted. Exceptions to preemption include when state laws are \"more stringent\" than HIPAA, providing greater privacy protection. HIPAA establishes a federal floor for protecting health information privacy, allowing states to add additional privacy protections. The Privacy Rule does not override state laws on reporting diseases, child abuse, or health plan audits. The HIPAA Security Rule mandates confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic PHI. The Security Rule under HIPAA requires covered entities and business associates to protect ePHI from threats and unauthorized access. It complements the Privacy Rule by setting standards for ensuring only authorized individuals have access to ePHI. The Security Rule under HIPAA requires covered entities and business associates to implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect PHI from unauthorized access. Organizations have flexibility in how they implement security standards, which consist of required and addressable implementation specifications. If an implementation specification is required, policies and procedures must be adopted, while addressable specifications must be assessed for appropriateness in the organization's environment. The Security Rule under HIPAA requires organizations to implement safeguards to protect PHI. Security standards are flexible and scalable, with required and addressable implementation specifications. Table 1 lists all security standards and associated measures. Organizations must consider size, complexity, and capabilities when choosing security measures. The Security Rule under HIPAA requires organizations to implement safeguards to protect PHI, including infrastructure, hardware, and software security capabilities. The initial actions required are conducting a risk analysis and developing a risk management strategy to identify and reduce potential risks to ePHI. The standards are technology-neutral and aim to accommodate new technologies while ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI. The HITECH Act strengthened HIPAA privacy and security standards by introducing provisions to address concerns of privacy advocates and stakeholders. It established categories of violations to reflect varying levels of culpability and emphasized the importance of ongoing risk analysis and management processes for covered entities and business associates. The HITECH Act established four categories of violations with corresponding tiers of CMPs, required HHS to investigate complaints of willful neglect, made business associates directly liable for violations, and mandated notification of individuals in case of PHI breaches. It also imposed limitations on PHI use for marketing, prohibited the sale of PHI, expanded individuals' rights to access their PHI, and clarified genetic information as PHI under GINA. The HITECH Act established CMP tiers for violations, investigated willful neglect complaints, made business associates liable, mandated breach notifications, limited PHI use for marketing, prohibited PHI sale, expanded individuals' access rights, and clarified genetic info as PHI under GINA. The Privacy Rule prohibits health plans from using genetic info for eligibility or enrollment purposes. The omnibus rule in January 2013 finalized most HITECH Act and GINA amendments to HIPAA standards, including changes for research authorizations. The HITECH Act expanded HIPAA regulations to include business associates, making them directly liable for violations and subject to penalties. It also clarified that subcontractors of business associates are also considered business associates. Subcontractors in the contractual chain are directly liable for HIPAA violations and must adhere to the same compliance obligations as business associates. Covered entities must take action if a business associate or subcontractor breaches the BAA, including termination of the contract. Retaliation against individuals who report violations is prohibited. The HIPAA breach notification program, established in 2009 under the HITECH Act, requires covered entities and their business associates to notify individuals affected by a breach of unsecured ePHI without delay, within 60 days of discovery. Business associates include Patient Safety Organizations, health information exchange organizations, and e-prescribing gateways. Data transmission services acting as conduits are not considered business associates, but those providing persistent storage like cloud EHRs are. The HITECH Act requires covered entities to notify the HHS Secretary of breaches of unsecured ePHI. Major breaches affecting 500 or more individuals must be reported immediately. OCR maintains a website listing major breaches. A breach is defined as unauthorized access, use, or disclosure compromising PHI security and privacy. The definition of a breach under the HITECH Act excludes unintentional access or use of PHI, inadvertent disclosures, and disclosures where there is a good faith belief that the information was not retained by an unauthorized person. Covered entities must determine if an incident poses a significant risk of harm to the individual to require notification. The harm threshold was criticized for being subjective and discouraging reporting. HHS responded to criticisms by modifying the breach notification rule to require a more objective risk assessment. The default now is notification, unless a low probability of PHI compromise is demonstrated through a risk assessment. Covered entities or business associates must document this determination to avoid notification. The Secretary is required to annually review these assessments. The Secretary is required to submit an annual report to Congress on breaches reported to OCR. Two reports have been submitted, covering 2009-2010 and 2011-2012, with a total of 710 major breaches affecting 22.5 million individuals. Theft was the leading cause of breaches, accounting for half of all incidents. OCR identified key lessons learned from breach reports: Thorough risk analysis and management plans are essential to address all potential risks to ePHI, including on various devices and networks. Security evaluations should be conducted during operational changes and technical upgrades to maintain ePHI security. Proper encryption and policies are necessary for securing ePHI on portable devices, and clear procedures for PHI disposal should be implemented. Physical safeguards should limit access to facilities. The HITECH Act strengthened HIPAA enforcement by expanding penalties for noncompliance. OCR had not imposed civil penalties on covered entities before the Act. The Act clarified criminal penalties for unauthorized disclosure of PHI. The HITECH Act strengthened HIPAA enforcement by expanding penalties for noncompliance, including criminal penalties for unauthorized disclosure of PHI. The Act introduced four tiers of CMPs to replace the original penalty structure, with the lowest tier applying to entities unaware of violations and the second tier covering violations due to reasonable cause. The HITECH Act introduced four tiers of CMPs for HIPAA enforcement, with the lowest tier for entities unaware of violations and the second tier for violations due to reasonable cause. The final two tiers deal with violations due to willful neglect, distinguished by whether corrective action is taken within 30 days. Willful neglect is defined as a conscious failure to comply. OCR must investigate possible violations of willful neglect, but will seek compliance through informal action if no willful neglect is indicated. The HITECH Act mandates periodic audits by the Secretary to ensure compliance with Privacy and Security Rules by covered entities and business associates. Audits are based on objective criteria, not specific events. A pilot audit program targeted 115 covered entities, evaluating privacy, security, and breach notification processes. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) assessed the pilot program, informing plans for a permanent audit program. OCR seeks additional funding for the audit program to provide tools for self-evaluation and promote a culture of compliance. The HITECH Act mandates audits by the Secretary to ensure compliance with Privacy and Security Rules. The Secretary submits annual reports to Congress summarizing complaints, enforcement actions, audits, and plans for improving HIPAA compliance. In 2009, the Institute of Medicine released a report criticizing the Privacy Rule's impact on research. The Privacy Rule has been criticized for impeding important new research due to varying interpretations by organizations collecting health data. Challenges arise in reconciling it with the Common Rule governing human subject research, leading to inconsistencies. For instance, the Privacy Rule prohibits combining authorizations unless for the same study, allowing for a combination with Common Rule informed consent. The Privacy Rule now allows compound authorizations for any research activity and permits authorizations for future research, as long as the description is clear to individuals."
