    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Health and Safety Code is amended to establish minimum standards for EMT-P training and practice. The authority is responsible for approving these standards and for licensing EMT-Ps who meet them. Approval from the director and consultation with a committee of EMS medical directors are required for any additions to local scope of practice for EMT-Ps. Each application for licensure or renewal requires the applicant's social security number for identity verification. Criminal record information is used to determine eligibility for licensure. Fingerprint submission may not be necessary for renewal if previously submitted and no lapse in license. The authority charges fees for EMT-P licensure and renewal to ensure quality care. The basic fee is $125, subject to adjustment based on program costs. Annual evaluations determine fee sufficiency. Adjustments are made through the rulemaking process. Fees for EMT-P licensure and renewal are adjusted through the rulemaking process. Additional fees may be charged for services not shared by all applicants. The process for EMT-P licensure includes application, competency testing, fingerprint/criminal record check, out-of-state training equivalency determination, verification of continuing education, and replacement of lost licensure card. Fees for individual services should not exceed the total cost of the licensure program. The authority may provide nonconfidential, nonpersonal information on EMS programs to interested persons upon request and establish fees for this service. Fees collected by an entity for the authority must be transmitted within 30 days to the Emergency Medical Services Personnel Fund."
