    "content": "Thermoelectric generating plants and manufacturing facilities withdraw large volumes of water for production and cooling, totaling over half of the 410 billion gallons of water withdrawn daily in the United States. This poses challenges for aquatic resources due to the release of heated water back into the environment. The direct release of heated water from power plants or manufacturing facilities can harm aquatic life, while drawing surface water into these facilities can also harm fish and other organisms. Congress included Section 316 in the Clean Water Act to address these issues, specifically focusing on the impacts of cooling water intake structures (CWIS). CWIS can cause impingement, where aquatic life gets trapped on screens, and entrainment, where small organisms are pulled into the intake water. Impingement and entrainment from cooling water intake structures harm aquatic organisms at all life stages. Regulation under CWA Section 316(b) aims to reduce mortality rates and protect affected biota. EPA has been working on implementing these regulations for over 35 years. EPA proposed national requirements in March 2011 under CWA Section 316(b) to minimize environmental impact of cooling water intake structures at electricity generating and manufacturing facilities. The regulations were controversial among stakeholders and Congress due to concerns about the impact on electricity supply reliability. The EPA proposal did not universally mandate closed-cycle cooling, opting for a less costly and more flexible regulatory option. EPA proposed national requirements in March 2011 under CWA Section 316(b) to minimize environmental impact of cooling water intake structures at electricity generating and manufacturing facilities. The regulations were controversial among stakeholders and Congress due to concerns about the impact on electricity supply reliability. EPA did not universally mandate closed-cycle cooling and instead proposed a less costly, more flexible regulatory option. Delays in finalizing the rule were due to assessing possible changes and consultation for an Endangered Species Act review. EPA announced the final rule on May 19, 2014. The Clean Water Act (CWA) aims to restore and maintain the integrity of the Nation's waters by regulating pollutant discharge through permits issued by EPA or authorized state agencies. Technology-based solutions are required to minimize environmental impacts, with specific guidelines for existing and new sources outlined in Sections 301 and 306. Section 316 addresses thermal pollution concerns. Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires cooling water intake structures to reflect the best available technology for minimizing environmental impact. EPA's implementation of this regulation has faced legal challenges, with three rulemaking phases applied through discharge permits. EPA implemented three phases of regulations for cooling water intake structures under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act. The Phase I rule was issued in 2001 for new facilities, Phase II in 2004 for large existing electric generating plants, and Phase III in 2006 for certain existing facilities and new offshore oil and gas extraction facilities. EPA consolidated regulations for existing facilities into a single proposal in response to legal challenges. In March 2011, EPA proposed regulations following a settlement agreement with environmental groups. The EPA proposed regulations for cooling water intake structures under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act in March 2011, with a final rule announced on May 19, 2014. The regulations were published in the Federal Register on August 15, 2014, with an effective date of October 14, 2014. Most power generators and manufacturing facilities use water-based systems for cooling processes. Once-through cooling systems withdraw untreated water from a source, circulate it through heat exchangers, and return it to a surface-water body, requiring large amounts of water. The discharged water may contain chemicals or pollutants. Recirculating cooling systems receive and return water to a cooling tower, basin, or pond, allowing waste heat transfer with less water usage. Cooling systems allow facilities to transfer waste heat using less water. Closed-cycle systems circulate water through heat exchangers, cool it, and recirculate it. Some water is removed as a blowdown stream. Closed-cycle systems are used by 27% of electric generating units and 20% of manufacturers. Combination systems use both once-through and closed-cycle cooling. Dry cooling towers are more expensive than wet cooling towers but eliminate the need for cooling water withdrawals. They are used in areas with limited water supplies and smaller electric generating units. Once-through cooling systems withdraw more water but evaporate less than closed-cycle systems. Closed-cycle systems are costlier and less energy efficient but can be limited during low-flow conditions. Once-through systems have greater impacts on aquatic life due to large water withdrawals. EPA requires standards for CWIS to minimize environmental impact. EPA's regulatory proposal aims to minimize adverse environmental impact of CWIS by addressing impingement and entrainment effects. Two approaches include flow reduction and installing technologies to exclude or collect organisms without harm. Technologies have been identified to reduce impingement and entrainment mortality. New facilities have been built in compliance with closed-cycle cooling requirements since the Phase I CWIS rule in 2001. For existing facilities, permitting authorities determine best technology available (BTA) for cooling water intake structures (CWIS) on a case-by-case basis due to legal challenges to EPA regulations. Some states like New York and California have proposed policies requiring closed-cycle cooling systems or equivalent alternatives for existing facilities to reduce environmental impact. The final rule would require power plants using marine or estuarine waters for cooling to replace once-through cooling systems with closed-cycle systems. Delaware and New Jersey have also proposed permits for existing power plants to use closed-cycle cooling systems to protect aquatic organisms. The rule would apply to approximately 1,065 facilities, including 521 manufacturing facilities in six primary industries. The final rule affects 521 manufacturing facilities in six primary industries, with small entities comprising 16% of affected facilities. The rule also impacts 544 steam electric generators, representing 9% of all U.S. steam electric generating facilities and nearly 46% of the U.S. electric power sector capacity. The final rule affects 521 manufacturing facilities in six primary industries, with small entities comprising 16% of affected facilities. Regionally, 22% of the affected power plants are located in the Upper Midwest/Mid-Atlantic states, and 32% are located in the Southeast and Florida. EPA's 2011 proposal described four regulatory options for power producers and manufacturers that withdraw over 2 million gallons per day (MGD) of water, at least 25% of which is used for cooling purposes. EPA believes that a significant amount of reduction, reuse, and recycling of water has already occurred in most manufacturing processes. The EPA proposed thresholds for water withdrawals by existing utilities and industrial sources would cover a majority of manufacturers and power-generating facilities. Different regulatory options were evaluated to minimize impingement and entrainment mortality by CWIS at existing facilities, with varying costs and environmental benefits. The EPA proposed different regulatory options to minimize impingement and entrainment mortality by CWIS at existing facilities, with a preference for uniform impingement mortality standards everywhere and case-by-case determination of entrainment mortality controls. The best technology identified for impingement mortality control was modified traveling screens with a fish handling and return system, plus barrier nets for intake systems located on the ocean. EPA proposed a numeric performance standard limiting fish impingement mortality to 12% annually and 31% monthly for facilities using best technology like modified traveling screens with fish handling and return system. Owners can comply with standards through fish mortality sampling or velocity limitations. The EPA proposed performance standards to limit fish impingement mortality, with options for compliance based on intake flow rates. Industry groups criticized the proposal, advocating for more flexible and site-specific approaches. Industry groups and some states are pushing for a more flexible approach in the proposed rule for intake structures, citing the variability of plants' technology and surroundings. They suggest developing a database of pre-approved Best Technology Available (BTA) options, with facility owners and states justifying deviations based on site-specific factors. State water officials express concerns about the feasibility of proposed numeric limits and recommend allowing permitting authorities to set impingement mortality rates. The EPA considered changes to impingement standards in response to public comments and data, with a focus on site-specific flexibility for regulating impingement mortality rates. This approach would provide regulated entities with greater flexibility in complying with the rule. The EPA was considering site-specific impingement controls and changes to intake velocity compliance. Data showed some facilities have low impingement rates, and permitting authorities may determine if BTA is already in use. BTA impingement control alone could reduce mortality by up to 31%. Some facilities could further reduce mortality by controlling entrainment. Wet cooling towers reduce both impingement and entrainment mortality. In the 2011 proposed rule, EPA evaluated four entrainment mitigation options for all existing facilities nationwide, ranging from case-by-case determinations to closed-cycle cooling. Options 1, 2, and 4 would require permitting authorities to analyze candidate BTA technologies for entrainment control. The EPA evaluated entrainment mitigation options for existing facilities nationwide in the 2011 proposed rule. Closed-cycle cooling was determined to reduce impingement and entrainment mortality the most, but it was not considered the \"best technology available\" due to availability and non-water quality impacts. Retrofitting cooling towers for national entrainment controls was rejected due to potential adverse consequences on energy delivery reliability. Retrofitting cooling towers for entrainment controls can reduce impingement and entrainment mortality, but it may lead to an energy penalty and extended downtime. This could result in electricity reliability issues in some regions, as existing transmission systems may not be able to transfer sufficient electricity. Some operators may choose to close existing facilities, leading to a loss of efficiency and generating capacity. Burning additional fuel to operate cooling towers can also increase pollutant emissions. The EPA found that closed-cycle cooling may not be feasible due to emission offsets, land availability concerns, and cost considerations. This technology may not be practical for 25% of facilities covered by the proposal. The EPA concluded that a uniform requirement for closed-cycle cooling at existing facilities nationwide is not possible, but case-by-case evaluations are preferred. The preferred regulatory option allows for site-specific evaluations to determine the best technology for reducing entrainment mortality, such as closed-cycle cooling. Industry groups and some states support this flexibility, while environmental advocacy groups criticize it for potentially perpetuating inadequate permitting processes. Some states, like Kansas and Minnesota, argue that the EPA's approach would place a burden on state permitting authorities. The EPA's proposal for reducing entrainment mortality includes requirements for newly installed units at existing facilities, with closed-cycle cooling systems being the preferred technology. States like Kansas and Minnesota are concerned about the burden this would place on state permitting authorities. Installing closed-cycle systems at new facilities or newly built units in existing facilities is more cost-effective than retrofitting the technology. New units can optimize their cooling water intake structures for cooling towers, reducing size, increasing efficiency, and lowering energy requirements. Compliance with the rule can be demonstrated by showing a 90% reduction in entrainment mortality compared to closed-cycle cooling. The goal of the rule is to minimize harm to aquatic species affected by cooling water intake structures. The proposed rule does not specifically protect threatened and endangered species over other aquatic species impacted by CWIS. EPA aims to minimize harm to aquatic species affected by cooling water intake structures. EPA's evaluation of the benefits of the proposed rule noted that mortality of T&E species resulting from I&E may either lengthen the species' recovery time, or hasten the demise of the species. EPA identified 88 federally listed aquatic T&E species potentially affected by I&E mortality, with 43 freshwater mussel species having the highest vulnerability. Nationally, 36% of T&E species assessed have vulnerable life history stages that overlap with CWIS facilities. Under the 2011 proposal, compliance with the rule would be required as soon as possible, with specific deadlines set for facilities when renewing their CWA discharge permits. EPA expects facilities to install cooling towers for entrainment mortality control over a five-year period from 2013 to 2017. Other vulnerable species include sea turtles, anadromous fish, and T&E freshwater fish. Permitting agencies allow facilities time to comply with new requirements. The proposal outlines compliance deadlines for facilities to install cooling towers for entrainment mortality control, with fossil-fuel electric power generating facilities needing to comply from 2018 to 2022, and nuclear power generating and manufacturing facilities from 2023 to 2027. By 2028, all covered existing facilities are expected to have achieved compliance. New units at existing facilities must comply upon operation, with the option to use restoration measures or other mitigation as alternatives to closed-cycle cooling systems. The EPA proposed in 2011 to remove restoration provisions from the Phase I rule, allowing facilities to demonstrate alternatives to cooling towers. Stakeholders were concerned about the costs of meeting new regulatory requirements, particularly the possibility of mandating cooling towers for all existing facilities. Reports and analyses examined the impacts of this requirement on power plants and electricity supply. The Department of Energy reports examined the potential energy penalties of retrofitting existing power plants with cooling towers. Depending on the type of cooling tower and weather conditions, energy penalties ranging from 0.8% to 8.8% could occur. In a worst-case scenario of retrofitting 100% of power plants, additional plants would need to be constructed to offset the energy penalty. The DOE reports analyzed the impact of retrofitting power plants with cooling towers, highlighting potential energy penalties ranging from 0.8% to 8.8%. A mandatory cooling tower rule for existing power plants could lead to a loss of generation capacity, particularly affecting older oil- and natural gas-fired steam plants. Reports also raised concerns about potential electricity reliability issues if closed-cycle cooling was mandated everywhere. These scenarios depended on various assumptions, including the need for additional power plant capacity. The EPA's proposal for power plant compliance did not accurately predict the impacts of the actual rule. They recommended site-specific determination for entrainment mortality controls, which could involve cooling towers. The estimated annual costs of compliance under the final rule were summarized in Table 2, including one-time technology costs for manufacturers and power producers. The EPA's proposed rule for power plant compliance includes various costs for manufacturers, power producers, and regulators. These costs encompass technology costs, installation downtime, operation and maintenance costs, permit renewal fees, and electricity requirements. State regulatory agencies may face challenges in implementing the rule due to limited resources. Regulatory activities include permit issuance, entrainment studies analysis, and monitoring. The need for site-specific reviews for entrainment mortality controls could increase regulatory workload. The final rule evaluated costs for facilities not in compliance, with potential closures of 10 power plant units by 2030. Overall, 22 units would close, and 12 would avoid closure due to expected improvements. The EPA analyzed the impact of the final rule on electricity prices for different consumer groups. Industrial consumers would see the highest price increases, while residential consumers would experience the lowest. On average, the rule would result in a $1.03 annual increase in electricity costs per household. The EPA also assessed the financial impact on manufacturing facilities, estimating that no facilities would be at risk of closure due to compliance costs. EPA acknowledged uncertainties in compliance cost estimates for the final rule, stating that 12 facilities could face financial stress but not closure. The agency did not include all costs in its analysis, particularly those related to site-specific determinations. Compliance costs may vary depending on factors such as waterbody-specific data, local impacts, and grid reliability. If closed-cycle cooling is installed, compliance costs will align with EPA's estimates. However, site-specific determinations may lead to higher costs than shown in Table 2. The installation and operation costs of cooling towers vary based on unit size and configuration, potentially causing under- or over-estimation of compliance costs for new capacity. EPA recognized data limitations and uncertainties in their analysis, relying on industry and facility data that may not reflect current circumstances. The EPA's analysis of compliance costs for closed-cycle cooling installations may vary from actual costs due to site-specific determinations and data limitations. Economic and operating differences between facilities could impact the allocation of electricity cost increases. Environmental benefits are expected from reductions in impingement and entrainment, despite uncertainties in downtime schedules and cost estimates. The 2011 proposal considered benefits such as increased harvests and improved recreational and commercial fisheries. The EPA estimated economic benefits from regulatory options for closed-cycle cooling installations, including increased harvests of recreational and commercial fisheries and improved ecosystem function. The rule would likely increase the number of aquatic organisms, benefiting individuals who use affected aquatic resources through use benefits like recreational and commercial fisheries. Large uncertainties were acknowledged in the analysis of benefits. EPA relied on regional studies to derive national benefit estimates. EPA's analysis found that uniform closed-cycle cooling would result in the greatest reduction in impingement and entrainment mortality of aquatic organisms. The estimated benefits on commercial and recreational fisheries were also highest under this option. Additionally, reducing mortality improves nonuse benefits such as ecosystem function and resource values. Monetizing nonuse benefits involves asking people to state their willingness to pay for ecological improvements, such as abundance of migratory fish species. EPA estimated nonuse benefits of increased winter flounder abundance in North Atlantic and Mid-Atlantic regions. The agency also considered benefits from improved protection of threatened and endangered species, but was unable to quantify effects on these populations from regulation. EPA obtained use values for only a small subset of affected species, concluding that the primary value of threatened and endangered species lies in their status or quality. The EPA was unable to quantify nonuse benefits of T&E species due to data limitations, resulting in partial estimates for the 2011 proposal and final rule. Monetizing benefits of reductions in I&E mortality losses is challenging due to uncertainties in valuation approaches. EPA acknowledged limitations in estimating national-scale losses and benefits. The EPA acknowledges uncertainties in estimating national-scale losses and benefits, with the potential for over- or underestimation. Nonuse benefits were not fully quantified in the 2011 proposal and final rule due to data limitations. The agency aimed to improve benefit estimates by conducting a national willingness to pay survey. The EPA conducted a survey to determine ratepayers' willingness to pay to reduce fish losses from CWIS. Industry groups criticized the survey design, stating it could overstate benefits of regulation. Preliminary data was reported in June 2012, with analysis ongoing. EPA will decide on using survey results in benefits analysis after completion and peer review. The EPA conducted a survey to determine ratepayers' willingness to pay to reduce fish losses from CWIS. Industry groups criticized the survey design, stating it could overstate benefits of regulation. EPA sought public comment on using survey results in benefits analysis for the final rule, but did not rely on them due to uncertainties and lack of review by the Science Advisory Board. Congressional interest in EPA's CWIS proposal has been evident within the context of concerns over potential impacts of regulatory proposals on various sectors of the economy. Recent legislative proposals aim to restrict regulatory authority and require more detailed analyses. Some suggest upcoming EPA rules should consider costs more carefully in line with President Obama's Executive Order 13563. Order 13563 calls for a review of existing regulations by agencies to assess benefits and costs accurately. Representative Fred Upton expressed concerns about potential retrofit costs in response to EPA's CWIS proposal. EPA Administrator assured a site-specific approach to minimize environmental impacts and avoid a one-size-fits-all mandate. EPA's 2011 CWIS proposal and final rule in 2014 show that costs exceed benefits, but when considering both monetized and nonmonetized benefits, EPA believes the benefits justify the costs. EPA aims to avoid lengthy litigation over cooling water intake structures. The CWA does not mandate that regulation benefits surpass costs. The Supreme Court allows EPA to consider costs but not obligated to. Critics argue that costs of the rule were underestimated compared to benefits. The final rule reflects modifications to address industry concerns about compliance costs. After industry concerns about compliance costs and technology options, EPA made changes to reduce monitoring requirements in the final rule. Stakeholders had mixed reactions, with environmental advocates supporting uniform impingement standards but criticizing the lack of uniformity in entrainment rules. Industry groups were relieved that closed-cycle cooling wasn't mandated for all facilities, focusing on impingement standards for cost-effective flexibility. States had varied responses, with many favoring more flexibility in the rule. States were divided in their responses to the final rule on entrainment, with some favoring flexibility to lessen administrative burden, while others advocated for a more prescriptive approach. Environmental groups expressed disappointment and planned to challenge the rule in court, citing it as weaker than previous regulations. In contrast, the electric power industry generally approved of the rule. The electric power industry expressed overall approval of the EPA's rule on entrainment, citing flexibility and cost considerations as positive aspects. However, concerns were raised about potential operational and compliance challenges, particularly regarding site-specific determinations. State agencies and environmental groups worry about increased administrative burdens on permitting authorities due to factors like land availability and social costs. The EPA's rule on entrainment considers factors like water consumption and local energy reliability, but providing flexibility may increase decision-making time and resources for permitting authorities. The final rule aims to limit information collection requirements to reduce burdens on states. Environmental groups have filed legal challenges in response to the rule. On August 15, environmental groups, the American Petroleum Institute, and the electric power industry filed legal challenges in various U.S. courts of appeals regarding the final rule's compliance with the CWA. Industry groups or states may also file lawsuits. Some Members of Congress are concerned about the rule's costs impacting electricity affordability and reliability. Senator Jim Inhofe plans to bring the rule to a vote under the Congressional Review Act. The final rule regarding cooling water intake structures has been challenged in federal court, adding to the long history of regulatory efforts dating back to the enactment of CWA Section 316(b) in 1972. EPA's initial rule in 1976 was invalidated due to procedural issues, leading to ongoing unresolved debates and legal challenges. EPA withdrew remanded portions of the rule, leaving unremanded parts requiring permitting authorities to determine best technology for cooling water intake structures. Draft guidance for implementing 316(b) was published, allowing site-specific permit decisions. This approach was challenged in 1993, leading to a consent decree with EPA in 1995. In 1995, EPA entered a consent decree for regulations under 316(b), setting a timetable for new and existing facilities. Phase I of the rule, implemented in December 2001, applies to new facilities with water-intake flow over 2 MGD for cooling purposes. Facilities with flow over 10 MGD must restrict inflow to levels achievable by closed-cycle cooling systems. The 2001 rule under 316(b) required new facilities with water-intake flow over 2 MGD for cooling purposes to comply by reducing water removal volume and velocity or demonstrating technologies that reduce environmental impacts. In 2004, a court invalidated a provision allowing restoration measures as an alternative to closed-cycle systems. In July 2004, the EPA promulgated the Phase II rule for existing electricity generation facilities with water-intake flow over 50 MGD. Approximately 53% of the nation's electric-power generating capacity was covered by this rule, offering five compliance alternatives to meet performance standards. The EPA did not mandate closed-cycle cooling systems for existing facilities, citing high conversion costs and the availability of alternative technologies. The Phase II rule for existing electricity generation facilities with water-intake flow over 50 MGD required reduction of impingement and entrainment by specified ranges from baseline. Site-specific variances were allowed if compliance costs were significantly greater than benefits. Restoration measures could be used for compliance. The U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on the cost-benefit variance provision in 2007. Court Judge Sonia Sotomayor ruled the cost-benefit variance provision of the regulations to be unlawful, stating that Section 316(b) does not permit the use of cost-benefit analysis. The EPA had exceeded its authority by allowing existing plants to meet national performance standards using restoration measures. The Supreme Court reviewed the use of cost-benefit analysis in determining the best technology available for cooling water intake structures, ruling in 2009 that it is permissible to apply cost-benefit analysis to minimize adverse environmental impacts. In 2009, the Supreme Court ruled that EPA has the discretion to consider costs and benefits under 316(b) but is not required to do so. The Phase III rule applied to existing power plants and industrial facilities with specific water-intake flow rates, relying on case-by-case decisions rather than national performance standards. Phase III rule applies to new offshore oil and gas extraction facilities with water-intake flow over 2 MGD, 25% used for cooling. Challenges to the rule were consolidated in the Fifth Circuit, stayed during Supreme Court's consideration of Phase II rule. Government and environmental plaintiffs requested remand of existing facilities provisions to EPA. In July 2010, the court approved a request to submit provisions of the Phase III rule to EPA, along with the remanded Phase II rule for existing large facilities. In November 2010, EPA entered into a consent decree to settle a challenge related to existing facilities provisions of the Phase III rule. The court approved a schedule in December 2010, setting a deadline for proposing a revised cooling water intake rule by March 14, 2011. EPA requested a delay, and the proposed rule was released on March 28. The EPA was required to promulgate a final rule by July 27, 2012, but after delays, the final rule was announced on May 19, 2014. Prior to the Phase I rule in 2001, CWIS requirements were developed on a case-by-case basis. Litigation and court-ordered remands have resulted in only certain facilities being subject to technology-based standards in EPA CWIS rules. Existing facilities of all sizes are subject to case-by-case permitting until EPA promulgates revised rules. New facilities with water-intake flow less than 2 MGD also require case-by-case permitting under unchanged provisions of the Phase I rule since 2001."
