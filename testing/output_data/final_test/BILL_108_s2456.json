SEC. 468C introduces Farm, Fishing, and Ranch Risk Management Accounts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. In SEC. 468C, individuals in eligible farming or fishing businesses can deduct cash payments to a FFARRM Account. Contributions are limited to 20% of taxable income attributable to the business. Distributions cannot be used for new fishing purchases. The Secretary of Commerce will enforce regulations to prevent the use of FFARRM Account funds for new fishing vessel purchases or capacity expansion. Eligible farming businesses and commercial fishing activities must not be passive to qualify for deductions. The FFARRM Account is a trust created for the exclusive benefit of the taxpayer, with specific requirements for contributions and trustee qualifications. The FFARRM Account is a trust where assets must consist of cash or interest-bearing obligations, income is distributed to the grantor, and assets are not commingled with other property. The grantor is taxed as the owner of the account. In general, any amount distributed from a FFARRM Account during a taxable year is includible in the taxpayer's gross income. This includes deemed distributions under specific circumstances outlined in the regulations. The distribution of funds from a FFARRM Account is subject to certain exceptions, such as distributions attributable to income of the account and contributions exceeding limitations. Special rules apply, including a tax on deposits not distributed within 5 years. If there is a nonqualified balance in a FFARRM Account at the end of a taxable year, an amount equal to the balance will be deemed distributed, and the taxpayer's tax will be increased by 10 percent of the distribution. This does not apply if the balance is distributed to the taxpayer before the tax return due date. The chapter imposes rules for nonqualified balances in FFARRM Accounts, defining them as balances from deposits made before the 4th preceding taxable year. Distributions are made in the order of deposit, with a penalty for nonqualified balances at the end of a taxable year. The chapter imposes rules for nonqualified balances in FFARRM Accounts, with distributions deemed from the account after a disqualification period of 2 consecutive taxable years. Certain rules apply for treatment after death of account holder and loss of exemption for engaging in ineligible activities. For FFARRM Accounts, payments are deemed made on the last day of the taxable year if made on or before the tax return due date. The term 'individual' excludes estates or trusts. The trustee of a FFARRM Account must report to the Secretary and the account beneficiary on contributions, distributions, and other matters as required by regulations. Additionally, the deduction for self-employment tax cannot be taken into account when determining an individual's net earnings from self-employment. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include FFARRM Accounts as a type of tax-favored account subject to excess contribution taxes. Excess contributions to FFARRM Accounts are defined as the amount exceeding the allowable contribution limit for the taxable year. Trustee reporting requirements and limitations on self-employment tax deductions apply to FFARRM Accounts. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 now includes FFARRM Accounts, subject to excess contribution taxes. Contributions distributed from the FFARRM Account under specific conditions are treated as not contributed. A special rule exempts individuals with FFARRM Accounts from the tax on prohibited transactions if the account ceases to be a FFARRM Account. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 now includes FFARRM Accounts, subject to excess contribution taxes. Amendments are made to various sections regarding FFARRM Accounts, including reporting requirements and failure to provide reports. Amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 regarding FFARRM Accounts, including section 468C(g) and a clerical amendment to the table of sections. The amendments made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 regarding FFARRM Accounts, including section 468C(g), will apply to taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act."
