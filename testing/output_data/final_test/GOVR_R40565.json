    "content": "Renewable energy accounts for 10% of U.S. energy production, with biomass being the largest source. Biomass sources include biofuels, landfill gas, and wood-derived fuels. The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 played a key role in promoting biomass energy production. Investments in combustion turbine technology preceded the growth of cogeneration, which is now a mainstay in several industries fueled by biomass from wood wastes. State governments are leading the way in deploying renewable energy technologies through Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) to create a market for renewable energy. RPS requirements oblige electric utilities to provide electricity from renewable sources, with 29 states plus the District of Columbia having established RPS goals. Two bills have been introduced in the 111th Congress to amend PURPA and establish a renewable electricity standard (RES). The American Renewable Energy Act, H.R. 890, and a Senate bill, S. 433, aim to increase the use of renewable energy. Senator Bingaman also proposed a federal renewable portfolio standard. Biomass is a key resource for meeting RES requirements, with debates focusing on the need for federal mandates on renewable energy use by electric providers. There is a push for federal requirements on renewable energy use by electric providers, including the consideration of a federal \"Feed-in Tariff\" law. Arguments in favor of renewable energy standards often cite environmental benefits and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. The success of renewable energy deployment in Europe is often attributed to Feed-in Tariff provisions. Renewable energy, such as biomass sources, emits fewer pollutants compared to fossil fuels like coal. Carbon dioxide emissions from biomass are considered neutral as they absorb and release carbon dioxide during their growth cycle. The use of renewable energy is seen as a way to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change, although renewable technologies are still relatively new and more expensive to produce than fossil fuels. Federal support for research and development is crucial in making renewable energy technologies more cost-competitive. A federal RES mandate and long-term financial incentives are necessary to increase renewable electricity generation for cleaner energy and greater energy security. Some states have their own RES programs for economic or environmental reasons, and argue against a national RES mandate that could override existing state programs. The federal government may use grants, loans, and tax incentives to encourage renewable energy growth. Some states are concerned about federal penalties under current RES proposals, especially in regions with uncertain renewable resources like the Southeast. H.R. 890 proposes a \"Renewable Electricity Deployment Fund\" to return penalties for noncompliance to retail electricity suppliers using renewable energy credits. Southeastern states and utilities fear becoming net losers without a balancing mechanism like returning penalties to states with fewer renewable resources. Investments in energy production in the southeastern United States have historically favored base load technologies due to economies of scale. The region's electricity industry is subject to traditional rate regulation, resulting in relatively low electricity prices. Concerns over biomass supplies in the Southeast have made it a focal point for federal RES debates. The southeastern United States has low electricity prices due to traditional rate regulation. Renewable energy technologies are not widely adopted in the region because of cost and operational variability. Offshore wind shows promise for coastal states, but there are no operational offshore wind farms in the US. Biomass energy is an exception, with the region producing 44% of the nation's woody biomass energy. The definition of biomass has evolved over time to meet policy goals and technological advancements. Biomass resources in the United States vary by region, with the Midwest and Southeast having significant agricultural and forest-based resources. Biomass has been used for energy since ancient times, with wood being a primary source for cooking and heating. Cellulosic fiber from trees is also used for paper production. The paper industry primarily uses wood waste from tree harvesting and processing for fuel in biomass boilers to generate steam and electricity. Black liquor, a by-product of the pulping process, is another fuel source. Inorganic chemicals dissolve lignin in wood fibers for paper production, with recovered chemicals reused and lignin burned for heat production. The forest products sector utilizes recovery and biomass boilers to generate energy from organic lignin and wood waste. This energy is used for steam production and electricity generation on-site, with excess electricity potentially sold to the grid. Crop residues like stover can also be used for energy production through burning in biomass boilers or processing into biofuels like cellulosic ethanol. Biocrops, such as switchgrass and willow, are fast-growing plants used for energy production. By co-firing biomass with coal in boilers, the amount of coal used for electricity generation can be reduced by up to 20%, without affecting boiler efficiency. This practice also helps in reducing overall air emissions. In the future, biomass co-fired in coal plants may come from biocrops, which are carbon neutral and low in sulfur content, reducing sulfur dioxide emissions. Livestock wastes can be used as fuel in biomass power boilers, and methane can be captured for electricity production. Landfill gas from decomposing organic matter can also be used to generate electricity. Landfill gas is a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide, requiring treatment before being used as fuel for power generation. Waste-to-energy facilities can use municipal solid waste directly as a fuel source to generate electricity. Gasification technology shows promise for increased efficiency in biomass combustion and waste-to-energy technologies. Plasma-arc gasification technology converts carbon-containing materials into syngas, which can be used for electricity generation or further processed into valuable chemicals and biofuels. It reduces organic waste to produce heat for power generation and inert solids. Commercially used worldwide, with the first U.S. facility planned for 2011. A potential national renewable electricity standard in 2011 may rely on biomass as a widely available resource. The debate on biomass resources is prominent in the southeastern United States, seen as the region's best hope to meet RES requirements. Key factors for success in biomass power plants include resource availability, feedstock prices, and collection/delivery costs. These factors will determine if biomass development can economically meet RES requirements. Proponents of an RES in the Southeast believe biomass resources can meet renewable energy requirements, with biomass potentially fulfilling 60% of a near-term RES goal by 2015. Tomorrow's opportunities for biomass electricity generation include energy crops and wood resources, with new energy crops expected to contribute the majority of capacity. Opponents argue that meeting new renewable energy generation goals is unfair and challenging within set timeframes. Southern Company, a major electric utility in the Southeast, doubts the achievability of RES requirements of 20% or 25% by 2025 using biomass or other renewable sources. They may need to purchase renewable electricity credits from other states. Georgia Power, a subsidiary of Southern Company, has approval to convert a coal-fired facility to woody biomass, resulting in 96 megawatts of renewable electricity. Plant Mitchell, one of the largest biomass power plants in the US, generates 96 megawatts of renewable electricity by burning one million tons of biomass annually. Collection of waste wood for biomass power plants may require coordination with forestry companies. The biopower industry relies on wood wastes from saw mills as a primary energy source, but economic challenges may arise if mills go out of business. Logging operations leave behind waste wood in forests, but specifically collecting wood wastes may not be cost-effective for biopower companies. Questions have been raised about the potential impacts on biomass resources under a renewable energy standard. The economic viability of biomass projects under a renewable energy standard could be affected by provisions such as price incentives and tax treatment. The American Forest & Paper Association is concerned that tradable RECs could give new biomass energy generators a financial advantage over existing forest products cogeneration facilities. AF&PA argues that trading in RECs by biopower companies could lead to increased demand and higher prices for biomass, impacting forest products companies. The American Forest & Paper Association is concerned about the impact of tradable RECs on biomass energy generators and forest products companies. AF&PA warns that increased demand and higher prices for biomass could affect forest products companies, while benefiting landowners in the region. The Biomass Power Association struggles to compete with the pulp and paper industry for woody biomass supplies at current prices, seeking alternative sources at lower costs. Biomass power plants in the 25 megawatt size range could be economically viable with fuel cost inputs, Production Tax Credit, and RECs valued at $0.08 per kilowatt-hour. Demand for woody biomass may increase due to requirements for biofuels production under the Renewable Fuel Standard. Recent technological advancements in cellulosic ethanol production are improving yields and reducing costs, potentially increasing demand and prices for biomass. The availability and economic feasibility of biomass for power generation are influenced by transportation costs and access to resources. Different types of biomass have varying procurement, collection, and transportation costs. Studies have identified high potential areas for woody biomass power generation. Geographic information system techniques have been used to assess the feasibility of biomass resources for bioenergy projects. The study used GIS techniques to analyze the effects of transportation infrastructure, distance, and biomass types on potential bioenergy projects in 27 counties. It found sufficient biomass supplies within the region, with costs ranging from $1.66 to $2.01 per thousand BTUs. Different biomass sources would need to be utilized, including forestry residues and urban wood residues within specific haul ranges. Georgia Power's biomass conversion at the former Mitchell coal plant is expected to use waste wood from a 100-mile radius, requiring 160 to 180 truckload deliveries per day for the 96 MW facility. Biomass is a significant source of renewable energy in the US, especially in the southeast region. Developing biomass plants could help meet renewable energy goals, but compliance may be a challenge. DOE/EIA has stated that biomass has the potential to be a large part of the national solution toward meeting a prospective RES, especially in the context of identifying sites for power generation and considering various options to meet the needed capacity. This includes upgrading existing power production facilities, evaluating new power generation facilities at closed mills, and potentially sourcing biomass from market sources or new renewable energy installations like solar or wind. Considerations for sustaining biomass resources while meeting projected uses are crucial. Biomass power plants play a crucial role in meeting renewable energy standards, especially in the southeastern region. The definition of biomass can include various sources like livestock and municipal waste. Cooperation between forest companies and power generators is essential for utilizing waste wood effectively. Biomass power plants are limited to specific \"geo-economic zones\" for cost-effective feedstock delivery, restricting growth in renewable electricity production. The availability of renewable electricity from biomass is crucial to meeting RES requirements, with a focus on a financially viable forest products sector. If forest residues and industry wastes are insufficient, new biomass sources like dedicated biocrops or municipal solid waste may be necessary. Increased demand for biofuels under a Renewable Fuels Standard could impact the price of woody biomass, highlighting the importance of sustainable forest resource management. Sustainable management of forest resources is essential for renewable energy installations, which face aesthetic and environmental challenges. Biomass-fueled power plants offer base-load capacity and a clean energy alternative, especially in the Southeast. Climate change considerations may impact the value of renewable energy credits and biomass demand nationwide. Research and development efforts aim to increase the efficiency of biomass power generation. Efforts to increase biomass power generation efficiency could boost power output with less feedstock. Sustainable management of woody biomass in the Southeast could help meet renewable energy targets. Diverse biomass supplies are crucial to meet various demands, and planning should consider competing uses to avoid unintended consequences."
