    "content": "The debate over the DP World transaction often confused the terms \"port,\" \"port authority,\" and \"terminal.\" Most major U.S. ports are publicly owned by a \"port authority,\" responsible for the overall administration of the property and facilities. Marine terminals are areas for loading and unloading ships, typically leased to terminal operating companies for long-term periods. The port authority or terminal operator provides cargo handling equipment. A public port is like a shopping mall, with the port authority owning the property and leasing terminals to operators. Terminals handle various types of cargo such as containers, dry bulk, liquid bulk, breakbulk, and automobiles. Container terminals can be 100 to 300 acres, while major port complexes can be 2,000 to over 3,000 acres in size. The DP World transaction involves marine terminals, with the terminal operator providing cargo handling equipment. The DP World transaction involves marine terminals, with public port authorities owning only one-third of deep-draft marine terminal facilities in the United States. Private terminals, often associated with oil, gas, and chemical industries, handle 85% of cargo at ports like the Port of Houston. Terminal operators contract with longshoremen unions for cargo handling services. Longshoremen, hired by union hiring halls or terminal operators, operate cranes to move cargo between ships and docks. Checkers direct container traffic within terminals based on stowage plans provided by ocean carriers. They also manage container separation for truck or rail transport and staff gates for container pick-up and drop-off. The terminal operator only needs cargo information like container weight, Customs release status, bill of lading number, seal number, and container number. DP World was set to be the first Middle Eastern company to operate U.S. container terminals, but most are run by foreign-based companies. 66% of the largest U.S. container ports are operated by foreign companies. The survey revealed that a majority of the largest U.S. container ports are operated by foreign-based companies, with some ports having no U.S.-based terminal operators. For example, at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, only three out of fifteen container terminals are operated by U.S.-based companies. Similarly, at the Port of New York and New Jersey, only two out of six container terminals are operated by U.S.-based companies. Additionally, the Port of Norfolk, Port of Savannah, and Port of Portland lease their terminals to private operators. The Port of Portland leases its container terminal to a U.S. based operator, while most foreign terminal operators are based in countries like Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, China, the United Kingdom, and Denmark. Foreign companies manage most U.S. container terminals due to the ownership of container shipping lines by foreign companies. Two large U.S.-based container lines were sold to foreign interests in the late 1990s. Sea-Land Service, a U.S. container shipping company, was sold to Maersk Lines in 1999. The World Shipping Council president notes that U.S. investors avoid the industry due to high capital requirements and foreign tax laws favoring shipping. Global terminal operators like DP World, P&O, Hutchison Port Holdings, PSA, and SSA Marine handle the majority of worldwide container shipments. Global independent terminal operators, such as DP World and P&O, follow the largest container shipping lines around the globe to serve their customers. The shipping industry is driven by globalization, with U.S. port terminal operations also seeing foreign involvement. The industry scans the globe for low-cost inputs, with some U.S. independent terminal operators only operating within the country. Terminal operators at ports have specific security responsibilities, as outlined by Coast Guard regulations and Customs and Border Protection guidelines. The Coast Guard oversees security at port facilities and vessels, with each terminal operator required to conduct a security assessment of their facility. The industry is driven by globalization, with foreign involvement in U.S. port terminal operations. Terminal operators in port areas must conduct a security assessment, write a security plan, and submit it to the Coast Guard for approval. The plan allows flexibility for operators to customize security measures based on their cargo terminal type. Security measures may include access restrictions, surveillance systems, and monitoring through security guards or patrols. Terminal operators in port areas must implement security measures such as security guards, patrols, alarm systems, surveillance equipment, and lighting. They must also specify procedures for checking container seals, verifying truck legitimacy, and conducting security drills. A Facility Security Officer (FSO) is designated to ensure compliance with Coast Guard regulations and maintain records of security activities for two years. The Coast Guard inspects terminals for security compliance. The Coast Guard conducted initial on-site inspections at port facilities between July 1, 2004, and January 1, 2005, to check compliance with security plans. They continue to conduct annual compliance inspections and use unscheduled spot checks to ensure ongoing compliance. Over 700 violations of security regulations have required corrective action since July 2004. Since July 2004, over 700 violations of MTSA security regulations have required corrective action, with 44 resulting in major control actions like terminal closure. Vessel owners must also submit security assessments and plans for Coast Guard approval, coordinating security measures with facility owners. Security plans must be updated every five years or when substantial changes occur. CBP oversees cargo security, with terminal operators responsible for setting security measures for cargo shipments from overseas. CBP plays a crucial role in inspecting cargo shipments to ensure border security and prevent terrorist threats. They are responsible for releasing shipments before they can enter the United States and enforcing commercial laws. Like the Coast Guard, CBP faces the challenge of balancing security with the efficient flow of goods at ports of entry. The Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) is a voluntary program that offers importers expedited processing of cargo if they comply with CBP requirements for securing their supply chain. Participants must sign an agreement, assess their security, submit a questionnaire, implement a security program, and extend it to other companies in their supply chain. CBP reviews the security profile and trade compliance history of C-TPAT applicants. They will address any security concerns or certify the applicant. A validation process is conducted on-site by Supply Chain Security Specialists to review security measures outlined in the profile. C-TPAT security guidelines vary based on the type of business, with specific requirements for importers, carriers, and port operators. U.S. Marine or Port Terminal Operators must assess their supply chain and ensure security measures are in place. Guidelines include conveyance security to prevent unauthorized access. C-TPAT security requirements for Port Authorities and Terminal Operators are similar to Coast Guard's guidelines, covering conveyance, business partner, container, physical access, procedural, personnel, physical, and information technology security measures. The lease agreement between the port authority and terminal operator addresses infrastructure security, such as perimeter fencing, security gates, lighting, monitoring equipment, and alarm systems. The responsibility for providing security infrastructure depends on the geography of the port complex. The federal government has provided funding for security infrastructure at ports since September 11, 2001. The federal government has provided $876 million in grants for port security infrastructure. Port authorities or terminal operators hire security guards, with some port authorities having their own police force. Trustworthiness of port workers is a key security issue, with DHS responsible for assessing terrorism risks. The Coast Guard assists TSA in security development. The Coast Guard is assisting TSA in developing a worker identification card (TWIC) to limit access to secure port areas. Delays in issuing TWIC cards were due to difficulties in obtaining DHS approval, collecting data for cost-benefit analysis, and assessing card technologies. Implementation of the card is set to begin in 2007. The implementation of the TWIC card is set to begin in 2007. Port authorities are deciding on criminal offenses that could disqualify workers from obtaining the card. Some ports already have ID systems in place, like the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey since 1953. The Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor conducts background checks on longshoremen. The Port of Miami and three Florida ports are also implementing ID systems to comply with state law for port security. The United States faces challenges in implementing background checks and ID systems for port workers, but this effort only covers a small part of the maritime transportation system. While C-TPAT participants are required to conduct background checks on employees, the effectiveness of these checks is uncertain. Port security extends beyond U.S. port complexes to securing cargo and ships in transit. The Coast Guard and CBP focus on securing cargo and ships before they reach U.S. ports to prevent potential security threats. They employ a strategy of \"pushing the borders out\" with security measures at overseas ports and scrutiny of ships before they enter U.S. harbors. U.S. ports are seen as the last line of defense against terrorism, emphasizing the international nature of the shipping industry. The Coast Guard, through the International Maritime Organization, helped develop the ISPS, a global security code for ports and ships. They assess security measures at foreign ports trading with the U.S. to counter terrorism threats. The Coast Guard has implemented new reporting requirements for ships entering or leaving U.S. harbors to improve anti-terrorism measures. This includes extending the Notice of Arrival (NOA) to 96 hours, providing detailed information on crew, cargo, and the vessel. The Coast Guard evaluates this information to determine necessary actions, such as boarding and inspecting the ship, escorting it into the port, or enforcing a security zone around the ship. They are also deploying a vessel tracking system for enhanced security measures. The Coast Guard is implementing new reporting requirements for ships entering or leaving U.S. harbors to enhance anti-terrorism measures. They are deploying a vessel tracking system to monitor ship traffic in U.S. harbors and plan to extend this capability nationwide. Additionally, the Coast Guard is pursuing a long-range vessel tracking system with a range of about 2,000 nautical miles. The Container Security Initiative (CSI) aims to improve the security of cargo entering the United States by identifying high-risk containers, pre-screening them early in the supply chain, using technology for quick screening, and implementing smart and secure measures. The Container Security Initiative (CSI) program aims to pre-screen high-risk containers at participating ports before they are loaded on U.S.-bound ships. CBP officers collaborate with host country customs officers to identify and inspect containers using non-intrusive technology. CSI is operational at 50 foreign ports, with plans to expand to 58 ports by the end of 2007, covering approximately 85% of maritime containers shipped to the United States. The port of Dubai, United Arab Emirates, joined the Container Security Initiative program as the 35th operational CSI port on March 26, 2005. CBP's cargo inspections rely on accurate and timely information for risk assessment and targeting procedures before shipments reach U.S. Ports of Entry. The 24-hour rule, established by the legacy Customs Service, requires the submission of certain cargo manifest information to Customs 24 hours in advance of vessel cargo being loaded at the foreign port. The Trade Act of 2002 mandated CBP to develop rules for mandatory electronic submission of cargo manifest data for all modes of entry, maintaining the 24-hour rule for U.S.-bound vessel cargo. The 24-hour rule applies to all U.S.-bound vessel cargo, regardless of passing through a CSI port. CBP is exploring acquiring additional data for container movement tracking. The Advance Trade Data Initiative (ATDI) is used as a prototype for this data acquisition. CBP uses the Automated Targeting System (ATS) to identify high-risk containers for inspection based on electronically filed entry information. ATS standardizes data and creates \"shipments\" for evaluation and scoring. Higher scores indicate shipments needing more attention. The ATS system is used by CBP to identify high-risk containers for inspection based on entry information. The port security debate surrounding the DP World purchase of P&O has raised issues for Congress regarding ownership relevance to security, federal presence on port grounds, and vulnerabilities in the maritime supply chain. Policymakers are concerned about ensuring compliance with security standards in an environment where terminal ownership frequently changes and is foreign-based. DHS seeks a security regime that requires attention to high-scoring shipments for additional enforcement actions. The DHS seeks a security regime for terminal operating companies to comply with federal security measures regardless of ownership. The Coast Guard and CBP enforce physical security requirements at the terminal, with CBP deciding which cargo to inspect. TSA will screen terminal workers with the TWIC card. The credibility of federal security requirements depends on the perceived presence of federal authorities in the port. In overseeing port security, Congress may assess if the Coast Guard and CBP have enough inspectors to ensure compliance. The question of whether foreign ownership of stevedores poses a higher security risk than domestic ownership may also be considered. Information on the number of U.S. marine facilities operated or owned by foreign companies would be helpful in evaluating the exclusion of foreign terminal operators from U.S. ports. Most container terminals in the U.S. are operated by foreign companies, but other types of marine terminals may also be owned by foreign interests. Foreign terminal operators, like DP World, may have intimate knowledge of security procedures at U.S. terminals, potentially posing a security risk if they have connections to terrorist groups. However, U.S.-based terminal operators could also be infiltrated. Foreign companies hire mostly Americans, so they may not pose a higher security risk than U.S.-based companies. Foreign terminal operators like DP World are mainly financiers of terminal operations, with limited involvement in day-to-day activities. Balancing security and commerce is crucial in cargo security policy, as port facilities require significant capital investments. The issue of foreign terminal operators involves ensuring security while attracting capital investments, as it could be too late if a terrorist threat is discovered. The security of U.S. ports relies on cooperation with foreign entities like DP World to begin the screening process for maritime commerce. Key policy questions include whether the U.S. should trust these partners in securing the supply chain. Foreign terminal operators are mainly financiers with limited involvement in day-to-day activities, balancing security and commerce in cargo security policy. The security of U.S. ports relies on cooperation with foreign entities to secure the supply chain. Various programs depend on international cooperation to protect U.S. bound cargo and enforce port security codes. The DP World controversy sparked a debate on the overall security of U.S. ports. The DP World controversy reignited the debate on U.S. port security, with concerns about the effectiveness of post-9/11 maritime security initiatives like CSI, ATS, C-TPAT, MTSA, and ISPS. Congress is interested in the effectiveness of these initiatives, with GAO reports highlighting limitations such as staffing imbalances and technical requirements for NII equipment. The GAO has raised concerns about the effectiveness of various U.S. port security initiatives, including CSI, C-TPAT, and ATS. Issues highlighted include staffing imbalances, lack of technical requirements for NII equipment, and the need for improvements in targeting procedures. The DHS Inspector General also identified areas for enhancement, such as refining ATS targeting rules and improving physical controls over containers. The DHS Inspector General and GAO have raised concerns about port security grants, radiation scanner deployment, and risk management in the Coast Guard's port security mission. CBP and Coast Guard are implementing recommendations, focusing on assessing risks in the maritime domain and securing the container supply chain integrity. Key security issues include container packing process, truck movement, and manifest information for targeting high-risk shipments. Some security experts suggest increasing physical inspections of containers to address vulnerabilities in targeting high-risk shipments. Debate continues on the likelihood of terrorists using shipping containers as \"Trojan horses\" for smuggling weapons. The GAO reports low likelihood of this tactic, with some experts suggesting terrorists may opt for smuggling weapons using private watercraft to land at public marinas. Terrorists may attempt to smuggle weapons using private watercraft to avoid scrutiny at official ports of entry. They could use tactics like ramming explosives-laden boats into ships, posing a threat to cruise ships, ferries, or vessels carrying hazardous cargo. Congress must address port security and funding to protect the U.S. economy's supply chains. To prevent terrorist attacks, it is crucial to enhance security measures in ports to deter their use as a transit point for potential threats to the United States."
