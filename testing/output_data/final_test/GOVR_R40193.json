    "content": "The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Havana announced the release of two more political prisoners, bringing the total to 57 released since July 2010. Cardinal Jaime Ortega stated that the remaining 11 prisoners on the list would be released in the coming months. Human rights groups estimate around 100 political prisoners still remain in Cuba. The State Department called for the release of USAID subcontractor Alan Gross, detained in Cuba for a year. In Cuba, President Castro announced the upcoming sixth congress of the Cuban Communist Party in April 2011, focusing on updating the economic model. The government also revealed plans to lay off half a million state workers by March 2011, with many transitioning to the private sector. Additionally, self-employment opportunities were expanded with 178 allowed categories of work. President Obama issued a partial waiver for Cuba regarding trafficking in persons, allowing for educational and cultural exchange programs. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported a provision in the FY2011 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act. Ra\u00fal Castro officially became Cuba's president on February 24, 2008, succeeding his brother Fidel Castro. This followed a provision in section 621 for FY2011 that defined \"payment of cash in advance\" under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. Ra\u00fal Castro succeeded his brother Fidel as Cuba's president in February 2008. Fidel had ceded political power to Ra\u00fal in 2006 due to poor health. Ra\u00fal had been the officially designated successor and held key positions in the Cuban government and military. Despite Fidel still holding the title of first secretary of the PCC, Ra\u00fal took over as head of government. Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Machado Ventura's selection as the Council of State's first vice president was a surprise. Born in 1930, Machado is a physician. Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Machado Ventura, a hard-line communist party ideologue and close friend of Ra\u00fal Castro, was unexpectedly chosen as the Council of State's first vice president, making him the official successor to Ra\u00fal according to the Cuban Constitution. This decision surprised many who had expected Carlos Lage, a younger leader responsible for Cuba's economic reforms in the 1990s, to be selected. The inclusion of key military officers and confidants of Ra\u00fal in the Council also increased the military's role in the government. General Julio Casas Regueiro, already a member of the Council, became one of its five vice presidents and was appointed as the new minister of the FAR by Ra\u00fal Castro. He also chairs GAESA, the Cuban military's business holding company. Other military appointments to the Council included Gen. Alvaro L\u00f3pez Miera and Gen. Leopoldo Cintra Fr\u00edas. Fidel Castro had ruled Cuba since the 1959 Revolution, declaring it socialist in 1961. In December 1961, Fidel Castro declared himself a Marxist-Leninist and ruled Cuba by decree until 1976. The Cuban Communist Party reaffirmed its commitment to a single-party state in 1997, reelecting Fidel and Ra\u00fal Castro as party secretaries. The Constitution outlines governmental structures with legislative authority vested in the National Assembly of People's Power. The president of the Council of State serves as the country's head of state. The president of the Council of State in Cuba is the head of state and government, with executive power vested in the Council of Ministers. Fidel Castro served in this role until 2008. National Assembly members were first directly elected in 1993, but only one slate of candidates was offered. Municipal elections are competitive, requiring candidates to receive more than half of the votes cast. Runoff elections between the top two candidates are common. In 2008, Fidel Castro announced his retirement from the position of president of the Council of State in Cuba, confirming his departure from leading the Cuban government. This decision came after the National Assembly elections where voters were only offered a single slate of candidates. Runoff elections between the top two candidates are common in Cuban elections. Fidel Castro announced his retirement as president of the Council of State, confirming his departure from leading the Cuban government. Observers predicted three potential scenarios for Cuba's future after Fidel: continuation of a communist government, a military government, or a democratic government. Ra\u00fal Castro was seen as the likely successor due to his designation by Fidel and leadership of the FAR, which controls the government's security apparatus and plays a role in Cuba's economy. After Fidel Castro's retirement, potential scenarios for Cuba's future included a continuation of a communist government, a military-led government in case of failure, or a democratic transition, which was seen as unlikely. The Castro government maintained control through a strong security apparatus, limiting civil society development and political opposition. Ra\u00fal Castro's government shake-up in 2009 consolidated ministries and removed high-ranking officials. In 2009, Ra\u00fal Castro streamlined the government by consolidating ministries and removing high-ranking officials, including Felipe P\u00e9rez Roque and Carlos Lage. P\u00e9rez Roque was replaced by Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla, while Carlos Lage was replaced by military General Jos\u00e9 Amado Guerra. These changes were part of Castro's efforts to make the government smaller and more efficient. Ra\u00fal Castro ousted high-ranking officials Felipe P\u00e9rez Roque and Carlos Lage in 2009, representing different political tendencies within Cuba's communist system. This move was seen as a way for Ra\u00fal to replace Fidelistas with his own supporters and remove potential contenders for power in a post-Castro Cuba. Fidel Castro criticized P\u00e9rez Roque and Lage for being seduced by ambitions for power. Ra\u00fal Castro's government shake-up in 2009 involved removing high-ranking officials like Felipe P\u00e9rez Roque and Carlos Lage, who were seen as potential contenders for power in a post-Castro Cuba. The appointments made by Ra\u00fal Castro aimed to make the government more efficient, with several unknown technocrats and military officials being brought in. This marked a shift towards a more military-influenced government structure since Fidel Castro stepped down in 2006. Since Ra\u00fal Castro took power in 2006, Cuba's political succession has been stable. Ra\u00fal hinted at economic changes in 2007, promising efficiency and production improvements in 2008. The government implemented economic reforms in 2008, including changes in the agriculture sector. The government initiated agriculture sector reforms in 2008 to boost food production, but results were disappointing. In September 2010, significant reforms were announced to reduce the public sector and increase private enterprise. Tight government control in the political sphere is expected to remain, with a strong security apparatus in place. The number of political prisoners has decreased, but some argue that repression still exists. Human rights activists welcome the release, but some argue that the overall situation in Cuba has not improved, with the government resorting to intimidation tactics. The PCC's sixth congress was postponed due to Cuba's poor economic situation, but Ra\u00fal Castro announced it would be held in April 2011, focusing on updating the economic model and outlining party policies. Speculation about Fidel Castro being replaced as party head during the congress was discussed. Ra\u00fal Castro announced that decisions on the party's leadership would be postponed until the end of the year, with a party conference scheduled. Cuba's poor human rights record includes restrictions on freedoms and crackdowns on dissent. The government's oppressive tactics have continued despite some anticipation of change after Pope John Paul II's visit in 1998. In March 2003, Cuba conducted a severe crackdown (Primavera Negra) imprisoning 75 democracy activists. In 2010, Cardinal Jaime Ortega's talks with President Castro led to the release of political prisoners. By the end of 2010, around 100 political prisoners remained. The Cuban government's restrictions on political rights, freedom of expression, and dissemination of ideas have led to systematic violations of citizens' fundamental rights. Despite signing U.N. human rights treaties in 2008, little progress has been made in guaranteeing civil and political freedoms. In a symbolic move, the ban on Cubans staying at tourist hotels was lifted in March 2008, ending the practice of \"tourism apartheid.\" On December 17, 2008, Cuban President Ra\u00fal Castro offered to exchange imprisoned Cuban political dissidents for five Cubans imprisoned in the United States for espionage. The State Department rejected the offer, insisting on the immediate release of jailed dissidents in Cuba without conditions. Human Rights Watch criticized Cuba's human rights record under Ra\u00fal Castro, citing the continued repression of political prisoners and the use of draconian laws to suppress fundamental freedoms. The Cuban government has been criticized for human rights abuses, including imprisoning individuals before they commit a crime. The State Department's 2009 report highlighted beatings, harsh prison conditions, harassment of political opponents, arbitrary arrests, and denial of fair trials. The Cuban government has been criticized for human rights abuses, including imprisoning individuals before they commit a crime. Cuban authorities monitor private communications, limit freedoms of speech, press, assembly, association, and movement. Amnesty International's report highlighted restrictions on freedom of expression in Cuba, with repressive tactics and criminal proceedings used to punish free expression. Cuba's laws severely restrict free expression in violation of international human rights standards. The report criticized Cuba for violating international human rights standards, with the judiciary complicit in repressing freedoms. Calls were made for Cuba to change its laws, end harassment of dissidents, ratify U.N. treaties, and allow access to human rights officials. Despite ongoing repression, pro-democracy activists continue to raise awareness of Cuba's poor human rights record. The Ladies in White, formed in 2003, consists of relatives of imprisoned dissidents. The Ladies in White, formed in April 2003 by relatives of imprisoned dissidents in Cuba, conduct peaceful protests calling for the release of political prisoners. They attend Mass at St. Rita's Church in Havana, walk silently through the streets, and have faced physical removal and verbal abuse during protests. The Ladies in White faced harassment by government-orchestrated mobs but were allowed to continue their protests with the help of Cardinal Jaime Ortega. Cuban blogger Yoan\u00ed S\u00e1nchez gained international attention for her critical website Generaci\u00f3n Y. Despite winning an award for digital journalism, she was not allowed to leave Cuba to accept it. In 2009, S\u00e1nchez and two other bloggers were intercepted by state security agents while on their way to a march. The assault on Cuban dissidents Yoan\u00ed S\u00e1nchez and Orlando Zapata Tamayo drew international attention to the plight of political prisoners in Cuba. Zapata's death after an 83-day hunger strike highlighted the harsh treatment of dissidents by the Cuban government. Amnesty International declared Zapata a prisoner of conscience in 2004. In May 2004, Zapata was sentenced to three years in prison for various charges, later serving a total of 36 years. His death brought attention to Cuba's political prisoners, leading to calls for their release by U.S. officials and President Obama. The Senate approved a resolution recognizing Zapata's life and advocating for the end of repression in Cuba. The Senate approved S.Con.Res. 54 recognizing Zapata's life and promoting human rights in Cuba. Amnesty International criticized Zapata's death as a sign of political repression in Cuba. The European Parliament condemned the death and called for the release of political prisoners. Spain also urged the release of Cuban political prisoners. President Ra\u00fal Castro expressed regret for the death of Cuban dissident Zapata but denied allegations of torture or murder in Cuba. Zapata's death led to protests and hunger strikes by other dissidents, including Guillermo Fari\u00f1as who went on a hunger strike to demand the release of political prisoners. Fari\u00f1as developed complications and ended the strike after Cuba announced the release of 52 political prisoners. The Cuban Commission on Human Rights documented a decline in political prisoners in Cuba, with at least 167 prisoners in July 2010. Despite the reduction, human rights activists argue that the overall situation has not improved, citing lower-profile tactics of political repression by the government. Thousands of people are imprisoned under the charge of \"social dangerousness.\" The Cuban government has thousands of people imprisoned under the charge of \"social dangerousness,\" with an estimated 5,000 Cubans detained. The Catholic Church in Cuba has played a key role in the release of political prisoners since May 2010, with the government releasing seven political prisoners by the end of June. The Cuban government released seven political prisoners and began transferring others closer to their homes. Cardinal Ortega met with President Castro and announced the release of 52 political prisoners, with 5 to be released soon and 47 others within 3 to 4 months. The prisoners were part of the \"group of 75\" imprisoned during the Black Spring of March 2003. The Catholic Church continued to announce the release of additional prisoners beyond the initial 52. By late December 2010, a total of 57 political prisoners had been released. In late December 2010, Cuba released 57 political prisoners, with 56 going to exile in Spain and 1 staying in Cuba. Cardinal Ortega mentioned that 11 prisoners wanted to stay in Cuba or go to the United States. It was expected that the remaining 11 prisoners would be released in the following months. Human rights groups estimated around 100 political prisoners still in Cuba. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch called for the immediate release of all political prisoners. Human Rights Watch called for the release of all remaining political prisoners in Cuba and the dismantling of authoritarian laws. Secretary of State Clinton welcomed the Church's announcement of prisoner release in July 2010, praising the efforts of the Cuban Catholic Church and others. The State Department hoped for increased respect for human rights in Cuba and urged the immediate release of all political prisoners. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba faced severe economic decline from 1989-1993. However, from 1994-2000, with limited market-oriented reforms, the economy grew by an average of 3.7% annually. Strong growth was seen in 2005-2007, with impressive rates despite hurricane damage, supported by tourism, nickel, and oil sectors, as well as investments from Venezuela and China. Cuba also benefits from a preferential oil agreement. In 2008, Cuba's economic growth slowed to 4.1% due to declining nickel prices, rising food import costs, and hurricane damage. The global financial crisis in 2009 further impacted the economy, leading to a growth rate of 1.4%, with a slight increase to 1.5% estimated for 2010. Cuba benefits from a preferential oil agreement with Venezuela, receiving over 90,000 barrels of oil daily, valued at over $2 billion annually in 2006-2007 and over $3 billion in 2008. In 2009, Cuba's economic growth slowed to 1.4% due to austerity measures, including energy rationing and cutbacks in transportation and food programs. Despite this, Cuba has achieved high levels of health and education, with a life expectancy of 79 years, adult literacy at almost 100%, and an infant mortality rate of 4.8 per 1,000 live births in 2009. In 1993, Cuba began to adopt market-oriented economic reforms, allowing Cubans to use U.S. dollars and shop at dollar-only shops. In 1993, Cuba implemented market-oriented economic reforms, allowing the use of U.S. dollars and shopping at dollar-only shops. Self-employment was authorized in over 100 occupations, growing to more than 150 by 1996. Large state farms were divided into smaller agricultural cooperatives, and agricultural markets were opened in 1994. Private food catering, artisan markets, and foreign investment were also permitted. Free trade zones with tariff reductions were established in 1996. In 1996, Cuba established free trade zones with tariff reductions. In 1997, a new Central Bank was created for banking system reform. However, the government later imposed regulations and taxes that hurt self-employed individuals, leading to closures of home restaurants. In 2004, restrictions were placed on the use of dollars by state companies, seen as a reversal of economic reform efforts. Fidel Castro also announced the discontinuation of U.S. dollar use in certain entities. In 2005, Cuba stopped pegging its convertible pesos to the U.S. dollar, linking them instead to a basket of foreign currencies. This change reduced the value of dollar remittances sent to Cuba and provided more hard currency to the Cuban government. Ra\u00fal Castro's provisional power in 2006 raised hopes for economic policy changes, leading to debates on potential reforms. In 2007, Ra\u00fal Castro acknowledged the insufficiency of Cuban salaries and the need for structural changes. In the aftermath of Ra\u00fal's 2007 speech, Cuban public expectations for economic reform increased. Thousands of meetings were held where Cubans discussed low salaries, housing, transportation issues, and advocated for more private businesses. Raised expectations increased the chance of policy changes to prevent social unrest. In early February 2008, a video surfaced of a meeting between Ricardo Alarc\u00f3n and university students in Cuba, where a student questioned low wages and travel restrictions. This highlighted the disillusionment of Cuban youth with the economic situation. After Ra\u00fal Castro became president, economic changes were announced, including making the government more efficient, reviewing the Cuban peso, and lifting restrictions on consumer products like computers and microwaves. In April 2008, Cuba announced plans to revamp the state's wage system by removing earning limits for state workers to boost productivity. However, the implementation has been delayed due to poor preparation and bureaucratic hurdles. The country also faces the challenge of unifying two official currencies, the Cuban convertible peso (CUC) and the Cuban peso, with most people being paid in Cuban pesos. The minimum monthly wage in Cuba is around 225 pesos. In 2008, Cuba focused on agricultural reforms to boost food production by giving farmers more autonomy over their land and supplies. The government also aimed to turn idle land into productive use through a land grant program. The minimum monthly wage in Cuba is about 225 pesos, with some Cubans having access to convertible pesos through foreign remittances or certain jobs. In 2010, despite efforts to boost food production in Cuba through agricultural reforms and a land grant program, shortages of basic agricultural products were reported in Havana and other areas. The government's control over resources and distribution has hindered production and delivery to the market. Cuban Minister of Economy and Planning hinted at forthcoming changes due to the unsustainable nature of the current system. In April 2010, the Cuban government initiated a pilot project transferring state-run barber shops and hair salons to employees. Subsequently, the government announced significant reforms to reduce the public sector and promote private enterprise. By September 2010, plans were made to lay off half a million state workers by March 2011, with most expected to transition to the private sector. Over the next five years, 1.2 million state employees out of 4.3 million would be cut. Additionally, the government expanded self-employment opportunities by allowing 178 categories of work, with 83 permitting small businesses to hire. The Cuban government introduced reforms to reduce the public sector and promote private enterprise, including allowing 178 categories of self-employment with 83 permitting small businesses to hire non-family members. New tax provisions were implemented to generate income for the government, including a sales tax and social security tax. Cuba's economy suffered after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the cold war, leading to the country abandoning its revolutionary exploits abroad. Cuba opened up its economy and developed economic relations with various countries, including Canada, Spain, China, and Venezuela. Relations with Russia and China have intensified, with visits from their respective presidents. All Latin American nations now have official diplomatic relations with Cuba. Cuba has strengthened its relations with Brazil and other Latin American countries, becoming a full member of the Rio Group in 2008. Ra\u00fal Castro visited Venezuela and Brazil in 2008, showing interest in expanding ties. Cuba actively participates in international forums like the United Nations and hosted the Non-aligned Movement summit in 2006. Cuba hosted the 14th summit of the Non-aligned Movement in 2006 and was a member of the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas. In 2009, the OAS overturned a resolution excluding Cuba, but Cuba stated it would not return to the organization. Relations between the US and Cuba deteriorated in the 1960s. In the early 1960s, U.S.-Cuban relations worsened as Fidel Castro established a communist dictatorship and aligned with the Soviet Union. Tensions were evident in events like the Bay of Pigs invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, Cuban support for insurgencies, the Mariel boatlift, and the 1996 shootdown of U.S. civilian planes by Cuban fighter jets. Since the early 1960s, U.S. policy towards Cuba has involved isolating the island nation through economic sanctions, including a trade embargo and financial transaction restrictions. The Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR) were first issued in July 1963, imposing sanctions such as prohibiting most financial transactions with Cuba and freezing Cuban government assets in the U.S. These sanctions were strengthened by the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 and the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996. The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996, also known as the Helms/Burton legislation, prohibits U.S. subsidiaries from trading with Cuba and restricts entry into the U.S. for vessels involved in Cuban trade within 180 days. This law codified the Cuban embargo and limits the executive branch's ability to lift economic restrictions on Cuba. The Helms/Burton legislation of 1996 codified the Cuban embargo, restricting U.S. subsidiaries from trading with Cuba and limiting the executive branch's authority to lift economic restrictions. The law includes provisions such as holding those trafficking in confiscated U.S. property by Cuba liable for damages in U.S. federal court, which has been suspended by Presidents Clinton and Bush. Additionally, U.S. policy towards Cuba includes support measures for the Cuban people, such as private humanitarian donations and medical exports. The United States has various measures to support the Cuban people, including private humanitarian donations, medical exports, democracy-building efforts, and radio and television broadcasting. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 allowed for agricultural exports to Cuba, making the U.S. the largest supplier of food and agricultural products to Cuba since 2002. Different schools of thought exist on how to achieve the objective of bringing democracy and respect for human rights to Cuba, with some advocating for maximum pressure on the Cuban government until reforms are enacted. Some advocate for maximum pressure on the Cuban government until reforms are enacted, while others support a constructive engagement approach to lift some U.S. sanctions. Legislative initiatives have aimed to ease U.S. sanctions on Cuba, with efforts dating back to 2000. Observers have called for a re-examination of U.S. policy towards Cuba following Fidel Castro's departure. Following Fidel Castro's departure, there are two main policy approaches towards Cuba: maintaining the current dual-track policy or increasing engagement with the Cuban government and society. Advocates for easing U.S. sanctions argue that increased travel, trade, and dialogue could lead to peaceful reform on the island and prevent violent change. Advocates for changing U.S. policy towards Cuba argue for a more pragmatic approach to induce change, citing international support for lifting the embargo, missed business opportunities, and increased suffering of the Cuban people. They believe consistency with policies towards other communist governments and a moderation in approach will advance human rights. Opponents argue for maintaining the current two-track policy. Opponents of changing U.S. policy towards Cuba argue that maintaining the current two-track policy of isolating Cuba while supporting the Cuban people is the best way to achieve political change. They believe that softening U.S. policy without concrete Cuban reforms would benefit the Castro government and prolong the communist regime. They argue that sustained sanctions can work and that Cuba's economic policies, not the U.S. embargo, are to blame for the country's difficult living conditions. The Clinton Administration made changes to U.S. policy towards Cuba after Pope John Paul II's 1998 visit, including resuming direct flights, cash remittances, and streamlining procedures for medical supplies. President Clinton announced further measures in January 1999, broadening cash remittances to all U.S. residents. The Bush Administration continued the two-track U.S. policy towards Cuba, emphasizing stronger enforcement of economic sanctions and tightening restrictions on travel, remittances, and humanitarian gift parcels. This included expanding direct passenger charter flights to Cuba from additional U.S. cities and loosening restrictions on travel for certain categories of travelers. The Bush Administration tightened restrictions on travel and payment terms for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. However, some easing of sanctions remained, allowing Americans to travel to Cuba for educational activities within structured academic programs. President Bush also established an interagency Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba to help bring about an end to Cuba's dictatorship. In May 2004, President Bush endorsed recommendations to hasten the end of Cuba's dictatorship and committed up to $59 million for democracy-building activities and airborne broadcasts to Cuba. The recommendations included tightening economic sanctions on family visits, travel, and humanitarian assistance. In June 2004, new sanctions were implemented by the Treasury and Commerce Departments. In February 2005, U.S. economic sanctions against Cuba were further tightened by restricting how U.S. agricultural exporters may be paid. In July 2005, Caleb McCarry was appointed as the State Department's new Cuba Transition Coordinator. In December 2005, the Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba was reconvened by Secretary Rice to identify measures to help Cubans transition to democracy and develop a plan for free and fair elections. In July 2006, the Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba issued its second report, recommending $80 million over two years to support Cuban civil society, fund education programs, break the Cuban government's information blockade, and strengthen civil society and transition planning. The full report is available at http://www.cafc.gov/rpt/. The Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba recommended additional funding of $15 million for strengthening civil society and transition planning, with a further recommendation of at least $20 million annually for democracy programs until the dictatorship ends. The report outlined detailed plans for the U.S. government, international community, and Cuban community abroad to assist a Cuban transition government in addressing humanitarian needs, holding elections, and transitioning to a market-based economy. The Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba recommended additional funding for strengthening civil society and transition planning. Some Cuban dissidents welcomed U.S. assistance, while others expressed concerns about foreign intervention. A founding member of the Ladies in White, a human rights organization, criticized the Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba's report for potentially justifying the imprisonment of dissidents. She emphasized that Cubans should decide their own future and called for peaceful transition and reconciliation. President Bush expressed support for the Cuban people's desire for democracy and freedom in response to Fidel Castro's temporary ceding of power to his brother Ra\u00fal in 2006. The U.S. pledged support for democratic change in Cuba and encouraged the Cuban people to work towards positive change. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice reiterated U.S. support for peaceful democratic change in Cuba, with plans in place to respond to any potential migration crisis. The U.S. encouraged the Cuban people to work towards positive change and discouraged risky sea travel. Ra\u00fal Castro expressed willingness to normalize relations but criticized U.S. policy as arrogant. The U.S. offered to lift economic sanctions if Cuba initiated political opening and transition to democracy. The Bush Administration was prepared to lift the embargo on Cuba if certain conditions were met, including freeing political prisoners and respecting human rights. Ra\u00fal Castro expressed willingness to negotiate with the United States based on principles of equality and mutual respect. Ra\u00fal Castro offered dialogue with the United States and criticized U.S. sanctions on Cuba. President Bush called for a transition to democracy in Cuba and emphasized the need for free speech, assembly, and elections. U.S. officials maintained that policy towards Cuba would not change unless the regime changed. President Bush reiterated the continuation of sanctions towards Cuba, stating that as long as the regime maintains control, the embargo will remain. He also encouraged Cuban officials to embrace change and offered a place for them in a free Cuba. President Bush announced his resignation as head of state, emphasizing the need for a democratic transition in Cuba. The U.S. maintained its policy stance, urging Cuba to release political prisoners, respect human rights, and hold free elections. Bush emphasized that Cuba needed to make changes for improved relations, including releasing political prisoners and respecting human rights. President Bush called for improvements in Cuba, including access to the Internet and allowing Americans to send mobile phones to family members. President Obama pledged to lift restrictions on family travel and remittances to Cuba but maintained the embargo as leverage for change. If Cuba frees political prisoners and moves towards democracy, the US would normalize relations and ease the embargo. In March 2009, Congress approved measures to ease Cuba sanctions, including restrictions on family travel. President Obama fulfilled his campaign pledges by lifting restrictions on family travel and remittances before the fifth Summit of the Americas in April 2009. The Obama Administration announced significant measures to ease relations with Cuba. On April 13, 2009, the Obama Administration announced measures to ease U.S. sanctions on Cuba, including lifting restrictions on family travel and remittances. Additionally, steps were taken to increase telecommunications links and expand humanitarian donations to Cuba. President Obama emphasized seeking a new beginning with Cuba at the Summit of the Americas. The President expressed willingness to engage with the Cuban government on various issues, aiming for improved relations. The State Department turned off a controversial electronic billboard in Havana, signaling a shift in U.S.-Cuban relations. Talks on migration and other topics were set to restart between the two countries. The United States and Cuba resumed talks on direct postal service in 2009, with discussions on transportation, quality, and security of mail service. Both sides agreed to meet again after government consultations, but no new talks were scheduled. In December 2009, an American subcontractor working on democracy projects in Cuba was arrested in Havana. An American subcontractor working on USAID-funded Cuba democracy projects in Cuba was arrested in Havana for distributing communications equipment. Cuban officials accused him of being a spy, but U.S. officials denied any involvement with intelligence services. Secretary of State Clinton expressed concern over his detention, stating it was harming U.S.-Cuban relations. The State Department called for his release, emphasizing that his continued detention was hindering dialogue between the two countries. In late 2009, Cuban officials criticized the Obama Administration, leading to a U.S. drug czar canceling a trip to Cuba. In 2010, the Obama Administration expressed concern about human rights issues in Cuba, particularly regarding imprisoned hunger striker Orlando Zapata Tamayo. After Zapata's death, U.S. officials called for the release of over 200 political prisoners held by Cuba. President Obama issued a statement in March 2010 expressing deep concern about the human rights situation in Cuba. The President expressed concern about human rights violations in Cuba, including the death of Zapata, repression of the Ladies in White, and increased harassment of dissenters. He called for an end to repression, release of political prisoners, and respect for basic rights. The President emphasized his commitment to supporting the Cuban people's desire for freedom and self-determination. In response to the Cuban Catholic Church's announcement of releasing 52 political prisoners, Secretary of State Clinton welcomed it as a positive step towards increased respect for human rights in Cuba. The State Department called for the immediate release of all political prisoners and supported their right to decide whether to stay in Cuba or travel to another country. Reports suggested that the Obama Administration would ease travel restrictions and allow all Americans to send remittances to Cuba. The relaxation of travel regulations in Cuba would involve looser restrictions on educational, religious, and people-to-people travel, with an expansion of charter flights and U.S. cities. Policy changes on travel and remittances were similar to those in effect during the Clinton and early Bush Administrations. However, by the end of the year, no announced policy changes had been made. The statement on the one-year anniversary of Alan Gross's incarceration in December 2010 called for his release, citing it as a major obstacle to dialogue between the US and Cuba. Travel restrictions to Cuba have been a contentious issue for the past 40 years, with changes over time. Enforcement of restrictions increased under the Bush Administration, including tighter controls on travel and remittances to Cuba. In March 2003, travel restrictions to Cuba were tightened, eliminating non-academic educational exchanges. In June 2004, family travel and humanitarian assistance were significantly restricted. In 2008, Barack Obama pledged to lift restrictions on family travel and remittances to Cuba, which was reiterated by Hillary Clinton in 2009. Congress also eased sanctions on travel to Cuba in 2009. In 2009, family travel restrictions to Cuba were eased, allowing visits to close relatives once a year with no limit on stay. The definition of \"close relative\" was expanded, and a general license was required for travel related to marketing agricultural and medical goods. Regulations were issued by the Treasury Department in September 2009. In 2009, family travel restrictions to Cuba were eased, allowing visits to close relatives once a year with no limit on stay. A general license was required for travel related to marketing agricultural and medical goods. Regulations were issued by the Treasury Department in September 2009. The Obama Administration announced measures to lift restrictions on family travel and remittances to Cuba in April 2009. In April 2009, the Obama Administration announced the lifting of restrictions on family travel and remittances to Cuba. The new policy allowed unlimited family visits with no restrictions on frequency or duration, removed the 44-pound baggage limit, and increased the daily spending limit to $179. Additionally, the previous $300 per quarter limit on family remittances was removed, allowing authorized travelers to carry up to $3,000 in remittances. Regulations for these changes were issued by the Treasury and Commerce Departments on September 3, 2009. The Obama Administration announced the lifting of restrictions on family travel and remittances to Cuba in April 2009. This policy allowed unlimited family visits, removed baggage limits, and increased spending limits. Reports in August 2010 suggested further easing of travel and remittance restrictions, similar to policies in place from 1999 to 2004. However, no official policy changes were announced by the end of the 111th Congress. Arguments for lifting the Cuba travel ban include rights of Americans to travel, influencing conditions in Cuba, and the ability to travel to other countries with authoritarian governments. The Obama Administration lifted restrictions on family travel and remittances to Cuba in April 2009, allowing unlimited family visits and increased spending limits. Arguments against lifting the Cuba travel ban include concerns about supporting Castro's government financially and the President's ability to restrict travel for foreign policy reasons. House hearings were held in the 111th Congress to discuss restrictions on travel to Cuba. The House Agriculture Committee discussed lifting Cuba travel and trade restrictions in a hearing on U.S.-Cuba policy. H.R. 4645 aimed to lift all travel restrictions to Cuba and ease payment mechanisms for U.S. agricultural exports. The bill was reported out on June 30, 2010, but further action was postponed. Another bill in the Senate, S. 3112, also addressed easing Cuba travel restrictions. Several bills in the 111th Congress aimed to ease Cuba travel restrictions, including H.R. 874, H.R. 1528, H.R. 188, H.R. 1530, H.R. 2272, H.R. 1531, H.R. 332, S. 428, S. 1089, S. 774, H.R. 1918, and S. 1517. However, H.Con.Res. 132 called for democratic conditions before increasing trade and tourism to Cuba. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 (TSRA) allows for one-year export licenses for selling agricultural commodities to Cuba, with restrictions on financing and credit. Importing goods from Cuba is still banned, but travel to Cuba for business related to agricultural sales is authorized under specific licenses. Since 2002, the United States has been Cuba's largest supplier of food and agricultural products, with exports rising significantly from $7 million in 2001 to $712 million in 2008. However, exports declined to $533 million in 2009 due to Cuba's shortage of hard currency. In 2010, U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba continued to fall, amounting to $311 million from January to October, a 31% decrease from 2009. The decline was mainly attributed to Cuba's shortage of hard currency. In 2005, OFAC clarified that \"payment of cash in advance\" means payment received before shipment, causing objections from U.S. agricultural exporters and some Members of Congress. In July 2005, OFAC clarified that vessels can leave U.S. ports for the sale of U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba once a foreign bank confirms receipt of payment. Congress defined \"payment of cash in advance\" in December 2009 as payment before transfer of title to the Cuban purchaser, overturning OFAC's previous clarification. The 111th Congress did not complete action on FY2011 appropriations legislation, but approved short-term resolutions instead. Legislative initiatives introduced would have made permanent the \"payment of cash in advance\" provision, but no action was completed. H.R. 4645 proposed changes to allow direct transfers between U.S. and Cuban financial institutions for payment for products sold to Cuba under TSRA. The 111th Congress did not complete action on FY2011 appropriations legislation but approved short-term resolutions instead. H.R. 4645 proposed changes to allow direct transfers between U.S. and Cuban financial institutions for payment for products sold to Cuba under TSRA, and also would have lifted all restrictions on travel to Cuba. Some groups advocate for further easing restrictions on agricultural exports to Cuba, arguing that it harms the Cuban population's health and nutrition. U.S. agribusiness companies supporting the removal of restrictions believe that U.S. farmers are missing out on a nearby market. Agricultural exporters want to change U.S. restrictions to sell agriculture and farm equipment to Cuba, and those supporting the lifting of the prohibition on financing argue that it would help smaller exporters. Opponents of easing restrictions on agricultural exports to Cuba argue that U.S. policy already allows for such sales, citing significant sales since 2001 and billions of dollars in licensed humanitarian donations. They believe that easing pressure on the Cuban government would not be beneficial. Opponents argue against easing restrictions on agricultural exports to Cuba, citing concerns about supporting the Castro regime and its repressive policies. Some agricultural producers support the prohibition on financing for exports to ensure payment. The 111th Congress took action in March 2009 to ease sanctions related to payment terms and travel for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. The Treasury issued regulations on travel to, from, or within Cuba for the marketing and sale of agricultural and medical goods under a general license. Specific licenses from OFAC were previously required on a case by case basis. The regulations, issued on September 3, 2009, allowed a narrow class of businesses to travel under a new general license, with requirements for advance notice and post-travel reporting. The regulations issued on September 3, 2009, included reporting requirements related to business conducted in Cuba. Section 622, Division D, of the FY2009 omnibus measure prohibited funds from being used to enforce an amendment to the Cuban embargo regulations regarding payment mechanisms for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. The regulations required either the \"payment of cash in advance\" or financing by third-country financial institutions for exports to Cuba. The FY2009 omnibus measure prohibited funds from enforcing an amendment to Cuban embargo regulations on payment mechanisms for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. OFAC guidance stated that exports to Cuba must be paid for in advance or financed through a third-country bank. Treasury Secretary Geithner's letter confirmed the requirement for advance payment, continuing the Bush Administration policy. Some Senators were reassured by the Secretary's interpretation, while others felt it ignored the legislative intent to ease restrictions on agricultural sales to Cuba. In December 2009, Congress clarified the payment of cash in advance for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. The provision aimed to make it easier for U.S. agricultural producers to export to Cuba, but some opponents argued it was a foreign policy change included in a must-pass spending bill without proper congressional consideration. The Administration implemented regulations for this provision in early March 2010. The Administration issued regulations in March 2010 regarding the provision for payment of cash in advance for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. This provision was included in the FY2010 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act and aimed to facilitate exports to Cuba. The committee urged the Treasury Department to amend Cuban Assets Control Regulations to remove impediments to U.S. agricultural sales to Cuba. The Senate Appropriations Committee included a provision in the FY2011 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act regarding \"payment of cash in advance\" for exports to Cuba, but no further action was taken. The 111th Congress did not complete action on the FY2011 Financial Services and General Government appropriations measure. Several legislative initiatives would have eased restrictions on U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba, including bills that would have lifted overall economic sanctions on Cuba. H.R. 2272, H.R. 1737, H.R. 1531, and S. 1089 aimed to lift economic sanctions on Cuba and facilitate U.S. agricultural exports. They included provisions to clarify payment terms and allow direct transfers for exports. Additionally, they proposed funding an agricultural export promotion program through a tax increase on U.S.-Cuba air travel. The bills H.R. 4645 and S. 3112 aimed to amend TSRA to clarify payment terms, authorize direct transfers between Cuban and U.S. financial institutions, and lift travel restrictions to Cuba. The United States has imposed sanctions denying trademark protection for businesses confiscated by the Cuban government. The provision in the bills H.R. 4645 and S. 3112 prohibits U.S. courts from recognizing trademarks used in connection with confiscated Cuban assets without the original owner's consent. This measure was enacted due to a dispute between Pernod Ricard and Bacardi Ltd. over the Havana Club rum trademark. Pernod Ricard entered a joint venture with the Cuban government to produce Havana Club, while Bacardi claims rights to the trademark through an agreement with the original owners whose assets were confiscated by Cuba in 1960. The United States faced a trade embargo and sought to protect its distribution rights in case the embargo was lifted. The European Union filed a dispute with the WTO in 2000, arguing that US law violated intellectual property agreements. The WTO ruled in 2002 that the US trademark sanction breached WTO provisions. The US agreed to comply with the ruling by January 2003 but failed to take legislative action. In 2005, the EU agreed not to retaliate immediately but reserved the right to do so in the future. On August 3, 2006, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office canceled Cuba's Havana Club trademark registration after OFAC denied a Cuban government company the license needed for renewal. Two approaches are proposed to comply with the WTO ruling on Section 211: amending it to apply to U.S. companies or repealing it altogether to protect trademarks of over 500 U.S. companies. The House Committee on the Judiciary discussed the impact of Section 211 on trademarks of U.S. companies in Cuba. Various legislative initiatives were introduced during the 111th Congress to address the issue, but no action was taken. Bills were proposed to either narrow the fix or repeal Section 211 altogether. The EU-U.S. bilateral agreement in July 2005 also played a role in the discussions. The EU-U.S. bilateral agreement reduced pressure on Congress to comply with the WTO ruling. Concerns about Cuba's deepwater oil reserves in the Gulf of Mexico have been raised, with estimates of significant oil and gas reserves. Cuba has agreements for concessions in its offshore sector. Cuba has agreements with foreign oil companies for offshore oil and gas exploration. Partners include Repsol, Norsk-Hydro, ONGC, PdVSA, Petronas, PetroVietnam, and Petrobras. China is focused on onshore oil extraction in Pi\u00f1ar del Rio province and does not have a concession in Cuba's offshore deepwater oil sector. Some Members of Congress have expressed concern about oil development in the Gulf of Mexico near the United States and potential environmental damage to the Florida coast. The Repsol-led project planned to drill a second well in August 2009, postponed to early 2011. Cuba has concerns about potential oil spill damage reaching its shore and has been preparing coastal residents. U.S. officials in Havana kept the Cuban government informed about the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Analysts suggest U.S.-Cuban energy and environmental cooperation to minimize risks. Some analysts have called for U.S.-Cuban cooperation on oil safety and environmental practices to minimize potential damage from a future oil spill. The Administration approved a license for a U.S. company to start cooperation with Cuba on this issue. Suggestions include identifying and amending regulatory restrictions on transferring equipment and personnel to combat oil spills in Cuba. Formal U.S.-Cuban government cooperation and planning are also recommended to mitigate potential oil spill damage. Cooperation with Mexico could serve as a model, and multilateral agreements under the International Maritime Organization could facilitate U.S.-Cuban engagement on oil pollution. In the 111th Congress, several measures were introduced regarding U.S. involvement in Cuba's offshore oil sector, including authorizing U.S. companies to work with Cuba for oil exploration and extraction. These measures aimed to amend existing laws to allow for collaboration and export of necessary equipment. However, no action was taken on these proposals. H.R. 5620 (Ros-Lehtinen) aimed to amend the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 to exclude aliens who invest $1 million or more in Cuba's offshore petroleum resources. The bill also proposed sanctions and prohibitions on the development of Cuba's petroleum resources. Cuba's susceptibility to narcotics smuggling is due to its geographic location, small keys, and extensive shoreline. Cuba has expressed concerns about drug trafficking through its waters and airspace, implementing measures such as stiffening penalties for traffickers and increasing counternarcotics training. They have judicial assistance agreements with 56 countries for anti-drug cooperation and have focused on maritime and air interdiction through Operation Hatchet since 2003. Cuba has actively pursued anti-drug efforts since 2003 with Operation Popular Shield, leading to increased cooperation with the United States on drug enforcement. In 1996, Cuba cooperated in seizing 6.6 tons of cocaine from a ship bound for Miami, and since 1999, efforts have been made to improve communication and cooperation between Cuban and U.S. authorities in combating drug trafficking. The U.S. Coast Guard Drug Interdiction Specialist (DIS) was stationed at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana in September 2000, leading to increased coordination with Cuban authorities in anti-drug operations. Cuban authorities provided the DIS access to counternarcotics efforts, including sharing criminal information, debriefings on drug trafficking cases, visits to training centers and facilities, and meetings with INTERPOL chiefs. Cuba has shown willingness to cooperate with the United States in combating drug trafficking by deporting fugitives and extraditing drug traffickers. However, the cooperation is on a case-by-case basis, not through a bilateral agreement. The United States and Cuba have cooperated in combating drug trafficking, with Cuba deporting fugitives and extraditing drug traffickers. Despite political differences, U.S. officials have praised the anti-drug cooperation as a positive example. Discussions have been held about a potential drug trafficking accord with Cuba, with the State Department highlighting the benefits of expanded cooperation due to Cuba's strategic location in the Caribbean. The United States and Cuba have cooperated in combating drug trafficking, with discussions about a potential drug trafficking accord due to Cuba's strategic location in the Caribbean. House and Senate versions of Foreign Operations appropriations bills have contained contrasting provisions related to funding for counternarcotics efforts with Cuba. Ultimately, none of these provisions were included in enacted measures. The FY2010 Senate Appropriations Committee-reported version of S. 1434 included a provision for $1 million in INCLE assistance for preliminary work on counternarcotics cooperation with Cuba. The FY2010 Senate Appropriations Committee-reported version of S. 1434 included a provision for $1 million in INCLE assistance for counternarcotics cooperation with Cuba, contingent on Cuba having appropriate procedures to protect against loss of innocent life during drug interdiction. The final enacted FY2010 omnibus appropriations measure did not include this provision. Several individuals, including U.S. government officials, have been convicted of spying for Cuba in the past decade. In June 2009, the FBI arrested Walter Kendall Myers and Gwendolyn Steingraber Myers for spying for Cuba for three decades. They passed classified information to the Cuban government. The Myerses pled guilty to spying charges in November 2009. Kendall Myers received a life sentence, while Gwendolyn Myers was sentenced to 81 months. In 2006, FIU professor Carlos Alvarez and his wife Elsa Prieto Alvarez were convicted of spying for Cuba. Carlos Alvarez received a five-year sentence, and his wife received three years. In May 2003, the Bush Administration expelled 14 Cuban diplomats. The Bush Administration expelled 14 Cuban diplomats for espionage activities, including Ana Montes who spied for Cuba for 16 years, revealing classified information about U.S. military operations. Montes was sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2002. In response, the State Department expelled four Cuban diplomats. In November 2002, four Cuban diplomats were expelled by the Bush Administration, including members of the \"Wasp Network\" convicted on espionage charges in Miami. The Cuban five, intelligence agents who infiltrated Cuban exile groups and targeted U.S. military bases, received sentences ranging from 15 years to life in prison. Cuba's government vowed to work for their return, with President Ra\u00fal Castro offering in December 2008. In December 2008, Cuban President Ra\u00fal Castro offered to exchange imprisoned Cuban political dissidents for the \"Cuban five,\" but the offer was rejected by the State Department. In 2009, sentences for three of the five were reduced, with one defendant's life sentence reduced to 20 years and another's reduced to 30 years. In February 2000, an INS official from Miami, Mariano Faget, was arrested and convicted. In May 2000, INS official Mariano Faget was arrested for passing classified information to a friend with ties to Cuba. He was sentenced to five years in prison in June 2001. This led to the expulsion of a Cuban diplomat in Washington, DC. Cuba has been on the State Department's list of states sponsoring international terrorism since 1982. Cuba's support for insurgents abroad decreased after Fidel Castro's statement in 1992, partly due to the Soviet Union's breakup. The loss of Soviet subsidies led to economic decline in Cuba. Debate surrounds Cuba's presence on the terrorism list, with critics arguing it's a cold war relic and supporters citing evidence of Cuba supporting terrorism through history. The State Department's 2009 report noted Cuba's condemnation of terrorism. The State Department's 2009 report highlighted Cuba's condemnation of terrorism, but also mentioned that Cuba provided safe haven and support to terrorist organizations like ETA, FARC, and ELN. Cuba cooperated with the U.S. on some law enforcement matters but allowed U.S. fugitives, including convicted murderers and hijackers, to live legally in Cuba. Both the President and Congress have the power to remove a country from the state sponsors of terrorism list. The process to remove a country from the state sponsors of terrorism list involves the President submitting a report to Congress certifying a change in leadership and policies, or providing assurances that the government no longer supports terrorism. Congress can block the removal through legislation if they disagree with the President's decision. The process to remove a country from the state sponsors of terrorism list involves the President submitting a report to Congress certifying a change in leadership and policies. Congress can block the removal through legislation. For example, legislation introduced on Cuba in the 111th Congress includes a provision to rescind the Secretary of State's determination that Cuba supports terrorism. Cuban officials criticize the U.S. for including Cuba on the extra screening list for Cuban citizens flying into the U.S. due to its retention on the terrorism list. They argue that Cuba has never supported terrorism. Cuba has been the target of various terrorist incidents over the years, including bombings in 1976 and 1997. Cuban officials maintain that Cuban exiles funded the bombings, and in 2000, four anti-Castro activists were arrested for a plot to kill Fidel Castro. In 2004, four men involved in the 1976 Cuban airline bombing were sentenced to prison terms. Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso pardoned them before the end of her term. Three men traveled to Florida with support from the Cuban American community, while Posada sought asylum in the US, fearing persecution for his opposition to Fidel Castro. Posada, a Venezuelan citizen, had been imprisoned in Venezuela for the bombing but reportedly escaped in 1985. In 1985, Posada escaped from prison after a bribe was paid to the warden. He was acquitted for a bombing but remained in prison pending an appeal. Posada admitted involvement in bombings in Havana in 1997, including one that killed an Italian tourist. He withdrew his asylum application in 2005 and was arrested for illegally entering the US. Venezuela requested his extradition, but a judge ruled he could not be deported due to risk of torture. In 2006, a U.S. federal judge ordered evidence justifying Posada's detention, leading to his indictment on seven counts for lying about entering the U.S. illegally. The Cuban government argued he should be charged with terrorism. Posada was released from jail in New Mexico in 2007 and allowed to return to Miami. Posada was released from jail in New Mexico on April 19, 2007, and allowed to return to Miami under house arrest. A federal judge in Texas dismissed immigration fraud charges on May 9, 2007, citing mistranslated testimony and manipulated evidence. Cuba and Venezuela denounced Posada's release, calling him a terrorist. Posada was indicted again in Texas on April 8, 2009, for lying about his involvement in bombings in Havana in 1997. The trial was rescheduled multiple times and is now set for January 2011. On July 7, 2010, a Posada associate was extradited to Cuba by Venezuelan authorities. Salvadoran citizen Francisco Ch\u00e1vez Abarca, an alleged associate of Luis Posada, was extradited to Cuba for his involvement in the 1997 bombings in Havana. Ch\u00e1vez Abarca had been imprisoned in El Salvador for running a car theft ring but was released due to a botched investigation. He was arrested in Venezuela in 2010 for planning protests during the country's legislative elections. The Cuban government released his video confessions linking him to Posada and the bombings, stating that Posada recruited him and paid him for each bomb. Posada recruited Ch\u00e1vez Abarca in El Salvador for the Cuba bombings, paying him $2,000 per bomb. Only one bomb detonated in Havana in 2007. The United States has provided assistance to increase information on democracy, human rights, and free enterprise in Cuba through various organizations. Congress allocated nearly $157 million from FY2001-FY2010 for these efforts. Congress appropriated almost $157 million from FY2001-FY2010 for Cuba democracy efforts, including $45.3 million for FY2008, $20 million for FY2009, and $20 million for FY2010. The funding aimed to assist human rights activists, independent journalists, Afro-Cubans, women, youth, and student activists. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended fully funding the Administration's request for Cuba and called for regular evaluations of program cost effectiveness. In the 111th Congress, the FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act funded overall foreign operations, including $20 million for Cuba democracy funding. Two members of Congress initially placed a hold on the assistance, but it was later lifted, with $15 million released. Additionally, USAID allocated an extra $620,000 in FY2009 ESF for Cuba, totaling $15.620 million. The remaining $4.380 million was shifted to a humanitarian assistance program for Guatemala. For FY2010, Congress fully funded the Administration's $20 million ESF request for Cuba democracy programs. For FY2010, Congress fully funded the Administration's $20 million ESF request for Cuba democracy programs, focusing on humanitarian assistance, strengthening civil society, weakening the information blockade, and promoting democratic change and reconciliation. The FY2011 request also sought $20 million for similar projects. The Administration's request for FY2010 and FY2011 focused on providing humanitarian assistance, strengthening civil society, supporting civic action movements, and promoting fundamental freedoms in Cuba. The Senate proposed transferring $2 million of ESF funds for democracy programs in Cuba. The 111th Congress did not complete action on the FY2011 appropriations measure, instead approving short-term funding resolutions. The funding for democratization assistance for Cuba has shifted from the Commerce, Justice, and State appropriations measure to the State Department, Foreign Operations, and Related Agencies appropriations measure. Funding for Cuba projects by the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) has increased steadily over the years, with $2.4 million allocated for 17 projects in FY2005, and almost $1.5 million for 13 projects in FY2006. In FY2008 and FY2009, NED funded multiple Cuba projects with funding from the State Department totaling over $1.4 million and about $1.5 million respectively. A report by the Government Accountability Office highlighted significant problems in the U.S. democracy assistance program for Cuba, citing issues with internal controls and oversight leading to misuse of funds and non-compliance with regulations. Representative William Delahunt raised concerns about the program's effectiveness due to high shipping costs and inadequate oversight. The GAO study was requested by the Affairs Committee's Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight, along with Representative Jeff Flake. Felipe Sixto, a White House aide to President Bush, resigned in March 2008 due to alleged misuse of funds at the Center for a Free Cuba. Sixto pled guilty to stealing nearly $600,000 in December 2008 and was sentenced to prison in March 2009. Another group, Grupo de Apoyo a la Democracia, is also under investigation for misuse of funds. GAO praised USAID's steps to improve oversight of its Cuba democracy program in a report issued on November 24, 2008. USAID has taken steps since 2006 to address issues with its Cuba program, including awarding grants competitively, hiring more staff, and improving oversight through reviews and guidance. However, the GAO report highlighted that USAID lacked sufficient staff for effective grant oversight and that assessing the program's improvements was challenging due to recent actions. The GAO report in August 2008 identified internal control, financial management, and procurement weaknesses at three grantees in USAID's Cuba program. Recommendations included ensuring adequate staffing for monitoring activities and assessing efforts to reduce grantee risks. The Cuban American National Foundation (CANF) report in May 2008 called for USAID grantees to spend a minimum of 75% of government funds on direct aid to Cuban civil society. On December 4, 2009, an American subcontractor, Alan Gross, was arrested in Cuba for distributing communications equipment to civil society groups. Cuban officials accused him of working for American intelligence. On December 4, 2009, American subcontractor Alan Gross was arrested in Cuba for distributing communications equipment to civil society groups. Cuban officials accused him of working for American intelligence, but U.S. officials denied the accusation. The contractor was working with a peaceful, non-dissident civic group recognized by the Cuban government to improve communication. Numerous U.S. officials have called for Gross's release, including at migration talks with Cuba and in a letter signed by 40 House Members. American subcontractor Alan Gross was arrested in Cuba for distributing communications equipment to civil society groups. U.S. officials denied accusations of him working for American intelligence. Calls for his release have been made by various U.S. officials, citing concerns for his health and his impact on U.S.-Cuba relations. Secretary of State Clinton expressed deep concern about his welfare and poor health. Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs met with Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez in New York. The Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs met with Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez in New York to encourage the release of Alan Gross, an American subcontractor detained in Cuba. The State Department reiterated calls for Gross's release, stating that his detention hinders dialogue between the two countries. U.S.-government sponsored Radio and TV Mart\u00ed aim to provide accurate and credible news to the Cuban people. The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) became an independent agency in October 1999, managing entities like Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, and Office of Cuba Broadcasting. Legislation in the 104th Congress required the relocation of Office of Cuba Broadcasting from Washington, DC to Miami, FL, which was completed in 1998. Radio Mart\u00ed broadcasts on short and medium wave channels for 24 hours six days per week. TV Mart\u00ed broadcasts on various platforms including internet, satellite television, and an airborne platform. It also transmits to Cuba 24 hours daily through Hispasat satellite television. The OCB contracted with private U.S. commercial stations to transmit Radio and TV Mart\u00ed. The OCB contracted with Radio Mamb\u00ed and TV Azteca for broadcasting Radio Mart\u00ed and TV Mart\u00ed programs in Miami. The contracts were extended for six months with similar terms, but Radio Mamb\u00ed's contract expired in early 2008 while TV Mart\u00ed continues to be shown on Channel 38. TV Mart\u00ed programming was also transmitted via an airborne platform known as Commando Solo from mid-2004 to 2006. The Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) began using contracted private aircraft to transmit TV Mart\u00ed broadcasts six days a week in August 2006. By late October 2006, the OCB inaugurated AeroMart\u00ed, an aircraft-broadcasting platform capable of live broadcasts. AeroMart\u00ed uses two privately contracted airplanes to transmit broadcasts for four and a half hours daily from Monday to Saturday. In June 2010, broadcast hours were reduced to two and a half hours for five days a week. Both Radio and TV Mart\u00ed have faced controversies over broadcast standards and funding cuts due to low audience numbers caused by Cuban jamming efforts. The Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) has faced allegations of cronyism, patronage, and bias in its operations. The former director of TV Mart\u00ed programming pleaded guilty to receiving kickbacks from a vendor. Various government studies and audits, including those by the GAO, have criticized the lack of transparency and accountability in awarding contracts to Radio Mamb\u00ed and TV Azteca. The GAO criticized Radio Mamb\u00ed and TV Azteca for lacking transparency and accountability in awarding contracts. The State Department/BBG OIG report praised OCB's improvements under director Pedro Roig, highlighting better broadcast quality and new technology for live TV signals into Cuba. The report also called for more internal quality control to ensure editorial standards are met. The report recommended reviewing leases with Radio Mamb\u00ed and TV Azteca to assess their effectiveness and cost. It also emphasized the need for a long-term strategic plan for OCB to compete with commercial broadcasters and prepare for uncensored broadcasting in a democratic Cuba. The report highlighted increased viewership of TV Mart\u00ed in Cuba, citing surveys showing higher listening rates for Radio and TV Mart\u00ed among recent Cuban arrivals. Anecdotal evidence suggested AeroMart\u00ed airborne transmissions had boosted viewership, with 17% of recent arrivals reportedly watching TV Mart\u00ed. USINT survey data also indicated a rise in viewership, reflecting the effectiveness of TV Mart\u00ed broadcasts in reaching Cuban audiences. In 2007, a report showed increased viewership of TV Mart\u00ed in Cuba, with some visitors able to watch it briefly via UHF. However, observers noted government jamming efforts made the signal essentially unusable. Cuban immigrants in Florida also mentioned that TV Mart\u00ed is rarely seen in Cuba, unlike Radio Mart\u00ed which can be heard throughout the country. Phone surveys commissioned by BBG in 2003, 2005, and 2007 also reflected low viewership of TV Mart\u00ed in Cuba. TV Mart\u00ed has low viewership in Cuba, with phone surveys from 2003, 2005, and 2006 showing past week viewership between 0.1% and 0.3%, and past month viewership of almost 0.5%. Radio Mart\u00ed had higher listenership, with 1% to 2% in the past week and 4% to 5% in the past month. A 2009 report by GAO stated that less than 2% of respondents tuned in to Radio or TV Mart\u00ed in the past week. The GAO report highlighted concerns with TV Mart\u00ed's viewership and adherence to laws and standards, including interference with Cuban broadcasts. GAO testified on these issues in a 2009 hearing by the House Subcommittee on International Organizations. In 2010, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff report concluded that Radio and TV Mart\u00ed were ineffective in influencing Cuban society and politics. The GAO report criticized Radio and TV Mart\u00ed for their ineffectiveness in influencing Cuban society and politics. It recommended integrating the Office of Cuba Broadcasting into the Voice of America in Washington. Funding for broadcasting to Cuba totaled $629 million from FY1984 to FY2009, with $34.4 million allocated in FY2009. The Broadcasting Board of Governors did not differentiate between Radio and TV Mart\u00ed funding after FY2005. In FY2009, $34.4 million was allocated for broadcasting to Cuba, including funding for the airborne platform used by the Office of Cuba Broadcasting for Radio and TV Mart\u00ed. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended fully funding the Administration's request for Cuba broadcasting. The FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act provided funding for Cuba broadcasting under the Broadcasting Board of Governors' International Broadcasting Operations account, fully funding the Administration's request. In FY2010, the BBG requested $32.47 million for Cuba broadcasting, Congress appropriated $30.474 million. Proposed changes included altering TV Mart\u00ed's news format and converting Radio Mart\u00ed to all news. This would result in a 20% staffing cut, eliminating 35 jobs. The changes were seen as addressing political bias criticism and streamlining programming. In December 2009, Congress provided $30.474 million for Cuba broadcasting in FY2010, $2 million less than the Administration's request. The omnibus appropriations measure did not fully fund the Administration's request, with the Senate version providing $15 million less and prohibiting funding for TV Mart\u00ed broadcasts. The bill also required two reports on a multi-year strategic plan for broadcasting to Cuba. The BBG strategic plan for broadcasting to Cuba must include an analysis of the current situation, estimated audience sizes for Radio and TV Mart\u00ed, operating costs of TV transmission, obstacles to increasing audience size, and other options for disseminating news. The BBG requested $29.179 million for broadcasting to Cuba in FY2011, with staffing remaining at 136 positions. The Senate recommended $28.789 million, $390,000 less than the request. The committee also opposed closing the Greenville Station in North Carolina. The 111th Congress did not complete action on the FY2011 State Department and Foreign Operations appropriations measure. Instead, it approved short-term continuing resolutions, with the last one providing funding for federal agencies through March 4, 2011. Cuba and the United States reached migration accords in 1994 and 1995 to address the mass exodus of Cubans. Policymakers were concerned about the 1980 Mariel boatlift when 125,000 Cubans fled to the United States. In response to the threat of another mass exodus of Cubans, President Clinton changed U.S. migration policy in August 1994. Cubans rescued at sea were taken to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and talks between Cuba and the United States led to a bilateral agreement on September 9, 1994, to stem the flow of Cubans fleeing by boat. The United States and Cuba agreed to ensure safe, legal, and orderly Cuban migration to the U.S., with a minimum of 20,000 legal migrants per year. The U.S. stopped granting parole to all Cuban migrants reaching its shores, while Cuba agreed to prevent unsafe departures. In 1995, an accord was reached to parole over 30,000 Cubans from Guantanamo to the U.S., but intercept and return future sea migrants to Cuba. Both countries pledged cooperation to prevent actions against migrants. Since the 1995 migration accord, the U.S. Coast Guard has intercepted thousands of Cubans at sea and returned them to Cuba, while those at risk for persecution were transferred to Guantanamo and later found asylum in a third country or the United States. Cubans who reach shore can apply for permanent resident status after one year under the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966. This \"wet foot/dry foot\" policy has been criticized for encouraging risky migration to the U.S. The number of Cubans interdicted at sea by the U.S. Coast Guard rose from 666 in FY2002 to a high of 2,868 in FY2007, but subsequently declined to 422 in FY2010. Reasons for the decline include the U.S. economic downturn, more efficient coastal patrolling, and aggressive prosecution of migrant smugglers. In October 2008, Mexico and Cuba negotiated a migration accord to curb irregular migrant flow. U.S. prosecution against migrant smugglers in Florida has increased with numerous convictions. The number of Cuban migrants interdicted at sea by the U.S. Coast Guard has increased in recent years with numerous convictions. There have been violent incidents involving weapons and Coast Guard officials using force to prevent Cubans from reaching shore. In late December 2007, a Coast Guard official in Florida called on the Cuban American community to denounce smuggling. In July 2010, three Cuban nationals were charged with conspiracy, kidnapping, and extortion involving the abduction of Cuban migrants in Mexico. The Cuban government also takes action against alien smuggling, imposing prison sentences of up to three years. In response to an announcement of temporary ceding of political power, the Department of Homeland Security urged Cubans to stay on the island and discouraged risky sea travel to the United States. Additional measures were introduced to deter Cubans from turning to alien smuggling for entry. Family reunification efforts were supported by increasing the number of Cuban migrants admitted annually with family in the U.S., while those attempting illegal entry would be ineligible under the new policy. Under the new family reunification procedure, those who enter the United States illegally will be ineligible. Cuban medical personnel working in third countries can now enter the U.S. along with their families. U.S.-Cuban talks on migration accords were canceled by the State Department due to Cuba's refusal to discuss key issues. The U.S. canceled talks with Cuba on migration accords, citing Cuba's refusal to discuss key issues. Cuban officials criticized the decision as irresponsible and expressed readiness to address all raised issues. The talks aimed to reaffirm commitment to safe migration and improve operational relations. Since mid-2009, there have been three rounds of talks between the U.S. and Cuba on migration issues. The talks aim to ensure effective operation of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, access to a deep-water port for Cuban migrants, monitoring the welfare of returned Cubans, and gaining Cuban government acceptance of excluded Cubans. Cuba proposed a new immigration agreement and more effective cooperation to combat alien smuggling, opposing the \"wet foot/dry foot policy.\" The second round of talks on migration issues between the U.S. and Cuba took place in Havana on February 19, 2010, aiming to advance mutual interests and the full implementation of the Migration Accords. During the third round of talks in June 2010, U.S. officials urged Cuba to provide medical care to political prisoner Orlando Zapata Tamayo and called for the release of USAID subcontractor Alan Gross. Secretary of State Clinton expressed deep concern about Gross's welfare and his continued detention harming U.S.-Cuba relations. The U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, has been a U.S. base since 1903, and its presence can only be terminated by mutual agreement or abandonment. The Cuban government has opposed the base's presence as illegal, despite assurances to respect treaty commitments. The base's mission has evolved over time, serving as a strategic location during the cold war. The U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, has been a U.S. base since 1903, serving as a strategic location during the cold war. In 1994-1995, the base housed Cuban and Haitian refugees, with most Cubans paroled into the United States. Since a 1995 accord, the U.S. Coast Guard has interdicted Cuban migrants at sea. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the base held captured Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters. The U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay has housed captured Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters. The Cuban government expressed concerns about the treatment of prisoners at the base and called for an investigation. President Obama issued an order to close the Guantanamo detention facility in 2009. Some Members of Congress have called for the closure of the Guantanamo detention facility within a year. Legislation has been introduced to prevent the transfer of enemy combatants to US military prisons. The future of the Guantanamo base is tied to the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996. The Cuban government is open to negotiations regarding the Guantanamo Bay base, which was excluded from the OAS in 1962 due to its Marxist-Leninist identification. In 2009, the OAS overturned this resolution, but Cuba remains hesitant to rejoin due to US dominance and promotion of capitalism. The Eighth Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of Foreign Affairs, requested by Colombia in 1961 under the R\u00edo Treaty, aimed to address threats to American states' peace and independence from extracontinental powers, hinting at concerns about Cuba and the Soviet Union. Peru had also requested a meeting to discuss Cuba's repression of its people and use of diplomatic missions for covert activities. The Inter-American Peace Committee provided a report on Cuba to the Eighth Meeting of Consultation of Foreign Ministers, highlighting Cuba's connections with the Sino-Soviet bloc as incompatible with the principles of the OAS. This led to the resolution that excluded Cuba from OAS participation due to its adherence to Marxism-Leninism and alignment with the communist bloc. The resolution to exclude Cuba from the OAS due to its Marxist-Leninist government was approved by a vote of 20-1, with Cuba voting against. 14 countries voted in favor, while 6 abstained citing juridical reasons. In 2009, Cuba's reinstatement into the inter-American system became an issue for Latin American countries. OAS Secretary General Insulza stated that the 1962 resolution excluding Cuba was outdated and should be debated for repeal at the upcoming OAS General Assembly. Insulza clarified that repealing the resolution wouldn't automatically readmit Cuba, as full reintegration would require a separate decision by Cuba and all OAS members. In 2009, OAS Secretary General Insulza called for the repeal of the 1962 resolution excluding Cuba from the inter-American system. He stated that the resolution was a \"bad idea\" and expressed his desire to see Cuba back in the organization. As the OAS General Assembly approached, several countries proposed resolutions on the Cuba issue, leading to the creation of a Working Group to find a consensus text. The draft resolutions by Honduras and Nicaragua aimed to overturn the 1962 resolution excluding Cuba from the OAS. The Honduran resolution would revoke the 1962 resolution, while the Nicaraguan resolution would characterize it as an act of justice. The Nicaraguan resolution also stated that the exclusion of Cuba violates international law and constitutes discrimination. The draft U.S. resolution did not explicitly repeal the 1962 resolution. The draft U.S. resolution at the OAS General Assembly in 2009 aimed to support Cuba's eventual reintegration into the Inter-American system while upholding OAS principles and values. It instructed the OAS Permanent Council to initiate a dialogue with Cuba for its reintegration, emphasizing sovereignty, democracy, and human rights. After facing difficulty in reaching consensus, the OAS General Assembly agreed on a resolution on June 3, 2009, to readmit Cuba into the OAS through a dialogue process initiated by the Cuban government, aligning with OAS principles. The resolution overturned the 1962 decision without specific reference to the Inter-American Democratic Charter. The OAS General Assembly agreed on a resolution to readmit Cuba, aligning with OAS principles. The resolution averted overturning the 1962 decision and allowed Cuba to participate in the OAS immediately. U.S. officials viewed it as a diplomatic success, as it laid out a process referencing democracy, human rights, and self-determination. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton praised the OAS resolution on Cuba, emphasizing the importance of democracy, human rights, and self-determination. She highlighted the need for Cuba to meet certain conditions before reentry. Critics argue for stricter enforcement measures. The consensus resolution on Cuba's reentry into the OAS has been criticized for not linking it strongly enough to the Inter-American Democratic Charter. Some Members of Congress threatened to withhold U.S. funding to the OAS if Cuba is readmitted as a member. Supporters argue that the resolution improves U.S.-Latin American relations. The consensus resolution on Cuba's reentry into the OAS is seen as a positive step in U.S.-Latin American relations and an opportunity for dialogue on democratic principles. Many Latin American nations praised the resolution as a move towards integrating the region into the Inter-American system. Cuba had previously shown no interest in rejoining the OAS, with Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodr\u00edguez criticizing the organization as a tool of the United States. Fidel Castro also expressed disdain for the OAS in an essay published on the day of the resolution vote. Fidel Castro criticized the OAS as a tool of the United States and expressed disdain for the organization. Cuba indicated it would not return to the OAS after the vote, citing U.S. dominance. Legislation in 2009 aimed to ease U.S. sanctions on Cuba.

This eliminates the need for a specific license from OFAC for such travel, which was previously required on a case by case basis. Additionally, Section 621 prohibits funds from being used to enforce family travel restrictions imposed in 2004, while Section 622 prohibits funds from being used to enforce an amendment to the Cuban embargo regulations in 2005.
