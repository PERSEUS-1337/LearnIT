    "content": "The \"Health Savings Act of 2015\" includes provisions for health savings accounts for children, allowing rollovers to child or parent, increasing contribution limits, providing bankruptcy protections, allowing silver and bronze plans, and identifying HSA compatible plans. The \"Health Savings Act of 2015\" includes provisions for child health savings accounts, allowing deductions for contributions made to a child or grandchild's account. The taxable year limit for child health savings accounts is based on monthly limitations for eligible individuals. Contributions to all child health savings accounts cannot exceed the monthly limitations. The monthly limitation for each child is 1/12 of the annual amount specified in the legislation. A child health savings account established for the benefit of the child of a taxpayer shall be treated as a health savings account of the taxpayer until the first taxable year for which no deduction is allowable to any taxpayer with respect to such child. After that, the account shall be treated as a health savings account of the child. The term 'child health savings account' refers to a health savings account established for the benefit of a child of a taxpayer. Qualified medical expenses for this account do not include amounts paid for medical care for individuals other than the child. Exceptions apply in cases of disability or death of the child. The taxpayer can rollover funds from a child health savings account to another health savings account for the child, grandparent, or another child of the taxpayer. Legal guardians are treated as parents for this purpose. The Secretary will create regulations for implementation, including rules for legal guardians and parents who file separately or are not married. Amounts in a child health savings account are not considered for means-tested programs. The health savings account funds are not counted for determining resources under title XIX of the Social Security Act. The amendments apply to taxable years after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 3. Allowing HSA rollover to child or parent of account holder. SEC. 3 amends section 223(f)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code to allow a child, parent, or grandparent to acquire a beneficiary's interest in a health savings account, treating it as a child health savings account for the child. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 4 increases the maximum contribution limit to Health Savings Accounts to the amount of deductible and out-of-pocket limitation for self-only and family coverage. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after the date of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 5 provides equivalent bankruptcy protections for Health Savings Accounts as retirement funds. SEC. 6 allows silver and bronze plans to be used with health savings accounts, treating them similarly to individual retirement accounts. The effective date for this amendment is after the enactment of the Act. Section 223 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to replace \"high deductible health plan\" with \"HSA compatible health plan\" in various subsections. The term \"HSA compatible health plan\" is defined as part of the Code. The term \"plan\" in Section 223 of the Internal Revenue Code refers to specific types of health plans, including high deductible health plans, catastrophic plans, and silver or bronze plans enrolled through an Exchange established under the Affordable Care Act. Clerical amendments are made to update the language in the Code. The amendments made by this section update the language in the Internal Revenue Code to replace \"high deductible health plan\" with \"HSA compatible health plan\" in specific subsection headings. These changes will apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2015. Beginning in 2016, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires that information on HSA compatible health plans must identify them as satisfying specific IRS code requirements."
