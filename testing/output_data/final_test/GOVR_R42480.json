    "content": "The bursting of the U.S. housing bubble in 2006 led to the 2007-2009 recession and financial panic in 2008. Falling house prices caused higher foreclosure rates and reduced consumer spending. Mortgage defaults and foreclosures harmed financial institutions, causing a broader financial system collapse. Some propose intervening in the housing market to improve the economy, while skeptics are concerned about potential negative effects. Since the bursting of the U.S. housing bubble in 2006, there have been concerns about the impact on the economy. Various proposed interventions aim to improve the housing market, such as reducing mortgage principal, refinancing mortgages, and renting out foreclosed homes. However, skeptics worry that further government intervention could prolong the housing slump and delay economic recovery. Principal reduction is a proposed intervention to improve the economy by shifting losses from borrowers to lenders. It may stimulate consumer spending by allowing borrowers to redirect income from debt repayment. Several bills in Congress aim to reduce mortgage principal, and it is also part of a settlement between mortgage servicers and state attorneys general. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) decided against allowing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to reduce mortgage principal. Large-scale refinancing helps current borrowers get lower interest rates, potentially preventing foreclosures. Refinancing could stimulate consumer spending by freeing up income for debt repayment or other expenses. In a refinance, the previous owner of the mortgage is repaid earlier than expected, leading to potential benefits for some investors but losses for others. Mass refinancing could impact government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with uncertain outcomes. President Obama proposed streamlining refinance programs in 2012. The 112th Congress proposed several large-scale refinancing plans for non-Fannie Mae and non-Freddie Mac loans, including H.R. 363, S. 170, and S. 3085. Another proposal suggests renting out foreclosed homes to stabilize housing prices by reducing the supply of homes for sale. This rental program depends on future house price increases for success. Renting foreclosed homes can help stabilize housing prices and reduce collateral damage to communities. Unlike other proposals like principal reductions and mass refinancing, renting foreclosed homes does not directly impact existing homeowners' payments or increase their disposable income. The program could prevent foreclosure by allowing delinquent homeowners to rent out their own homes. FHFA has initiated a pilot project to convert GSE foreclosed homes into rentals. Congressional proposals in the 112th Congress include H.R. 1548, the Right to Rent Act of 2011, and H.R. 2636, the Neighborhood Preservation Act of 2011. The potential impact of housing policies like H.R. 2636, S. 2080, and renting foreclosed homes is summarized in tables. The report will further analyze principal reduction, refinance, and rental proposals. Laurie Goodman estimated that 8.3 million to 10.4 million homeowners are at risk. Approximately 15%-19% of homeowners with a mortgage, totaling 8.3 million to 10.4 million, are at risk of losing their homes in the next six years. Laurie Goodman's estimates categorize mortgages into five groups based on default rates to calculate the number of homes in jeopardy of default. Laurie Goodman categorizes mortgages into five groups based on default rates to estimate the number of homes at risk of default. Her analysis suggests policy approaches to lower default rates, such as principal reduction and large-scale refinancing. Goodman's analysis suggests policy approaches to lower default rates, including large-scale refinancing for borrowers with negative equity. Another approach is to convert foreclosed homes into rental properties to prevent further market saturation and price decreases. The report analyzes these major policy proposals in detail. As a result of falling house prices, 11-15 million homeowners are underwater on their mortgages, limiting their ability to sell or use their homes as collateral. Negative equity increases the likelihood of default and foreclosure, driving down home prices further. To address these concerns, some Members propose large-scale refinancing and converting foreclosed homes into rental properties. Some Members of Congress propose reducing mortgage principal for underwater borrowers, measured by loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. LTV above 100% indicates negative equity. Figure 2 shows distribution of borrowers by home equity. Homeowners with mortgages can be divided into three groups. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and privately owned mortgage holders are the focus of proposals to reduce mortgage principal for underwater borrowers. GSE borrowers are ineligible for principal reductions due to FHFA policies, while non-GSE borrowers could benefit from programs like HAMP's Principal Reduction Alternative. Bills in Congress aim to address mortgage principal reduction. Several bills in the 112th Congress aim to reduce mortgage principal, including H.R. 1587, H.R. 3841, H.R. 4058, and S. 2093. Principal reduction is also part of a settlement between mortgage servicers, state attorneys general, and the federal government. Factors influencing financial institutions offering principal reductions are discussed. Some argue that principal reductions are typically in the borrower's and financial institution's best interests. Advocates argue that principal reductions are beneficial for borrowers and financial institutions, especially when borrowers are near foreclosure due to negative equity in their homes. This can prevent the bank from recovering only a fraction of the house's value through foreclosure. It is in the financial institution's best interest to reduce principal by less than the amount lost in foreclosure. Delinquent borrowers fall into four categories: those who can become current without assistance, those who will default despite a modification, those who can become current with a modification, and those who end up in foreclosure without a modification. Mortgage holders prefer to target Type 3 borrowers for modifications to avoid expenses for Types 1 and 2. The challenge for mortgage servicers is determining the type of delinquent borrower to offer a modification to, facing self-cure and re-default risks. Offering significant loan modifications may incentivize current borrowers to default for eligibility. The risk of strategic default arises when borrowers have an incentive to default to qualify for a modification, creating moral hazard. Financial institutions will only offer principal reductions if it maximizes profits by weighing the benefits of helping high-risk borrowers against potential losses from self-cure, re-default, or strategic default. This risk is present in all types of loan modifications, including changes to interest rates and loan balances. Loan modifications can include changes to interest rates and loan balances. Decreased monthly mortgage payments benefit all borrowers. Principal forbearance removes a portion of the principal temporarily, while principal reduction paired with other strategies can minimize risk. Borrowers who don't need modifications may find forbearance less appealing as it changes payment timing without reducing the overall amount owed. Principal reduction, combined with a shared appreciation mortgage, can minimize strategic default risk for borrowers with negative equity. This strategy aims to interrupt the cycle of falling home prices leading to more foreclosures. By reducing negative equity or increasing positive equity, principal reduction can help stabilize the housing market. Principal reduction programs target borrowers experiencing \"house lock\" who are unable to sell their home for enough to cover the mortgage balance. Some propose reducing principal incrementally or sharing house price appreciation with lenders to address concerns. Opponents argue that principal reduction may benefit some parts of the country at the expense of others due to concentrated negative equity in certain states. Principal reduction policies, similar to aid for natural disasters, may disproportionately benefit certain states with high negative equity. While stabilizing the housing market, this policy could boost the economy by reducing borrowers' monthly payments. However, it comes at the expense of mortgage owners, leading to potential net spending increases as borrowers spend more and investors spend less. Principal reduction policies could benefit states with high negative equity by stabilizing the housing market and boosting the economy. This could lead to increased consumer spending as borrowers spend more and investors spend less. Additionally, reducing foreclosures and stabilizing home prices would preserve household wealth and build consumer confidence, positively impacting the wider economy. Assuming mortgage holders voluntarily reduce principal when beneficial, involuntary reductions would not be in their best interest. Involuntary principal reductions may not benefit mortgage holders, as it could limit their choices and impact their ability to maximize returns. This could lead to a reduction in lending by banks and potentially cause interest rates to rise. However, the Federal Reserve could counteract a credit contraction through various measures. Despite the potential loss in revenue, mortgage holders could still benefit from a principal reduction program through different channels. Mortgage holders may face challenges due to servicers' incentives and operational issues, leading to potential foreclosure instead of loan modification. Coordination problems could arise if multiple mortgage holders pursue foreclosure simultaneously, driving down house prices and reducing recovery. The report analyzes the impact of principal reduction on the housing market and economy. Supporters argue it can stabilize the market and support household net worth, while opponents raise concerns about its negative impact on financial institutions. The GSEs do not perform principal reductions, but non-GSEs do through the government's Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP). Non-GSE mortgage holders, including banks and private investors, are more likely to perform principal reductions compared to GSEs. They also utilize principal forbearance at a similar rate. These mortgage holders, owning half of all outstanding mortgage debt in the US, can independently modify mortgage terms. The Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) encourages non-GSE institutions to conduct principal reductions through its Principal Reduction Alternative (PRA). The federal government offers financial incentives to investors in non-Fannie and non-Freddie loans to reduce mortgage principal through HAMP's Principal Reduction Alternative (PRA). HAMP is part of President Obama's Making Home Affordable (MHA) program, providing incentives to lower troubled borrowers' monthly mortgage payments. The PRA, announced on March 26, 2010, requires servicers to consider reducing principal balances for homeowners who owe at least 115% of their home value. Servicers conduct two net present value (NPV) tests, with the option to reduce principal if the NPV is higher with the test including principal reduction. The Principal Reduction Alternative (PRA) allows servicers to reduce principal, with the amount forgiven over three years if the borrower remains current. The Treasury Department reported over 60,000 active PRA modifications by January 2012, with incentives for servicers and investors to encourage more principal reductions. The Treasury Department's Principal Reduction Alternative (PRA) offers incentives for investors to reduce principal for borrowers. The program includes Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans, but FHFA has decided against their participation. The mortgage settlement with banks and state attorneys general is expected to provide $25 billion in relief, with $17 billion allocated for homeowners needing principal reductions. The Treasury Department's Principal Reduction Alternative (PRA) offers incentives for investors to reduce principal for borrowers, with $17 billion allocated for homeowners in need of principal reductions. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac do not offer principal reductions on their loans, which make up half of the U.S. mortgage market. FHFA, in consultation with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, decided against participating in the PRA component of HAMP. GSE loans are not covered for principal reduction under the terms of the mortgage settlement. Congress established FHFA in 2008 to preserve and conserve the assets of regulated entities. FHFA must ensure that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac maintain liquidity in the housing market during economic turbulence. FHFA analyzed the potential impact of principal reductions in 2012 and decided against participating in HAMP PRA. Treasury Department offered incentive payments to GSEs, but FHFA determined they would not participate. FHFA decided against GSEs participating in HAMP PRA due to analysis comparing benefits of principal reduction to costs. Analysis included comparing principal reduction to forbearance and creating a model to simulate program operation. FHFA calculated potential savings for GSEs by offering HAMP modifications with or without principal reduction. They compared the benefits of principal reduction to forbearance and determined the optimal modification for each borrower based on expected NPV. Ultimately, FHFA decided against GSEs participating in HAMP PRA. The FHFA analyzed the potential savings of offering principal reduction in HAMP modifications. The methodology used in previous analysis was criticized, but some criticisms were addressed in a later analysis. The FHFA used the NPV model in its analysis of HAMP data, which was criticized for not fully utilizing actual HAMP data. The NPV model is continually updated with more information on modification performance, including re-default rates. HAMP results indirectly influenced FHFA's analysis through the NPV model calibration. Additionally, technical flaws in the analysis were pointed out, such as using state-level house price indices. FHFA's January analysis used state-level house price indices, while the July analysis utilized ZIP code level indices to assess the potential number of homeowners eligible for HAMP PRA. The January analysis applied principal reduction to the entire GSEs portfolio, while the July analysis focused on determining optimal modifications for individual loans eligible for HAMP PRA. Goodman noted that the January analysis did not evaluate the actual HAMP program structure, while the July analysis attempted to analyze the actual HAMP structure with some simplifying assumptions due to the use of a model. The July analysis by FHFA attempted to model current loan attributes for eligible borrowers by lowering credit scores and using higher debt-to-income ratios. Despite criticism for not differentiating between loans with and without mortgage insurance, FHFA did account for mortgage insurance in some loans. Goodman argues that FHFA could implement a principal forgiveness program for borrowers without mortgage insurance, which would benefit the GSEs. FHFA conducted multiple analyses, with the final six focusing on numbers 11 through 12c. Table 4 shows the results of these analyses, listing the assumptions used in FHFA's modeling. FHFA conducted analyses on numbers 11 through 12c, estimating expected losses and savings for eligible loans. They calculated the benefit of offering principal reductions and expected Treasury subsidies. The Taxpayer Benefit was determined by subtracting these values. FHFA conducted analyses on numbers 11 through 12c to estimate losses and savings for eligible loans under the principal reduction program. Analysis 11 shows potential savings of $3.6 billion to GSEs and $1.0 billion to taxpayers, with most savings coming from severely underwater borrowers. The effectiveness of the program for borrowers more than a year delinquent is questioned, suggesting potential overestimation of savings. Analysis 11 removes borrowers more than 12 months delinquent, while Analysis 11b removes those more than 6 months delinquent, reducing the benefits found in Analysis 11. FHFA aims for a 50% take-up rate for HAMP eligible borrowers, scaling Analyses 12a-12c by 50%, 25%, and 15% to account for lower participation levels. The results show positive benefits for the GSEs and taxpayers, with 85% of optimal HAMP modifications being principal reductions. Table 4 only includes direct benefits and costs of offering principal reduction, with final results still pending. FHFA analyzed the direct benefits and costs of offering principal reduction, including potential indirect costs related to strategic modifiers. They found that 14,000 to 126,000 strategic modifiers would eliminate benefits to the GSEs and taxpayers, while 3,000 to 19,000 strategic modifiers would eliminate taxpayer benefits. FHFA analyzed the benefits and costs of principal reduction, including indirect costs like operational costs and staff resources. They concluded that implementing a principal reduction program would increase GSE and taxpayer losses, leading them to decide against allowing GSEs to participate in HAMP PRA. Targeting all borrowers, including those underwater or delinquent, was considered for eligibility in a principal reduction policy. Members in the 112th Congress have introduced legislation to reduce mortgage principal for subsets of homeowners through bills like H.R. 1587 and H.R. 4058, which aim to address different methods for reducing principal. Eligibility for principal reduction may vary based on the policy goal, targeting delinquent borrowers who could afford lower payments or a broader group to stimulate consumer spending. The Principal Reduction Act of 2012 aims to establish a program for reducing mortgage principal for qualified borrowers with loans owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. This program would require a principal reduction if it is determined that reducing principal is more beneficial than foreclosing. The Principal Reduction Act of 2012 aims to establish a program for reducing mortgage principal for qualified borrowers with loans owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Qualified mortgages would have their principal reduced to an LTV not exceeding 90%, and borrowers must share appreciation or repay the difference in case of foreclosure. S. 2093, the Preserving American Homeownership Act of 2012, requires the establishment of shared appreciation mortgage modification pilot programs for FHFA and FHA loans. Borrowers must be delinquent or at risk of default to be eligible. The Principal Reduction Act of 2012 aims to establish a program for reducing mortgage principal for qualified borrowers with loans owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Borrowers must be delinquent or at risk of default on their mortgage, have a documented financial hardship, and have the mortgage on their primary residence. Loans would be reduced to an LTV of 95% within three years by reducing the principal by one-third of the necessary amount over each of the three years. Borrowers would be eligible only if the modification results in greater cash flows to investors than other loss mitigation activities. A mortgage refinance allows borrowers to lower their monthly payments by prepaying the existing loan with a new loan at a lower interest rate. This process helps current borrowers and may prevent foreclosures, stimulating consumer spending and improving household balance sheets. Some borrowers may increase non-housing spending through refinancing, impacting the financial sector. While some investors may lose, banks and mortgage originators benefit. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may lose investment income but gain from reduced default risk. Current refinancing policy discussions focus on developing new programs or expanding existing ones like HARP. President Obama has endorsed these efforts in his State of the Union address. President Obama endorsed approaches to help borrowers refinance non-GSE and GSE loans. He proposed a program funded by a tax on financial institutions for non-GSE loans and streamlining HARP for GSE loans. The recent mortgage settlement aims to provide $3 billion for underwater borrowers. Congressional proposals like the Helping Responsible Homeowners Act and Responsible Homeowner Refinancing Act would require Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to expand refinancing options. The Act of 2012 proposed by Senator Robert Menendez et al. would require Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to expand refinancing of GSE loans. Borrowers can refinance their mortgage with a new lender, and the existing lender faces the risk of losing the loan to a competitor due to prepayment. The value of a mortgage held by a lender reflects this prepayment risk. The value of a mortgage that a lender holds reflects prepayment risk, influenced by mortgage interest rates. Refinances increase when rates fall, but despite historic lows, refinancing activity has not peaked as in 2003. Insufficient home equity is a barrier to refinancing, as lenders typically require 20% positive equity. Borrowers need at least 20% positive equity in their home to refinance, protecting the lender in case of default. Closing costs and fixed costs of refinancing can also be barriers for borrowers. Refinancing is beneficial if the amount saved on interest rates exceeds the cost of refinancing. Typically, interest rates need to drop by 1 to 2 percentage points for it to be worthwhile. Mass refinancing programs target borrowers with insufficient equity or high closing costs, aiming to prevent foreclosures and lower monthly payments. The impact on house prices would likely be through avoided foreclosures. Refinancing programs aim to prevent foreclosures by targeting borrowers with insufficient equity or high closing costs. Studies show that a small percentage of homeowners would have been foreclosed on without a refinance. Non-GSE loans may have a larger impact on avoided foreclosures compared to GSE loans. Targeting refinancing proposals to current borrowers is seen as the primary motivation for mass refinancing. The primary motivation for mass refinancing is economic stimulus, with estimates suggesting savings of $2,500 a year per borrower. Mark Zandi predicts that 6.8 million borrowers would refinance, boosting GDP by 0.1 percentage points. Estimates vary, with CBO predicting 2.9 million refinances and Hubbard et al. estimating 14 million, depending on eligibility criteria and borrower participation. Refinancing increases disposable income for borrowers. Refinancing increases disposable income for borrowers, but reduces potential income for mortgage investors. Borrowers are more likely to refinance when interest rates fall. Mass refinancing can have non-zero-sum gains for borrowers and losses for investors. It can also increase aggregate spending and support economic recovery, especially if borrowers spend more domestically. Foreign investors and the federal government hold a significant percentage of mortgage-backed securities. Mass refinancing can boost consumer spending in the US, with every dollar saved on monthly payments potentially generating 50 cents in additional spending. Some argue for a broader economic stimulus approach instead of targeting a small group of eligible homeowners. Despite potential losses for mortgage holders, the benefits to borrowers from large-scale refinancing may outweigh the drawbacks. A large-scale refinancing of agency MBS could impact various investors, including mutual funds and individuals' savings in pension funds. While mortgage holders may incur losses, some banks and institutions could benefit from increased business. The potential cost to investors would only arise if refinances exceeded expectations. The value of MBS already accounts for prepayment risk, and a mass refinancing proposal could help GSE loan borrowers refinance, even with limited income. The Obama Administration created HARP to assist borrowers with GSE loans in refinancing, even with little to no equity. Eligibility criteria include having a mortgage owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, owing more than 80% of the home's value on the mortgage, being current on payments, and having the ability to make new payments. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy loans from lenders and agree to purchase a new loan through HARP if the borrower meets the criteria. The HARP program was created by the Obama Administration to help borrowers with GSE loans refinance, even with little to no equity. Refinancing does not increase credit risk for GSEs as they already own the borrower's credit risk. HARP has refinanced around 998,000 mortgages, with most beneficiaries having positive equity or moderate negative equity. 91% of those who refinanced had LTV ratios between 80% and 105%. Fewer than 9% had LTV ratios over 105%. Additional fees may limit the reach of HARP. Loan level price adjustments and closing costs associated with getting a mortgage, such as an appraisal, may pose upfront expenses that some borrowers cannot afford. HARP allows for streamlined refinancing through an existing servicer, potentially reducing competition and increasing rates for borrowers. Questions arise about originators' capacity to handle increased refinance applications. HARP is a voluntary program, and FHFA announced changes in October 2011, removing the LTV ratio cap under HARP 2.0. Under HARP 2.0, the GSEs are eliminating loan level price adjustments and reducing closing costs for borrowers. Fannie and Freddie are waiving representations and warranties on original loans to incentivize lenders to refinance homeowners. This allows lenders to re-underwrite loans to meet agreed upon standards. In 2012, President Obama proposed a new program to allow non-GSE borrowers to refinance through the FHA and streamline HARP for GSE borrowers. Eligibility criteria for non-GSE borrowers include being current on mortgage payments, having a FICO score over 580, and meeting certain loan-to-value limits. The Administration proposed a new refinancing program to streamline HARP for GSE borrowers. The program would eliminate the need for a new appraisal or tax return to prove primary residency and would be funded through a fee on large financial institutions. Closing costs would be reduced by eliminating manual appraisals, requiring the use of automated valuation models instead. The Administration proposed a new refinancing program to streamline HARP for GSE borrowers, eliminating the need for new appraisals and tax returns. Lenders not currently servicing a borrower's mortgage could access streamlined underwriting, potentially lowering costs and increasing competition. The plan would make streamlined refinancing available to all GSE borrowers, including those with significant equity in their homes. Borrowers could use savings from refinancing to lower monthly payments or build equity more quickly by shortening the loan term. Equity can be built more quickly in a home by shortening the loan term through refinancing GSE loans. Closing costs for those opting to build equity faster would be covered by GSEs or FHA. Refinancing GSE loans does not increase credit risk, as the GSEs already own the borrower's credit risk. However, the FHA program would require the government to take on additional risk. Various proposals in the 112th Congress aim to mandate increased refinancing of GSE loans. Mae and Freddie Mac are establishing refinancing programs for qualified mortgages they own or guarantee. The programs have restrictions on additional fees and interest rates, with a one-year expiration. S. 170 requires borrowers to be current on their mortgages, while H.R. 363 does not have this restriction. H.R. 363 prohibits mortgage servicers from charging fees for refinancing, with GSEs paying up to $1,000. S. 170 and H.R. 363 focus on refinancing GSE loans with restrictions on fees and interest rates. S. 3085 aims to expand borrower eligibility for HARP, including those with more than 20% equity, and eliminating certain fees. S. 3085 aims to increase competition among servicers by streamlining the refinancing process for borrowers. The bill also penalizes junior lien holders and mortgage insurers for hindering eligible borrowers from refinancing. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and experts highlight imbalances in the housing market due to overbuilding, foreclosures, and a surplus of homes. Falling house prices can lead to a negative cycle of more foreclosures and further price declines. As of December 2011, financial institutions hold single-family REOs valued at $11.6 billion. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and FHA also hold a significant number of REO properties. Large banks slowed down foreclosure proceedings due to investigations into robo-signing allegations. The recent mortgage settlement may lead to an increase in foreclosures as the backlog reaches the market. Shadow inventory consists of approximately 1.5 million seriously delinquent borrowers. The shadow inventory consists of approximately 1.5 million seriously delinquent borrowers who are at risk of foreclosure. William Dudley of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimated a potential increase in REO properties to 1.8 million per year in 2012 and 2013. Suggestions include allowing financial institutions to rent or sell foreclosed homes to investors for rental purposes. Banks and GSEs have traditionally focused on quick sales of REO properties rather than extensive property management. Some proposals suggest renting foreclosed properties to help homeowners or stabilize neighborhoods and home prices. Supporters believe extending the time for renting REOs is justified due to housing market imbalances. Critics fear that renting homes may delay market recovery by flooding it with more properties in the future. The Federal Reserve outlined obstacles to implementing an REO-to-rental program in a housing white paper prepared for Congress. Regulators discourage financial institutions from holding REO properties, allowing temporary rental to maximize asset returns. Federal Reserve guidance clarifies rental expectations for regulated REO holders. Investors in REO programs need to buy properties in close proximity for profitability. Property management benefits from economies of scale. Investors benefit from economies of scale by developing relationships with local contractors and acquiring a critical mass of properties in a given area. The Federal Reserve suggests auctioning existing inventory and future REOs to investors for bulk transactions. However, bulk sales may result in lower recoveries compared to individual sales, but selling properties individually can lead to deterioration. Bulk investors may pay a premium for the convenience of purchasing a large quantity at once. Investors may need financing to amass a sufficient number of properties, but traditional lenders do not typically offer financing for bulk purchases of REO properties. Restrictions from entities like Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae limit the number of homes investors can finance. Limited accessible credit may restrict investor participation. Not all communities are suitable for a REO-to-rental program, with effectiveness in targeting communities with high REO properties and weak demand for individual purchases. This program aims to prevent foreclosed homes from flooding the market. The program aims to prevent foreclosed homes from flooding the market by shifting them to the rental market temporarily. Foreclosed homes negatively impact house prices by selling at a discount, increasing supply, and lowering home prices. Converting vacant REOs to rentals could increase house prices by 0.5% in the first year and 1% in the second year. The Federal Reserve white paper suggests transitioning REO properties to rentals in areas where prices are falling in the for-sale market but rising in the rental market. Two main policy proposals involve either banks renting properties themselves or selling them in bulk to investors for renting. The timing of eventual asset sales will impact institutions' balance sheets. The Federal Reserve white paper suggests transitioning REO properties to rentals in areas where prices are falling in the for-sale market but rising in the rental market. The direction of future house prices will significantly impact the price for which the properties are eventually sold. Supporters of policies that encourage institutions to rent for several years before selling are likely expecting future house prices to increase. Future asset prices are inherently unpredictable, and renting foreclosed homes does not reduce existing homeowners' payments or increase their. Renting foreclosed homes does not directly impact existing homeowners' payments or increase their disposable income. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) initiated the Real Estate-Owned (REO) Initiative in 2012, selling Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac REO properties to qualified investors who agree to rent the properties for a specified number of years. Most properties in the first transaction were single-family homes or condominiums. Most single-family homes and condominiums in the first transaction are already rented out, with fewer than 10% vacant. Some commentators are disappointed by the low vacancy rate, while others believe that starting with properties with existing tenants can attract more investors. It is unclear if FHFA will allow Fannie Mae to retain ownership stake in the properties or if they will be true sales. Financing options for investors and the method of selling the properties are also uncertain. Multiple proposals in the 112th Congress aim to establish REO rental programs, allowing foreclosed properties to be rented out to any renter or letting delinquent homeowners stay and pay rent. H.R. 2636 and S. 2080 temporarily authorize institutions to lease foreclosed properties for up to five years, with the goal of maximizing asset value by renting out homes before selling them. The Right to Rent Act of 2011 allows delinquent borrowers facing foreclosure to rent their home at fair market rent for up to five years. Eligibility criteria include having a mortgage originated before July 1, 2007, on a single-family property used as the borrower's principal residence for at least two years prior to foreclosure filing. The fair market rent will be determined by the court and adjusted annually."
