Congress finds that the United States Government increasingly relies on armed private security contractors for critical functions, with a significant number deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. In September 2009, photos were published showing security contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan engaging in lewd sexual hazing and harassment. The Department of State had previously expressed grave concerns about the company's performance on the contract. On July 7, 2011, Armor Group North America paid a $7.5 million settlement for submitting false claims on a State Department contract. The settlement resolved claims of AGNA guards violating the Trafficking Victims Protection Act by visiting brothels in Kabul with management's knowledge. Additionally, AGNA misrepresented the work experience of 38 third country nationals hired to guard the embassy. In 2010, a Senate investigation found EOD Technology, the company taking over protection of the Kabul Embassy, was suspected of hiring local warlords with possible Taliban ties. The EODT contract was terminated for default in March 2011. In 2011, the EODT contract was terminated for default. In May 2009, military trainers for Paravant LLC, a Blackwater affiliate, fired on a civilian vehicle in Kabul, killing one Afghan and wounding two others. In September 2007, individuals hired by Blackwater USA opened fire on Baghdad's Nisour Square, killing 17 Iraqis. In August 2010, XE Services, LLC (formerly Blackwater) settled with the State Department for $42 million for alleged violations of arms export laws. In 2007, the House of Representatives investigated Blackwater's employment practices, finding potential tax avoidance. Defense Secretary Gates expressed concerns about contractors' missions conflicting with larger goals in Iraq. In 2006, a Blackwater contractor, Andrew Moonen, shot and killed a guard in the Green Zone while drunk. He lost his job with Blackwater but was quickly hired by Combat Support Associates and sent to work in Kuwait. In 2004, four Blackwater contractors were killed in Fallujah, leading to a civil suit against the company which was eventually thrown out after nearly seven years in court due to the families being unable to pay court costs. XE Services, LLC, formerly known as Blackwater, was involved in these incidents. In 2010, former Blackwater employees, including the former president, were indicted on charges related to firearms violations. The Inspector General found that Blackwater misrepresented its small business status to secure $110 million in government contracts. Signed affidavits were filed in a civil lawsuit. In a civil lawsuit against Blackwater, signed affidavits allege that founder Erik Prince saw himself as a Christian crusader aiming to eliminate Muslims, deployed unfit men to Iraq, and used illegal ammunition. Additionally, a contractor from DynCorp shot and killed an unarmed taxi driver in 2007, while a report in the same year revealed that DynCorp billed the US for unauthorized work. The Department of State spent $1.2 billion on the DynCorp Contract for Iraqi Police Training without knowing what was received. Congress lacks access to information on security contracts and the number of armed private security contractors in combat zones. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
