Section 30515 of the Penal Code in California is amended to include specific criteria for defining an \"assault weapon,\" such as features like pistol grips, folding stocks, grenade launchers, and high-capacity magazines for rifles, as well as threaded barrels and second handgrips for pistols. The amended Penal Code in California defines an \"assault weapon\" based on specific features like pistol grips, folding stocks, grenade launchers, and high-capacity magazines for rifles. It also includes criteria such as threaded barrels, second handgrips, and detachable magazines for semiautomatic pistols and shotguns. The California Penal Code exempts pistols designed for Olympic target shooting from the definition of \"assault weapon.\" Pistols sanctioned by the International Olympic Committee and USA Shooting, used for Olympic target shooting before January 1, 2001, are exempt. Specific pistol models from manufacturers like Benelli and Hammerli are also exempt. The California Penal Code exempts specific pistol models used for Olympic target shooting from being classified as assault weapons. The Department of Justice will create a program to exempt new competitive pistol models based on recommendations from organizations like USA Shooting. Section 30680 of the Penal Code exempts individuals who lawfully possessed assault weapons before January 1, 2017, from certain restrictions if they register the weapon by January 1, 2018. Section 30900 of the Penal Code requires individuals who lawfully possessed assault weapons before specific dates to register the firearm by certain deadlines with the Department of Justice. Individuals who lawfully possessed assault weapons before specific dates must register the firearm by January 1, 2001, with the Department of Justice, providing unique identification details and owner information. The department may charge a registration fee of up to $20 per person to cover processing costs. Fees will increase annually based on the cost-of-living adjustment or Budget Act, not exceeding the department's reasonable costs. Fees collected will go into the Dealers\u2019 Record of Sale Special Account. Any person who lawfully possessed an assault weapon without a fixed magazine from 2001 to 2016 must register the firearm by January 1, 2018. Registration must be done electronically via a public-facing application provided by the department. The registration for an assault weapon without a fixed magazine from 2001 to 2016 must include unique firearm details, acquisition information, and personal details like name, address, and driver's license number. A fee of up to $15 per person can be charged for processing, to be paid by debit or credit card at the time of submission. The fee will go towards the Dealers\u2019 Record of Sale Special Account for this purpose. The department will adopt regulations exempt from the Administrative Procedure Act to implement the subdivision. No reimbursement is required by this act as it creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes penalties."
