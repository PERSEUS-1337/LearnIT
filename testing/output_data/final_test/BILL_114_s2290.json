It focuses on supporting children's growth in various areas such as language, literacy, mathematics, science, and creative arts. In this subchapter, a delegate agency is defined as an organization responsible for administering funds, an eligible entity is the recipient of a subgrant, and financial assistance includes grants, agreements, or contracts with payment adjustments. The term 'grant recipient' refers to the recipient of a grant under section 639(a), while 'Indian tribe' includes any organized group of Indians eligible for special programs. 'Local educational agency' is defined as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The term 'low-income child' refers to a child aged 5 or younger from a family with income below 100% of the poverty line. The 'poverty line' is the official line adjusted for inflation and family size. The term 'Secretary' refers to the Secretary of Education. The term 'Secretary' in this context refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The term 'State' includes various regions such as States, territories, and Commonwealths, with specific exceptions. \"Authorization of appropriations for $8,598,000,000 annually from 2016 to 2020 for carrying out this subchapter. Block grants provided to eligible States and Indian tribes.\" Beginning in the fiscal year following the enactment of the Head Start Improvement Act of 2015, grants will be awarded to eligible States and Indian tribes based on the number of children under 5 from low-income families. The Secretary will allot funds proportionally to states and tribes based on this criteria. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a State or Indian tribe must submit an application to the Secretary with the number of low-income children. The grant funds must be used for prekindergarten education programs and program administration. The grant recipient must certify that funds will be used for education services for low-income children and families, and award subgrants to eligible entities for program implementation. The grant recipient can provide prekindergarten education programs, establish rules and standards for subgrantees, and monitor compliance. Grant funds can be used flexibly for prekindergarten education providers or a voucher system for low-income parents. The portable voucher system allows low-income parents to use grant funds to pay for private prekindergarten education. Members of Indian tribes can choose to receive services from eligible entities. Grant recipients must provide matching funds from non-Federal sources. Eligible entities receiving subgrants for programs under this subchapter have limits on administrative costs. Subgrants for programs under this subchapter must allocate over 15 percent of funds for program administrative costs. SEC. 640 of this subchapter does not mandate grant recipients to establish publicly funded early childhood education programs or require children to participate in them. Participation in such programs or screenings is not mandatory, except as specified under certain sections of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. SEC. 641 focuses on setting goals and monitoring progress. Grant recipients must conduct self-assessments annually to evaluate program effectiveness in serving low-income children. They are required to publish online reports with improvement plans based on the self-assessment findings. Additionally, ongoing monitoring processes must be established by each grant recipient. Each grant recipient must establish ongoing monitoring procedures to ensure program operations align with program goals. \"SEC. 642. ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS.\" Each grant recipient must publish an annual online report disclosing the total funds received, budget details, number of children and families served, self-assessment results, and parent involvement activities. The grant recipient must report on parent involvement activities and efforts to prepare children for kindergarten in their annual online report. Each recipient of financial assistance must keep records disclosing the amount and use of the funds, total program cost, and contributions from other sources. The Comptroller General will conduct a study on state and tribal approaches in implementing the program, based on online reports from grant recipients. A report on the study results will be submitted to Congress by October 1 of the fourth fiscal year after enactment. Nondiscrimination provisions are also outlined. The nondiscrimination provisions in the grant or contract for financial assistance under this subchapter prohibit discrimination based on race, creed, color, national origin, sex, political affiliation, beliefs, or disability. Restrictions on political activities for programs assisted under this subchapter include prohibiting partisan or nonpartisan political activity, providing transportation to the polls, and promoting or deterring union organization. Additionally, no funds under this subchapter can be used for voter registration activities. The subchapter prohibits the use of Head Start facilities during operation hours by nonpartisan organizations to increase voter registration for Federal elections. The subchapter allows for advance funding to provide notice of available funds. It also prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services from mandating curriculum selection for Head Start programs. The amendment made by this Act will be effective starting on October 1 of the fiscal year following the enactment of the Improvement Act of 2015."
