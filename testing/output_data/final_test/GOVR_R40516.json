Competition promotes accountability in government contracts by ensuring merit-based agreements and preventing favoritism. However, some argue that not all procurements need to be competitively bid, as it can cause delays in agency operations. The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 requires full and open competition in government contracts to prevent delays in agency operations. However, there is a point where the costs of soliciting and evaluating offers outweigh the savings from competition, leading to a diminishing return on investment. The federal government's requirements for competition in contracting have periodically shifted to realize the benefits of competition or other goals. This could increase the risk of new contractors winning government contracts without experience, leading to potential performance issues. Armed conflicts often relax competition requirements but may result in alleged abuses like \"war profiteering.\" The current interest in competition in contracting is driven by alleged abuses like \"war profiteering\" and waste of money on overpriced goods and services. The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 has amended the foundation of competition requirements to include efficiency in agency operations and the use of \"special simplified methods\" for contracting commercial items. The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) of 1994 established a preference for procuring commercial items using simplified methods. This was followed by the Federal Acquisition Reform Act (FARA) of 1996, which emphasized efficiency in agency operations. FARA and the Services Acquisition Reform Act (SARA) of 2003 relaxed rules for agencies acquiring commercial items. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA) of 2008 allowed the Secretary of the Treasury to use non-competitive methods in urgent circumstances. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 allowed the Treasury Department to use non-competitive methods in urgent circumstances, ensuring that competition requirements did not slow contracting for services to stabilize U.S. financial markets. Non-procurement contracts, like those from other transaction authority, are not subject to competition provisions under CICA. Certain agencies, such as the Departments of Defense, Transportation, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, and Energy, have been granted Other Transaction Authority (OTA) to contract for research and development (R&D) or prototypes of new technologies without full and open competition requirements. OTA helps avoid difficulties in contracting for R&D or prototypes, as uncertainties in new technology development make it hard to establish contract prices. Companies best suited for these contracts may not be regular government vendors and may not comply with government procurement regulations. OTA contracts are not subject to full and open competition requirements under CICA. Competition under CICA involves procurement contracts authorized by statute, allowing agencies to use specific procedures or limit competition. For example, the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2005 permitted USAID to place task orders with small businesses without full competition. Other provisions allow agencies to limit competition to certain groups or entities, or enter contracts without competition, such as the Bureau of Land Management for hazardous fuel reduction activities. Under CICA, procurement contracts authorized by statute allow agencies to use specific procedures or limit competition. For example, the National Gallery of Art may contract for restoration and repair without competition, while the Bureau of Land Management can contract for hazardous fuel reduction activities with specified groups or entities. CICA mandates \"full and open competition\" unless certain circumstances permit noncompetitive procedures. A \"responsible source\" is a prospective contractor with adequate financial resources, ability to comply with schedules, and satisfactory performance. Under CICA, agencies must ensure that contractors meet specific criteria to be considered a \"responsible source\" for procurement contracts. This includes having a satisfactory performance record, integrity, necessary skills and resources, and eligibility under applicable laws. Competitive procedures like sealed bids are used to achieve full and open competition, with contracts awarded to the lowest-priced responsible bidder. Under CICA, agencies must ensure that contractors meet specific criteria to be considered a \"responsible source\" for procurement contracts. This includes having a satisfactory performance record, integrity, necessary skills and resources, and eligibility under applicable laws. Competitive procedures like sealed bids are used to achieve full and open competition, with contracts awarded to the lowest-priced responsible bidder. Competitive proposals are used when sealed bids are not appropriate, allowing for negotiation between the government and offerors within the competitive range to determine the best value for the government. The government ensures contractors meet specific criteria to be considered a \"responsible source\" for procurement contracts under CICA. Competitive procedures like sealed bids are used for full and open competition, with contracts awarded to the lowest-priced responsible bidder. Other competitive procedures include two-step sealed bidding, procurement of architectural or engineering services under the Brooks Act, and competitive selection of basic research proposals. Procedures for procurement contracts under CICA include general solicitation, peer review, and GSA multiple awards schedule program. Set-asides for small businesses are competitive as long as all responsible businesses can compete. Agencies can use Federal Supply Schedules for procurement. The seventh provision of CICA allows agencies to use Federal Supply Schedules for simplified procurement processes and authorizes set-asides for small businesses, ensuring full and open competition. Dual sourcing and set-asides are common practices in defense agencies. The defense agencies have a history of dual sourcing contracts to avoid reliance on individual companies. CICA allows agencies to exclude a particular source to establish alternative sources, increasing competition and reducing costs. This practice is common in defense agencies to ensure national defense interests. The government may require a facility or supplier for national defense purposes, ensure a reliable supply source, meet high demand, or address critical needs like medical supplies. Dual sourcing is sometimes mandated by Congress, especially for the Department of Defense, to promote competition in future procurements. The government may require facilities or suppliers for national defense, ensure a reliable supply source, meet high demand, or address critical needs like medical supplies. Congress mandates dual sourcing, especially for the Department of Defense, to promote competition in future procurements. The Small Business Act allows for set-asides for small businesses, including women-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, HUBZone small businesses, and socially and economically disadvantaged individuals participating in the Business Development Program under Section 8(a) of the act. Set-asides can also be made for local firms during major disasters or emergencies under the authority of the Stafford Act. The Stafford Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a75150) allows for noncompetitive procurement contracts under certain circumstances outlined in CICA. These circumstances include single source availability, unusual and compelling urgency, and other specific situations where competitive procedures are not required. The Stafford Act allows for noncompetitive procurement contracts under specific circumstances outlined in CICA, such as single source availability, unusual urgency, and other situations where competitive procedures are not required. Additionally, contracts may be awarded to maintain the industrial base or meet requirements of international agreements. The Stafford Act allows for noncompetitive procurement contracts under specific circumstances outlined in CICA, such as single source availability, unusual urgency, and other situations where competitive procedures are not required. Exceptions include statutory authorization, brand-name items for resale, national security, and public interest. The Stafford Act allows for noncompetitive procurement contracts under specific circumstances outlined in CICA, such as single source availability, unusual urgency, and other situations where competitive procedures are not required. Exceptions include statutory authorization, brand-name items for resale, national security, and public interest. Sole-source awards can be used when there is a single responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, helping agencies efficiently meet their needs when competition is not possible. The exceptions to competitive contracting under CICA cover various scenarios like follow-on contracts, contingency situations, dual sourcing, and mandatory purchases from specific agencies. These exceptions do not give agencies unlimited discretion in contracting, as other CICA provisions impose conditions on using non-competitive procedures. The exceptions to competitive contracting under CICA impose conditions on using non-competitive procedures, such as justifying and obtaining approval for their use. Other conditions include barring poor agency planning for unusual urgency, prohibiting delegation of authority, and requiring offers from multiple sources when relying on exceptions. The Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) imposes conditions on non-competitive procedures, requiring justifications and approvals for their use. Contracting officers must justify and certify in writing the need for non-competitive procedures, with approvals from higher-ranking officials. The Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) requires written justifications and approvals for non-competitive procedures, except in specific circumstances such as unusual urgency or certain authorized purchases. Justifications can be omitted in cases where competitive procedures are not feasible or for specific types of procurement. The purchase of brand-name items for resale in commissaries or similar facilities requires agency heads to document the circumstances in writing and notify Congress. Justifications must include agency needs, statutory exceptions, fair cost determination, and market survey details. The agency must document any market survey conducted or reasons for not conducting one, list sources expressing interest, and outline actions to promote competition. Justifications for noncompetitive awards must be posted on FedBizOpps within 14 days of contract award, as required by CICA. Agencies must also publish notices on FedBizOpps before awarding certain noncompetitive contracts. CICA allows for noncompetitive contract awards in certain circumstances, including \"special simplified procedures\" for small purchases. A small purchase is defined as below the simplified acquisition threshold, currently around $150,000. Agencies have had authority to use simplified acquisition since 1996. Since 1996, agencies have been authorized to use simplified acquisition procedures for purchasing commercial items exceeding the threshold but below $6.5 million (or $12 million for certain operations). This authority can be used when contracting officers expect offers to include only commercial items based on market research. CICA prohibits splitting purchases to exploit simplified procedures and requires promoting competition to the maximum extent possible. Under the FAR, purchases below the simplified acquisition threshold ($150,000) are further divided into micropurchases (below $3,000) and those above it. Micropurchases require promoting competition among qualified suppliers to the extent practicable. Agencies can make micropurchases without competitive quotations if the price is considered reasonable. When purchases are above the micropurchase threshold but below the simplified acquisition threshold, agencies must use simplified acquisition procedures to the maximum extent practicable. These purchases are reserved exclusively for small businesses, promoting competition under CICA. Agencies must consider solicitation of at least three sources, two of which were not included in the previous solicitation, to obtain supplies and services from the most advantageous source. Contracting officers are prohibited from soliciting quotations based on personal preferences. Contracting officers are prohibited from soliciting quotations based on personal preferences or restricting solicitations to suppliers of well-known brands. Sole-source solicitations for purchases below the simplified acquisition threshold are permissible only under specific circumstances, such as urgency or exclusive licensing agreements. For purchases of commercial items exceeding the threshold, written justification and approval are required, along with notice at FedBizOpps. Effective competition in government procurement involves more than just personal preferences. CICA promotes competition in government procurement by requiring agencies to use full and open competition in soliciting bids, conduct advanced procurement planning and market research, and develop specifications to achieve full and open competition. Specifications must not be restrictive and can be based on function, performance, or design requirements. CICA requires agencies to evaluate bids and proposals based on specified factors to ensure fair competition and prevent favoritism in awarding contracts. CICA requires agency competition advocates to promote full and open competition in procurement activities. Agencies must publish procurement notices for contracts exceeding $25,000. CICA requires agencies to publish procurement notices for contracts exceeding $25,000, promoting competition by providing ample notice and preparation time for offerors. FASA supplements CICA by specifying competition requirements for task order and delivery order contracts. TO/DO contracts, also known as indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts, allow for the issuance of orders for supplies without specifying delivery time or quantity. These contracts can be single-award or multiple-award, with single-award contracts awarded competitively under FASA regulations. FASA regulations require agencies to follow CICA when awarding TO/DO contracts, allowing exceptions only with proper justifications. FASA also promotes multiple-award contracts over single-award ones and mandates fair consideration for contractors when issuing orders over $3,000, unless specific circumstances apply. FASA regulations require agencies to follow CICA when awarding TO/DO contracts, allowing exceptions only with proper justifications. FASA also promotes multiple-award contracts over single-award ones and mandates fair consideration for contractors when issuing orders over $3,000, unless specific circumstances apply. The issuance of task or delivery orders under TO/DO contracts is not subject to CICA, and agencies must designate a \"task and delivery order ombudsman\" to review contractors' complaints and ensure fair opportunity for all contractors holding multiple-award TO/DO contracts. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2008 (NDAA '08) strengthens competition requirements for TO/DO contracts established by FASA, limiting agencies' ability to use single-award TO/DO contracts over $103 million without specific determinations in writing. The NDAA '08 strengthens competition requirements for TO/DO contracts, limiting single-award contracts over $103 million without specific determinations. Fair opportunity for contractors includes clear requirements, proposal time, factors for evaluation, and a written statement. The NDAA '08 granted GAO exclusive authority to hear protests alleging improprieties in agencies' award of task and delivery orders valued over $10 million. Congress extended GAO's jurisdiction over protests of \"large\" orders under defense contracts. The NDAA '08 granted GAO exclusive authority to hear protests alleging improprieties in agencies' award of task and delivery orders valued over $10 million, extending jurisdiction over similar orders under civilian contracts through September 30, 2016."
