These programs have shown significant academic benefits in language, literacy, and mathematics. The PRIDE Act authorizes the Secretary to conduct a project enhancing biliteracy, bilingualism, and multicultural skills for children in impoverished communities through dual language programs from preschool to fifth grade. The Secretary can award grants to fund partnerships for effective strategies in ensuring academic success for low-income minority students. The PRIDE Act aims to enhance biliteracy, bilingualism, and multicultural skills for low-income minority students through a high-quality dual language program. This program serves economically disadvantaged minority and limited-English-proficient students from preschool to fifth grade, with a focus on rigorous assessment, curriculum alignment, and the development of bilingual, biliterate, and multicultural competencies. The PRIDE Act focuses on enhancing bilingualism and biliteracy for low-income minority students through a dual language program for students up to grade five. The program emphasizes student-centered instructional methods, professional development for educators, staff recruitment and training, and building positive relationships with students' families and the community. The Secretary reserves up to 5% of funds for technical assistance, evaluation, and dissemination of best practices. Grants awarded under this section last up to five years. Eligible entities must submit applications with required documentation for proposed programs. The program must partner with an expert entity for technical assistance and evaluation, have qualified personnel, and serve economically disadvantaged and limited-English-proficient students. The application must include data showing the program serves these students. The program must align assessment and instruction language, evaluate goals, inform instruction improvements, and support student readiness and academic progress through grade five. The program focuses on dual language development through grade five, designing culturally and linguistically appropriate curriculum, teacher training, and parent outreach.

Technical assistance and evaluation are provided to strengthen programs conducted by grantees.
