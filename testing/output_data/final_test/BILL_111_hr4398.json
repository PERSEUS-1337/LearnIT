    "content": "The National Forest Insect and Disease Emergency Act of 2009 includes provisions for emergency designation areas, response protocols, collaboration with Colorado, stewardship contracting, and protection of private property rights. The Act is cited as the \"National Forest Insect and Disease Emergency Act of 2009\" and outlines various purposes. The National Forest Insect and Disease Emergency Act of 2009 aims to mitigate hazards from bark beetles and insects, allocate resources for emergency areas, and provide good-neighbor authority in Colorado. It also defines key terms for implementation. The Act defines key terms such as \"affected State,\" \"insect and disease emergency area,\" and \"insect and disease infestation emergency\" for National Forest System land. The Act defines terms like \"insect and disease infestation emergency\" as a situation where insect or disease infestation increases the risk of wildland fires or threatens infrastructure. The National Forest System is defined as per the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, and the Secretary refers to the Secretary of Agriculture. SEC. 4. DESIGNATION OF INSECT AND DISEASE EMERGENCY AREAS. Designation by Map. An insect and disease emergency area is designated on the map entitled \"Insect Emergency Areas.\" The Secretary will file the map and legal descriptions with relevant Senate and House committees. The map and legal descriptions have the force of law. The Secretary may designate National Forest System land as an insect and disease emergency area if located in an affected State and subject to an infestation emergency. The map and legal descriptions filed have the same force as if included in the Act and are available for public inspection. The Secretary can designate National Forest System land as an insect and disease emergency area in response to a request by the Governor of an affected State. The Secretary must accept or deny the request within 90 days, or it will be deemed denied. The Secretary must provide an explanation if a request for designation as an insect and disease emergency area is denied. Delegation of authority is limited to the Regional Forester. The Secretary must publish a notice of the designation in the Federal Register. The designation of an insect and disease emergency area under this section does not constitute a major Federal action under NEPA. Subsequent major Federal actions taken as a result of the designation are subject to NEPA. The designation shall not be subject to certain Forest Service decision-making laws. An insect and disease emergency area designated under Law 102-381 excludes certain lands like wilderness areas or those with vegetation removal restrictions. The designation lasts for 10 years from the enactment of the Act. The Secretary can designate an insect and disease emergency area on National Forest System land for up to 10 years, or earlier if the infestation emergency ends. The Secretary can redesignate an insect and disease emergency area on National Forest System land if the infestation emergency continues after the initial 10-year period. SEC. 5. RESPONSE TO EMERGENCY DESIGNATION. Priority Treatments in managing insect and disease emergency areas include removing hazardous fuels and trees posing risks to communities, infrastructure, and restoring land health. Assistance is provided to governments and landowners for fuel removal and land restoration. The text chunk discusses the priority given to restoring the health of land in insect and disease emergency areas, with a focus on biomass use and emergency forest restoration. In response to insect and disease emergencies in forest areas, the Secretary may provide payments to private landowners for emergency measures. Biomass removed from affected areas is considered renewable for fuel standards. The Secretary has the authority to apply requirements from the Healthy Forests Restoration Act to promote healthy forest restoration. The Forests Restoration Act of 2003 allows projects to remove hazardous fuels and trees in National Forest System land in insect and disease emergency areas. Judicial review applies to these projects. The Forests Restoration Act of 2003 allows projects to remove hazardous fuels and trees in National Forest System land in insect and disease emergency areas. Judicial review applies to these projects. Good neighbor relationship with the State of Colorado is emphasized in Section 6. The Secretary may contract with the State of Colorado for watershed restoration services on National Forest System land if the State is also working on adjacent State or private land. Services include treating insect-infested trees. The Secretary may contract with the State of Colorado for watershed restoration services on National Forest System land, including treating insect-infested trees, reducing hazardous fuels, and improving fish and wildlife habitat across ownership boundaries. Administrative provisions exempt certain sections of the National Forest Management Act of 1976 and hold the State liable for actions of its employees under the contract. The State may enter into subcontracts for restoration services under a contract. Disputes will be resolved according to specified procedures. Responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 are retained. The Policy Act of 1969 prohibits delegation of decisions under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to State officers or employees for watershed restoration on National Forest System land in Colorado. The Secretary of the Interior may carry out activities on public land in Colorado administered by the Bureau of Land Management. SEC. 7. STEWARDSHIP CONTRACTING. Section 347 of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999 is amended to remove the limitation on obligation for canceling a Forest Service multiyear stewardship contract. The Forest Service can cover the costs of canceling a multiyear stewardship contract from available appropriations. If funds are depleted, it won't violate financial regulations, and the Secretary of Agriculture can request additional funding. SEC. 8. PROTECTION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS. This Act does not diminish the rights of any private property owner."
