    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Juvenile Corrections Act of 1995\" and provides grants for violent and chronic juvenile facilities. The \"Juvenile Corrections Act of 1995\" allows the Administrator to grant funds to States and local governments for secure facilities and programs for violent juvenile offenders. Applications for grants must include plans for educational, vocational training, and substance abuse treatment for juvenile offenders. The \"Juvenile Corrections Act of 1995\" grants funds for secure facilities and programs for juvenile offenders, with a focus on post-release supervision and services. States and local governments must allocate a minimum percentage of the total grant amount for these programs. The \"Juvenile Corrections Act of 1995\" requires funded facilities to have evaluation components with outcome measures to assess program effectiveness in reducing recidivism. The Administrator will conduct periodic reviews and reports. The Administrator will review grant recipient performance, require reports on evaluations and data, provide technical assistance and training to achieve section purposes, and define the term \"Administrator.\" The term \"Administrator\" refers to the head of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Programs. A \"qualifying State\" is one that has submitted a grant application meeting specific requirements. The term \"State\" includes various regions. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 1996-1999 is specified. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 1999 and 2000 is set at $200,000,000 and $207,000,000 respectively. The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 is amended to reduce authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 1996 to 2000. Additionally, a report on accountability and performance measures in juvenile corrections programs is required. The Administrator must submit a report to Congress within 6 months of this Act's enactment, in consultation with relevant organizations, on using performance-based criteria to evaluate juvenile corrections facilities and programs. The report will cover various performance measures, including recidivism rates, and explore the feasibility of tying Federal funding to meeting these criteria. The report to Congress, due within 6 months of the Act's enactment, will assess the feasibility of using performance-based criteria to evaluate juvenile corrections programs. It will examine data collection, cost, and the potential for a Federal matching mechanism based on program performance."
