    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Championing Apprenticeships for New Careers and Employees in Technology Act\" or the \"CHANCE in TECH Act.\" Congressional findings are also included in the Act. Congress finds that there are over 500,000 IT job openings in the US every 90 days, with the technology sector growing twice as fast as overall employment. These jobs offer higher pay, better benefits, and more resilience to economic downturns. IT skills are transferable across industries, and there are effective education and training programs that should be expanded to meet workforce demands. Employer-driven models like ApprenticeshipUSA should be adopted. In the technology sector, models like ApprenticeshipUSA aim to grow the workforce. Career pathway education should align with employer needs starting in high school. Preparing students for tech jobs is crucial for US economic competitiveness. Around 800,000 IT workers will retire by 2024. In 2016, the average IT sector salary was $108,000, significantly higher than other sectors. SEC. 3. TECHNOLOGY APPRENTICESHIP CONTRACTS. The Secretary of Labor will contract industry intermediaries to promote technology apprenticeships. Intermediaries must submit applications outlining activities to support this goal. Contracts will be awarded based on competitive criteria, and funds can only be used for approved activities. The Secretary of Labor will contract industry intermediaries to promote technology apprenticeships, including facilitating apprenticeships in the technology sector through collaborations with public and private entities, encouraging entities to establish apprenticeships, and identifying, assessing, and training applicants for such apprenticeships. The Secretary of Labor will contract industry intermediaries to promote technology apprenticeships, including facilitating apprenticeships in the technology sector through collaborations with public and private entities, encouraging entities to establish apprenticeships, and identifying, assessing, and training applicants for such apprenticeships. Additionally, funds are authorized for tracking the progress of applicants enrolled in apprenticeship training initiatives. SEC. 4. CHANCE IN TECH AWARDS FOR 21ST CENTURY SCHOOLS. The Secretary of Education may issue \"CHANCE in TECH Awards for 21st Century Schools\" to secondary schools or junior/community colleges showing high achievement in providing students with skills for the 21st century workforce. Criteria for selection include the availability of STEM, career/technical education, and computer technology courses, as well as student performance in STEM subjects on State academic assessments. The curr_chunk discusses the evaluation criteria for schools to receive \"CHANCE in TECH Awards for 21st Century Schools\", including student performance in STEM subjects, coordination with technology sector employers for work-based learning programs, and individualized plans for postsecondary education and career paths. SEC. 5. FUNDING. Amounts from the Department of Labor Appropriations Act, 2017 can be used for this Act in fiscal year 2017. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal year 2018 and beyond. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, key definitions include apprenticeship, career and technical education, early college high school, and high school as defined in relevant education acts. The Education Act of 1965 defines an industry intermediary as an entity that accelerates apprenticeship program development by connecting employers with partners like industry partners, the Department of Labor, and state workforce development agencies. Industry intermediaries also work to identify workforce trends and secure funding for new apprenticeship programs. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of an entity eligible to participate in apprenticeship programs, including businesses, consortiums, business-related nonprofits, workforce intermediaries, and consortiums of these entities. The curr_chunk provides definitions for key terms related to education, such as institution of higher education, junior or community college, local educational agency, secondary school, and State educational agency. These definitions are based on specific sections of relevant education acts. The curr_chunk defines \"STEM\" as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, and \"technology sector\" as the industry involved in hardware, software, or digital data security."
