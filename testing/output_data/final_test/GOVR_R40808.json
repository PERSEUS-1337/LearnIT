    "content": "Gasoline taxes can impact the national economy and consumer decisions. High taxes can reduce consumption, addressing environmental and security concerns. However, they may also slow economic activity but could lower the trade deficit by reducing oil imports. In the US, federal gasoline tax revenues fund highway projects, creating jobs and improving infrastructure. A well-designed tax can stabilize gasoline prices, encouraging fuel-efficient vehicle purchases and supporting mass transit. Despite being unpopular with consumers, increasing the tax is believed to be beneficial. The federal gasoline tax is unpopular with consumers, but increasing it could generate opposition. The tax is relatively low, only about 5% of the average price per gallon. It raises revenue for highway construction and maintenance, tied to automobile and gasoline use. Despite many failed attempts to increase it since the 1970s, the tax has gradually increased to the current rate of 18.4 cents per gallon. The federal gasoline tax, collected at the refinery, is passed on to consumers and included in the pump price. This report analyzes the effects of the tax, evaluates the incentive structure of a higher gasoline tax, and examines a variable gasoline tax. Excise taxes are sales taxes on specific goods, set as a percent of the value or a set dollar value per unit. They have been used for revenue and deficit reduction, with some aimed at discouraging consumption. The federal government imposes an excise tax on gasoline, currently at 18.4 cents per gallon, with most of it going to the Highway Trust Fund. This tax was first enacted in 1932 and has since become a permanent source of revenue. Excise taxes on gasoline at the retail level can range from approximately 40 to over 50 cents per gallon. The federal gasoline tax ranges from approximately 40 to over 50 cents per gallon, with state and local taxes added. The tax is seen as a user charge for services like highway projects, easing opposition. Interest in using the gasoline tax as a policy instrument expanded after the oil embargo of 1973-1974. During the Ford and Carter Administrations, there were proposals to increase gasoline taxes to fund alternative energy sources and reduce oil consumption. However, these proposals were not successfully passed into law by Congress. In 1982, the Reagan Administration also proposed a gasoline tax increase. In 1982, the Reagan Administration proposed a federal gasoline tax increase to improve highways, create jobs, and raise the tax from 4 to 9 cents per gallon. The tax increase was signed into law in 1983. Another increase was included in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 for deficit reduction, which President George H. W. Bush initially opposed but later supported and signed into law. President Bill Clinton initially supported a broad-based energy tax rather than a gasoline tax, proposing a tax on the energy content of fuels. However, this proposal failed to gain support in Congress. As an alternative, an increase in the gasoline tax to 18.4 cents per gallon was passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton in December 1993. The revenue from the tax increase was allocated to deficit reduction. President George W. Bush's Administration did not propose any increase in the gasoline tax. The Obama Administration opposed increasing the gasoline tax during the recession but supported policy objectives like greenhouse gas reduction and energy security. Tax provisions related to Highway Trust Fund financing were set to expire in September 2011. The reduced tax rates on certain fuels and heavy highway vehicles, along with the expiration of LUST Trust Fund financing rates, are set to expire. Taxes are essential for government funding but reduce taxpayers' purchasing power. The government uses tax revenue to provide public goods and services, although disagreements on the proper mix and level of services make taxes non-voluntary. Taxes are necessary for government funding and are collected through the force of law. They can impact consumer decisions and have various economic effects. The economic burden of an excise tax on gasoline is typically passed on to consumers due to low elasticity of demand. Gasoline demand is not highly elastic in the short run, with studies suggesting it is low or near zero. Gasoline taxes can lead to excess burden, shifting consumer choices. If the social cost of gasoline is higher than its private cost, taxes may be designed to discourage its use. In a market with gasoline consumption, social costs like national security and environmental issues can raise the total cost above private costs, leading to potential over-consumption. Market imperfections, such as market power from large firms, OPEC, and national oil companies, make it challenging to determine if actual consumption is efficient or not. The level of tax on gasoline must be determined to encourage the use of alternative fuels and reduce petroleum imports. A large tax may be necessary to reduce consumption if demand elasticity is low. Increasing the federal excise tax on gasoline could impact consumer purchasing power and macroeconomic activity, but revenue could be returned to consumers through tax reductions. The tax revenue raised could be returned to consumers through reductions in other taxes, especially if the goal is to reduce gasoline consumption. Gasoline demand in the US is influenced by price and consumer income, with low price elasticity indicating it is viewed as a necessity. Commodities with low price elasticity of demand are subject to price volatility when market quantities vary. Income elasticity measures consumer demand responsiveness to income changes. Price and income elasticity can interact, affecting the effectiveness of a gasoline tax in generating government revenue or reducing consumption. The effectiveness of a gasoline tax lies in its ability to generate government revenue and reduce gasoline consumption in line with economic goals. Despite rising prices, U.S. gasoline consumption increased from 2000 to 2007 due to factors like income growth. However, demand started to decline in 2007, coinciding with the recession, and continued to decrease through 2011 due to high prices and economic concerns. The current federal gasoline tax of 18.4 cents per gallon is not functioning effectively in terms of raising revenues, reducing consumption, or providing consistent incentives. Despite generating over $30 billion in revenue in FY2008, the Highway Trust Fund, heavily reliant on fuel excise taxes, has been financially unstable. The federal gasoline tax is not effectively reducing consumption or providing incentives for fuel-efficient vehicles. It does little to influence consumer behavior due to its fixed amount per gallon and small relative cost. This leads to consumers buying the \"wrong type\" of vehicle based on fluctuating gasoline prices. Consumers' shifting automobile preferences due to high gasoline prices have impacted the auto industry, leading to instability. To address uncertainties in the market, a variable gasoline tax could be implemented to discourage gasoline consumption and promote fuel-efficient vehicles. A variable gasoline tax could target a specific price to control consumption and revenue. The tax would adjust based on oil price changes, providing a constant incentive for consumers to choose fuel-efficient vehicles and alternative fuels. This tax influences consumer behavior through the substitution effect and income effect, reducing gasoline consumption. A variable gasoline tax can influence consumer behavior through the substitution effect and income effect, reducing gasoline consumption. The tax could stimulate demand for fuel-efficient vehicles, alternative energy sources, and decrease U.S. oil imports and greenhouse gas emissions. The high gasoline taxes in Europe incentivize consumers to buy smaller cars, drive less, and switch to diesel fuel for better fuel economy. This has led to reduced greenhouse gas emissions and lower dependence on unstable global supplies. In contrast, U.S consumers enjoy lower taxes on gasoline, resulting in higher retail prices in other industrialized nations. The high gasoline taxes in Europe incentivize consumers to buy smaller cars, drive less, and switch to diesel fuel for better fuel economy. This has led to reduced greenhouse gas emissions and lower dependence on unstable global supplies. In contrast, the U.S. gasoline tax could generate significant revenue, potentially impacting the economy, but this could be mitigated by recycling the revenue into infrastructure or alternative energy projects, or returning it to taxpayers through income tax rebates or reductions. The U.S. gasoline tax could generate revenue for the Highway Trust Fund, mass transit infrastructure, alternative energy research, and deficit reduction. The petroleum refining industry saw high profits from 2004-2007 due to increased demand and favorable price spreads. The petroleum refining industry has seen changes since 2007, with weak product demand leading to lower capacity utilization rates, refinery closures, and reduced profitability. Reduced gasoline demand, economic recession, high prices, and competition from alternative fuels have contributed to this decline. Additional economic pressure could be created by a gasoline tax reducing demand further. The Obama Administration is considering a gasoline tax increase to reduce carbon emissions, decrease dependence on imported oil, and promote alternative energy sources. This tax could provide stable funding for the Highway Trust Fund and help achieve these goals. The refining industry may face more challenges with lower capacity utilization rates and potential plant closures due to the tax. A gasoline tax increase is being considered by the Obama Administration to reduce carbon emissions and promote alternative energy sources, but it may be unpopular with consumers and could drain purchasing power from a weakened economy."
