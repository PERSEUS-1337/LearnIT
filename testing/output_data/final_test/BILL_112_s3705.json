Congress finds that deaths from child abuse and neglect are preventable and significantly underreported, with no national standard for reporting. In fiscal year 2011, 1,545 children in the United States died from child abuse and neglect, with experts believing the actual number to be higher. Over 42% of these children were under the age of 1, and almost 82% were under the age of 4. In the same year, 70% of the children who died suffered neglect, and 48% suffered physical abuse. In recent years, Congress has taken steps to reduce child fatalities from abuse and neglect by providing states with flexibility to operate child welfare projects focused on prevention and ensuring children's safety in their homes. Funding has also been provided for services to address abuse and neglect. The Services Improvement Act of 2006, Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008, and Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act of 2011 provide funding and requirements for enhancing child safety, supporting parents with substance abuse issues, and improving data collection on child abuse and neglect fatalities.
