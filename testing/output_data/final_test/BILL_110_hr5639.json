    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans Act of 2008\" and establishes physical activity guidelines. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must publish a report every 5 years titled \"Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans\" based on current scientific and medical knowledge. Federal agencies must promote these guidelines in their health programs. Federal agencies must submit physical activity guidance for review by the Secretary to ensure consistency with the \"Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans\" or valid new scientific knowledge. If not disapproved after a 60-day review, the guidance can be issued by the agency. The Secretary must review physical activity guidance from federal agencies for consistency with the \"Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.\" If the guidance is found to be inconsistent, the agency must follow specific procedures before final dissemination. If disapproved, the agency must publish a notice in the Federal Register. The Secretary reviews physical activity guidance from federal agencies for consistency with the \"Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.\" If found inconsistent, specific procedures must be followed before final dissemination, including a 30-day public comment period and review of comments received. The final physical activity guidance must address significant comments and be announced in the Federal Register before dissemination. If the Secretary disapproves a proposed guidance, it cannot be issued. If a proposed physical activity guidance is disapproved by the Secretary, the Federal agency can request a review within 15 days. If the Secretary approves the guidance after review, it can be issued by the agency. The term \"physical activity guidance for the general population\" excludes any federal agency rules. \"Identified population subgroups\" include groups based on factors like age, sex, race, or physical disability. This section does not limit scientific or medical research, findings, or information exchange by federal agencies."
