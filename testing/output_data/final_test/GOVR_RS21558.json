    "content": "The United States, Argentina, and Brazil dominate the global soybean market, producing and trading the majority of soybeans worldwide. Controversy surrounds the pirated use of Roundup Ready (RR) soybeans in Argentina and Brazil, violating intellectual property rights and giving these countries a competitive edge in exports. Roundup Ready (RR) soybeans, developed by Monsanto, are genetically engineered to resist glyphosate herbicide. Monsanto holds the patent for RR soybeans in the United States, licensing the technology to seed companies who sell the GE seeds to farmers. The patent allows for control over pricing and product use, with farmers paying a technology fee and being prohibited from saving seeds for future planting. Despite the cost and restrictions, RR soybeans are preferred over traditional varieties. RR soybeans are favored over traditional varieties due to lower production costs, increased yields, and more flexibility in crop management. 80% of soybeans planted in the US in 2003 will be RR varieties. Monsanto has offices worldwide to market its technology, with approval in 30 countries but facing challenges in Argentina and Brazil regarding patent protection. The status of GE soybeans in Brazil is crucial for international oilseed markets as Brazil is one of the last potential major sources for non-GE soybeans. In Argentina, Monsanto has agreements with seed firms allowing them to use RR technology, leading to almost 100% of the 2003 soybean crop being RR varieties. Argentine farmers often save RR soybean seeds for planting or resale, despite a seed law requiring certification for commercial use. In Argentina, a black market for RR soybeans has developed due to the lack of enforcement of seed laws, keeping prices low and discouraging technology fees. Argentine farmers save about $8 to $9 per metric ton on technology fees, giving them a cost advantage over U.S. soybeans in the international market. In Brazil, the approval of RR soybeans by the Biosafety Commission faced opposition from groups like Greenpeace and the Brazilian Consumer Defense Institute, leading to lawsuits challenging the approval. In Brazil, lawsuits were filed challenging the approval of RR soybeans by the Biosafety Commission. Despite remaining illegal to plant GE soybeans, Brazilian farmers have reportedly smuggled RR soybean seeds from Argentina's black market. Approximately 80% of the crop in Rio Grande do Sul is estimated to be planted with RR soybean varieties, even without government approval. In Brazil, approximately 80% of the crop in Rio Grande do Sul is estimated to be planted with RR soybean varieties. The American Soybean Association claims that technology fee savings for Brazilian growers range from $9.30 to $15.50 per acre. China's regulations on GE soybeans have led to temporary changes in Brazil's official position on exporting GE soybeans. In 2003, China rejected Brazil's initial application to export GE soybeans due to Brazil not officially recognizing domestic production and export of GE soybeans. Under pressure from producer groups, Brazil announced temporary Regulation 113 (R113) allowing sales of RR soybeans from the 2002-03 crop. The regulation expires in March 2004, and a second temporary reprieve was issued with Regulation 130 (R130) in September 2003, approving the planting of GE soybeans for the 2003-04 season. The sale period of RR soybeans in Brazil was extended through December 2004. Farmers selling GE soybeans during this period must pledge not to buy untraced seeds in the future. Brazilian farmers can only plant GE seeds already on hand due to restrictions on importing or selling GE seeds. The lack of labeling for GE crops complicates domestic marketing. The government is working on a bio-safety law to address these issues, but progress has been slow. There is disagreement within the government on prompt legalization, with the Minister of Agriculture in favor and the Minister of Environment opposed, calling for an environmental impact study before commercialization. Both ministers agree on strict enforcement of existing regulations, including incineration. Both ministers in Brazil agree on strict enforcement of existing regulations for genetically engineered (GE) crops, which would result in incineration of all GE crops and imprisonment of growers. There are opposing views within Brazil on legalizing GE soybeans, with consumer and environmental groups concerned about unknown risks, while peasant groups fear it will benefit multinational corporations like Monsanto. Brazilian producer groups argue that lack of access to GE technology puts them at a competitive disadvantage in international markets. The premium for non-GE soybeans may offset cost advantages of GE varieties in markets. Legalizing GE soybeans could be Brazil's only viable solution. Brazil's food labeling regulation for GE ingredients requires labeling when over 4% of ingredients are derived from GE commodities. R113 imposes stricter labeling conditions, with non-GE soybeans to be segregated with a 0% tolerance level from GE soybeans. Labeling is also required on shipments with GE soybean presence over 1%. Failure to label properly incurs severe fines in Brazil. Brazil's National Agriculture Federation estimates the cost of testing the current crop for GE content at $277 million. Passing this cost on to consumers would hinder Brazil's competitiveness in the global soybean market. The decision on GE crops in Brazil will have significant market implications, with nearly all internationally traded soybeans being of GE varieties if Brazil legalizes GE soybeans permanently. Brazil's decision on GE crops could be irreversible due to mixing in distribution systems, leading to widespread planting of GE crops. This could eliminate major international suppliers of non-GE soybeans. The U.S. is committed to promoting intellectual property protection and believes GE crops are as safe as conventional ones. Congress has generally supported the safety and productivity benefits of GE crops, passing resolutions in support of the Administration's dispute settlement case at the WTO against the EU's ban on GE crop imports. The issue of RR soybean piracy in Brazil was raised in Senate hearings, highlighting challenges in enforcing IPR without patent protection in Argentina or Brazil. Both Argentina and Brazil, as members of the WTO, have agreed to abide by the TRIPS Agreement on intellectual property rights. If Monsanto obtains patent protection for RR technology in these countries, they can seek recourse for infringement through the legal systems as per WTO requirements."
