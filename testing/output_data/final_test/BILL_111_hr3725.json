Congress finds that traffic congestion in urban areas results in major chokepoints and bottlenecks, causing Americans to lose billions of hours and gallons of fuel. This congestion leads to virtual congestion taxes for travelers, threatens business productivity, and increases the risk of highway crashes. Traffic congestion in urban areas leads to major chokepoints and bottlenecks, increasing the risk of highway crashes. Vehicles emit more pollutants in stop-and-go traffic, impacting air quality. In large cities, congestion affects 67% of travel, lasting seven hours per day and extending rush hour trips by 37%. Congestion is no longer limited to central city areas. The rate of traffic congestion has increased in medium-sized cities and suburban areas. A 2005 survey found that congestion was the top concern for residents, surpassing education and healthcare. The National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission recommended establishing a program to fund projects that reduce congestion. The Secretary of Transportation must establish a chokepoint congestion relief program within 180 days of this Act. Additionally, regulations for national chokepoint regions will be issued. The Secretary must develop criteria for designating national chokepoint regions based on various factors within 180 days of the Act. The Secretary must develop criteria for designating national chokepoint regions based on factors such as incident-related travel delay, highway alignment changes, interruptions to highway flow, and vehicle merging maneuvers. The Secretary must develop criteria for designating national chokepoint regions based on factors such as incident-related travel delay, highway alignment changes, interruptions to highway flow, and vehicle merging maneuvers. Additionally, there is a grant program established in Section 5. The Secretary may grant funds for capital improvements to State departments of transportation in national chokepoint regions. Grants are only for eligible projects described in section 7 and must be coordinated with existing programs. Projects on Federal-aid highways must meet construction standards under this Act. The Federal share of the cost for eligible projects under this Act is 80 percent, with the non-Federal share not allowed to come from other Federal funds. SEC. 6. APPORTIONMENT OF FUNDS. The Secretary is authorized to carry out the chokepoint congestion relief program by apportioning capital improvement grants to State departments of transportation for eligible projects in national chokepoint regions. A formula based on delay per traveler, daily vehicle-miles, and travel time index will determine funding for projects in regions spanning multiple states. The Secretary will allocate funds for eligible projects in national chokepoint regions among states based on lane miles and vehicle miles traveled on Federal-aid highways. Amounts granted to State departments of transportation for eligible projects shall be available for obligation for 6 years. Unobligated funds after this period will be reallocated to other States for projects in national chokepoint regions at the Secretary's discretion. SEC. 7. PROJECT SELECTION AND ELIGIBILITY. The Secretary must issue project selection guidelines for State departments of transportation to follow in selecting eligible projects for grants under this Act. Guidelines include consulting with local governments, adhering to planning processes, and having a transparent selection process available to the public. The Secretary must develop a process for rating proposed projects for grants under this Act and identify the basis for rating projects. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines terms like \"eligible project,\" \"Federal-aid highway,\" \"Secretary,\" \"State,\" and \"State department of transportation.\" SEC. 9. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND QUANTITATIVE GOALS FOR STATE DOTS. Congress believes that States should set objectives to reduce traffic congestion and establish performance measures for efficient use of resources. Congress emphasizes the need to address traffic congestion by investing in nonautomotive modes of travel, travel demand management strategies, growth management, and green infrastructure along transportation corridors. Additionally, a study on congestion pricing is proposed. The Administrator of the Research and Innovative Technology Administration will study congestion pricing to incentivize off-peak travel, reduce reliance on tax-based funding, explore foreign practices, and report findings to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The House of Representatives and Senate committees oversee transportation and infrastructure. Authorization of appropriations from the Highway Trust Fund for fiscal years 2010 through 2015 is provided in this Act."
