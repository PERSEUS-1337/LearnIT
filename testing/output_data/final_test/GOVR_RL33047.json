    "content": "The receipt of \"gifts\" by Members and staff of the House of Representatives and the Senate is restricted by federal statutory law and congressional rules. Members and staff are generally prohibited from accepting gifts or reimbursements from private sources, except for certain exceptions like gifts from relatives or personal friends under $50. Exceptions exist for travel expenses under both House and Senate Rules. The acceptance of gifts by Members and staff of the House and Senate is restricted by federal law and congressional rules. Prohibitions exist under both House and Senate Rules for accepting travel expenses from outside parties in limited circumstances. Federal law prohibits soliciting or accepting anything of value from individuals seeking official action or whose interests may be affected by the individual's performance. The acceptance of gifts by Members and staff of the House and Senate is restricted by federal law and congressional rules. Subsection (a) prohibits the receipt of gifts from interested parties, while subsection (b) allows for exceptions under the supervision of the ethics office. The Rules of the House and Senate set standards for accepting gifts and reimbursement, with prohibitions and exceptions outlined in House Rule XXV and Senate Rule XXXV. House Rule XXV and Senate Rule XXXV restrict the acceptance of gifts by Members and staff, prohibiting gifts of $50 or more from private sources unless exceptions apply, such as gifts from relatives or long-term friends. Exceptions also exist for certain travel expenses under specific circumstances, with the purpose of the travel being a key consideration. The purpose of travel can vary, including official business, political reasons, charitable events, private business endeavors, personal recreation, fact-finding tours, or a combination. Different rules and restrictions apply based on the nature and purpose of the travel. For example, strictly official congressional business may not be paid for by outside third parties due to House and Senate Rules. Accounts prohibit the establishment or operation of congressional \"slush funds\" for private contributions to pay for official congressional activities. Expenses for campaign-related travel can be paid for from campaign accounts, subject to campaign finance laws. Members can accept travel expenses for charitable fundraisers under House and Senate Rules limitations. Reimbursement for travel related to private business must comply with federal campaign finance laws. The acceptance of private payment or reimbursement for \"officially connected\" travel by Members and staff is permitted under certain guidelines, while payments for purely personal travel purposes are generally prohibited as impermissible gifts. This includes necessary travel expenses for events related to a Member's official duties, such as conferences or fact-finding tours. The House and Senate Rules allow for private payment or reimbursement for \"officially connected\" travel related to a Member's official duties. Restrictions on gifts with monetary limitations were first enacted in 1977, allowing for certain travel expenses to be accepted by Members and staff. The House of Representatives in the 95th Congress established a Select Committee on Ethics to provide guidance on restrictions on gifts, including travel expenses for \"fact-finding\" events related to official duties. The Committee emphasized the importance of allowing necessary travel expenses for legitimate purposes directly related to Congress duties, despite past criticisms of abuses in such tours. The Select Committee on Ethics established guidelines exempting necessary expenses for fact-finding events related to official duties from limitations on gifts. Reimbursements over $250 from one source must be disclosed to prevent abuse, and gifts over $100 are prohibited to avoid personal pleasure or entertainment. The definition of \"fact-finding\" tours was narrowly defined to prevent potential abuses. The Select Committee on Ethics established guidelines exempting necessary expenses for fact-finding events related to official duties from limitations on gifts. Members may only accept necessary expenses for fact-finding activities and must not accept entertainment or expenses beyond necessary expenses. The definition of a \"fact-finding event\" must be interpreted narrowly. The Select Committee on Ethics guidelines exempt necessary expenses for fact-finding events related to official duties from limitations on gifts. Members can only accept necessary expenses for fact-finding activities, not entertainment or expenses beyond that. The definition of a \"fact-finding event\" must be narrowly interpreted. The House and Senate Rules now reflect traditional restrictions on privately financed travel. Privately funded travel for Members must be connected to official duties and publicly disclosed within 30 days to be considered a reimbursement to the House or Senate. Limitations and restrictions apply to prevent abuse of such travel opportunities. Privately funded travel for Members must be connected to official duties to avoid the appearance of using public office for private gain. The trip's purpose and activities must be related to one's official duties, and expenses cannot be paid for by lobbyists or foreign agents. If the trip is substantially recreational, it will not be considered officially connected. The Foreign Agents Registration Act prohibits lobbyists and lobbying firms from paying for official travel, but clients or employers of lobbyists can sponsor and reimburse such trips. The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct also prohibits accepting travel expenses from lobbyists, even if later reimbursed by a non-lobbyist client. The Rules do not expressly prohibit lobbyists from accompanying Members on events paid for by clients or employers. The House Rules do not explicitly forbid lobbyists from extending invitations to Members for sponsored events. The source of funds for a fact-finding event must be the sponsor or a closely connected entity. The House and Senate rules allow Members to accept travel expenses from sponsors or closely connected entities for officially connected travel. Members are advised to inquire about the source of funds used for the trip to ensure compliance with the rules. Non-profit organizations can pay for travel with earmarked donations, making donors \"private sources\" for the trip. Donors must be publicly disclosed as trip sponsors and may need to meet standards for proper funding sources. Members and staff should inquire about the funding source for trips. Permissible expenses for officially-connected events include necessary travel expenses like food, transportation, lodging, conference fees, and materials. The House and Senate Rules define \"necessary\" expenses as reasonable expenditures for these items. Expenses for recreational activities, even during legitimate travel, are not considered \"necessary expenses\" and are subject to a $50 limitation on personal gifts to Members. This includes expenses for activities like jet-skiing, golf, and fishing expeditions. Entertainment expenses exceeding $50 from a private source are not allowed, and overall gift limits must be followed. The Rules of the House and Senate state that \"necessary\" expenses for officially connected travel must be \"reasonable.\" There are no specific guidelines for what constitutes reasonable expenses for travel and lodging. The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct emphasizes that expenses must be reasonably necessary for the trip's purpose. Officially connected travel expenses in the House of Representatives and Senate must be reasonable and necessary for the trip's purpose. Maximum allowed stays are up to four days for domestic events and seven days for foreign travel in the House, and up to three days for domestic travel and seven days for foreign travel in the Senate. Additional expenses for side trips unrelated to the trip's purpose are not permitted. In the House and Senate, additional expenses for side trips unrelated to the trip's purpose are not permitted. Members may accept return transportation from the event locale if they wish to extend a trip, but any side trips for unrelated activities must be paid for by the Member. Members of the House and Senate must obtain advance authorization for officially connected travel, while staff employees need written approval from their employing Member or officer. Any privately financed travel expenses for \"officially connected\" events must be disclosed within 30 days, including dates, itinerary, trip sponsor, and expenses. The discussion focuses on House and Senate Rules regarding the acceptance of gifts from private sources by Members. Criminal statutes also address the receipt of anything of value by public officials, particularly when connected to an official act. Gifts are typically given with no strings attached, but criminal laws target the receipt of things of value linked to official acts. The \"bribery\" provisions of federal law prohibit the \"corrupt\" receipt of something of value in return for being influenced in any official act, while the \"illegal gratuities\" clause requires merely the receipt of something of value with the knowledge of being compensated for any official act. House Rule XXV, clause 5: (b) (1) (A) allows reimbursement for necessary expenses related to official duties. The House Rule XXV, clause 5 allows reimbursement for necessary expenses related to official duties, as long as advance authorization is received and expenses are disclosed within 30 days. Events with recreational activities are not considered part of official duties. Each authorization must be signed by the supervising Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, or officer. The House Rule XXV, clause 5 allows reimbursement for necessary expenses related to official duties, with advance authorization required and expenses disclosed within 30 days. Each authorization must be signed by the supervising Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, or officer, including details like employee name, reimbursement source, travel details, and confirmation of duty-related travel. The House Rule XXV, clause 5 allows reimbursement for necessary expenses related to official duties with advance authorization required. This includes transportation, lodging, meal expenses, and other related expenses. The expenses must be necessary for travel within the United States for a limited period. Reimbursements must be in connection with the individual's duties as an officeholder and not for private gain. Reimbursements for necessary expenses related to official duties, with advance authorization required, are limited to reasonable expenditures for transportation, lodging, conference fees, and food. Entertainment and recreational activities are not included, except for activities provided to all attendees as part of the event. Travel expenses for a relative may be included. The Clerk publicly discloses advance authorizations and reimbursements for necessary expenses related to official duties, excluding entertainment and recreational activities. Reimbursements from individuals not registered as lobbyists or foreign agents are considered reimbursements to the Senate, not gifts, if authorized in advance and disclosed. The Clerk discloses expenses reimbursed for official duties, excluding recreational activities. Reimbursements must be authorized in advance and disclosed within 30 days of travel completion. Each disclosure includes details like the employee's name, reimbursement source, travel details, and confirmation of duty connection. Expenses reimbursed for official duties must be authorized in advance and disclosed within 30 days of travel completion. The disclosure should include estimates of transportation, lodging, meal, and other expenses, ensuring they are necessary and duty-related. Reimbursements to Members or officers must also confirm the travel's connection to their official duties. The term \"necessary transportation, lodging, and related expenses\" for official duties must be pre-approved and disclosed within 30 days. It includes reasonable expenses for travel up to three days in the US or seven days outside, limited to transportation, lodging, conference fees, and food. Expenditures for recreational activities or entertainment not provided to all attendees are not covered. The Senate allows for reimbursement of travel expenses for spouses or children if deemed appropriate for representation purposes. The Secretary of the Senate must disclose all authorizations and reimbursements to the public promptly."
