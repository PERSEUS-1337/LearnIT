The Gallatin Land Consolidation Act of 1998 aims to acquire land north of Yellowstone National Park to add to the National Forest System, establish a logical ownership pattern for the Gallatin National Forest, and improve public access. The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to enter into agreements for land acquisition, including exchanges with private property owners. The Gallatin Land Consolidation Act of 1998 authorizes the acquisition of BLM land and BSL land for the National Forest System. BLM land refers to 2,000 acres proposed for acquisition by BSL, while BSL land refers to 54,000 acres owned by BSL. The Act aims to establish a logical ownership pattern for the Gallatin National Forest and improve public access. The National Forests in Montana, including Beaverhead, Deerlodge, Helena, Custer, and Lewis and Clark National Forests, are part of the National Forest System land proposed for acquisition by BSL. The Option Agreement, signed in July 1998, outlines the details of the acquisition. The Option Agreement for the Acquisition of Big Sky Lumber Co. Lands, signed in July 1998, includes exhibits, maps, and an exchange agreement with the Secretary of Agriculture. The Secretary refers to the Secretary of Agriculture. SEC. 4. GALLATIN LAND CONSOLIDATION COMPLETION. The text discusses the conveyance of land from BSL to the Secretary and vice versa, subject to certain conditions and agreements. The Secretary of the Interior and BSL agree to convey land with specified terms and conditions. BSL may place land in escrow, and the Secretary will do the same with Federal land in exchange. Additionally, the Secretary may purchase specific sections of BSL land held in escrow. The Secretary will acquire Taylor Fork sections identified in the Option Agreement held in escrow for $4,150,000. BSL will release deeds to equivalent value of Taylor Fork land to the Secretary as funds or timber sale receipts are received. The Secretary will acquire Taylor Fork sections held in escrow for $4,150,000. BSL will release deeds to equivalent value of Taylor Fork land as funds or timber sale receipts are received. If funds are not provided, BSL is entitled to receive patents and deeds to an equivalent value of the Federal land held in escrow. The property and assets exchanged must be approximately equal in value as determined by the Secretary. The Secretary will equalize the values of states under subsection (a) as per the Option Agreement. A timber sale program will be implemented to generate receipts for purchasing portions of BSL land in Taylor Fork, subject to environmental laws and small business set-aside rules. The Secretary will provide BSL with an annual timber sales schedule, deposit receipts in a special account, exempt Gallatin National Forest receipts from certain laws, and fund the program as determined. Rights-of-Way will be specified in the Option Agreement. The Secretary will convey easements to BSL for access to National Forest System land, and BSL will convey easements to the United States for land owned by BSL. The Secretary will review the title for BSL land and determine if it meets applicable title standards within 45 days. The Secretary of Agriculture will ensure that the title standards for Federal land acquisition are met, approve all conveyances and closing documents, verify compliance with title standards, and confirm that the title includes both surface and subsurface estates without reservation, including minerals and mineral rights. The Secretary of Agriculture ensures that title standards for Federal land acquisition are met, approves conveyances and closing documents, and verifies compliance. The conveyance of title may be deemed unacceptable if it does not meet Federal standards. The property rights include surface rights, timber interests, water rights, geothermal rights, and any other interest in the property. The Secretary of Agriculture advises BSL on corrective actions for title conveyance. Title to subsurface estate is conveyed to the Secretary. Implementation timing requires land conveyance within 45 days of title quality determination. Land-for-timber sale receipt exchange is also specified in the Option Agreement. The Secretary must provide timber receipts by December 31 of the fifth year after the Act's enactment. The purchase of BSL land must be completed within 30 days of funds availability and title quality determination. SEC. 5. OTHER FACILITATED EXCHANGES. The Secretary will conduct land exchanges outlined in documents dated July 1998 for the Wapiti and Eightmile/West Pine areas, ensuring equal value based on appraisals. The Secretary is encouraged to pursue a land exchange with the owner of section 1 of the Taylor Fork land after completing a full public process and an appraisal. The Secretary shall report to Congress on the implementation of this exchange within 180 days of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 6. GENERAL PROVISIONS. The Option Agreement allows for minor corrections and supplemental provisions agreed upon by the Secretary and BSL. The Secretary must notify specific committees and members of any changes. The boundary of the Gallatin National Forest is adjusted in the Wineglass and North Bridger area upon completion of conveyances, with no limitations on the Secretary's authority to make adjustments. The Option Agreement limits the Secretary's authority to adjust the boundaries of the Gallatin National Forest. The boundaries are considered as of January 1, 1965 for the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act. The Agreement is available for public inspection and filed with county clerks. The Secretary, the Secretary of the Interior, and BSL must comply with the terms of the Option Agreement, with exceptions for conflicts with this Act. Land conveyed to the United States will be added to Gallatin National Forest and Deerlodge National Forest. Management includes a public process within 30 days of completing the land exchange. After completing the land-for-land exchange, the Secretary will amend the Gallatin National Forest Plan and Deerlodge National Forest Plan to integrate the acquired land. The amendment process must be completed within 540 days and will not allow surface occupancy for oil and gas activities. Until the amendment process is finished, the Secretary will manage the acquired land according to set standards. The Secretary will manage the acquired land according to Forest Service standards and guidelines, maintaining public access. A restoration program will be implemented for reforestation and watershed enhancements to comply with Forest Service standards, potentially involving partnerships with State and local conservation corps. The Secretary of Agriculture will ensure funds for Gallatin National Forest under the Public Lands Corps Act of 1993. Any public orders withdrawing lands from appropriation laws are revoked upon land conveyance by the Secretary. SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Such sums as necessary are authorized to carry out this Act."
