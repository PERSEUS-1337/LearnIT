This report focuses on how depository banks are performing in financial intermediation. Depository banks engage in various activities such as making loans, providing check cashing services, and underwriting securities. They profit from the spread between the rates they receive from borrowers and pay to depositors, but face risks such as default and funding liquidity. Banks face funding and liquidity risks due to short-term interest rate movements, requiring access to short-term funding until long-term loans are repaid. Fluctuations in short rates impact profit spreads, and sudden deposit withdrawals can lead to financial distress. Bank profitability is closely tied to financial risk, with financial intermediation increasing borrower vulnerability during economic downturns. U.S. depository banks may increase credit availability in optimistic economic conditions, leading to higher financial distress during recessions. Safety regulations monitor financial risks to prevent bank distress. Restrained lending reduces risks but comes with a cost. The cost of reducing financial risk is a trade-off for a less robust economic expansion. Determining the optimal level of financial intermediation risk for banks is a regulatory challenge. Congressional interest in the financial conditions of depository banks has increased, focusing on profitability and lending activity levels. This report primarily focuses on profitability and lending activity levels of depository banks. It discusses the aggregate balance sheet of commercial banking institutions, including assets such as loans and financial securities, and liabilities like borrowed funds. The industry's profitability has improved, but lending activity has not fully recovered to pre-crisis levels. When customers deposit funds into a bank, the bank borrows these funds to lend out for longer periods. The interest paid on these borrowings is the cost incurred by the bank. Bank capital is the difference between assets and liabilities, including shareholder equity and provisions for losses. Banks must maintain sufficient capital reserves to protect creditors from loan defaults. If a bank's capital falls below regulatory thresholds, it could lead to failure to repay obligations. Banks must maintain sufficient capital reserves to protect creditors from loan defaults. If a bank's capital falls below regulatory thresholds, it could lead to failure to repay obligations. Compliance with regulatory capital requirements implies that capital reserves must grow proportionately with bank asset portfolios. Assets in the banking industry are not evenly distributed, so banking firms must be analyzed separately for a more accurate assessment of financial conditions. Data from the FDIC shows the number of U.S. banks over time by size categories of bank asset holdings. The banking industry is divided into community banks with assets below $1 billion and large financial institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. The number of banks with over $10 billion in assets has remained steady. Industry assets were $14,722.80 billion in 2013, with bank assets increasing while the number of institutions has decreased. Banks with over $10 billion in assets hold about 80% of industry assets. The banking system experienced a high number of distressed institutions during the financial crisis of 2008, with a significant increase in bank failures. The FDIC administered 25 bank failures in 2008, 140 in 2009, and 157 in 2010. The bank failure rate has since decreased, with 92 bank failures in 2011, 51 in 2012, and 24 in 2013. Approximately 35% of FDIC-insured institutions reported negative quarterly income in 2013. The percentage of unprofitable institutions decreased from 35% in 2013 to 12.2% in 2013. The number of banks on the FDIC's problem list peaked at 888 in 2011 before falling to 467 in 2013. An unprofitable institution may not be on the problem list if it has enough capital to absorb revenue shortfalls. The banking industry has seen a return to profitability, with full-year net income reaching $154.7 billion in 2013, the highest level since 2006. The increase in earnings is mainly attributed to noninterest income and lower provisions for loan losses. Return on assets (RoA) and return on equity (RoE) are key metrics used to measure bank profitability, with RoA reflecting the financial return on average assets or lending activities. The RoA and RoE ratios are key metrics used to measure bank profitability. RoA reflects the financial return on assets or lending activities, while RoE measures the financial return for shareholders. During the 2007-2009 recession, both RoA and RoE declined as loan defaults led to capital deterioration and increased bank failures. The RoA and RoE measures have shown a reversal since the recession, attributed to loan repayment problems leading to distressed institutions. Non-current assets are loans not repaid as scheduled, with ALLL set aside for anticipated loan losses. Loan loss provisioning increases when default risks rise, shown by an increase in noncurrent assets and charge-offs after 2007. Banking organizations must hold capital for default risks. The federal bank regulators believe that most banking organizations already hold sufficient capital to meet higher requirements for unanticipated losses. ALLL requirements change frequently, and banks may need to increase provisions if borrowers show signs of repayment difficulties. The ratio of ALLL provisioning to total bank assets serves as a proxy for anticipated loan losses. The ALLL indicator in Figure 4 shows that loan loss provisioning has declined over 15 consecutive quarters until December 2013, but it still covers net charge-offs. However, the percentage of non-current loans must decrease further relative to the current level of ALLL provisioning to fully cover default risks. The coverage ratio, which assesses non-performing assets relative to ALLL levels, is commonly used in the industry. The coverage ratio, assessing non-performing assets relative to ALLL levels, has been rising as regulators require banks to increase loan loss provisioning to match problem loans. This increase in provisioning may impact the growth rate of bank lending portfolios. The asset growth rate of banks fell below negative 2% in 2009 due to loan repayment problems, leading to cautious lending practices. Despite an increase in bank lending post-recession, it has not returned to pre-recession levels. Since the 2007-2009 recession, the banking system's asset holdings have shifted, with larger shares of cash and smaller shares of residential mortgages. Cash holdings grew from 5% to 12% from 2000 to 2013, while residential mortgage credit declined from 20% to below 16%. Commercial real estate loans also decreased from almost 15% in 2007 to below 12% by the end of 2013, leading to a decline in real estate lending in bank portfolios. The decline in real estate lending in bank portfolios has led to a shift in asset holdings, with larger shares of cash and smaller shares of residential mortgages. Consumer loans, commercial & industrial loans, and securities have remained stable from 2000 to 2013. Banks borrow funds from depositors for shorter periods and continuously renew short-term borrowings until longer-term loans are repaid. Smaller banks focus on relationship banking, serving local customers with higher net interest margins. They fund loans with deposits, which is cheaper than accessing short-term financial markets. In contrast, large banks engage in transactional banking. Large banks engage in \"transactional banking\" with automated underwriting methodologies, accessing short-term money markets for funding. They generate fee income from various activities to cover borrowing costs, including originating and selling loans to nonbank institutions. Fees are also earned from traditional banking services like safe deposit and trust services. Large banks generate fee income from transactional banking activities such as safe deposit, payroll processing, and payment services. Net interest margins for small banks declined by 2009 but remained higher than those of larger banks. The net interest margins for large banks increased during the recession due to a surge in deposits, leading to lower funding costs. Despite a return to pre-recession trends, future performance may be influenced by changes in asset holdings, such as an increase in liquid assets. Banks may adjust asset portfolios to seek higher yields and maintain spreads above 3%. Predicting profitability from traditional lending activities has become more challenging. Fee income as a percentage of assets has rebounded post-recession, with smaller institutions showing more volatility in fee income revenues. Greater reliance on fee income may reduce exposure to credit and funding risks for large banks. Despite a reduction in credit and funding risks, stability of earnings streams may not increase for banks. Fee income from selling loans to securitization markets has decreased, leading to income variability. Regulatory costs could further impact fee income, prompting banks to explore new opportunities for generating revenue. Financial market uncertainty continues to affect future fee-generating activities in the banking industry. The banking industry has shown profitability post-financial crisis, with less volatile net interest margins and fee income. However, there are still challenges such as non-current assets exceeding allowances for loan losses and many banks on the FDIC's problem list. Asset growth has been positive but below historical averages, and lending patterns are changing due to new regulatory requirements. Profitability should not be seen as a return to previous norms, as lending costs are expected to rise. Large banks may be able to maintain profitability through fee income from various financial activities, despite lower traditional lending levels due to increased capital requirements. Profitability trends may vary based on bank size."
