    "content": "The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy and the Pew Oceans Commission have recommended changes to U.S. ocean policy. Congress may consider comprehensive bills addressing federal organization, ecosystem management, and funding. Alternatively, Congress may focus on specific issues like fisheries, ocean exploration, and marine debris. Congress has been involved in ocean affairs, creating new programs and defining a national ocean policy. The Development Act of 1966 established a National Council on Marine Resources and Engineering Development and initiated work by a presidential bipartisan Commission on Marine Science, Engineering, and Resources. Dr. Julius Stratton was appointed as the commission chairman by President Lyndon Johnson. The commission, known as the Stratton Commission, completed its final report in 1969 with over 120 recommendations for federal policy on ocean exploration and development. This report played a key role in shaping the structure of a national ocean policy. The Stratton Commission's recommendations influenced the establishment of various ocean-oriented programs and laws enacted by Congress. These included the National Sea Grant College Program, the National Advisory Committee on Oceans and Atmosphere (NACOA), and the reorganization of federal ocean programs under NOAA. Subsequent legislation on marine sanctuaries, fishery conservation, ocean pollution, and seabed mining also reflected the commission's recommendations. Since the 1970s, there have been efforts to implement a comprehensive national ocean policy, with initiatives consolidated and reduced since 1980. By the late 1980s, there was a consensus on the need to redefine national ocean policy, spurred by President Reagan's establishment of a 200-nautical-mile Exclusive Economic Zone in 1983 and the extension of the U.S. territorial sea in 1988. In the aftermath of President's decision not to sign the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, legislation was introduced in multiple Congresses to create an oceans commission and review U.S. ocean policy. Despite passing the House in various instances, the Senate did not act on the bills. In the 105th Congress, legislation creating a national ocean council and a commission on ocean policy passed the Senate and House separately, but differences were not reconciled before Congress adjourned in 1998. It wasn't until the 106th Congress in 2000 that legislation was addressed. In 2000, legislation was enacted to establish a 16-member U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy (P.L. 106-256) to make recommendations for a national ocean policy. This followed a National Ocean Conference in 1998 attended by President Clinton and Vice President Gore, and a post-conference report titled Turning to the Sea: America's Ocean Future. In 2000, the Pew Oceans Commission was established by the Pew Charitable Trusts to conduct a national dialogue on policies to restore and protect marine resources in U.S. waters. The Oceans Act of 2000 mandated a U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy to issue findings and recommendations for a national ocean policy. The Pew Oceans Commission established a national dialogue on marine resource protection in U.S. waters. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy was mandated by the Oceans Act of 2000 to develop a comprehensive national ocean policy. President Bush appointed 16 members to the commission, which convened its inaugural meeting in September 2001. Admiral James D. Watkins was selected as chair, and four working groups were established to address governance, research, stewardship, and investment. The Oceans Act of 2000 directed the commission to establish a Science Advisory Panel to assist in preparing the report. The panel's composition was determined by the commissioners in consultation with the Ocean Studies Board of the National Research Council. Members were divided into four working groups to address pressing issues related to the use and stewardship of the nation's marine resources. The commission established working groups to address key issues related to the use and stewardship of the nation's oceans. They gathered information from public meetings, identified key issues, outlined options, and shared deliberations to coordinate the final report and recommendations. After conducting extensive research and public meetings, the commission completed its information-gathering phase in October 2002. Deliberations began in November 2002, with the final public discussion held in April 2003. Various supporting documents were produced, and the commission's final report was released in two stages, with a Preliminary Report issued on April 20, 2004. The commission released a Preliminary Report on April 20, 2004, for review and comment by governors and stakeholders. The report was based on information from public meetings, site visits, and experts, presenting policy recommendations for protecting the ocean environment and sustaining the economy. After a 30-day review period, the commission modified the report in response to feedback before approving changes at its 17th public meeting on July 22, 2004. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy approved changes to its Preliminary Report at its 17th public meeting on July 22, 2004, and directed staff to prepare the final report titled An Ocean Blueprint for the 21st Century. The report, with 212 recommendations, was delivered to the President and Congress on September 20, 2004. Key recommendations included establishing a National Ocean Council, creating a President's Council of Advisors on Ocean Policy, strengthening NOAA, and developing regional ocean councils. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy approved changes to its Preliminary Report at its 17th public meeting on July 22, 2004, and directed staff to prepare the final report titled An Ocean Blueprint for the 21st Century. The report, with 212 recommendations, was delivered to the President and Congress on September 20, 2004. Key recommendations included establishing a National Ocean Council, creating a President's Council of Advisors on Ocean Policy, strengthening NOAA, and developing regional ocean councils. The recommendations also included doubling the nation's investment in ocean research, implementing the national Integrated Ocean Observing System, increasing attention to ocean education, strengthening coastal and watershed management, creating a coordinated management regime for federal waters, setting measurable water pollution reduction goals, reforming fisheries management, acceding to the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, and establishing an Ocean Policy Trust Fund based on revenue from offshore oil and gas development. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy approved changes to its Preliminary Report at a meeting on July 22, 2004, for the final report titled An Ocean Blueprint. Modifications were made based on feedback from various stakeholders and experts, with no changes to the 13 critical actions. The final report emphasizes the important role of states in ocean policy. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy revised its report to emphasize states' role, embrace all coastal areas, address climate change impacts, recognize cultural heritage, and consolidate funding discussions. Governors and tribal leaders generally approved the changes. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy report received positive feedback from tribal leaders and various stakeholders, who praised its comprehensive treatment of ocean and coastal issues, economic importance, and recommendations for immediate action. Public comments from a diverse group of individuals and organizations supported the report's themes and recommendations, with concerns raised about funding, policy development participation, and implementation flexibility. Several commenters highlighted concerns regarding national and regional governance, federal organization, offshore management regimes, funding for science and research, ecosystem-based management, regulation and enforcement, and living marine resources. Additional comments covered issues such as cruise ships, climate change, invasive species, bottom-trawling, wind energy, coastal development, international ocean policy, and seafood safety. Members of Congress generally supported the report but had specific concerns about funding increases and the creation of a specific oceans structure in the White House. The Pew Oceans Commission, funded by a $5.5 million grant from the Pew Charitable Trusts, released a final report on June 4, 2003, outlining a national agenda for protecting and restoring the oceans. The report was criticized by some for contributing to excessive government control. The Pew Oceans Commission released a final report in 2003 with 26 recommendations organized into six categories, including governance for sustainable seas and restoring America's fisheries. Key recommendations include enacting a National Ocean Policy Act, establishing marine reserves, and implementing ecosystem-based planning. Implementing ecosystem-based planning and marine zoning, regulating destructive fishing gear, requiring bycatch monitoring, access, and allocation planning, establishing a fishery conservation trust fund, developing action plans for non-point source pollution, protecting critical coastal habitats, managing development impact, and revising pollution laws to focus on non-point sources are key recommendations from the Pew Oceans Commission's final report in 2003. The Pew Oceans Commission's final report in 2003 recommended revising and strengthening pollution laws to address non-point source pollution, point sources like animal feeding operations and cruise ships, and emerging sources like invasive species and noise. It also called for a national marine aquaculture policy based on conservation principles, doubling funding for ocean science research, and improving the use of scientific information. The Pew Oceans Commission's final report in 2003 recommended creating independent scientific oversight for ocean management, broadening ocean education, and addressing concerns about bias in the report's recommendations. Representative Richard Pombo criticized the report for being influenced by the \"environmental agenda\" of the Pew Charitable Trusts. Commission members praised the report as long overdue. The Pew Oceans Commission's report in 2003 was praised for offering practical solutions to reverse declining trends in U.S. ocean policy. Commission members saw it as a wake-up call for Americans to protect ecosystems at risk. The report focused on environmental issues and was compared to the broader U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy. Despite positive feedback, Congress did not immediately react to the report's release. Chairman Leon E. Panetta testified before the U.S. Commission on multiple occasions. President Bush responded to the U.S. Ocean Commission's report by submitting a U.S. Ocean Action Plan to Congress on December 17, 2004. He also established a Committee on Ocean Policy within the Council on Environmental Quality. The Committee released an Implementation Update on January 26, 2007, covering progress in six general subject areas. The Committee on Ocean Policy established an ocean governance structure to coordinate management efforts, including the Interagency Committee on Ocean Science and Resource Management Integration (ICOSRMI) and two subcommittees. In January 2008, the ICOSRMI released the Federal Ocean and Coastal Activities Report to Congress for CY 2006 and 2007. ICOSRMI released the Federal Ocean and Coastal Activities Report to Congress for CY 2006 and 2007. President Obama established the Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force (IOPTF) to develop recommendations for a national ocean policy and coastal planning. The CEQ released the Final Recommendations of the Ocean Policy Task Force in July 2010, focusing on national policy for the ocean, coasts, and Great Lakes. The Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force (IOPTF) focused on developing recommendations for a national policy for the ocean, coasts, and Great Lakes. This included a governance structure, implementation strategy, and stewardship principles. Departments and agencies were instructed to identify requirements for implementation. The coordination framework and participating agencies would be similar to committees established under the Bush Administration. The National Ocean Council (NOC) would be responsible for implementing the national ocean policy, with the Ocean Resource Management Interagency Policy Committee (ORM-IPC) focusing on resource management and the Ocean Science and Technology Interagency Policy Committee (OST-IPC) on science and technology. The governance structure would include various committees and advisory panels. The implementation strategy for the national ocean policy includes four basic areas for federal government operation: ecosystem-based management, coastal and marine spatial planning, informed decisions, and coordination. Special emphasis is placed on resiliency to climate change, regional ecosystem protection, water quality, Arctic conditions, and ocean infrastructure. The Framework for Effective Coastal and Marine Spatial Planning defines CMSP as a comprehensive, adaptive, integrated, ecosystem-based, and transparent spatial planning process for ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes areas. President Obama signed an executive order to establish a national policy for stewardship of the oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes, adopting recommendations to establish a National Ocean Council and develop coastal and marine spatial plans. President Obama revokes E.O. 13366 signed by President Bush in 2004 and plans to implement a national policy through the National Ocean Council. The United States never became a signatory nation to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). President Bush urged Senate to act on U.S. accession to UNCLOS in 2007, but it was not considered. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton confirmed U.S. accession to UNCLOS as an Obama Administration priority in 2009. The IOPTF recommended U.S. accession to UNCLOS. The IOPTF recommended U.S. accession to UNCLOS, with support from the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy and the Pew Oceans Commission. The Joint Ocean Commission Initiative, led by Admiral James D. Watkins and the Honorable Leon E. Panetta, aims to advance ocean policy reform with priorities including ecosystem management, ocean governance reforms, improved fisheries management, reliance on science in decision-making, and increased funding for ocean programs. On June 13, 2006, the Joint Ocean Commission Initiative delivered a national ocean policy action plan to Congress in response to a request from a bipartisan group of Senators. The plan outlined the top 10 steps Congress should take to address pressing challenges, funding priorities, and changes to federal laws for a more effective ocean policy. The plan aimed to guide legislation and funding for high-priority programs to protect and restore the marine ecosystem. The Joint Ocean Commission Initiative delivered a national ocean policy action plan to Congress, outlining key steps to improve federal agency coordination on ocean and coastal issues, reauthorize the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, support innovation in ocean-related research, establish an Ocean Trust Fund, and more. The Joint Ocean Commission Initiative continues to advocate for ocean policy reform through various means such as reports, press releases, and public speaking engagements. In April 2009, they released a report titled \"Changing Oceans, Changing World\" outlining priorities for the Obama Administration and Congress. The 111th Congress will consider the findings and recommendations of the Pew Oceans Commission. The Pew Oceans Commission report and the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy's recommendations have not been fully addressed, despite some progress in ocean policy reform. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act was reauthorized by the 109th Congress, incorporating many of these recommendations. The 109th Congress reauthorized the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, addressing issues such as enhancing the role of science, setting sustainable harvest levels, and ending overfishing. Provisions included market-based approaches, limited access privilege programs, fisheries enforcement, ecosystem pilot programs, community-based restoration, and a regionally-based registry for recreational fishermen. Additionally, bills were considered on ocean exploration, observing systems, marine debris, and mapping integration. The 109th Congress reauthorized the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, focusing on sustainable harvest levels and ending overfishing. The Marine Debris Research, Prevention, and Reduction Act (P.L. 109-449) established a program to address marine debris and its impact on the environment. Legislation introduced during the 111th Congress included the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-11) which addressed ocean exploration and related topics. Title XII of previous Congresses addressed ocean exploration, mapping, observation, acidification research, and land conservation. Bills like H.R. 21 and S. 858 aimed to establish a national ocean policy emphasizing conservation, authorizing NOAA, promoting regional coordination, and creating an Ocean and Great Lakes Trust Fund. The House Natural Resources Subcommittee held a hearing on H.R. 21 to establish a national ocean policy and create an Ocean and Great Lakes Trust Fund. Supporters emphasize the need for improved ocean conservation due to pollution, habitat destruction, and overfishing. However, concerns exist about potential increased bureaucracy and conflicts with existing mandates. The Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee's Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries, and Coast Guard held a hearing on the future of ocean governance, focusing on IOPTF activities and over 70 bills related to ocean and Great Lakes management, climate change, fisheries, coastal conservation, marine animals, marine sanctuaries, research, education, and transportation. The 111th Congress is considering a comprehensive approach to ocean policy, with concerns about increased bureaucracy and conflicts with existing mandates. The Ocean, Coastal, and Watershed Education Act (H.R. 3644) was passed by the House on January 19, 2010. This bill aims to enhance regional education and watershed programs, establish a national grant program for environmental literacy, and may face congressional oversight during the 111th Congress."
