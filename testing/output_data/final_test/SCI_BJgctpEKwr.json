    "content": "Random Path Generative Adversarial Network (RPGAN) is introduced as an alternative scheme of GANs for generative model analysis. RPGAN's latent space consists of random paths in a generator network, providing interpretability by associating different layers with different regions. Experiments show RPGAN's insights into image generation processes, competitive generation quality, and efficient incremental learning capabilities. Generative modeling methods like GANs are widely used in various applications such as image editing, super-resolution, and video generation. These models provide insights into data generation processes but are often complex and difficult to interpret. In this work, the Random Path GAN (RPGAN) is proposed as an alternative design of GANs for natural interpretability of the generator network. RPGAN generators use stochastic routing during the forward pass instead of noisy input vectors, allowing for individual samples to be influenced by random instances of each layer. Training of RPGAN is done in an adversarial manner. The RPGAN introduces stochastic routing during generation, allowing for individual samples to be influenced by random instances of each layer. It can be trained in an adversarial manner like traditional GANs and offers insights into factors of variation in image generation. RPGANs can be updated with new data efficiently and enable the construction of generative models without nonlinearities, speeding up the generation process for fully-connected layers. RPGAN introduces stochastic routing during generation, allowing for individual samples to be influenced by random instances of each layer. It offers insights into factors of variation in image generation and enables efficient model updates with new data. The PyTorch implementation of RPGAN is open-sourced with common generator architectures. The paper is organized into sections reviewing prior art, describing the RPGAN design, experimental evaluation, and concluding with possible future directions. In RPGAN, stochastic routing is introduced during generation, providing random routes in the generator for stochasticity. GANs consist of a generator and discriminator trained adversarially, with state-of-the-art models capable of producing high-fidelity images. Various architectures, loss functions, and techniques have been developed in the GAN paradigm. In RPGAN, random routes are used in the generator for stochasticity, different from prior works that focused on specific GAN architectures. RPGAN does not mimic latent representations of pretrained classifiers, offering a unique approach to interpretability in deep neural networks. Interpretability of deep neural networks is a key research area, with most work focusing on discriminative models. While some studies aim to understand network representations or explain decisions, few address interpretability of generative models. Bau et al. (2019) developed a technique to identify generator parts responsible for object generation. In contrast, this study proposes GANs with a different stochasticity source for natural interpretation. Findings align with Bau et al. (2019), providing stronger evidence on layer responsibilities. In this study, the authors propose an architecture that allows for the interpretation of individual layers in GANs. Unlike previous techniques, their approach does not require auxiliary models or supervision and can be applied to any data. The different layers in the generator architecture are shown to have specific roles in image generation. The RPGAN model is highly flexible and consists of a generator and discriminator like standard GAN architectures. The generator always receives a fixed input vector during the forward pass and aims to produce an image from the real image distribution. It is structured into consequent buckets, each containing independent blocks. The RPGAN model's generator is structured into consequent buckets, each with independent blocks like ResNet blocks. Each bucket corresponds to a layer in the generator architecture, with a fixed input vector Z for the first bucket. Stochasticity in the generator comes from a random path using a single block from each bucket to generate an output image. The RPGAN model's generator uses buckets with independent blocks, each corresponding to a layer. It randomly selects blocks to generate an output image, allowing for a large variety of samples compared to the training set size. The RPGAN model's generator uses buckets with independent blocks for each layer to generate high-quality images. A diversity term is added to the generator loss function to ensure different blocks learn unique weights. Parameters are enforced to be different by normalizing with the standard deviation, guaranteeing all buckets contribute to diversity. The experiments in this section use ResNet-like generators with spectral normalization and hinge loss. Different datasets like CIFAR-10, LSUN-bedroom, and Anime Faces were used with varying numbers of discriminator steps and blocks in a bucket. Additional experiments with other architectures are provided in the Appendix. In the experiments, ResNet-like generators with spectral normalization and hinge loss were used for three datasets: CIFAR-10, Anime Faces, and LSUN-bedroom. The coverage ratio was reported to ensure a rich latent space for generator routes. Training details included using the Adam optimizer with specific parameters and training the model for a set number of generator steps for each dataset. Learning a unique input vector Z was found to improve generation quality and stabilize the learning process. During training, Z is passed through N random paths in RPGAN, using random blocks to form new batches. RPGAN achieves the same quality as standard GANs without needing more data or training time. Samples generated with fixed block sequences help interpret factors of variation in different buckets. In experiments, the responsibility areas of generator layers are investigated using fixed block sequences to interpret factors of variation. By analyzing the distribution of generated images, the influence of different blocks in a specific bucket can be understood. Samples generated with unfrozen buckets show how images change with varying blocks. The first bucket has minimal impact on coloring but affects small objects' deformations. Intermediate buckets have the most influence on semantics, while the last two buckets mainly affect coloring. The fourth layer varies color widely, and the fifth layer corrects tones. These findings align with Bau et al. (2019). A metric d img is used to quantify image similarity, with different metrics capturing various variations. In the study, the diversity of buckets in an RPGAN generator is measured using the metric d img. Two metrics, capturing semantics and color differences, are experimented with. The Euclidean distance between outputs is considered, inspired by the Fr\u00e9chet Inception Score concept. In the study, the diversity of buckets in an RPGAN generator is measured using the metric d img. The Euclidean distance between outputs of the pretrained InceptionV3 network is used for semantic distance evaluation. Hellinger distance is employed to measure differences in color histograms of generated samples. The average values of semantic diversity are highest for the intermediate layers. The semantic diversity is highest in the intermediate layers of an RPGAN generator, while the last layers have a greater impact on color. The first layer shows the smallest variability. Findings are consistent across different datasets like CIFAR-10, LSUN, and Anime Faces. Earlier layers determine viewpoint and object position, intermediate layers influence semantic details, and last layers focus on color correction. The image content details are mainly influenced by the intermediate layers in RPGAN generators. The last layers primarily impact the coloring scheme rather than the content semantics or image geometry. Results may vary for different datasets or generator architectures. The interpretations of different layers in RPGAN are applicable to standard GAN generators of the same architecture. Both standard GAN and RPGAN show similar generation quality when trained under the same protocol, as measured by Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) and precision-recall curve. Evaluation on CIFAR-10 dataset is conducted. In RPGAN and SN-ResNet generators, FID values for CIFAR-10 are compared, showing similar quality in both metrics. Noise injection in layers of standard GAN generator alters generated samples, confirming interpretability of RPGAN layers in standard GAN architecture. The RPGAN serves as an analysis tool for generator models by showing how noise in different layers affects the characteristics of generated samples. Injecting noise in RPGAN always results in good-looking images, allowing for the identification of factors of variation in each layer. This contrasts with perturbed generators, which produce poor images that are difficult to analyze. The RPGAN model is effective in analyzing generator models by showing the impact of noise on generated samples. Injecting noise in RPGAN produces visually appealing images, aiding in identifying variation factors in each layer. In contrast, perturbed generators result in poor, hard-to-analyze images. The RPGAN model is also suitable for generative incremental learning tasks, as demonstrated with the MNIST handwritten digits dataset partitioned into subsets. The RPGAN model is effective in analyzing generator models by showing the impact of noise on generated samples. It can produce visually appealing images and identify variation factors in each layer. The model can be trained with linear transformations only, achieving decent generation quality. The RPGAN model can be trained with linear transformations only, achieving decent generation quality. By replacing nonlinearities in the generator model with identity operations, the model achieves a competitive FID of 22.79 on the CIFAR-10 dataset. This approach fails for standard GAN generators but allows for faster image generation using purely linear architecture. In experiments with RPGAN model, a fully-connected generator network on the MNIST dataset was trained, achieving a 2.2x speed up by combining the last three buckets into one. This compression method reduces the number of matrix multiplications required, resulting in faster image generation. The RPGAN model introduces random routing for interpretability of generator layers, showing different factors of variation in generated images. Future research can use RPGAN analysis for efficient model construction by identifying redundant parts for pruning or speedup. Insufficient cardinality in latent space results from too few blocks, while too many blocks can lead to dataset coverage issues. The 7-bucket RPGAN with ResNet-like generator is used to generate LSUN-bedroom-like images. Different buckets are responsible for various aspects of the generated images, with central buckets impacting semantics, last two buckets affecting coloring, and first two buckets influencing local geometrical features. Mode collapse is observed in the third bucket, affecting only small local features. Samples generated by the model can be seen in Figure 14. The 6-bucket RPGAN with ResNet-like generator is used with the Anime Faces dataset, revealing RPGAN analysis tools. Different buckets impact image content semantics, with the last two buckets affecting coloring. The first buckets influence small features. See Figure 15 for block variations and Figure 16 for bucket responsibility analysis. The RPGAN model works well with different generator architectures and learning strategies, using DCGAN-like generators with consequent convolutional layers. Models are trained as WGANs with weight penalty. Plots are shown for generators with different numbers of buckets on CIFAR-10, colored MNIST, and CelebA-64x64 datasets. Noise injection is demonstrated to impact image generation. Injecting noise in the generator weights is not an effective interpretability method, as shown by comparing RPGAN and noise injection on randomly colored MNIST samples. Both RPGAN and standard generators are trained as Wasserstein GANs with weights penalty. Tanh function is used for reshaping to 28x28 images."
