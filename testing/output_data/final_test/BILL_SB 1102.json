    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 7282.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code defines terms related to collecting platforms and collecting jurisdictions for the purpose of collecting and remitting taxes on rental transactions for tourist or transient use. The Revenue and Taxation Code defines terms related to collecting platforms and jurisdictions for collecting and remitting taxes on rental transactions for tourist or transient use. An \"operator\" is a person offering a unit for tourist or transient use through a platform, which is a marketplace facilitating the rental of units for compensation, with the owner deriving revenues from the platform. On and after July 1, 2017, collecting platforms must collect taxes on rental transactions for tourist use and remit them to the relevant city or county. The Controller will establish procedures for platforms and jurisdictions to notify their election to participate in tax collection. The Controller will establish procedures for collecting platforms and jurisdictions to notify their election to participate in tax collection. Platforms may elect to become collecting platforms by using the developed procedures to notify the Controller. (2) By April 30, 2017, a city, county, or city and county can choose to become a collecting jurisdiction by following specified procedures and notifying the Controller. The legislative body must approve the notice before submission.\n(3) Once elected, the jurisdiction's status is effective upon receipt by the Controller and remains until discontinued by the platform or jurisdiction.\n(4) The Controller will publicly list all platforms and jurisdictions that have notified their election by May 31, 2017. On or after July 1, 2017, a platform that did not elect to become a collecting platform can choose to do so by notifying the Controller. The election is effective six months after receipt by the Controller or the specified date in the notice. The Controller will publicly identify each platform that has provided notice on their website. A collecting platform or jurisdiction can elect to discontinue or change its status by notifying the Controller before June 30 of an odd-numbered year. The election will be effective on July 1 of the following year. Starting January 1, 2017, the Controller will annually review or audit collecting platforms' tax revenue collection and remittance. A report will be submitted to each city, county, or city and county with findings of errors in tax collection and remittance, without revealing any personally identifiable taxpayer information. It is prohibited for the Controller or any authorized person to disclose any information obtained from audits or reviews of tax collection platforms, including details of income, profits, losses, or expenditures, to any unauthorized person. When requested by a city, county, or city and county, the Controller shall allow authorized officers to examine records related to the audit of collections by a platform within that jurisdiction. Information obtained can only be used for local transient occupancy tax collection purposes. If information obtained for local transient occupancy tax collection purposes is believed to be disclosed or used inappropriately, the Controller can impose access conditions to protect confidentiality. (5) A platform, city, county, or city and county can appeal findings in a review or audit report by submitting a notice of appeal to the Controller\u2019s General Counsel within 60 days of the final report. The Controller\u2019s General Counsel will review the appeal and may hold an informal conference to gather more information before issuing a determination within 90 days. (6) The Controller can recover audit costs from the audited platform at the Controller\u2019s standard rate. Unless mutually agreed upon, a platform and a city, county, or city and county bound by a legal agreement for tax collection before June 1, 2016, must continue to adhere to the agreement. The platform's tax collection under the agreement is not subject to Controller review or audit. Notification of the agreement must be provided to the Controller. A collecting platform meeting review or audit parameters set by the Controller is not required to disclose personally identifiable information or transaction details to local jurisdictions. Local jurisdictions can still regulate operators and request transaction information as long as it is not discriminatory. The Legislature aims to establish uniform transient occupancy tax administration requirements for short-term rental online platforms to create a level playing field and reduce compliance costs. This applies to charter cities, counties, and charter cities and counties. Additionally, the Legislature acknowledges that the new section added to the Revenue and Taxation Code may limit public access to meetings and writings of public officials, citing constitutional provisions for protection. Limiting disclosure of records related to audits of transient occupancy taxes balances public disclosure with taxpayer confidentiality and prevents misuse of information. The Legislature amends Section 53051 of the Government Code to protect taxpayer confidentiality by restricting disclosure of information from audits conducted by the Controller on transient occupancy taxes. Section 53051 of the Government Code requires public agencies to file a statement with the Secretary of State and county clerk within 50 working days of establishment, including details such as the agency's name, governing body's address, and information on members and officers. Within 10 working days of any changes, an amended statement with required information must be filed with the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State and county clerk must maintain a public record called the \"Roster of Public Agencies\" containing all filed information."
