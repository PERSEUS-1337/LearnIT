    "content": "The Act titled \"Swan Creek Black River Confederated Ojibwa Tribes of Michigan Act\" defines key terms such as Tribe, member, and Secretary. The Congress recognizes the Tribe as the political successor to various treaties and acknowledges their aboriginal lands in Michigan. The Tribe's aboriginal lands in southeastern lower Michigan include Oakland, Macomb, St. Clair, Lapeer, Sanilac, Livingston, Washtenaw, Genesee, and Tuscola Counties. The cession treaties from 1807 to 1836 forced the Tribe to relinquish most of its lands, leaving them with small tracts in a few counties and receiving small annuity payments. The 1807 Treaty of Detroit required the Tribe to give up small tracts of land in exchange for future annuity payments and land in Kansas. Most members migrated to counties in Michigan, while some relocated to Kansas. In 1855, the Tribe was asked to move to Isabella County for individual land allotments, but many stayed in their original counties. The 1855 Treaty of Detroit relocated the Saginaw Band of Chippewa Indians to Isabella County for land allotments, dissolving their organization for administrative convenience. Another treaty in 1855 grouped Ottawa and Chippewa bands together, dissolving their organizations as well. The Treaty of 1864 confirmed the Federal acknowledgment of the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians as a separate tribe from the Chippewa Indians. Public Law 103-324 reaffirmed this recognition, clarifying that the Federal Government's intent was to dissolve their fictional coupling, not their independent sovereign existence. The Federal Government unilaterally withdrew from the established relationship with the Tribe over time without justification. The Tribe filed suit against the Federal Government for amounts past due under treaties. Congress enacted jurisdictional acts in 1910 and 1924 to enable the Tribe to file their claims. These claims were later incorporated into Indian Claims Commission Dockets and United Claims Court Docket. Beginning in 1935, the Tribe petitioned for reorganization and assistance under the Indian Reorganization Act due to misinterpretation of the 1855 Treaty of Detroit. In 1939, the Swan Creek Black River Ojibwa Bands were unable to purchase reservation lands due to lack of funding. The Federal Government decided not to extend benefits of the Indian Reorganization Act to additional Indian tribes in Michigan's lower peninsula, as per various treaties. In 1986, Congress enacted Public Law 99-346 to distribute judgment funds awarded in settlement of claims brought by the Tribe and the Saginaw Band in a nondiscriminatory manner. Despite administrative denials, the Tribe continued to carry out its governmental functions. The Tribe conducted government functions through various structures, including a Tribal Council. In 1991, they chartered a non-profit tribal government and sought Federal recognition as a distinct tribe. Other tribes in Michigan with treaty signatory descendants have been recognized by the Federal Government. The Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, along with other tribes in Michigan, have at least 300 eligible members residing close to their ancestral homelands. The United States Government and local governments have had continuous dealings with the Tribe's recognized political leaders since 1785, in light of treaty relations and Federal recognition of their rights. Congress should reaffirm and clarify the Federal relationship of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, similar to other tribes in Michigan that have received Federal recognition. The Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians seeks Federal recognition. Federal recognition of the Swan Creek Black River Confederated Ojibwa Tribes of Michigan Indians is affirmed, granting them access to federal services and benefits without the need for a reservation. The Swan Creek Black River Confederated Ojibwa Tribes of Michigan Indians are granted federal recognition, allowing them access to services in specific counties in southeastern lower Michigan, regardless of having a reservation. Services can also extend beyond the designated area if not prohibited by law. SEC. 5. REAFFIRMATION OF RIGHTS. All rights and privileges of the Tribe and its members are reaffirmed, without diminishing any existing rights. This Act does not affect any legal claims the Tribe may have regarding rights wrongfully denied before its enactment. SEC. 6. TRIBAL LANDS. The Tribe's tribal lands include all real property held by the Tribe or in trust for them. The Secretary will acquire land for the Tribe's benefit, taking it in the name of the United States in trust for the Tribe. Restored lands will be within those ceded by the Tribe in the 1807 Treaty of Detroit. SEC. 7. MEMBERSHIP. SEC. 7. MEMBERSHIP. The Tribe must submit membership rolls to the Secretary within 18 months of the Act's enactment. The qualifications for membership will be determined by the Tribe's governing documents in consultation with the Secretary. The Secretary will publish notice of the rolls in the Federal Register, and the Tribe must maintain and update them. The Secretary must conduct a secret ballot election within 24 months for the Tribe to adopt a constitution and bylaws. Until then, the interim governing documents will be in effect. Within 6 months of adopting the constitution, elections will be held to elect officials for the Tribe. The election of officials for the Tribe will be conducted according to procedures outlined in the constitution, with the interim government in place until new officials are elected. The Tribe will have jurisdiction over lands taken into trust by the Secretary and its members within the service area, following the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978."
