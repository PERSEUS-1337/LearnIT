    "content": "Federal law, known as the Hatch Act, regulates government employees' participation in partisan political activities in the executive branch. Employees have certain limitations on off-duty political activities, dating back to an executive order in 1907. The policy recognizes employees' right to engage in the political processes of the nation while prohibiting the use of official authority to interfere with elections. The Hatch Act, established in 1939, restricts federal executive branch employees from actively participating in political management or campaigns. State and local government employees connected to federally funded activities are also subject to these restrictions. The Act aims to protect employees from coercion by supervisors and ensure nonpartisan administration of federal laws and programs. The Hatch Act Reform Amendments of 1993 relaxed restrictions on federal employees' participation in partisan political activities outside of work hours and away from federal premises, aiming to balance protection against coercion with employees' rights to private expression. The Hatch Act Modernization Act of 2012 made changes to the Hatch Act, including excluding employees of the District of Columbia from coverage and altering enforcement mechanisms for violations. The Act generally prohibits certain political activities for covered employees, such as using their official authority for interfering with political results. The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from interfering in elections, accepting campaign contributions, running for partisan office, discouraging political activity, or engaging in partisan activities while on duty, on federal property, or in uniform. Specific permitted and prohibited political activities for federal employees are detailed in the Appendix. The Hatch Act allows federal employees certain political activities, overseen by the U.S. Office of Special Counsel. Penalties for violations are administrative in nature, including removal or grade reduction. The Hatch Act defines penalties for violations as \"overly-restrictive,\" including removal, grade reduction, debarment from federal employment for up to five years, suspension, reprimand, or a civil fine. The Act applies to employees in Executive Agencies or competitive service positions, excluding uniformed services, District of Columbia government employees, legislative, and judicial branch employees. Some provisions of the federal criminal code also relate to political activities. The Hatch Act applies to federal officers and employees in all branches of government, except the President and Vice President. It generally applies to civilian officers and employees in the executive branch. There are exceptions under certain circumstances. Following the relaxation of limitations on political activity for federal employees under the Hatch Act, most employees are considered \"less restricted\" and can participate in political campaigns. However, some employees, known as \"further restricted employees,\" face additional restrictions beyond the standard rules of the Hatch Act, similar to the original \"no politics\" rule. Further restricted employees, identified by the agencies they work for or specific positions within the executive branch, include agencies dealing with law enforcement or national security matters such as the Federal Election Commission, the FBI, the Secret Service, and others. Employees in certain designated positions within agencies like the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Justice are subject to heightened restrictions under the Hatch Act. These employees are prohibited from actively participating in political management or campaigns, except those appointed by the President with Senate approval. The restrictions apply even when off duty or away from their official duties. However, further restricted employees, particularly in law enforcement or national security agencies, are not completely barred from political activities under the Hatch Act. Employees in certain designated positions within agencies like the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Justice are subject to heightened restrictions under the Hatch Act. They may engage in political activities as private citizens if not representing the government, with exceptions for high-ranking officials not funded by the Treasury. The exception under the Hatch Act allows certain high-ranking officials, like presidential advisers and Cabinet officers, to engage in political activities during official working hours, as long as federal funds are not used. They must reimburse the U.S. Treasury for any resources used in campaign activities. Additionally, employees covered by the Act may participate in political campaigns in their municipality or political subdivision under certain regulations. The Hatch Act applies to municipalities and political subdivisions with federal government employees, including those in the District of Columbia, Maryland, or Virginia near DC. The Act restricts political activities while on duty or representing the government, especially in the evolving workplace with various platforms for political engagement. One key restriction is the prohibition on political activities while on duty. The Hatch Act prohibits political activities on duty, including while in federal buildings, wearing official insignia, or using government vehicles. Definitions of terms are detailed in federal regulations. The Hatch Act prohibits political activities on duty, including in federal buildings. Political activity is defined as activity directed towards the success or failure of a political party, candidate, or group. Employees are considered on duty when in a pay status or representing the government. The federal workplace includes federally owned or leased spaces where official duties are performed. The Hatch Act prohibits political activities on duty, including in federal buildings. Employees are considered on duty when in a pay status or representing the government. The Act does not specify how it is applied to different communication methods for political activity, making the manner of participation irrelevant to its permissibility. This includes using mobile devices for partisan political activity during work hours. The Hatch Act prohibits political activities on duty, including in federal buildings. Employees are considered on duty when in a pay status or representing the government. The Act does not specify how it is applied to different communication methods for political activity, making the manner of participation irrelevant to its permissibility. This includes using mobile devices for partisan political activity during work hours. The employee could be in violation of the Hatch Act by engaging in political activity through email on official or personal accounts on work devices. OSC has provided guidance on this issue, citing an example where an email about a presidential candidate was found to be in violation of the Act. The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) found an email about then-presidential candidate Obama to be in violation of the Hatch Act. The email contained negative statements about Obama and urged recipients to be cautious about his candidacy. It was noted that the email was not created by a federal employee but was forwarded without any added content. While federal employees can receive political emails and forward them to personal accounts, certain email activities are restricted under the Hatch Act. Certain email activities are prohibited under Hatch Act restrictions for federal employees, including sending partisan political emails while on duty or in a federal workplace. This ban applies to all accounts, not just government accounts, even if using personal devices. Employees are also not allowed to send political fundraising event invitations or forward such emails to subordinates. The use of mobile communications and social media has increased the potential for engaging in political activity in both personal and professional capacities. The federal workforce relies heavily on social media for communication. The Hatch Act applies to political activity on social media, with restrictions on using official titles, recommending campaign contributions, and sharing partisan material. Specific rules govern social media contacts between supervisors and subordinates. OSC has identified limitations on biographical content on social media accounts, such as use of official title and political preferences. Disciplinary measures have been announced for federal employees violating prohibitions on political activities, including prosecution for advocating for a candidate on Twitter. An FEC employee resigned after posting partisan political tweets and criticizing the Republican Party on an internet broadcast. The OSC barred an FEC employee from the executive branch for two years after criticizing the Republican Party and Mitt Romney on a webcam broadcast. Details of the settlements reached were not disclosed, raising questions about the use of personal or official social media accounts for restricted activities. Federal telework programs have expanded, leading to concerns about Hatch Act compliance for employees working from home with government-issued equipment. The application of Hatch Act restrictions to teleworking employees using government-issued equipment is a complex issue. The OSC suggests that Congress should clarify definitions rather than relying on administrative regulations. There is uncertainty about whether teleworking employees are considered 'on duty' and if their home can be classified as a federal workplace. OSC recommends expanding the prohibition on using government vehicles to include other equipment like laptops and smartphones. The Office of Special Counsel recommends clarifying definitions for teleworking employees using government-issued equipment. They suggest expanding restrictions to include laptops and smartphones, as the Hatch Act is silent on using resources other than vehicles. Agencies are encouraged to develop clear computer-usage and government equipment policies, but this issue was not addressed in recent amendments to the Act. OSC provides guidance on permissible political activities for less restricted employees, such as being candidates in nonpartisan elections, voting as they choose, assisting in voter registration drives, contributing to political campaigns, attending fundraising functions, and more. Employees are allowed to participate in various political activities, including attending rallies, joining political clubs, campaigning for candidates, and expressing opinions. However, they are not permitted to engage in political activities while on duty, in federal buildings, or while wearing a uniform. Prohibited Political Activities for federal employees include not using official authority to interfere with elections, not using official titles for political activities, not inviting subordinates to political events, not soliciting donations for partisan political groups, not hosting political fundraisers, not being candidates in partisan elections, and not discouraging political activities. Federal employees are prohibited from engaging in political activities while on duty, in federal buildings, or using federally owned vehicles. This includes distributing or displaying campaign materials, wearing partisan political items, performing campaign chores, making political contributions, and advocating for or against political candidates on social media. Restricted federal employees are prohibited from engaging in political activities while on duty or using government resources. They are not allowed to post comments on social media advocating for or against political parties or candidates. However, they are permitted to participate in nonpartisan activities such as voter registration drives and contribute money to political campaigns. Federal employees are restricted from engaging in political activities while on duty or using government resources. They are prohibited from being a candidate in partisan elections or actively participating in partisan political campaigns. This includes campaigning for or against candidates, making campaign speeches, or engaging in activities to elect partisan candidates. Federal employees are prohibited from engaging in partisan political activities, including distributing campaign material, circulating nominating petitions, managing political rallies, or using their official authority to interfere with elections.
