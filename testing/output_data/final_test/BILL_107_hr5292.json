    "content": "The \"Contractors Accountability Act of 2002\" may be cited as such. The Congress recognizes the need for a centralized database to track judicial actions, consent decrees, and other legal matters related to potential Federal contractors and assistance participants due to the lack of resources to gather this information for each procurement award. Since 1990, 16 of the top 43 Federal contractors have a total of 28 criminal convictions, and 4 of the top ten have at least 2 criminal convictions. The lack of information compromises the Federal Government's ability to safeguard the integrity of procurement and assistance activities. It is in the best business interests of the Federal Government to have all possible information regarding potential contractors' performance and integrity records. Despite 43 contractors paying $3.4 billion in fines and penalties under the Superfund program, only one contractor has been suspended from contracting with the Federal Government for 5 days. There is a lack of centralized listing of criminal or civil indictments, convictions, fines, and penalties related to contractors, compromising the integrity of procurement and assistance activities. Federal contractors are not required to disclose relevant information, highlighting the need for a database to track contractor performance and integrity records. Participants in the Federal procurement award process are not mandated to disclose all relevant criminal, civil, or administrative rulings. This lack of disclosure hinders Federal award officials and debarment officials from having crucial information for assessing present responsibility. SEC. 3. DATABASE FOR FEDERAL DEBARMENT OFFICIALS AND CONTRACTING OFFICERS. The Administrator of General Services will establish a database containing information on the integrity and performance of Federal contracts and assistance recipients. This database will include details of judicial and administrative proceedings against contractors or recipients, within the most recent 5-year period. The Administrator will maintain a database with details of proceedings, payments to the government, terminated contracts, debarments, suspensions, and agreements with contractors. Federal agencies can directly input and update information in the database. The Administrator will maintain a database with details of proceedings, payments to the government, terminated contracts, debarments, suspensions, and agreements with contractors. Federal agencies can directly input and update information in the database, which will be available to all Federal agencies and the public in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act. SEC. 4. SUSPENSION AND DEBARMENT PRESUMPTION FOR REPEAT VIOLATORS AND POOR PERFORMERS. Federal agency suspension and debarment regulations will be amended to presume an entity as nonresponsible for a Federal contract if convicted twice for the same offense within a 3-year period. The presumption can only be rebutted with clear evidence of present responsibility and corrective actions. Repeat violations can lead to immediate suspension by the agency. Immediate action is necessary to suspend an entity under regulations until it fulfills the requirements. Federal regulations must be amended within 180 days of this Act to require entities applying for Federal contracts or assistance to disclose any debarments, suspensions, legal proceedings, and administrative agreements within the past 5 years. The role of the interagency committee is outlined in Section 6. The Interagency Committee on Debarment and Suspension resolves issues, coordinates actions among agencies, encourages cooperative efforts, recommends changes to the Government debarment system, and authorizes the Office of Management and Budget to issue guidelines. The Interagency Committee on Debarment and Suspension is authorized to establish subcommittees, submit an annual report to Congress on progress and efforts to improve the suspension and debarment system, and summarize each agency's activities in the Governmentwide debarment system. SEC. 7 authorizes independent agencies to participate in the Governmentwide suspension and debarment system. SEC. 8 pertains to the use of payments under administrative agreements. Federal agencies can retain and use amounts received from Federal contractors or assistance participants for suspension or debarment administrative agreements and maintaining a database. These amounts cannot be used for other agency expenses. SEC. 9. DEFINITIONS. The Interagency Committee on Debarment and Suspension is defined as the committee constituted under Executive Order 12549. Assistance refers to Federal grants, agreements, loans, and benefits under nonprocurement suspension rules. Contract pertains to direct procurement transactions under the Federal Acquisition Regulation."
