The Congress acknowledges the disagreement on the causes of epidemic drug addiction in the US and the lack of accurate information hindering effective responses. Evaluating the effectiveness of federal programs requires establishing cause and effect relationships. The 1988 Anti-Drug Abuse Act will allocate billions of dollars to antidrug programs for years to come, aiming for effective expenditure oversight. The Act aims to study and create an auditing mechanism for federally funded antidrug programs. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will collaborate with the National Academy of Sciences to study the effectiveness of various components of the Federal antidrug program in reducing drug addiction. This includes crop eradication, crop substitution, support for foreign law enforcement, interdiction, education, treatment, support for local law enforcement, criminal justice system reforms, and research on pharmacological and other medical treatments for drug addiction. The study will analyze the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different components of the Federal antidrug program, including job training, education, and health programs, in reducing drug addiction. It will also consider societal changes and demographic factors. The National Academy of Sciences will conduct a study to analyze the effectiveness of the Federal antidrug program on various demographic subgroups. They will provide detailed descriptions of the study's goals, preliminary results, and final results to the Secretary and Congress within specific timeframes. The Secretary will update the study results every 2 years with the National Academy of Sciences. Federal agencies will provide necessary information for the study. The Government Accounting Office will provide an annual audit report to Congress on the management and expenditures of the Federal antidrug program's component parts. The Comptroller General will have access to records, files, personnel, and facilities of Federal agencies involved in the program for this purpose."
