    "content": "The \"Presidential Debate Reform Act\" establishes a Presidential Debate Commission under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. The \"Presidential Debate Reform Act\" establishes a Presidential Debate Commission appointed by the President before each general election for the offices of President and Vice President of the United States. The Commission is composed of 3 members appointed by the President, with nominees submitted by the chairs of the Republican and Democratic National Committees. The Presidential Debate Reform Act establishes a Commission with 1 member nominated by both the Republican and Democratic National Committees. Members can be from various sectors and vacancies must be filled promptly. Members receive no compensation but are reimbursed for travel expenses. The Commission established by the Presidential Debate Reform Act consists of members nominated by the Republican and Democratic National Committees. Members are reimbursed for travel expenses and decisions are made by unanimous consent. An executive director is appointed with majority approval of the Commission's members. The Commission may appoint an executive director paid at a rate not exceeding level V of the Executive Schedule. Other personnel can be appointed with majority approval, with pay not exceeding 75% of the Executive Director's rate. Temporary and intermittent services can also be utilized. The Commission may procure temporary and intermittent services as authorized by section 3109(b) of title 5, United States Code. Its duties include establishing a schedule of debates, including one preliminary debate, not more than 2 Vice Presidential debates, and not less than 2 or more than 4 Presidential debates. Preliminary debates must occur 90-60 days before a Presidential election, with details announced at least 14 days prior. The Commission sets a schedule for debates, including a preliminary debate for presidential candidates meeting certain criteria. Vice Presidential debates follow the preliminary debate by at least 7 days. The format is determined by the Commission, and attendance at the preliminary debate is optional. The Vice Presidential debate involves candidates who are running with qualified Presidential candidates. The format of debates is decided by the Commission. Presidential debates must occur at least 7 days after the preliminary debate, with the time and date announced 21 days prior. Qualified Presidential candidates are defined in the subsection. The Commission determines a `qualified Presidential candidate' as one with the support of at least 5 percent of likely voters post-preliminary debate polling. Each Commission appointed is authorized appropriations as needed for election activities and terminates after the election day. SEC. 3. REDUCTION IN FEDERAL PAYMENTS FOR PARTY CONVENTIONS OF NON-COMMISSION DEBATE PARTICIPANTS. Section 9008 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to reduce payments for parties not participating in debates certified by the Presidential Debate Commission. If the nominee for President or Vice President does not certify participation in scheduled debates, the payment for the nominating convention will be reduced. The general election payment reduction is based on the percentage of debates not attended by a party's nominee, as determined by the Presidential Debate Commission. The reduction percentage is calculated by dividing the number of debates missed by the nominee by the total number of debates scheduled for the election."
