Since the mid-1970s, the Federal Government and many State and local agencies have promoted the General Equivalency Diploma (GED) over a traditional high school degree. However, with the current economy requiring higher skilled workers, the GED is no longer seen as a sufficient alternative. Economists Stephen Cameron and James Heckman found that individuals with exam-certified high school equivalents are similar to high school dropouts in the labor market and have comparable low wages. High school dropouts and individuals with General Equivalency Diplomas have poor wages, earnings, employment experiences, and job tenure. GED holders are closer to dropouts in labor market status and have lower employment rates compared to traditional high school graduates. Men with GEDs have inferior labor market status even after controlling for ability. Both anecdotal and empirical evidence suggest that employers and the military devalue the General Equivalency Diploma. Education programs focusing solely on obtaining a GED are seen as misguided. Despite a decrease in teenage pregnancy rates, a significant number of adolescent girls still give birth each year. Efforts to prevent unintended pregnancies should continue, while pregnant teenagers and young mothers should be provided with educational support. Pregnant teenagers and young mothers should be given educational opportunities to become productive citizens and caring parents, without receiving inferior education. SEC. 3. STUDY AND REVIEW OF POLICIES. The Secretary of Education will conduct a study on the value of a GED compared to a high school diploma and review policies to improve educational opportunities for all Americans, including pregnant teenagers and young mothers. The Secretary of Education will conduct a study on the value of a GED compared to a high school diploma and review policies to improve educational opportunities for all Americans, including pregnant teenagers and young mothers. The study aims to encourage dropouts to return to school for additional training, help individuals working to obtain a GED enter colleges, and restructure the GED to meet current educational standards. A report on the study results will be submitted to Congress within 2 years of the Act's enactment. The report will contain the study results, review findings, and reform recommendations. Authorization of appropriations for $2,000,000 for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 is provided to carry out this Act."
