    "content": "Congress is considering enlargement of NATO, following the allied summit in Prague in November 2002. The Senate previously voted in favor of admitting Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary in 1998, increasing NATO's membership from 12 to 19 countries. The alliance created a Membership Action Plan (MAP) to outline goals for potential candidates. At the Prague summit in November 2002, current NATO members designated Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania as prospective members. The debate over NATO enlargement in 1998 covered costs, mission, and candidate qualifications, with the entry of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary not requiring extra U.S. funds. These countries have contributed to stability in Europe and made political contributions to the alliance. The new NATO members from central and eastern Europe, Russia, and the Balkans are contributing to peace operations and building their military forces. Poland has made the most progress in modernizing its military, while the Czech Republic and Hungary have made less progress. It takes time to rebuild a military with an authoritarian tradition and transition it to civilian control. Some suggest NATO should wait until democratic processes are firmly established before inviting new members. The recent Hungarian government under Victor Orban faced criticism for an ethnic \"status law\" seen as territorial ambitions. Some defend Orban's election and dismiss the law as nationalist politics before an election. The period between candidate selection for NATO accession negotiations and final approval by member governments may involve debates on democratic criteria and potential extremist governments. NATO lacks provisions for expelling or disciplining a member state. The current enlargement debate in NATO revolves around qualifications for new member states. Slovenia's successful referendum showed popular support for NATO membership despite opposition to the Iraq war. Albania and Macedonia, although not invited to join, have small militaries with limited capabilities for high-intensity conflict. There is no consensus on the criteria for new members. Many participants in the NATO enlargement debate argue for standards reflecting the current European political situation, emphasizing the need for modernized militaries and political stability. Secretary of State Powell supports this view, suggesting candidates should strengthen democratic structures and contribute to border defense and peace operations. NATO should define its mission, agree on out-of-area threats, and consider enlargement with prospective members contributing to the mission. Some prefer members to relieve the U.S. burden, while others see no clear distinction between collective defense and security. Countries contributing to peace operations help prevent terrorism in unstable societies like Bosnia or Afghanistan. Countries involved in peace operations contribute to preventing terrorism in unstable societies like Bosnia or Afghanistan. The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, have influenced the enlargement debate within NATO, with a focus on how prospective members can aid in the fight against terrorism and the flow of weapons of mass destruction. NATO invoked Article V for collective defense after the attacks, settling a debate among European allies on using it for out-of-area actions against terrorism. At a NATO ministerial meeting in Reykjavik in May 2002, allies agreed on the need for mobile forces to carry out missions effectively. However, not all member states have the necessary forces for tasks in Afghanistan and Iraq. Some allies lack special forces or combat forces, but have intelligence, transport, medical units, and political influence that could assist in conflicts. Prospective members may be considered for their potential contributions, which could include political support in international organizations or with other countries, not just military assistance. The NATO alliance experienced divisions over military force against Iraq in 2003. Bush Administration officials praised 7 candidate states for endorsing the U.S. position on Iraq, with 6 joining the coalition. Slovenia was the exception, allowing overflight by U.S. and UK forces. The importance of preventing money-laundering and combating a black economy post-September 11 may lead to increased emphasis on ending corruption within candidate countries. The failure to achieve consensus in the North Atlantic Council over aiding Turkey in the event of an attack by Iraq exposed serious divisions in the alliance. Some officials and Members of Congress suggested changing NATO decision-making procedures. The debate over enlargement in 2001 differs from 1998, with most member states cautiously discussing Slovenia's potential membership for strategic reasons. Slovenia's entry would provide Hungary with a land bridge to Italy. Hungary's entry into the alliance would provide a land bridge to Italy, benefiting from Austria's refusal to permit NATO overflights during the Kosovo war. Slovakia is seen as a credible candidate for NATO membership, with key elements of its reform government returning in elections. Some NATO allies, like Poland, strongly support Baltic states' membership, citing their adherence to political guidelines and efforts to build stability in the region. Italy, Greece, and Turkey advocate for Bulgaria's and Romania's entry, believing they can contribute to Balkan stability. Critics argue that Romania and Bulgaria need to address corruption and modernize their military. Bulgaria has faced political and economic reform challenges, influenced by Russia's stance on NATO enlargement. Putin's softer rhetoric post-9/11 suggests a focus on anti-terrorism efforts over NATO enlargement opposition from some Russian factions. The Senate committees began hearings on NATO enlargement in 2003, with some members expressing views and relevant legislation introduced. The purpose of enlargement is to ensure stability in Europe and provide security to Russia's west through the addition of new member states. Putin may see the entry of Estonia and Latvia into NATO as a way to protect Russian minorities in those countries. In the 107th Congress, legislation was introduced supporting further enlargement of NATO, with bills introduced in both Houses. Representative Bereuter introduced the Freedom Consolidation Act of 2001, supported by Speaker Hastert and others. The bill designated Slovakia as a candidate for NATO membership. In the 107th Congress, legislation was introduced supporting NATO enlargement and funding for specific candidates. Slovakia was designated as eligible for U.S. assistance under the NATO Participation Act of 1994. Representative Gallegly introduced H.Res. 468, emphasizing NATO's importance to U.S. interests in Europe and advocating for improved relations with Russia. The resolution passed the House with a strong majority and was marked up by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for ratification. The Committee's report reviews strengths and weaknesses of candidate states for NATO admission, assessing political, economic, and military policies. Secretary Rumsfeld's comments on \"old\" and \"new\" Europe have caused controversy, with European critics opposing the categorization. Germany and France are highlighted for their economic and military capabilities within NATO. NATO completed accession negotiations with candidate states on March 26, 2003. The Bush Administration aims for Senate vote on enlargement before August 2003 recess, with NATO hoping to admit successful candidates in May 2004."
