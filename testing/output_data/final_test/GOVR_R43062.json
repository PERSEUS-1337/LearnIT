    "content": "Dietary supplements are widely used in the U.S. for various purposes such as nutritional support, weight loss, and sports performance enhancement. The market for dietary supplements has grown significantly, with over half of U.S. adults taking them. The industry has seen a rise in production, with the number of supplements on the market increasing from 4,000 in 1994 to approximately 55,000 in 2009. Sales in the industry reached over $30 billion in 2011, with top-selling supplements including vitamins, herbs, sports nutrition supplements, and specialty supplements like glucosamine and fish oil. The report discusses the FDA's authority to regulate dietary supplements, including regulations for new dietary ingredients, manufacturing practices, labeling, and claims. It also covers adverse event reporting, enforcement of regulations, and dietary supplement advertising by the FTC. Policy issues related to the manufacture, regulation, and safety of dietary supplements are also addressed. The FDA regulates the processing, manufacture, and labeling of dietary supplements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) of 1938. FDA has the authority to recall misbranded or adulterated food products, including dietary supplements. The FDA has the authority to recall food and dietary supplements that pose a risk of illness or injury. The Nutrition Labeling Education Act of 1990 established labeling requirements for food, including supplements, but the Dietary Supplement Act of 1992 delayed its implementation. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 then required the FDA to create specific regulations for dietary supplement labeling, which differentiated certain aspects from conventional foods. This included regulations for new dietary ingredients, good manufacturing practices, labeling, and health claims for dietary supplements. Additionally, dietary supplement ingredients were excluded from the definition of food. The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act mandated registration of food manufacturers, processors, and packers with the FDA. The Dietary Supplement and Non-Prescription Drug Consumer Protection Act added requirements for reporting adverse events for dietary supplements. The Food Safety Modernization Act granted the FDA recall authority for adulterated food and inadequate allergen labeling, overseen by the Office of Foods, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. Under the oversight of CFSAN, FDA can enforce actions against misbranded and adulterated dietary supplements through warning letters, product seizures, recalls, and ingredient bans. The FFDCA considers a dietary supplement adulterated if it poses a significant risk of illness or injury under recommended conditions of use or if it contains a New Dietary Ingredient (NDI). The FDA can enforce actions against misbranded and adulterated dietary supplements through warning letters, product seizures, recalls, and ingredient bans. A dietary supplement is considered misbranded if inaccurately labeled or presents unapproved claims. The burden of proof of misbranding or adulteration is on the agency, specific to dietary supplements. Prior to DSHEA, there was no statutory definition of dietary supplements. As amended by DSHEA, the FFDCA defines a dietary supplement as a product (other than tobacco) that is not represented as a. The FFDCA defines dietary supplements as products intended to supplement the diet, containing vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids, etc., and labeled as such. They are regulated as food, subject to fewer premarket regulations than drugs or medical devices. Manufacturers must register with the FDA, follow good manufacturing practices, and comply with labeling regulations specific to dietary supplements. Dietary supplement manufacturers must report serious adverse events to the FDA, but unlike drugs, supplements are presumed safe without pre-market testing. FDA regulations require notification for new ingredients and certain claims, but there is no pre-market approval process for supplements. FDA can deem supplements misbranded or adulterated if inaccurately labeled or contain unapproved ingredients. The FDA can deem dietary supplements misbranded or adulterated if inaccurately labeled, contain unapproved ingredients, or harmful substances. They may issue warnings or order recalls in certain cases. The FDA has specific regulations and guidance on new dietary ingredients (NDI), good manufacturing practices (GMP), labeling requirements, claims, and reporting serious adverse events. A NDI is a dietary ingredient not marketed in the US before October 15, 1994, and grandfathered ingredients are presumed safe based on their history of use. Manufacturers must maintain records to prove grandfathered status. Prior to DSHEA in 1994, manufacturers were not required to notify the FDA of dietary supplement ingredients. DSHEA created a requirement for manufacturers to notify the FDA of New Dietary Ingredients (NDI). FSMA, enacted in 2010, required the FDA to clarify the definition of NDI and explain safety evaluation requirements within 180 days. The FDA published draft NDI guidance in 2011, which sparked controversy. The FDA published draft NDI guidance in 2011, which sparked controversy among manufacturers. In response, the FDA agreed to revise the guidance in 2012. Manufacturers must submit notifications for each NDI, providing evidence of safety. If an ingredient is not grandfathered, manufacturers must re-characterize it as a NDI and follow regulatory requirements. Dietary supplement processors must ensure safety by following GMP, which set standards for manufacturing, packaging, and labeling. FDA established specific GMP for dietary supplements in 2007 to address industry concerns about unique characteristics. If an ingredient is not grandfathered, it must be re-characterized as a NDI and go through the regulatory process. The FDA established specific GMP regulations for dietary supplements in 2007 to address industry concerns. These regulations ensure quality control procedures and recordkeeping requirements are followed during the manufacturing process to prevent the inclusion of wrong ingredients, contaminants, or improper packaging. GMP for dietary supplements apply to all companies that manufacture, package, label, or hold these products for import and sale in the United States. The FDA established GMP regulations for dietary supplements in 2007 to ensure quality control during manufacturing. Dietary supplements have different labeling requirements under the FFDCA, including packaging, inserts, and point of sale information. The NLEA of 1990 amended the FFDCA to require nutritional content labels on all foods. The Dietary Supplement Act of 1992 created a moratorium on NLEA implementation for dietary supplements. DSHEA gave FDA authority to regulate supplement labeling. Dietary supplement labels must have a supplement facts panel and follow specific regulations. FDA can deem a supplement misbranded if labeling rules are not followed. Labels can make certain claims but must include a disclaimer and cannot link to specific medical conditions. The FDA's Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide provides guidelines for display. The FDA's Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide outlines requirements for dietary supplement labels, including the statement of identity, net quantity of contents, Supplement Facts Panel, ingredients list, and manufacturer information. Manufacturers can make certain claims about benefits but must include a disclaimer and cannot link to specific medical conditions. Dietary supplement manufacturers can make certain claims about benefits, but they must include FDA-approved disclaimers. These claims include nutrient content claims, health claims, and structure/function claims. Nutrient content claims characterize the level of a nutrient in the supplement, either expressly or implicitly. Health claims describe the relationship between a food, food component, or dietary supplement ingredient and reducing the risk of a disease or health-related condition. The FDA authorizes health claims on dietary supplement labeling based on significant scientific agreement standards. The FDA authorizes health claims based on scientific evidence and authoritative statements from federal scientific bodies. Sixteen health claims have been authorized to date, with twelve explicitly authorized in regulations and four based on authoritative statements. Qualified health claims for dietary supplements are based on less scientific evidence than other health claims but must be approved by the FDA. They do not require authorization in statute or regulation. FDA guidance provides standardized language for qualified health claims. In addition to health and nutrient content claims, manufacturers can make structure/function claims about how their products affect the body without mentioning specific diseases. Structure/function claims for dietary supplements describe the role of the supplement in the body and must be truthful. FDA preapproval is not required, but manufacturers need evidence to support these claims. They must notify the FDA and include a disclaimer on the label stating that the claim has not been evaluated by the FDA and the product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. Safety issues are identified through the adverse event reporting system. The FDA established a voluntary adverse event reporting system for supplements in 1993 to detect and assess adverse events. However, the system was found to be inadequate in providing data on adverse events by the HHS' Office of the Inspector General. The Dietary Supplement and Non-Prescription Drug Consumer Protection Act in 2006 mandated changes to improve the reporting system for dietary supplements. The FDA established a voluntary adverse event reporting system for supplements in 1993. The Dietary Supplement and Non-Prescription Drug Consumer Protection Act in 2006 mandated changes to improve the reporting system for dietary supplements. FFDCA requires supplement manufacturers to report serious adverse events in the US. A GAO report found 6,307 adverse event reports from 2008-2011, with 71% being serious events from the industry. FDA estimates 50,000 annual adverse events linked to dietary supplements due to underreporting. The FDA does not require premarket approval or review of safety and efficacy for dietary supplements, except for NDI. Adverse events linked to supplements may prompt further investigation by the FDA, but individual reports are not usually enough to take action against a product. FDA focuses its enforcement activities on dietary supplements already on the market. The FDA concentrates its enforcement activities on dietary supplements already on the market to ensure compliance with regulations. Various mechanisms, such as inspections, screenings, recalls, and warning labels, are used to identify safety concerns. The FDA shares regulatory responsibility with the FTC, with the FDA overseeing product labeling claims and the FTC regulating dietary supplement advertising. Funding priorities determine the FDA's capacity to carry out these tasks. The FDA and FTC regulate dietary supplement advertising to ensure truthfulness and prevent misleading claims. The FTC's authority comes from the FTC Act, which prohibits false advertisements that induce the purchase of products. Both agencies require claims to be substantiated, with the FTC providing a guide for manufacturers. The FTC enforces truthfulness in advertising by requiring adequate substantiation for all product claims, defined as \"competent and reliable scientific evidence.\" Deceptive ads mislead consumers to their detriment and are subject to enforcement actions. The FTC has filed numerous law enforcement actions challenging claims about the efficacy or safety of dietary supplements over the past decade. Current federal policy aims to balance consumer safety with industry interests, allowing the FDA to intervene in unsafe products while not imposing unnecessary regulatory barriers. Dietary supplements are regulated as food, meaning the FDA only takes action after issues arise, unlike drug regulation which requires proof of safety and efficacy before market approval. The dietary supplement industry is a topic of regulatory concern, with advocates for industry worried about stifling regulations and public health advocates pushing for a more stringent regulatory scheme similar to drug regulation. The market's growth has raised complex regulatory and research questions, reflecting the balance between personal choice and safety. Current areas of concern include product identification, their impact on health, and recent safety issues. The FDA is being asked for clarity on how products are categorized as dietary supplements, conventional foods, or drugs. Energy drinks are a specific example of this issue, with the term \"energy drink\" not being defined in regulation. The FDA interprets it as a liquid product containing caffeine. Energy drinks can be marketed as beverages or dietary supplements, each following different FDA regulations. Conventional foods with added ingredients must adhere to FDA regulations on food additives and GRAS substances, while dietary supplements have different labeling, GMP, and adverse event reporting requirements. Manufacturers can choose how to market their energy drinks, but the FDA can challenge products marketed as dietary supplements if they appear to be conventional foods. The FDA can challenge the decision to market energy drinks as dietary supplements to avoid food additive standards. Energy drinks marketed as beverages do not require reporting of adverse events and can be purchased with food stamps. In 2010, the GAO recommended FDA guidance on when products should be marketed as dietary supplements or conventional foods. FDA has agreed and issued draft guidance. The FDA has issued draft guidance on distinguishing liquid dietary supplements from beverages. Industry representatives have concerns about the guidance and have requested clarification. Adverse event reports suggest a potential association between energy drinks and illnesses, but causality has not been proven. Manufacturers deny any link between their products and these events. Reporting of serious adverse events would be required if all energy drinks were classified as dietary supplements. The FDA has issued draft guidance on distinguishing liquid dietary supplements from beverages. Industry representatives have concerns about the guidance and have requested clarification. Reporting of serious adverse events would be mandatory for all energy drink manufacturers if classified as dietary supplements. Some Members of Congress have expressed concern over energy drink regulation, specifically concerning caffeine, calling on the FDA to address regulatory loopholes. Senators Durbin and Blumenthal have requested regulatory action to address health concerns around energy drinks. FDA agreed to commission an outside panel of experts to review the safety of energy drinks with added caffeine in November 2012. The FDA's guidance on distinguishing drugs from dietary supplements has raised concerns in the industry. Dietary supplement manufacturers may still sell products being investigated for an IND if they were on the market prior to being approved as a new drug. One example of a product in this grey area is pyridoxal 5-phosphate (P5P). Pyridoxal 5-phosphate (P5P), a form of vitamin B6, is being investigated as an IND and marketed as a dietary supplement. A Citizen Petition has been filed with the FDA claiming P5P is an unapproved NDI. The dietary supplement industry is concerned that FDA action on the petition could make it illegal to use P5P. The dietary supplement industry is worried that FDA action on a Citizen Petition regarding P5P could lead to it being banned as a supplement ingredient. Surveys show many Americans take dietary supplements to meet nutritional needs, but there is limited research on their effectiveness and impact on healthcare costs. The effectiveness of dietary supplements is still being researched, with specific supplements like folic acid proven to reduce neural tube defects in infants. Calcium supplementation is recommended for bone health, but evidence of benefits is inconclusive. The FDA's NDI rule may lead to more research on newer supplements. Many physicians and patients lack understanding of supplement regulation and efficacy due to limited peer-reviewed research. The limited availability of peer-reviewed medical research on dietary supplements may compound efficacy issues. Consumers and medical professionals lack objective information on safety, efficacy, and potential side-effects. Patients may not disclose supplement intake to physicians, leading to limited understanding of marketing materials. Some physicians recommend supplements based on literature, while others rely on personal research. The federal government and supplement industry are taking steps to address these concerns. The federal government and dietary supplement industry are addressing consumer and healthcare provider understanding through research, industry standards, and guidelines. Some physician associations have published guidelines for clinical use, while industry groups are developing their own. Past legislation has aimed to allow supplement manufacturers to make drug-like claims. Research shows potential for supplements in preventing and treating health conditions. The use of dietary supplements, proven safe and effective through research, could lead to cost savings for consumers. However, the cost of conducting research to prove health claims to the FDA may increase supplement prices. Despite effectiveness, supplements can impact healthcare costs by reducing doctor visits. Some advocate for treating certain supplements as medical care. Advocates are pushing for certain supplements to be considered medical care for health savings account eligibility, arguing that supplements enhance health and well-being. Employer-sponsored accounts already allow supplements as eligible expenses. Safety and efficacy of dietary supplements are crucial, with public assuming FDA reviews them before market release. The FDA has the authority to regulate dietary supplements once they are on the market, ensuring compliance with GMP, proper labeling, and monitoring adverse event reports. The FTC also monitors dietary supplement advertising. The industry has self-regulation standards for quality and safety, but there is disagreement with FDA over regulations. The FDA's regulations on dietary supplements are seen as undermining the intent of DSHEA by holding them to the same safety standards as food additives. Public health advocates stress the need for scientific evidence to ensure product safety, while industry advocates fear the burden of proving safety for new dietary ingredients. Some Members of Congress have urged the FDA to revise its guidance to avoid creating barriers for new supplement companies. Concerns have been raised about the FDA's ability to identify safety issues due to a lack of scientific information. The FDA's regulations on dietary supplements are criticized for lacking scientific information compared to drugs. Industry argues for different safety standards for supplements, with newer ingredients needing NDI notification. FDA now has recall authority for adulterated products, but burden of proof remains on them. Enforcement policies have faced criticism for overstepping authority and violating the First Amendment. The FDA has been criticized for its enforcement policies on dietary supplements, with some calling them anemic. Past inspections found supplements with undeclared ingredients, often promoted for weight loss and bodybuilding. The FDA now has the authority to notify the DEA about supplements containing anabolic steroids. They have implemented a rapid public notification system to warn consumers about tainted products and provide guidance on supplement safety. Despite new FDA post-market authorities and industry standard and certification programs, the public still faces inconsistent potency and quality in dietary supplements. Manufacturers make unsubstantiated claims and use illegal ingredients, leading to adulterated products. FDA issued warning letters to manufacturers not following guidelines, such as marketing products containing dimethylamylamine without NDI notification. Plaintiffs have used these letters to bring lawsuits. FDA has taken steps to improve oversight of dietary supplement safety. The FDA has increased dietary supplement facility inspections and enforcement actions since 2008 due to mandatory serious adverse event reporting. Industry groups and advocates have challenged regulations perceived to overstep FDA's authority, but legislative action moves forward once consensus is reached among industry, Congress, and the FDA. The FDA has increased dietary supplement facility inspections and enforcement actions since 2008 due to mandatory serious adverse event reporting. Industry groups and advocates have challenged regulations perceived to overstep FDA's authority, but legislative action moves forward once consensus is reached among industry, Congress, and the FDA. The mandatory recall authority proffered by FSMA was supported by industry representatives, consumers, the health care and dietary supplement industries, Congress, and federal regulators. Research into supplement effectiveness and safety, industry compliance, surveillance strategies, and enforcement of current authorities are ongoing concerns. Congress and FDA aim to balance safety, effectiveness, access to unbiased information, accurate adverse event reporting, and consumer choice in dietary supplement regulation. The 114th Congress's stance on new dietary supplement legislation remains uncertain. The 114th Congress's consideration of new dietary supplement legislation remains uncertain. Key laws regulating dietary supplements include the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act, and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. These laws provide FDA oversight on safety, nutrition labeling requirements, and moratorium on FDA actions. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 amended the FFDCA to create new manufacturing and labeling requirements for dietary supplements. The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 mandates a chain of possession identification for firms importing components of drugs, devices, food additives, color additives, or dietary supplements. The Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act mandates reporting of any dietary supplement related issues.

The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 mandates a chain of possession identification for firms importing components of drugs, devices, food additives, color additives, or dietary supplements. The Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act (P.L. 109-462) requires reporting of serious adverse events related to dietary supplements to the FDA within 15 days. The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (P.L. 111-353) gives FDA mandatory recall authority for food, including dietary supplements, and requires issuance of NDI guidance within 180 days. The abbreviations include GAO, HHS, NIH, OIG, DSHEA, FDAMA, FFDCA, FSMA, NLEA, CFR, FAERS, GMP, GRAS, NDI, SSA, and IND."
