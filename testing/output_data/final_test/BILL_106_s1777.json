    "content": "The Act titled \"Climate Change Tax Amendments of 1999\" includes a permanent tax credit for research and development related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Act includes an exception for certain research expenses related to reducing greenhouse gases, effective for expenses incurred after the enactment date, contingent on the Climate Change Energy Policy Response Act. SEC. 3 introduces a tax credit for reduced greenhouse gas emissions facilities under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It amends Section 46 to include the reduced greenhouse gas emissions facilities credit and adds a new section 48A for the credit amount calculation. The reduced greenhouse gas emissions facilities credit under Section 46 is based on the qualified investment in a facility that reduces greenhouse gas emissions. The facility must be constructed, acquired, or operated by the taxpayer to qualify for the credit. The reduced greenhouse gas emissions facilities credit under Section 46 is available for facilities that meet specific criteria, including using the same type of fuel as the replaced facility, meeting performance and quality standards jointly prescribed by the Secretary and the Secretary of Energy, and having allowable depreciation or amortization. The applicable percentage for the credit is determined based on these criteria. The applicable percentage for the reduced greenhouse gas emissions facilities credit is one-half of the percentage reduction in emissions reported under the Energy Policy Act of 1992. A qualified investment refers to the basis of a facility that reduces emissions and has production capacity not exceeding the facility being replaced. Qualified progress expenditures can increase the qualified investment for taxpayers who make an election. The qualified investment of a taxpayer for the taxable year can be increased by qualified progress expenditures related to progress expenditure property, which is property being constructed for reduced greenhouse gas emissions facilities. For self-constructed property, qualified progress expenditures are the amount chargeable to capital account during the taxable year. For non-self-constructed property, it refers to the amount paid to another person for construction. Self-constructed property is defined as property where more than half of the construction is reasonable to believe. The term 'non-self-constructed property' refers to property not self-constructed. 'Construction' includes reconstruction and erection. Only construction of reduced greenhouse gas emissions facility is considered if expenditures are properly chargeable to capital account. An election can be made under this subsection for a reduced greenhouse gas emissions facility, with regulations prescribed by the Secretary. Once made, the election applies to the taxable year and all subsequent years, and cannot be revoked without the Secretary's consent. Special rules apply for recapture in the case of any credit allowable by section 48A. The tax increase for a reduced greenhouse gas emissions facility is calculated based on the investment tax credit allowed for prior years, multiplied by a fraction representing the remaining years of depreciation. The year of disposal is considered a year of remaining depreciation. The tax increase for a reduced greenhouse gas emissions facility is calculated based on the investment tax credit allowed for prior years, multiplied by a fraction representing the remaining years of depreciation. The year of disposal is considered a year of remaining depreciation. Rules similar to those for qualified progress expenditures apply, with adjustments made for the amount of tax increase. The tax code for reduced greenhouse gas emissions facilities is amended to include qualified investments. Section 50(a)(4) is also amended to include additional clauses. The tax code is amended to provide a credit for reduced greenhouse gas emissions facilities. The amendments apply to property placed in service after the enactment date. A study will be conducted on additional incentives for voluntary reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The tax code is amended to provide a credit for reduced greenhouse gas emissions facilities, which shall be considered voluntary and non-recoupable under certain conditions. Within 6 months of enactment, a report on the results will be submitted to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Energy. The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Energy will jointly report to Congress on the study results and recommendations for legislative action regarding incentives for greenhouse gas reductions. Congress emphasizes the need for incentives to be available for individuals, organizations, and entities, both for-profit and non-profit, to ensure a level playing field in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Energy will report to Congress on incentives for greenhouse gas reductions for non-profit entities, with recommendations for legislative action within 6 months of the Act's enactment."
