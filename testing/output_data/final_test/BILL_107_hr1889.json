Congress finds that extension services like the Manufacturing Extension Partnership and the Agricultural Extension Service are effective public-private partnerships for integrating new technologies for small to medium-sized manufacturers and the agricultural community. Undergraduate institutions can tailor educational technology programs with nonprofit organizations and government agencies to meet local needs. Over the past 20 years, higher education institutions have integrated educational technologies into their curriculums with support from the National Science Foundation. Many elementary and secondary school systems lack information on integrating technology into the curriculum effectively. Federal and State educational technology programs focus more on acquiring technologies rather than utilizing them in the classroom. The full potential of educational technology has not been realized, hindering the ability to support rapid technological changes in the workforce. Only 1 in 5 teachers feel well-prepared to work in a modern classroom, highlighting the need for more effective professional development. The purpose of this Act is to improve the utilization of educational technologies in elementary and secondary education through an educational technology extension service. A 1998 national survey found that only 19% of teachers had been formally mentored, with 70% finding this collaboration helpful to their teaching. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. The term ``Director'' refers to the Director of the National Science Foundation, and the term ``institution of higher education'' is defined as per the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Director, in cooperation with the Secretary of Education and the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is authorized to provide assistance for the creation and support of regional centers for the utilization of educational technologies (ETU Centers). These centers may be established at various educational entities to enhance the utilization of educational technologies. The ETU Centers aim to enhance the use of educational technologies in elementary and secondary education by advising school administrators, promoting collaboration with various sectors, and disseminating information on educational technology use. The activities of ETU Centers include transferring research findings and expertise to school authorities, training teachers in integrating educational technology into instruction, and advising on technology infrastructure utilization in schools. The ETU Centers provide training and support to teachers, administrators, and school board members on educational technologies, skill set standards, and program administration. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology will publish proposed rules for establishing ETU Centers in the Federal Register within 90 days of the enactment of this Act. The rules will include a program description, applicant procedures, criteria for determining qualified applicants, and criteria for choosing recipients of financial assistance. The Director will publish final rules for the program after a 30-day comment period. Eligible entities can apply for financial support by contributing 50% or more of the proposed ETU Center's costs. The Director, in conjunction with the Secretary of Education and the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, will review each application for the proposed ETU Center's costs. The National Science Foundation will consider the merits of the application, especially regarding adapting training and educational technologies to specific regions. The ETU Center receiving financial assistance will be evaluated in its third year of operation by an appointed panel to measure performance against specified objectives. Funding renewal is contingent on meeting evaluation criteria. The ETU Center must pass a positive evaluation for funding renewal. Authorization of appropriations for the National Science Foundation: $7,000,000 for 2002, $8,500,000 for 2003, and $9,500,000 for 2004."
