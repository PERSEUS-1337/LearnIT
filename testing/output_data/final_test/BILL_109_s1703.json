    "content": "The \"Communications Security Act of 2005\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. Congress finds that the tragic events of September 11, 2001, and Hurricane Katrina exposed significant weaknesses in the communications infrastructure of the United States, leaving the nation largely unprepared for effective communication during emergencies. Despite efforts to improve communications after Hurricane Katrina and 9/11, there is still a need for a comprehensive emergency back-up system to enhance the nation's response capabilities. Deployment of this system is crucial for effective emergency communication. The deployment of a critical emergency communication system is essential for enhancing the overall infrastructure. Additional improvements are needed in training, personnel, equipment, software, and services for local governments to support ongoing efforts in this regard. SEC. 3. EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS BACK-UP SYSTEM. Amends Title III of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to include an Emergency Communications Back-Up System. The Secretary, in conjunction with the FCC, will evaluate creating a back-up emergency communications system within 180 days of the Communications Security Act of 2005. The system will complement existing resources and consider advanced technologies to provide a resilient communications system for emergency responders. This evaluation will include options like satellites, wireless, and terrestrial-based systems. The back-up emergency communications system shall include reliable means of emergency communications and necessary devices for each public safety entity. The evaluation will consider using existing systems, private networks, and technical options for deployment. The Secretary will evaluate the feasibility and cost of necessary changes to emergency communication systems for public safety entities in urban areas and nationwide. A report detailing findings and resources will be submitted to Congress, with authorization for necessary appropriations. If needed, an expedited funding option and implementation strategy will be considered. The Secretary will request appropriations for a back-up communications system within 90 days of submitting the evaluation report. A clerical amendment will be made to the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The Secretary will request appropriations for a back-up communications system within 90 days of submitting the evaluation report, including an emergency communications back-up system under Sec. 317."
