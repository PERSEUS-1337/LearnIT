    "content": "Gradient descent on unregularized logistic regression converges to the same direction as the max-margin solution for separable datasets. The convergence is slow, logarithmic in the loss convergence, explaining the benefit of optimizing even after zero training error. This methodology aids in understanding implicit regularization. Implicit biases introduced by optimization algorithms play a crucial role in deep learning and the generalization ability of learned models. Minimizing training error without explicit regularization over models with more parameters than training examples often leads to good generalization. Optimization algorithms bias towards global minima that generalize well, but understanding these biases in different situations is still lacking. In deep learning, implicit biases introduced by optimization algorithms are crucial for generalization. While we understand implicit regularization with early stopping, for loss functions like logistic loss, there is no finite minimizer on separable problems. Instead, the predictor must diverge towards infinity to minimize the loss. The predictor must diverge towards infinity to minimize the logistic loss on separable data. Even without explicit regularization, when minimizing linearly separable logistic regression problems using gradient descent, w(t)/ w(t) converges to the L2 maximum margin separator. When minimizing linearly separable logistic regression problems using gradient descent, the norm w converges to the L2 maximum margin separator, even without explicit regularization. This behavior is specific to gradient descent and can be changed by using different optimization algorithms. The convergence rate is slow, decreasing only as O(1/ log(t)), explaining why the predictor continues to improve even with a small training loss. The text discusses learning by minimizing an empirical loss for linearly separable problems with smooth, monotone, and non-negative loss functions. It assumes y n = 1 for simplicity and focuses on problems where the dataset is strictly linearly separable. Common loss functions like logistic, exp-loss, probit, and sigmoidal follow the assumptions outlined. The text discusses minimizing an empirical loss for linearly separable problems with smooth, monotone, and non-negative loss functions. It focuses on Gradient Descent convergence to the global minimum without requiring convexity. The text discusses the convergence of Gradient Descent to the global minimum for linearly separable problems with smooth, monotone, and non-negative loss functions. It questions the direction in which the parameter w(t) diverges and analyzes the limit of w(t) / w(t) as t approaches infinity, assuming a \"tight exponential tail\" for the loss function. The text discusses the convergence of Gradient Descent to the global minimum for linearly separable problems with smooth, monotone, and non-negative loss functions. It introduces the concept of a \"tight exponential tail\" for the loss function and presents Theorem 3, which outlines the behavior of gradient descent under certain assumptions. The text discusses the convergence of Gradient Descent to the global minimum for linearly separable problems with smooth, monotone, and non-negative loss functions. It introduces the concept of a \"tight exponential tail\" for the loss function and presents Theorem 3, which outlines the behavior of gradient descent under certain assumptions. The residual \u03c1 (t) is bounded, and the L2 max margin vector \u0175 is the solution to the hard margin SVM. The theorem holds for almost all datasets, particularly with probability 1 if {x_n}^N_n=1 are sampled from an absolutely continuous distribution. The proof sketch explains why an exponential tail of the loss leads to asymptotic convergence to the max margin vector. The text discusses the convergence of Gradient Descent to the global minimum for linearly separable problems with smooth, monotone, and non-negative loss functions. The largest exponents contribute to the gradient, leading to a non-negative linear combination of support vectors. The limit w \u221e is dominated by these gradients, making w \u221e a non-negative linear combination of support vectors. The KKT condition for the SVM problem is satisfied, with \u0175 being its solution. Theorem 3 outlines the behavior of gradient descent, showing that w (t) / w (t) has a limit, g (t) = log (t), and bounds the effect of residual errors. The text discusses the convergence of Gradient Descent to the global minimum for linearly separable problems with smooth, monotone, and non-negative loss functions. It shows that the increment in the norm of \u03c1 (t) is bounded by a converging series, and characterizes the asymptotic behavior of \u03c1 (t) using the KKT conditions of the SVM problem. The refined analysis is provided in Appendix A. The convergence of Gradient Descent to the global minimum for linearly separable problems with smooth, monotone, and non-negative loss functions is discussed. The support vectors span the data, and the normalized weight vector converges to the normalized max margin vector in L2 norm and angle. The convergence is slow, logarithmic in the number of iterations. The convergence of Gradient Descent to the global minimum for linearly separable problems with smooth, monotone, and non-negative loss functions is slow, logarithmic in the number of iterations. The margin converges slowly, contrasting the fast convergence of the training loss. Continuing to optimize the training loss, even after reaching zero error, can still improve generalization performance. The dataset includes positive and negative samples denoted by + and \u2022, with a max margin separating hyperplane. The asymptotic solution of Gradient Descent (GD) and GD with momentum (GDMO) is shown, including the norm of w(t), training loss, angle, and margin gap of w(t) from \u0175. Implementation details include a dataset with support vectors and random datapoints, using a learning rate based on the maximal singular value of X and momentum for GDMO. The norm of w(t) grows logarithmically and converges to the max-margin separator, while the loss decreases rapidly. The margin of w(t) improves, but the expected population loss does not. The direction of w(t) converges towards the max margin predictor \u0175, which may not have zero misclassification error on the population or test set. Using logistic loss, the loss incurred will increase as the norm of w(t) increases. The logistic loss or any convex loss will increase the loss on misclassified points. The population loss increases logarithmically while the margin and misclassification error improve. The increase in test loss is important for monitoring progress. The validation loss increases logarithmically with t, which may indicate overfitting but could actually mean the model is improving. For multi-class problems, predictors are learned for each class using cross-entropy loss with softmax output. The convergence of linear predictors w k (t) when minimizing cross-entropy loss by gradient descent is discussed in Appendix C. In Appendix C, the analysis shows that predictors diverge to infinity and the loss converges to zero when minimizing cross-entropy loss by gradient descent. The loss converges to a logistic loss for transformed data, suggesting convergence to a scaling of the K-class SVM solution. Understanding the implicit bias and convergence rate in different optimization methods is crucial for constructing learning methods attuned to expected inductive biases. In Appendix C, predictors diverge to infinity and loss converges to zero with gradient descent minimizing cross-entropy. Loss converges to logistic loss for transformed data, implying scaling of K-class SVM solution. Understanding bias and convergence in optimization methods is crucial for tailored learning methods. Adding momentum or stochasticity does not affect bias induced by gradient descent. Adaptive methods like AdaGrad and ADAM significantly impact bias. ADAM and gradient descent converge to zero training error solutions, but ADAM does not converge to L2 max margin predictor as predicted by theory. The text discusses the convergence behavior of different optimization methods. While gradient descent converges to the L2 max margin predictor as predicted by theory, ADAM does not. The implicit bias of adaptive methods like ADAM has been a recent topic of interest, with concerns raised about their impact on generalization. The training of a convolutional neural network on CIFAR10 using stochastic gradient descent is analyzed, showing trends in training and validation loss. Wilson et al. discuss the limit of AdaGrad on least square problems but do not provide a clear characterization of this limit. The methodology aims to characterize the implicit bias of optimization methods on logistic regression problems. The analysis is asymptotic, insensitive to initial conditions, and aims to relate bias to potential functions. Mirror descent and natural gradient descent behaviors are of interest, with a conjecture that they converge to the maximum potential margin solution. The analysis focuses on the bias implied by optimization algorithms in logistic regression problems. It considers the regularization path and the effect of optimization algorithms, specifically in the context of linear prediction. Boosting is discussed as a coordinate descent procedure, with a comparison to gradient descent procedures. The study aims to generalize findings on implicit bias in optimization methods. The paper discusses the bias in optimization algorithms for logistic regression, focusing on linear prediction. It aims to generalize results to non-linear models like multi-layer neural networks. Results show how minimizing cross-entropy loss with gradient descent can maximize margins, with validation error improving slowly even after training error is zero. The paper discusses optimizing logistic regression with gradient descent to maximize margins, even with small losses. Results can be applied to multi-layer neural networks, with training error reaching zero after activation units stop switching. BID2 recently studied implicit bias in under-determined matrix factorization problems, minimizing squared loss by gradient descent. The factorization can be seen as a two-layer network, providing insights for studying more complex neural networks. Gunasekar et al. found that gradient descent converges to the minimum nuclear norm solution for under-determined problems with close-to-zero initialization. The implicit bias induced by gradient descent in minimizing smooth monotone loss functions with an exponential tail provides insights into deep learning. Studying logistic loss instead of squared loss could offer a different perspective on the problem. This approach does not rely on initialization or step-size, making it easier to analyze logistic regression on matrix factorization for non-convex optimization. The implicit bias induced by gradient descent in minimizing smooth monotone loss functions with an exponential tail provides insights into deep learning. Gradient descent converges to the maximum L2 margin solution when minimizing logistic loss or exp-loss. The convergence is slow, explaining the need to continue optimization even after zero training error. The bias is independent of step-size and initialization. The implicit bias induced by gradient descent in minimizing smooth monotone loss functions with an exponential tail provides insights into deep learning. Gradient descent leads to a max L2 margin solution, independent of step-size and initialization, even when validation loss increases and training loss decreases slowly. This bias is not well studied and could open doors for further analysis in different optimization methods and models like deep networks. Analyzing gradient descent on logistic/cross-entropy loss is more relevant and technically easier than least square loss. In the following proofs, we define r(t) = w(t) - \u0175 log t - w, where \u0175 is the max margin vector and w satisfies certain conditions. Lemma 8 shows that for almost every dataset, \u03b1 is uniquely defined with no more than d support vectors and \u03b1n = 0 for all n in S. In the context of gradient descent on logistic/cross-entropy loss, the uniqueness of dataset \u03b1 with no more than d support vectors is crucial. The solution to eq. A.1 may not be unique if the support vectors do not span the data. Various positive constants denoted by C_i are independent of t. The orthogonal projection matrix P1 and complementary projection P2 are defined in terms of the subspace spanned by the support vectors. The special case of (u) = e^-u is examined, with a continuous time limit of gradient descent. The proof in this case is self-contained and helps clarify the main ideas of the general proof.

The text discusses the unique \u03b1 that satisfies the KKT conditions for datasets, limiting the number of support vectors to at most d. The KKT conditions entail that \u03b1 n = 0 if n / \u2208 S and 1 = X S\u0175 = X S X S \u03b1 S. For almost every set X, \u03b1 S has a unique solution, implying that \u03b1 n is a rational function in the components of X S.
