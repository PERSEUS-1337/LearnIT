In this Act, key definitions are provided including terms like community development corporation, low-income families, multifamily housing project, Secretary, and severe physical problems. Severe physical problems in a housing unit include lack of hot or cold water, malfunctioning heating system, no electricity, exposed wiring, blown fuses, and dark public hallways. The term \"single family residence\" refers to a 1- to 4-family dwelling held by the Secretary. A multifamily housing project is considered \"substandard\" if at least 25 percent of the units have severe physical problems. The term \"unit of general local government\" has the same meaning as in section. The term \"unoccupied multifamily housing project\" refers to a multifamily housing project certified by the Secretary as uninhabited. SEC. 3. DISPOSITION OF UNOCCUPIED AND SUBSTANDARD PUBLIC HOUSING.

The Secretary is required to establish necessary procedures within 6 months of the Act's enactment."
