    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Partnership for Productive Ports Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings. Congress finds that a network of ports and harbors is crucial for the US economy, trade competitiveness, and national security. The Nation's coastal, ocean, and freshwater resources must be protected and conserved. Port facilities play a vital role in transportation and commerce, requiring timely and environmentally friendly dredging. About 400,000,000 cubic yards of sediment are involved. Approximately 400,000,000 cubic yards of sediment are dredged from our Nation's ports each year, with 300,000,000 cubic yards from Federal channels. Improved environmental responsibility is needed for dredged material that could harm human health or the environment. Federal navigation dredging projects should not be hindered by a lack of suitable disposal sites. The cost of sediment disposal is a significant part of navigation project expenses. The purpose of this Act is to provide cost-sharing for the construction and operation of confined disposal facilities for contaminated dredged materials to offer alternatives to open water disposal. Inconsistent cost-sharing policies create incentives for using open water disposal sites over more environmentally friendly options. SEC. 3. CREATION OF CONFINED DREDGED MATERIAL DISPOSAL FACILITIES. The Federal share for confined disposal facilities under the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 is amended to include cost sharing requirements for project features necessary for creating such facilities. This applies to projects authorized before, on, or after the enactment date. The term 'confined disposal facility' is defined as an alternative to ocean disposal, including subaqueous borrow pits and containment islands. Amendments to the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 include cost sharing requirements for project features related to creating such facilities. Amendments to the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 include cost sharing requirements for project features related to creating confined dredged material disposal facilities. Amendments to the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 now include funding priority for operation and maintenance costs related to disposal of dredged materials in confined facilities. Additionally, a confined disposal facility is to be established in the Port of New York and New Jersey. The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 now prioritizes funding for confined disposal facilities for dredged materials. A facility will be created in the Port of New York and New Jersey within 18 months of the Act's enactment for materials not suitable for open water disposal."
