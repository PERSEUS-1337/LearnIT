While most Americans get coverage through the private sector, public entities are playing a larger role. The IRS rule in 1954 exempted employer contributions to health insurance from being taxed, which helped increase employer-sponsored health benefits. Rising medical costs have posed challenges for certain consumer groups. Government efforts to assist health care consumers in paying for medical services through Medicare and Medicaid programs, HIPAA providing protections to workers switching jobs, and the ACA reforming the private insurance market and expanding publicly funded coverage. Legislation continues to be introduced to modify the health insurance system. Health insurance provides protection against financial loss from high healthcare expenses by spreading out costs and minimizing risk for individuals. The concept of insurance is based on the likelihood and magnitude of financial loss, with all parties seeking to reduce their own risk. In health insurance, consumers and insurers manage insurance risk differently. Insurers charge higher premiums for older consumers to manage the risk of increasing medical expenses with age. Both parties aim to minimize risk in an uncertain future to make financial loss more predictable. Insurance spreads risk across a group by having people contribute to a common pool. Insurers charge premiums to finance health coverage, with the premium reflecting the expected cost of claims for healthcare use in a year. Insuring larger groups is considered less risky as the costs of healthcare services used by a few individuals are spread over the entire group. Insurance spreads risk by having individuals contribute to a common pool, with premiums reflecting the expected cost of healthcare claims. Equilibrium in the risk pool is achieved when insurers accurately estimate future costs and set appropriate premium levels. Healthy individuals often subsidize the higher costs of less healthy individuals, as a minority of consumers account for a majority of expenses. This redistributive effect is a key feature of insurance due to the uneven distribution of healthcare expenses. The composition of a risk pool is crucial for spreading costs, with factors like individual health status and income influencing a consumer's decision to obtain health coverage. Employer subsidies also incentivize individuals, even those unlikely to incur high medical expenses, to get insurance. Individuals are incentivized to obtain health coverage due to employer subsidies and legal requirements. Those expecting high medical expenses tend to enroll in more expensive plans, leading to adverse selection. This can result in higher costs, causing healthier individuals to leave the risk pool, leaving a less healthy group behind. Health insurance can be provided to groups through employers or organizations, known as group coverage. The group market is divided into small and large groups based on employer size. Adverse selection can lead to rising costs and a less healthy risk pool, potentially causing the group to dissolve. The group insurance market is divided into small and large groups based on employer size. The dividing line between small and large groups was typically 50 employees before the ACA, but will increase to 100 employees in 2016. Businesses with fewer than 100 employees will be eligible for small group coverage. States can choose to define small employers as those with 50 or fewer employees until the 100 employee large group definition takes effect in 2016. Consumers without group coverage can purchase health insurance directly from insurers in the individual market. In the individual insurance market, people without employer coverage can buy health insurance directly from insurers. Fully insured plans involve purchasing coverage from an insurance carrier, while self-insured plans are provided directly by the organization. Under self-insurance, organizations directly pay for health benefits for their members, bearing the risk for covering medical expenses. These benefit plans are not subject to state insurance regulations. Firms may use third-party administrators (TPAs) for administrative duties. Self-only coverage refers to the policyholder being the only person insured. Health insurance coverage in the United States is delivered through a patchwork approach, including private and public sources. Employer-sponsored health coverage is encouraged through tax incentives, with employer contributions not taxed as part of workers' income. This tax preference aims to increase workers' enrollment in health coverage provided by their employers. Employer-sponsored health coverage in the United States is encouraged through tax incentives, with premium contributions excluded from wages for tax calculations. This tax exclusion affects the amounts paid in employment taxes, such as Social Security and Medicare taxes. Additionally, employer-sponsored health coverage allows for recruitment and retention of workers, offering access to better plan choices at lower rates. However, economic theory suggests that workers may receive reduced wages to offset richer benefits. The tax exclusion of health benefits is a primary reason why health insurance coverage is mainly provided through the workplace in the United States, with approximately 53.9% of Americans having employer-sponsored insurance in 2013. In 2013, approximately 53.9% of Americans had employer-sponsored insurance, which is the largest tax expenditure by the federal government. The tax exclusion for employer-sponsored insurance cost the government $248 billion in 2013. Private health insurance plans require a monthly premium for coverage, with cost-sharing between the insurer and the enrollee. Premiums cover medical claims, administrative costs, and profit margins. Premiums for U.S. insurance plans cover medical claims, administrative costs, and a profit margin. Claims payments make up the largest portion of premiums, ranging from 85% to 88% of fully insured plans. Rising prices, not quantity, drive total payments. Administrative costs and a profit margin of less than 5% make up the rest of premiums. Plans can be arranged by an employer or purchased individually, covering a single person, a family, or a combination. The average annual premium for self-only coverage in 2014 was $6,025, while for a family of four, it was $16,834. Employer-sponsored health benefits costs remained steady for self-only coverage but increased by 3% for family coverage. Despite a slight decrease in premium growth rates, they still outpaced wage growth and general inflation. Nongroup premiums have also risen in recent years. Health insurance companies require specialized expertise and technology to operate. Administrative expenses, including provider contracting, sales, marketing, and customer service, are essential components of premiums. From 2009 to 2013, administrative costs and claims adjustment expenses made up 11.7% to 12.1% of insurers' net written premiums. Insurers report these costs in regulatory filings to state entities, showing a stable trend. Health insurance regulation addresses various issues such as required benefits, availability to individuals, and insurer responsibilities. The debate over whether regulation should be handled by states or the federal government has been ongoing. State regulations, governed by the McCarran-Ferguson Act, set standards for insurance business practices, including financial requirements and benefit mandates for state-licensed carriers. The regulation of health insurance involves required benefits and insurer responsibilities. State regulations, governed by the McCarran-Ferguson Act, set standards for insurance business practices. Fully-insured plans must offer mandated benefits, while self-insured plans are exempt from state requirements. Federal laws like ERISA, HIPAA, and ACA also impact private health insurance provision. ERISA, a federal law, regulates employee benefit plans, including health benefits, to ensure prudent fund handling and disclosure of financial activities. It preempts state laws for consistency across states but allows state laws for insurance-related issues. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) aimed to address concerns about losing health coverage when changing jobs or health plans. It established federal requirements for employer-sponsored health plans, including coverage availability, limits on preexisting condition exclusions, and prohibition of health status discrimination. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted in 2010 to expand health coverage through tax provisions and private insurance requirements. It includes provisions for tax-advantaged medical savings accounts, increased deductions for self-employed individuals, and regulations on electronic health information transmission and privacy. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) includes private insurance provisions that impose new requirements on individuals, employers, and health plans. It provides financial assistance to certain individuals and small employers through market reforms, insurance exchanges, subsidies, individual mandate, and penalties for non-compliance. Americans obtain health insurance from various sources, including the private sector and government. The ACA includes private insurance provisions that impose new requirements on individuals, employers, and health plans. Private insurance can be obtained through various sources, such as the private sector or government. In 2013, approximately 201 million individuals received coverage through private insurance, which includes employer-sponsored and individual market coverage. The ACA introduced significant reforms to the private insurance market. The ACA introduced significant reforms to the private insurance market, focusing on the individual and small group markets. Group health insurance is mainly provided by employers, covering approximately 169 million individuals in 2013. Insurers use strategies like open enrollment periods to ensure balanced risk pools. Employers use strategies like open enrollment periods to encourage healthy workers to take up health insurance, with subsidies covering most of the premium costs. This helps avoid adverse selection and maintains the stability of the risk pool. Employer-sponsored health insurance (ESI) offers tax advantages and subsidies for workers, making it more advantageous than individual insurance. For employers, health benefits are a key component of employee compensation used for recruitment and retention. Additionally, employer premium contributions are excluded from wages for tax purposes, benefiting both employers and workers. Large employers offering health coverage meeting ACA standards comply with employer requirements, avoiding noncompliance tax. Small employers may qualify for tax credits if they contribute to employees' health insurance costs. Challenges of employer-sponsored health insurance include lack of portability and trade-offs between wages and benefits for workers. Workers who do not enroll in employer-sponsored health insurance may receive lower wages for unused benefits, leading to a lack of awareness of healthcare costs. Sponsors struggle to control costs by increasing employee contributions, while the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored insurance is a significant loss of revenue. The individual insurance market serves those unable to access workplace coverage. The individual insurance market provides coverage for those who cannot access employer-sponsored insurance or public programs like Medicare and Medicaid. It caters to part-time workers, self-employed individuals, and those in-between jobs. Only 11% of the U.S. population was covered by individual insurance in 2013, and ACA reforms target this market specifically. The ACA's insurance market reforms in 2013 focused on the individual insurance market, addressing issues such as denial of coverage, higher premiums based on individual characteristics, and benefit exclusions for preexisting conditions. State laws varied in patient protections prior to the ACA. The reforms and exchange provisions under the ACA impacted the offer, issuance, generosity, and pricing of health plans, including the establishment of a new tax credit for qualified individuals and families to purchase insurance through exchanges. The ACA requires the establishment of health insurance exchanges in every state, where individuals and small businesses can shop for private health insurance. States can choose to run their own exchange, opt for a state-federal partnership, or have a federally facilitated exchange. Enrollment in the individual insurance market may increase due to ACA's market reforms, exchanges, and tax credits. The ACA's market reforms, health insurance exchanges, and tax credits are projected to increase nongroup insurance coverage by 20 million by 2024. In 2013, 107.6 million people in the U.S. got health coverage through government-administered programs, with almost 49 million individuals covered by Medicare. Medicare consists of four parts: Part A, Hospital Insurance; Part B, Supplementary Medical Insurance; Part C, Medicare Advantage; and Part D, the prescription drug benefit, providing coverage for a wide range of medical services. Medicaid covers approximately 54.1 million low-income Americans and is a joint federal and state program with means-tested eligibility criteria. Medicaid provides health care coverage for low-income adults, children, the elderly, and persons with disabilities. It is jointly funded by federal and state governments and administered by the states within federal guidelines. States must offer federally specified benefits like hospital services, physician services, nursing home care, home health care, and services for children, with the option to cover additional services and beneficiaries. The State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) was established in 1997 to provide health coverage to uninsured low-income children who are ineligible for Medicaid. States have the option to expand Medicaid, create a separate CHIP program, or a combination of both. States that expand Medicaid to CHIP eligibles must provide mandatory Medicaid benefits and optional services specified in their state Medicaid plans. In 2013, approximately 14.1 million persons were covered by health care services for military servicemembers and veterans provided by the Department of Defense (DOD) through TRICARE or by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) through the VA system and CHAMPVA. In 2013, TRICARE and VA health care services covered millions of military servicemembers, veterans, and their dependents. TRICARE is administered regionally and includes active duty personnel, Reserve Component members, retirees, and survivors. The VA system is veteran-specific, providing care based on eligibility criteria such as veteran status, service-connected disabilities, and income. CHAMPVA covers a select group of dependents. Despite various insurance options, many Americans remain uninsured. In 2013, approximately 42 million Americans (13.4% of the population) lacked health insurance coverage due to accessibility and affordability issues, especially among the under-65 population. A significant proportion of the uninsured were in low-income families, with most having ties to the paid labor force. Over 80% of the uninsured are in families headed by workers, who may decline employer-offered insurance due to cost, work for small firms that don't provide benefits, or choose to go without coverage. Despite the prevalence of employer-sponsored insurance, factors like employment status, health conditions, and financial resources historically hinder coverage. Health insurance is valuable for accessing expensive healthcare services, even though it's not essential for receiving care. Health insurance is crucial for accessing costly healthcare services, especially as healthcare costs rise. It provides protection for those with limited means or high medical needs. Uninsured individuals are more likely to skip necessary care, leading to worse health outcomes. Having health insurance ensures a usual source of care, which is important for ongoing healthcare needs. The ACA requires individuals to maintain health insurance coverage or pay a penalty. The penalty for noncompliance increases annually based on income percentage. Expanding coverage is a primary goal of the ACA. The Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the ACA will increase the number of nonelderly Americans with health insurance by about 26 million by 2024. The share of nonelderly U.S. residents with insurance coverage in 2024 is estimated to be around 89%. Approximately 31 million nonelderly U.S. residents are estimated to remain uninsured, including those who choose not to purchase health insurance and are subject to penalties. The U.S. health insurance system is a mix of private and government sources, with a majority obtaining insurance through the private sector in 2013. In 2013, 34.3% of Americans were covered by public programs like Medicare and Medicaid/CHIP, while 13.4% were uninsured for the entire year. Health insurance in the U.S. varies by market structure, regulations, and different delivery and financing arrangements. The ACA brought reforms to the private insurance market and expanded publicly funded coverage. Health coverage in the U.S. is delivered and financed through various arrangements, influenced by factors like payment, access, and flexibility for enrollees. Indemnity insurance allows the insured person to choose their healthcare providers and services, with claims filed retrospectively for reimbursement. In the U.S., health care delivery and financing are kept separate, with payments made retrospectively for services rendered. Critics argue that this fee-for-service model incentivizes providers to over-treat patients for higher revenue. By the 1970s, interest grew in alternative models like managed care for cost control. Managed care models, with cost control as a key feature, integrate service delivery and financing functions. Managed care organizations (MCOs) use techniques like restricting access to in-network providers, gatekeeping for specialty care, disease management, and pre-certification for hospital care to control costs and manage health service use. MCOs offer different health plans varying in cost and medical decision-making control. Managed care models involve varying levels of cost and medical decision control in health plans, leading to different enrollee costs. The more tightly managed a plan is, the lower the premium. Managed care emphasizes preventive health care and quality assurance processes. Federal legislation in the 1970s supported the growth of managed care, particularly in the form of HMOs. Market competition among MCOs led to decreased premiums to attract enrollees, especially during high medical inflation in the 1980s and 1990s. By the mid-1990s, more insured workers were enrolled in HMOs than any other health plan type. In the latter half of the 1990s, a backlash against managed care grew as some enrollees grew weary of restrictions. MCOs raised premiums to increase revenue, leading to accusations of prioritizing cost control over healthcare. Providers resented managed care's role in medical decision-making, causing many enrollees to leave HMOs. The industry responded by offering less tightly managed, but more costly insurance products. Traditional HMOs widened provider networks and eliminated gatekeeping functions, while employers offered less tightly managed plan types. By the end of the 1990s, as the influence of managed care waned and health care costs rose, employers began passing expenses to enrollees by increasing contributions. This led to a shift towards less tightly managed plan types like preferred provider organizations (PPOs) over HMOs. Consumer-driven health care emerged as an alternative to managed care. Consumer-driven health care has been proposed as an alternative to managed care, aiming to give consumers incentives to control their health services usage and costs. This model shifts some cost and service control responsibilities from managed care organizations to enrollees, with the expectation that increased cost-consciousness will lead to lower overall health expenses. Consumer-driven health care involves the use of health savings accounts (HSAs), which are investment accounts where tax-free contributions can be made by consumers or their employers to cover medical expenses not covered by insurance. HSAs are paired with high-deductible health plans, and any unused contributions roll over to the next year. Once the deductible level is reached, coverage from the health plan takes effect. HSAs were authorized in 2003 under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act. Proponents of consumer-directed health care advocate for increased individual responsibility in healthcare use and expenses, leading to better-informed consumers and lower overall spending. Opponents raise concerns about the approach not considering varying health conditions and benefiting the wealthy more than the less well-off. Recent trends show a decline in popularity of HMOs among covered workers, with PPOs making up the majority of employer-sponsored insurance. PPOs have dominated the employer-sponsored insurance market, with a 58% share in 2014. High-deductible plans with HSAs have also gained popularity, comprising about a fifth of enrollment. In the individual insurance market, PPOs are overwhelmingly popular, accounting for over 80% of self-only plans and over 70% of family plans in 2009. In contrast, HMOs are relatively unpopular, declining from about 6% of self-only plans in 2004 to about 2% in 2009."
