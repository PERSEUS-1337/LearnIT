    "content": "The \"Continuity of Congress Act of 2003\" is cited as the short title. It addresses the filling of vacancies and incapacities in Congress following a catastrophic incident. The \"Continuity of Congress Act of 2003\" allows states to enact laws determining how to fill House of Representatives vacancies if one-fourth of members are incapacitated or killed. Options include special elections, appointment by the governor or legislature, or appointment from a list of successors created by the incumbent member. The \"Continuity of Congress Act of 2003\" allows states to determine procedures for filling House of Representatives vacancies due to incapacitation or death of one-fourth of members. Options include special elections or appointments by the governor or legislature. Vacancies must be filled within 120 days, and incapacitated members can reclaim their office when no longer incapacitated. One-fourth of House of Representatives members can be declared killed or incapacitated by the Speaker of the House and the minority party leader, or by individual state governors certifying their representatives' status, with final certification by the President. In the event that one-fourth of the Senate members are killed or incapacitated, each State can enact laws to determine replacements, which may include appointment by the governor or legislature, or based on a list created by the incumbent member. If one-fourth of Senate members are incapacitated or killed, replacements can be determined by the State through various procedures, such as appointment by the governor or legislature, or based on a list created by the incumbent member. Members can reclaim their office once they are no longer incapacitated. If one-fourth of Senate members are incapacitated or killed, replacements can be determined by the State through certification by governors and the President. The Act does not limit any State's authority to fill vacancies in the House of Representatives or the Senate. It will take effect upon ratification of the related constitutional amendment."
