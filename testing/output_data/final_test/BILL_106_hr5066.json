    "content": "The term 'joint resolution' refers to a resolution introduced by a qualifying Member after the President's report on the deployment of a National Missile Defense system is received by Congress. The resolution must not have a preamble and must be titled 'Joint resolution relating to deployment of a National Missile Defense system.' A qualifying Member is specified for the House of Representatives. In the House of Representatives, the majority or minority leader or a designated Member can introduce a joint resolution. In the Senate, the majority or minority leader or a designated Member can do the same. Provisions from the National Missile Defense Deployment Criteria Act of 2000 apply to these resolutions. SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON OBLIGATION OF FUNDS FOR PROCUREMENT FOR NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM. No funds for the Department of Defense procurement can be used for the National Missile Defense system without the President submitting a report on testing against countermeasures and a joint resolution concurring in the certification. The President must certify that there is an adequate testing program in place to meet identified threats and that sufficient ground and flight testing has been conducted against likely countermeasures. The President must certify an adequate testing program for the National Missile Defense system against likely countermeasures. A joint resolution is required for funding, confirming the testing program's realism. The Missile Defense Deployment Criteria Act of 2000 establishes a program for realistic testing of the National Missile Defense system against countermeasures. Qualifying members include leaders of the House and Senate or designated members. A joint resolution is needed for funding and confirming the testing program's realism. The Missile Defense Deployment Criteria Act of 2000 requires a joint resolution for funding and confirming a testing program for the National Missile Defense system. If a committee does not report the joint resolution within 60 legislative days, it will be discharged and placed on the House calendar. After the committee reports or is discharged, any House member can move to proceed with the resolution. The Missile Defense Deployment Criteria Act of 2000 mandates a joint resolution for funding and confirming a testing program for the National Missile Defense system. If a committee fails to report the resolution within 60 legislative days, it will be placed on the House calendar. Any House member can then move to proceed with the resolution, which will lead to a two-hour debate before a vote. The joint resolution process for the Missile Defense Deployment Criteria Act of 2000 includes limitations on amendments, debate, and motions such as tabling or reconsideration. Appeals on procedural decisions are decided without debate, and the resolution is considered in the Senate according to specific provisions. If one House receives a joint resolution from the other House, it impacts the passage process. The joint resolution process for the Missile Defense Deployment Criteria Act of 2000 includes limitations on amendments, debate, and motions. If one House receives a joint resolution from the other House, specific procedures apply for consideration and final passage. The joint resolution process for the Missile Defense Deployment Criteria Act of 2000 includes limitations on amendments, debate, and motions. In the computation of the period of 60 days, a legislative day is a calendar day when the House is in session. The provisions of this subsection are enacted by Congress as part of the rules of either House. The joint resolution process for the Missile Defense Deployment Criteria Act of 2000 includes limitations on amendments, debate, and motions, with recognition of the constitutional right of either House to change rules related to procedures at any time. SEC. 5. OPERATIONALLY REALISTIC TESTING AGAINST COUNTERMEASURES FOR NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE. The Secretary of Defense directs the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization to include countermeasures in testing the National Missile Defense system before it becomes operational. This includes testing against likely decoys and determining the system's ability to discriminate between warheads. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Director of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, will determine additional funding needed for the National Missile Defense system to meet requirements for discriminating between warheads and countermeasures. The Secretary of Defense is required to submit an annual report to Congress by April 15 each year. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Director of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, will determine additional funding needed for the National Missile Defense system to meet requirements for discriminating between warheads and countermeasures. The Secretary shall submit an annual report to Congress by April 15 each year, detailing efforts to establish a program for operationally realistic testing of the system against countermeasures. The report will include assessments of countermeasures available to foreign countries, the system's ability to defeat them, and plans to demonstrate this capability. The Secretary of Defense may arrange for an independent panel of scientific experts to assess the countermeasures against the National Missile Defense system, its operational effectiveness, and the adequacy of the testing program. No annual report is required once the system is operational. The Panel evaluates the ground and flight testing of the National Missile Defense system to determine operational effectiveness and ability to counter likely countermeasures. It assesses the system's capability to discriminate between warheads and countermeasures. The Panel evaluates the National Missile Defense system's testing for operational effectiveness and countering countermeasures. It submits an annual report with recommendations for improving the system's capabilities. Countermeasures are defined as deliberate actions by countries with ballistic missiles to defeat the defense system.

Countermeasures are defined as deliberate actions by countries with ballistic missiles to defeat the defense system. The use of anti-simulation and decoys like Mylar balloons disguise the warhead's signature, while a shroud cooled with liquid nitrogen reduces the infrared signature."
