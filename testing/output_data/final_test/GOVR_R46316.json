    "content": "The global pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is impacting communities worldwide and in the United States, with efforts to slow transmission and support the healthcare system. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) is one of three laws enacted to aid the pandemic response, providing funding and waivers for telehealth services. The CARES Act, enacted on March 27, 2020, includes provisions for COVID-19 vaccine coverage, economic stimulus, and a $100 billion Provider Relief Fund to assist healthcare facilities. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) includes provisions related to HHS social services programs and federal nutrition programs. Some provisions have been amended by the CARES Act. This report will not be updated to reflect subsequent actions. The House passed H.R. 6201 on March 14, 2020. The House passed H.R. 6201, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, by a vote of 363-40 under the suspension of the rules procedure. The bill was introduced on March 11, 2020, and referred to multiple committees. The House amended and passed the bill with unanimous consent on March 16, 2020. The House passed H.R. 6201, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, by a vote of 363-40. The engrossed version was sent to the Senate, which passed the bill 90-8 on March 18, 2020. The President signed it into law the same day, becoming P.L. 116-127. The act increases appropriations for testing and services related to COVID-19. The FFCRA provides coverage for COVID-19 testing and related services without cost sharing for individuals under various healthcare plans, including Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, TRICARE, and private insurance. Utilization management tools like prior authorization are prohibited for private health insurance and Medicare Advantage plans. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) increases Medicaid funding for all states, the District of Columbia, and territories, and modifies Medicare telehealth restrictions during the emergency. It also waives liability for manufacturers, distributors, or providers of specified respiratory protective devices used for COVID-19 response. The act is estimated to increase discretionary spending by $2.4 billion from emergency supplemental appropriations. The estimates for the Families First Coronavirus Response Act include increasing discretionary spending by $2.4 billion from emergency supplemental appropriations, with key terms like emergency period, COVID-19 testing, and uninsured individuals defined in the report. Several provisions in Division F refer to the emergency period defined in Section 1135 of the Social Security Act. Section 1135 of the Social Security Act allows the HHS Secretary to waive requirements during emergencies, specifically referring to the COVID-19 outbreak. Division F provisions are effective during the public health emergency period declared on January 31, 2020, and become effective as of the date of enactment of FFCRA on March. The FFCRA provisions for COVID-19 testing coverage became effective on March 18, 2020, covering various healthcare plans and uninsured individuals. Division F outlines requirements for testing and related services without cost sharing. The FFCRA provisions for COVID-19 testing coverage include coverage for in vitro diagnostic products approved under specific regulations. Diagnostic testing identifies the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, aiding in the diagnosis of COVID-19. In Vitro Diagnostics (IVDs) are medical devices used in laboratory analysis of human samples. In Vitro Diagnostics (IVDs) are medical devices used in various settings for diagnosing diseases. IVDs include reagents, instruments, and systems intended for disease diagnosis, treatment, or prevention. FDA regulates IVDs through premarket review processes such as Premarket Approval (PMA), 510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for public health emergencies. The FFCRA provisions refer to COVID-19 testing and ancillary services related to health care items and services. Definitions and terms were amended in the CARES Act, with ancillary services defined as items and services provided during health care provider office visits. The definition of health care provider office visits includes in-person and telehealth visits, urgent care center visits, and emergency room visits related to in vitro diagnostic products. This may involve additional diagnostic testing but does not cover treatment for COVID-19 illnesses. Enforcement and implementation details are discussed in the \"Section 6001. Coverage of Testing for COVID-19\" section. The curr_chunk discusses various amendments to different sections of the Social Security Act related to private health insurance coverage, Medicaid, CHIP, TRICARE, veterans health care, federal civilian employee health coverage, and IHS, all referencing FFCRA Section 6001(a)(1)-(2). Additionally, appropriations provided in FFCRA Division A to the Defense Health Program are mentioned. The curr_chunk discusses the use of appropriations from FFCRA Division A for COVID-19 testing and related services, with specific provisions for uninsured individuals. It highlights that Medicare, Medicare Advantage, and Medicaid/CHIP programs do not directly reference FFCRA Section 6001(a)(1)-(2) but amend the Social Security Act for coverage. Section 6004 allows states to use Medicaid to provide COVID-19 testing at no cost to uninsured individuals. \"Uninsured individual\" in Title V refers to those not enrolled in federal health care programs or private insurance plans. This provision aims to reimburse healthcare providers for COVID-19 testing costs for uninsured individuals. Section 6004 allows states to use Medicaid to provide COVID-19 testing at no cost to uninsured individuals, who are not enrolled in federal health care programs or private insurance plans. Individuals with short-term, limited duration insurance (STLDI) may be considered uninsured for testing assistance under Title V. Section 6004 expands the definition of \"uninsured individual\" for COVID-19 testing under Medicaid, including those not enrolled in federal health care programs, private insurance plans, or FEHB. It also excludes Medicaid-eligible individuals under certain pathways. The criteria are similar to Title V, with slight wording differences. See Section 6004 for more details on COVID-19 testing without cost-sharing under Medicaid. The FFCRA Division A provides supplemental appropriations for health care-related expenses in the Defense Health Program, Veterans Health Administration, and HHS accounts without cost-sharing under Medicaid. The Defense Health Program funds various functions of the Military Health System, including health care services, medical readiness activities, and research. Congress appropriated $34.4 billion to the DHP for FY2020, with an additional $82 billion allocated by FFCRA. These appropriations are designated as emergency requirements and are not subject to discretionary spending limits. For FY2020, Congress appropriated $34.4 billion to the DHP. FFCRA allocated an extra $82 million for COVID-19 testing and related services until September 30, 2022. The IHS under HHS is responsible for improving the health of American Indians and Alaska Natives, providing healthcare to around 2.6 million eligible individuals in FY2019 with a $6.1 billion appropriation in FY2020. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides a range of clinical services and public health activities at its facilities, including inpatient, outpatient, laboratory testing, and emergency care. IHS does not have a standard benefit package and is not required to cover certain services. An additional $64 million was allocated for COVID-19 testing and related services under the FFCRA Section 6007. The Indian Health Service received an additional $64 million for COVID-19 testing and related services under the FFCRA Section 6007. Congress has provided appropriations for limited mechanisms to address uncompensated health care costs during public health emergencies, but there is no federal program specifically for this purpose. The financial pressures faced by uninsured and underinsured individuals during the COVID-19 outbreak have sparked congressional interest in addressing these issues. The CARES Act appropriates $100 billion for the \"Provider Relief Fund\" to assist healthcare facilities and providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The FFCRA utilizes the NDMS Definitive Care Reimbursement Program for federal payment for COVID-19 testing and services for uninsured individuals. FFCRA provides $1 billion to the PHSSEF to fund this approach. The CARES Act provides funding for healthcare facilities and providers during the COVID-19 pandemic, including one-time and annual funding for the HHS ASPR office. It covers COVID-19 testing, administration, and related services for uninsured individuals. The additional funds are designated as emergency spending and are available until expended. The VHA of the VA provides healthcare to eligible veterans and their dependents through five appropriations accounts. The VHA is funded through five appropriations accounts for medical care for veterans, with FFCRA providing $60 million in supplemental appropriations for COVID-19 testing and related services. The additional funds are designated as emergency spending and are available until September 30, 2022. Title VII of the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) includes provisions related to COVID-19 testing. Section 1702 was repealed and replaced with a requirement for laboratories to report testing data to HHS. Laboratories typically report testing results for notifiable conditions to state health departments. The CDC works with jurisdictions and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) to track national notifiable conditions, including infectious diseases and lead poisoning. COVID-19 is a reportable disease in all jurisdictions, with data on cases and test results sent to CDC. The FDA may require labs conducting Emergency Use Authorization tests to comply with state and local reporting requirements. FFCRA Section 1702 would have mandated real-time reporting of testing data to State Emergency Operations Centers. Private health insurance is the main source of coverage in the US, available through individual plans or employer-sponsored group plans. Benefits and costs vary by plan type. The federal government and states regulate private health insurance coverage, with varying requirements by plan type. FFCRA now mandates most plans to cover COVID-19 testing and related services. Some states and insurers have also implemented additional coverage requirements. The FFCRA mandates most health insurance plans to cover COVID-19 testing and related services without cost-sharing. This includes individual and group plans, but not short-term, limited-duration plans. Grandfathered plans are also required to comply with these coverage requirements. Plans that maintain their grandfathered status are exempt from some federal requirements, but FFCRA specifies that Section 6001 applies to them. The coverage requirements in this act apply only to specified items and services during the emergency period starting from March 18, 2020. Secretaries of HHS, Labor, and Treasury are required to enforce these provisions as if they were part of PHSA, ERISA, and IRC. CBO estimates Section 6001 will decrease federal revenues by $4 million and increase federal outlays by $7 million over FY2020\u2013FY2022. The FFCRA eliminates Medicare Part B beneficiary cost-sharing for outpatient clinical laboratory tests, including those for COVID-19, with no coinsurance, co-payments, or deductibles for covered services. The FFCRA eliminates Medicare Part B beneficiary cost-sharing for COVID-19 testing-related services, including outpatient clinical lab services. Beneficiaries are not responsible for coinsurance or deductibles for specified COVID-19 testing-related services during the emergency period. This applies to various medical visit categories and Medicare payment systems. The HHS Secretary will provide coding modifiers for waived cost-sharing services in various payment systems. Enacting Sections 6002 and 6003 may increase direct spending by $6.7 billion over FY2020-FY2022. Medicare Advantage offers covered benefits through private health plans with equivalent cost-sharing to original Medicare. Private Medicare Advantage plans must offer cost-sharing that is actuarially equivalent to original Medicare, but they can use different techniques to manage care. The plans are required to cover COVID-19 testing and related services without cost-sharing or prior authorization during the emergency period. The HHS Secretary can implement Sections 6002 and 6003 to increase federal spending by $6.7 billion over FY2020-FY2022. Medicaid is a federal-state program financing medical services for low-income populations, with states having flexibility in program design. Coverage includes primary and acute-care services, as well as long-term services and supports, varying across states. Medicaid enrollees have access to different services based on their eligibility pathway. Traditional Medicaid covers specific required services and optional services, while alternative benefit plans provide comprehensive coverage based on a benchmark. ABPs must include essential health benefits. States implementing the ACA Medicaid expansion must provide Alternative Benefit Plan (ABP) coverage to eligible individuals, with limited beneficiary cost sharing. The State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) offers coverage to uninsured children and some pregnant women with higher incomes than Medicaid allows. CHIP is a program for pregnant women with higher incomes than Medicaid allows, jointly financed by the federal government and states. States have flexibility in designing their own version of CHIP, which can be a Medicaid expansion, a separate program, or a combination. Benefit coverage and cost-sharing rules vary depending on the program design. States have flexibility in designing their own version of CHIP, which can be a Medicaid expansion, a separate program, or a combination. Benefit coverage and cost-sharing rules vary depending on the program design. Medicaid must cover emergency services, well-baby and well-child care, dental services, and COVID-19 testing and related services without charging beneficiary cost sharing during the public health emergency. FFCRA allows states to extend COVID-19 testing and related services without cost sharing to uninsured individuals during the public health emergency. Uninsured individuals are those not eligible for Medicaid or enrolled in federal health care programs or private insurance plans. The law provides 100% federal matching rate for medical assistance. The law provides 100% federal matching rate for medical assistance and administrative costs for uninsured individuals eligible for Medicaid. CHIP programs must cover COVID-19 testing without cost sharing for enrollees during the public health emergency. CBO estimates a $1.9 billion increase in federal spending for FY2020 and FY2021. The PREP Act allows the federal government to waive liability for medical countermeasures during public health emergencies. FFCRA includes personal respiratory protective devices approved by NIOSH and used for COVID-19 response. The CARES Act defines covered devices for compensation. The amendment to the PREP Act allows for the use of covered personal respiratory protective devices approved by NIOSH during public health emergencies without FDA authorization. This extends authority to these devices for both COVID-19 and future emergencies. The Department of Defense administers health entitlements to 9.5 million beneficiaries through the Military Health System. The Military Health System provides health entitlements to 9.5 million beneficiaries through military treatment facilities and civilian providers participating in TRICARE. TRICARE plan options have different cost-sharing features, but FFCRA waives cost-sharing requirements for COVID-19 testing and related services. Veterans enrolled in the VA health care system receive a standard medical package that includes laboratory services. The VA provides a standard medical package that includes laboratory services. Veterans do not have to pay copayments for services related to service-connected conditions or preventive screenings. FFCRA requires the VA Secretary to waive copayments for COVID-19 testing and related services. The FEHB Program provides health insurance to federal employees, retirees, and their dependents with varying cost-sharing requirements. FFCRA mandates no copayments for COVID-19 testing and related services for federal civil servants and FEHB enrollees during the emergency period. IHS provides healthcare to eligible American Indians/Alaska Natives directly or through tribal facilities. Services vary by facility, and IHS does not offer a standard benefit package. Payment may be authorized through the Purchased Referred Care Program when services are not available. PRC funds are limited, and prior approval is generally required. The Purchased Referred Care Program (PRC) provides limited funds for emergency claims, with specific criteria for authorization. The Indian Health Service (IHS) is required to cover COVID-19 testing costs without any cost-sharing requirements for eligible individuals, including those served by Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs). The federal government's share of Medicaid costs is determined by the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) rate, which varies by state. Exceptions to the regular FMAP rate have been made for certain states, situations, populations, providers, and services, including temporary exceptions during recessions provided through specific acts. The FFCRA provides a temporary increase to the FMAP rate for all states, the District of Columbia, and territories during the public health emergency period. States must meet certain requirements to be eligible for the FMAP increase. The FFCRA provides a temporary increase to the FMAP rate for states, DC, and territories during the public health emergency period. To be eligible for the FMAP increase, states must meet specific requirements, including maintaining Medicaid eligibility standards, coverage for COVID-19 testing services and treatments, and not imposing excessive premiums. FFCRA adds a condition for the FMAP rate increase, preventing local governments from funding more than on March 11, 2020. CBO estimates a $50.0 billion increase in spending. Medicaid financing for territories differs from states and DC, with capped funding and different funding sources. Federal Medicaid funding for the territories comes from various sources, including annual capped funding. Additional funding for FY2020 and FY2021 was provided through the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020. The total additional funding for the territories has increased, with CBO estimating a $204 million increase in direct spending over the FY2020-FY2021 period. Medicare coverage for telehealth services under Part B is subject to specific conditions outlined in SSA Sec. 1834(m). Recent legislation has modified conditions for Medicare telehealth services, allowing temporary waivers during the COVID-19 emergency period. A qualified telehealth provider now includes those with a prior relationship within the past three years with the patient under Medicare. FFCRA expands the definition of a qualified provider to include those who had provider-patient relationships within the past three years outside of Medicare. The health care provisions in FFCRA are listed with contact information for the CRS expert on each provision."
