    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Drug Overdose Reduction Act\". The Congress finds that drug overdose deaths have become a significant public health issue, with a 400% increase in accidental drug overdose deaths between 1980 and 1999. Additionally, 95% of unintentional poisoning deaths are due to drugs. In the year 2000, poisoning deaths cost society over $25 billion in total, with most drug-related deaths involving multiple drugs including opioids and alcohol. Community-based programs have successfully prevented opioid overdose deaths through education and access to naloxone, an effective opioid antagonist. Public health programs in major cities and states distribute naloxone to prevent drug overdoses, with successful outcomes saving lives. Training witnesses to respond effectively to overdoses is crucial for prevention programs. Overdose prevention programs are necessary in correctional facilities, addiction treatment programs, and other high-risk environments after a period of abstinence. The text chunk \"SEC. 3.
