Ongoing political protests in August 2014 may lead to military intervention, jeopardizing U.S. interests. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government, elected in 2013, faces criticism from opposition leaders Imran Khan and Tahir-ul-Qadri. The two leaders, suspected of colluding with the military, gathered 30,000 anti-government protesters. In August 2014, opposition leaders Imran Khan and Tahir-ul-Qadri gathered 30,000 anti-government protestors in Islamabad, demanding Prime Minister Sharif's resignation due to election fraud and corruption. The protests turned violent, leading to casualties. Sharif and political consensus view the demands as unconstitutional, emphasizing the need for electoral reforms and an overhaul of the Election Commission of Pakistan. The Army, led by General Raheel Sharif, is seen as potentially orchestrating a \"soft coup\" to reduce Prime Minister Sharif's authority. The International Crisis Group warns of a threat to Pakistan's democratic transition, with the military possibly ruling indirectly. The Obama Administration has maintained a low-key stance on the unrest. The Obama Administration supports democracy in Pakistan and urges all sides to refrain from violence and respect the rule of law amidst unrest in Islamabad. Peaceful protest and freedom of expression are important aspects of democracy. The scholar suggests that Washington should support the current government in Pakistan to strengthen its democratic system, despite ongoing political unrest. The opposition parties are likely to adhere to constitutional processes, indicating that the Sharif government will likely remain in power, albeit weakened. The implications for U.S. interests are uncertain but may have negative effects on Pakistani democratization, Afghan stability, Pakistan-India relations, and economic development. The ongoing political unrest in Pakistan could have negative effects on Pakistani democratization, Afghan stability, Pakistan-India relations, and economic development. Prime Minister Sharif stated that the supremacy of law and constitution will continue in Pakistan despite protests. The Army intervened to break the deadlock, but Sharif denied involvement in the decision. Violence erupted in Pakistan over the weekend of August 30-31, with three people killed and hundreds injured as paramilitary troops clashed with protesters near the prime minister's residence. The government denied endorsing the Army as a mediator and guarantor in the situation. The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, led by Khan and Qadri, faced internal division as senior ally Javed Hashmi accused Khan of breaking promises to followers. The United States is interested in assisting Pakistan to combat religious militancy and create a stable, democratic, and prosperous country. This is a key foreign policy effort post-9/11, with vital interests in regional and global terrorism, stabilizing Afghanistan, nuclear proliferation, Pakistan-India tensions, democratization, human rights, and economic development. Pakistan is a haven for extremist groups, posing a threat globally. Pakistan, a haven for Islamist extremist groups and a rapid nuclear proliferator, receives significant U.S. foreign assistance. Despite efforts to boost its economy and security forces, the country continues to struggle with militancy, terrorism, inflation, unemployment, and weak economic growth. Power struggles among presidents, prime ministers, and army chiefs have characterized Pakistan's history of democracy, with military regimes ruling for a significant portion of its independence. Pakistan has a history of military rule, with the armed forces seizing power from civilian governments three times. The most recent national election in May 2013 ousted the incumbent government. The 2013 national election in Pakistan saw Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League\u2013Nawaz (PML-N) party win with accusations of vote-rigging leading to street protests. Sharif, a former prime minister, returned from exile in 2007 and secured a majority in the Assembly with support from late-joiners, marking a peaceful transfer of power. The peaceful transfer of power in Pakistan in 2013 marked a historic milestone in establishing sustainable representative government. Prime Minister Sharif's government, elected with a strong mandate, focused on reversing economic trends but still faces challenges like the energy crisis. Despite this, public support for Sharif remains high, with a 64% approval rating. Pakistanis are also less pessimistic about the future, with 37% believing the economy has improved. Since last year, the number saying the economy has improved more than doubled to 37%, and satisfaction with the direction of the country more than tripled to 25%. Prime Minister Sharif faces challenges addressing serious issues such as economic decline, power shortages, and security concerns both domestically and abroad. Pakistan views India as a security concern on its eastern border. The PML-N in Pakistan is criticized for its perceived ineffectiveness, with Parliament failing to pass new laws under Sharif's leadership. Important positions remain unfilled, and the party is accused of being too focused on one family. Sharif is criticized for maintaining an autocratic ruling style and neglecting to reform Pakistan's governance system. Relations between the Sharif government and the Pakistani Army deteriorated in 2014 due to legal actions against Pervez Musharraf and tensions over Geo News. Sharif's negotiations with the TTP and commercial ties with India also strained relations with the Army. Sharif's detachment from Pakistan's issues and poor relations with the generals led to protests by opposition parties in Islamabad in 2014. Protesters demanded Sharif's resignation, with different objectives between the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT) groups. Despite differing long-term objectives, the PTI and PAT did not directly collaborate during the protests in Islamabad. Both Imran Khan and Tahir-ul-Qadri emphasized peaceful demonstrations and instructed followers not to occupy government buildings. The Sharif government maintained a lenient stance, but the large number of protesters created a delicate situation that could not be sustained indefinitely. The \"azadi\" march led by Imran Khan's PTI in Pakistan gained international attention but lacked widespread public support. The protests were sparked by allegations of election rigging in 2013 by Sharif's PML-N. Despite the large number of protesters, an impasse was reached on whether to escalate by occupying government buildings or abandon the protests. Imran Khan's PTI protest in Pakistan alleged election rigging by Sharif's PML-N, demanding his resignation and early elections. Despite initial momentum, Khan's protest lost steam as demands became inconsistent and strategy unclear. Khan rejected Sharif's offer of an election review panel and continued to push for resignation. Imran Khan's protest in Pakistan against alleged election rigging lost momentum due to unclear strategy and inconsistent demands. Khan's actions alienated the media and caused divisions within his party. Tahir-ul-Qadri's concurrent protest, known as the \"Inqilab\" march, highlighted his nonpartisan stance and previous political activities. Qadri reemerged on the national political stage in June after clashes with police in Lahore resulted in 14 deaths. The PML-N's provincial government in Punjab was slow to react, leading to Qadri announcing a \"grand march\" with grievances against the democratic system. Prime Minister Sharif's response to the protests was inconsistent, with authorities deploying shipping containers to obstruct major arteries. As the marchers approached the capital, they were allowed to camp outside the Parliament building despite warnings not to enter the \"Red Zone.\" After 17 days, some protestors encroached on the PM's residence grounds, leading to a forceful police response. The Pakistani leader's willingness to negotiate and pursue electoral audits has not changed the protest leaders' demands for the Prime Minister's resignation, which opposition parties argue is unconstitutional. The Assembly passed resolutions affirming the constitution's supremacy. The parliamentary opposition has not fully denied Khan's election rigging claims. Some suggest fraud occurred but criticize Khan's tactics. Sharif showed confidence in his leadership. The military has been a trusted institution in Pakistan. Analysts are divided on the army's role in the unrest. There are possible links between Khan, Qadri, and the military. Some analysts see a coordinated effort between the military and the latest crisis, but doubt the army would directly take over the government due to ongoing operations against militants. There are speculations of a \"soft coup\" to reduce civilian government support and allow the army to control foreign and security policies. Prime Minister Sharif was reportedly told to \"share space\" with the military, but no coup was being engineered. The army has not intervened in public protests as of early September. The army's potential intervention in Pakistan's government is hinted at by a social media message from an army spokesman, causing speculation of political interference. Despite ongoing meetings between the Prime Minister and Army Chief, experts do not foresee immediate policy changes of international significance. However, hopes for democratic consolidation have been dampened by recent unrest, which is expected to further complicate Pakistan's domestic situation. The Pakistan army's increased control over foreign and security policies may shift its approach towards Afghanistan to counter Indian influence, potentially hindering India-Pakistan relations and regional cooperation in South Asia. This could impact U.S. interests related to nuclear security, counterterrorism, Afghanistan stability, and Pakistan-India relations. The military's dominance in security policy is unlikely to affect the nuclear realm. The Pakistan Army's control over foreign and security policies may impact U.S. interests in nuclear security, counterterrorism, and Afghanistan stability. Washington relies on Islamabad as a partner for Afghan stability post-2014, but the military's focus on countering Indian influence could hinder regional cooperation. Pakistan's strategic support of the Afghan Taliban, seen as anti-India, raises concerns for Afghanistan and India. The Haqqani Network leaders fled to Afghanistan during Pakistan's 2014 offensive, prompting the U.S. to offer bounties. The State Department's actions suggest doubts about Pakistan's control over its Afghanistan policy. Afghan President Karzai's distrust of Pakistan complicates regional dynamics. The distrust between Afghan President Karzai and Pakistan has led Afghanistan to seek support from India in defense matters. Despite efforts by Prime Minister Sharif to improve relations with Afghanistan, little progress was made due to resistance from the Pakistan Army. Tensions between Pakistan and India have grown, hindering efforts to resolve disputes and stabilize the region. The current political instability in Islamabad further reduces prospects for cooperation between the two countries. The Pakistani government has shown interest in resolving disputes with India and strengthening bilateral ties. However, the Pakistani Army's obstruction of trade with India due to territorial disputes has hindered progress. Despite initial efforts to resume dialogue with India, Prime Minister Sharif's influence within the Pakistani establishment has decreased, leading to increased tensions between the two countries. Reports of attempts to infiltrate militants into Indian Kashmir have also escalated. The downturn in Pakistan-India relations has intensified over the summer, with cross-border firing along the LOC leading to fears of escalation. The Pakistani military is seen as orchestrating this shift, potentially halting progress in trade and economic relations with India initiated by Prime Minister Sharif. A recent survey found 71% of Pakistanis expressing an unfavorable view of India. Pakistan's blockage of Indian access to Afghanistan hinders trade and connectivity with Central Asia. This could impact US efforts to link India with Central Asia through a \"New Silk Road\" and hinder South Asian regional cooperation. The situation may prompt India to develop alternative routes, such as Iran's Chabbahar port, potentially engaging with US adversaries. Prime Minister Sharif's handling of the Army's intervention in late August remains a topic of analysis. The analysts believe that Prime Minister Sharif's lack of civilian control over domestic security could weaken his position, impacting U.S. efforts to support Pakistan's democratic governance. Any military ouster of Sharif may lead to U.S. sanctions on foreign aid, potentially halting a key American assistance program."
