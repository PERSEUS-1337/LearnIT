TERMINATION OF DESIGNATION; PROBATION. Section 217(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to include definitions for probationary period and program country. The Secretary of Homeland Security will determine probationary status and notify noncompliance during a program country's periodic evaluation. The Secretary of Homeland Security will determine if a program country complies with program requirements. If not, the country will be placed on probation for the following fiscal year. At the end of the probationary period, actions will be taken. At the end of the initial probationary period, the Secretary of Homeland Security will take action based on compliance with program requirements.

Actions will be taken at the end of additional probationary periods. At the end of additional probationary periods, the Secretary will either end the country's probationary status if in compliance with program requirements or terminate the country's participation if noncompliant. The program country remains in non-compliance with program requirements, leading to termination of participation in the program. Termination takes effect at the start of the following fiscal year, with nationals remaining eligible for a waiver until then. After termination, nationals of the country are subject to specific treatment. Terminated nationals remain eligible for a waiver until termination takes effect. Waivers granted before termination are not invalidated. The Secretary of State plays a consultative role in the process. The Comptroller General of the United States will review the methods used by the Secretary of Homeland Security to track aliens entering and exiting the United States, as well as to detect any alien overstaying their authorized admission period."
