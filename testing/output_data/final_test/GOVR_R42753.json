    "content": "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was established in 2002 after the 9/11 attacks, integrating parts of 22 federal agencies. The urgency of its mission led to rapid growth, but hindered full integration of its components. The interim DHS headquarters was located at the Nebraska Avenue Complex in Washington, DC. The interim DHS headquarters at the Nebraska Avenue Complex was designated after Tom Ridge became the first secretary of the department. DHS operates from over 50 locations in the National Capital Region, despite being the third-largest federal department. In 2004, the Coast Guard began exploring new headquarters facilities due to inadequate leased locations. In 2004, GSA, OMB, and DHS decided that a federally owned site would be more cost-effective than a replacement lease for the DHS headquarters. The interim location was found to be inadequate, as the department's staffing needs exceeded initial estimates. GSA took over the West Campus of St. Elizabeths Hospital in DC, a National Historic Landmark, to address the long-term mission requirements of DHS. The West Campus of St. Elizabeths, a National Historic Landmark, required significant restoration due to years of neglect, estimated to cost nearly $500 million in 2003. Senator Collins criticized the mismanagement of the property by the Federal Government, noting the poor oversight by HHS and the D.C. Government. The once valuable asset had become a massive liability. The decision to keep the West Campus of St. Elizabeths as part of the federal real estate portfolio was made in the mid-1980s. The site had 61 buildings with 1.1 million square feet of space and was the last parcel of Federally owned land in the District. President George W. Bush's FY2006 budget request included plans to consolidate the Coast Guard's headquarters on the West Campus, with initial planning funding allocated in GSA's budget that year. The Administration's FY2007 budget request sought construction funding for the new Coast Guard headquarters through the DHS appropriations bill. In October 2006, DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff proposed a master plan to consolidate DHS headquarters with operating components, including moving 14,000 staff to St. Elizabeths. The White House report on the Federal Response to Katrina emphasized the need for a joint departmental operations center for efficient incident response. The need for a consolidated headquarters project to support efficient incident response has been advocated for since 2006. However, consistent funding for the project has been lacking, with the majority of funding received in FY2009. The project's construction schedule became unfeasible due to the lack of consistent funding, and cost estimates provided in June 2013 proposed a phased approach for funding individual segments. The 2013 proposal suggests funding individual segments of a consolidated headquarters project annually, costing $4.5 billion to complete by FY2026. GSA estimates $697 million in savings over thirty years. Additional funding could shorten the timeline and reduce costs, but the first four years would still require over $330 million annually from DHS and GSA. Funding of $190 million was provided in FY2014. The $190 million provided to GSA and DHS for project construction was more than $164 million short of the request level. In September 2014, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that DHS and GSA did not follow relevant guidance when developing cost estimates for the St. Elizabeths project, leading to unreliable estimates. Critics cited this as evidence of mismanagement. GSA and DHS promised improved compliance with guidelines in their latest revision of the project plan. The DHS headquarters consolidation project aimed to improve mission effectiveness, create a unified organization, increase efficiency, adjust real estate portfolio size, and reduce occupancy costs. Testimony simplified the objectives to enhancing effectiveness, communication, and fostering a unified culture. Former DHS Secretary Chertoff emphasized the importance of the project for defining the department. The DHS headquarters consolidation project aims to align with the government's policy of using federally owned sites, reducing overhead costs, and saving almost $700 million over 30 years. The St. Elizabeths project would provide 4.5 million square feet of office space for DHS operations. The DHS needed 4.5 million square feet of office space for headquarters functions on a secure campus, housing 14,000 personnel out of a total need of 7.1 million square feet in the region. The NAC could only provide 1.2 million square feet. St. Elizabeths was identified as the best match, meeting eight out of nine requirements for the project. St. Elizabeths was chosen as the site for the DHS headquarters due to its ability to meet the agency's needs, including historic property requirements. Other benefits include economic and security advantages for the local community and nearby federal facilities. The campus is government-controlled and overlooks Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling and the Defense Information Systems Agency. The Coast Guard headquarters is also located there, customized to their needs. The DHS headquarters at St. Elizabeths is now a functional reality, with a debate focusing on the consolidation of DHS headquarters there. A hearing in 2011 reviewed the status of the consolidation project, specifically the move of the Coast Guard to St. Elizabeths and its impact on the Coast Guard's budget and operations. The Coast Guard authorization bill in 2006 required GSA to include another DHS agency's move to St. Elizabeths in its master plan. The Coast Guard's move to St. Elizabeths prompted concerns about isolation and lack of road infrastructure, leading to calls for further consolidation efforts and necessary road improvements. Critics question the need for a single large headquarters, suggesting a distributed model instead. Some Members of Congress have raised concerns about schedule delays and cost increases related to the consolidation project. Some critics oppose the consolidation of the Department of Homeland Security's headquarters at St. Elizabeths due to concerns about delays, cost increases, and the flawed establishment of the department. Historic preservationists worry about the project's impact on the site's historic character and the high cost of reusing the historic buildings. The House Committee on Homeland Security expressed concerns about rising costs and delays in a 2014 report, questioning the feasibility of the project given budget constraints. The Committee acknowledges DHS's need to streamline activities for efficiency but criticizes the lack of vision in adapting St. Elizabeths construction to fiscal challenges. GAO highlighted inconsistent oversight and failure to plan according to guidelines. Critics question the project's resource-intensive approach and its ability to address capability gaps. The St. Elizabeths construction project for the DHS headquarters aims to create economic activity in the area by providing office space for 14,000 personnel. However, budget constraints and changing federal office space usage patterns may impact the original growth projections for the project. The DHS headquarters project at St. Elizabeths aims to accommodate 14,000 personnel, but changing federal office space usage patterns may impact growth projections. DHS has saved $238 million through space management improvements, raising questions about the need for additional personnel beyond the original 14,000 slated for St. Elizabeths. The DHS headquarters project at St. Elizabeths aims to accommodate 14,000 personnel, but questions arise over the rationale for additional personnel beyond this number. Funding for federal government facilities is provided through different sources, with construction authority lacking in some cases like DHS, leading to contracts funded through GSA for building construction and tenant improvements. The St. Elizabeths project for DHS headquarters consolidation has received over $1.7 billion in appropriations, but funding levels have not consistently met requests from both Administrations. Delays occurred in FY2007 and FY2008 due to unfilled funding requests, impacting the project's start. The Coast Guard's relocation to its new headquarters was part of the original DHS National Capital Region Master Plan. The Coast Guard's relocation to its new headquarters at St. Elizabeths faced delays, with funding issues impacting the project's start. In FY2009, the project received significant funding from both DHS and GSA budgets, including $98 million for the Coast Guard Headquarters element and $650 million from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The total funding for the project reached $347 million through GSA, matching the Administration's request. The Coast Guard Headquarters at St. Elizabeths faced funding challenges, with requests for funding from FY2011 to FY2015 only partially met. A ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new headquarters took place in July 2013. DHS officials indicated a new approach was being prepared for the project due to funding limitations. The DHS faced funding challenges for the Coast Guard Headquarters at St. Elizabeths from FY2011 to FY2015. A new approach was needed due to limited funding, resulting in individual construction segments instead of a coordinated plan. This change led to cost increases and efficiency loss in building the departmental operations center. The construction of a new facility at St. Elizabeths has faced funding challenges, leading to delays and increased costs. The original cost estimate was $3.4 billion, but the revised 2013 estimate is now $4.5 billion. The DHS attributes the cost increases to funding delays rather than changes in the project's design. The Coast Guard and interim campus security control center will occupy some of the available space in the meantime. The St. Elizabeths project has faced funding challenges, leading to delays and increased costs. The original cost estimate was $3.4 billion, but the revised 2013 estimate is now $4.5 billion. DHS and GSA indicated that funding the project faster could lower the total cost. However, a revised plan criticized by GAO in 2014 was only partially compliant with leading practices. A new plan with updated cost and schedule estimates is expected to be released with the President's FY2016 budget request. The FY2014 budget included requests for funding for the St. Elizabeths project through GSA and DHS. The GSA requested $262 million, with $202 million for the next phase of the project and $60 million for infrastructure activities. The DHS requested $93 million for construction and $13 million for security costs. P.L. 113-76 provided $155 million through GSA and $35 million through DHS for the project, with an additional $13 million for support costs from the Coast Guard. The appropriations were the largest provided for the project. The FY2014 appropriation for the St. Elizabeths project was the largest since FY2009, but not enough to keep up with the construction schedule. The FY2015 budget request included funding from GSA and DHS, with GSA requesting $251 million for a new interchange and DHS requesting $58 million for construction and $15 million for operational support. The House-passed FY2015 Appropriations bill did not include funding for St. Elizabeths. The FY2015 appropriations bill did not include funding for St. Elizabeths through the GSA, while the Senate Appropriations Committee draft included $251 million. The House-reported Homeland Security Appropriations bill for FY2015 also did not include funding for headquarters consolidation at St. Elizabeths, but its Senate-reported counterpart included $49 million for operational support and construction. The consolidated appropriations act for FY2015 included $144 million for the GSA, with DHS funded by a short-term continuing resolution. The House Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Oversight and Management held a hearing regarding the Department of Homeland Security's consolidation project at St. Elizabeths. The Government Accountability Office criticized the planning practices, and DHS and GSA planned to release an updated project plan incorporating GAO's recommendations. The hearing also included criticisms from the subcommittee and a Senate staff report highlighting the project's importance. The Committee majority staff report released in September 2014 emphasized the importance of the project. H.R. 2611 was enacted into law in August 2013, naming the new Coast Guard Headquarters at St. Elizabeths the \"Douglas A. Munro Coast Guard Headquarters Building.\" Signalman First Class Munro was the only Coast Guardsman to receive the Medal of Honor. The bill passed unanimously in the House and Senate, with no commentary during floor debate. A hearing on DHS's real estate management efforts was held on May 22, 2013. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is focused on improving the management of its real estate, which costs $1.6 billion in rent and $310 million in upkeep annually. Implementation of flexible workplace strategies is expected to lead to significant savings. The Administration is committed to consolidating its headquarters at St. Elizabeths in Washington, D.C., with the goal of reducing the number of locations in the National Capital Region. Collaboration with the General Services Administration (GSA) is ongoing to re-evaluate program requirements and achieve cost-effective goals. The House Appropriations Committee's Homeland Security Subcommittee held a hearing on DHS facilities, focusing on two major construction projects: the consolidated headquarters project and the National Bio- and Agro-defense Facility. Subcommittee Chairman Robert Aderholt emphasized the need for realistic planning and tighter budgets for these complex projects. Congress must consider minimum funding requirements and alternative solutions for the projects. The Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2011 directed DHS to consolidate its headquarters function at St. Elizabeths by the end of FY2018. This consolidation would have operational, budgetary, and cultural implications for DHS, with the vision presented in the St. Elizabeths project providing its own unique texture to these changes. Consolidating DHS headquarters at a single site would improve coordination among departmental components. Former Coast Guard Commandant Thad Allen highlighted the current disjointed facilities in Washington, emphasizing the need for a unified campus at St. Elizabeths. The future of relocating to the St. Elizabeths campus is uncertain, risking the failure to establish a National Operations Center for the Department. This could hinder the Department's ability to coordinate homeland security events effectively as envisioned by the Homeland Security Act. The Department has struggled to develop operational planning and coordination capabilities, limiting its ability to mature as an enterprise. The Department aims to mature as an enterprise with increased efficiencies and effectiveness. The priority is to create unity of effort for better mission performance by removing barriers to information sharing and improving operational planning. The current National Operations Center at the Nebraska Avenue Complex is limited in size and infrastructure, hindering its command and control function. Establishing a more capable Departmental Operations Center (DOC) as recommended would significantly impact day-to-day and crisis operations. The White House's after-action report on Hurricane Katrina recommended establishing a new National Operations Center (NOC) to strengthen DHS's operational management capabilities. The NOC's mission would be to coordinate the national response and provide a common operating picture for the entire Federal government. This would involve co-locating the DOC with the operations centers of individual DHS components to enhance coordination and integration. The establishment of a consolidated headquarters for DHS components is seen as crucial for enhancing collaboration and operational effectiveness. Co-locating operations centers and staff at one location is expected to improve coordination and efficiency, as well as provide real estate savings through shared facilities. This consolidation project brings together executive leadership from all DHS components for the first time, which would be challenging without a consolidated headquarters. The consolidation of DHS components into a single headquarters is essential for improved collaboration and operational efficiency. However, the slower pace of consolidation and the premature establishment of operations centers before headquarters presence could lead to inefficiencies. For example, the NRCC may move to St. Elizabeths before the FEMA headquarters is completed, impacting response efforts. The senior leadership of DHS components and operations centers will move to St. Elizabeths ahead of other headquarters functions. The consolidation raises security concerns, with the proposed headquarters classified as a Level V facility under ISC standards. The proposed DHS headquarters at St. Elizabeths will be classified as a Level V facility, the highest level on the scale, with missions critical to national security and high threat/high profile buildings. Security standards include 100-foot perimeter setbacks and protected ventilation equipment. DHS's current dispersed headquarters across the National Capital Region cannot ensure this level of security. The St. Elizabeths site was chosen for the new DHS headquarters due to its ability to implement Level V security standards, which include 100-foot perimeter setbacks and protected ventilation equipment. The site is the only one in the District that can accommodate the office space requirement and security standards. The new Coast Guard headquarters and temporary perimeter meet Level V security standards. DHS offices lack the same security level as the NAC, potentially causing collateral damage in case of a terrorist attack. CIA and Pentagon, also Level V facilities, have been targets with limited collateral damage. Attacks on DHS headquarters could result in greater collateral damage due to lack of separation from the general population. The man flew a private plane into a commercial office building housing IRS offices, affecting other tenants. Level V facilities continued to operate during attacks. Consolidating DHS headquarters at St. Elizabeths may not increase its likelihood as a target. The St. Elizabeths campus may offer better security and operational benefits for DHS headquarters, despite potential increased visibility. The project was previously a high priority for the Administration. In September 2011, Secretary Napolitano mentioned that the DHS budget would flatten out, leading to postponement of projects like St. Elizabeths headquarters. The focus was on funding National Security Cutter for the Coast Guard and supporting the Secret Service and border efforts. The DHS Chief Financial Officer clarified that the DHS Headquarters Consolidation Project is not currently on the budget chopping block. The Administration remains committed to building a new headquarters in DC but is reevaluating the project based on budget projections and department growth. The project was initially planned in a different budget environment, and adjustments are being made to accommodate current fiscal realities. The DHS budget is expected to remain flat or decline in the future due to the Budget Control Act. The Administration's budget projection for DHS in FY2019 is similar to what was received in FY2007. Minimal increases are projected for FY2014-FY2018, indicating no significant expansion in budgetary resources. The GSA is expected to bear over $2 billion of the initially projected $3.4 billion in project costs for the DHS Headquarters Consolidation Project. The GSA's budget for the DHS Headquarters Consolidation Project has increased to $2.8 billion out of a total of $4.5 billion, representing 63% of the total cost. This rise is due to cost escalations from construction delays and loss of efficiencies. GSA's appropriations have not kept pace with the project's construction plan, leading to a backlog of $4 billion in construction and renovation needs. Tangherlini reported a $4 billion backlog for the DHS Headquarters Consolidation Project as of April 2013. The new baseline calls for over $200 million in annual funding from FY2014 to FY2017, with significant contributions from GSA. Congress and the Administration are making affirmative choices to invest in various projects despite fiscal constraints. The key question is the level of priority placed on the project in the overall budget. The Administration and Congress prioritize the St. Elizabeths project in the budget, but this could change in a national emergency. Moving to government-owned facilities from leased properties can save costs for agencies, freeing up resources. However, the upfront costs of such projects can be challenging for agencies with tight budgets. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that owning buildings is often cheaper than leasing them for long-term space needs. GAO's reports since 1995 showed that the government could have saved nearly $1 billion by constructing rather than leasing space for federal agencies. The potential savings from ownership instead of leasing is likely even higher. The GSA and DHS have cited potential cost savings of $600 million over 30 years for the St. Elizabeths project. GSA's recent estimate shows almost $700 million in savings from new construction versus leasing. However, GAO noted in a 2014 report that cost estimates may not be reliable and lack full life-cycle costs. DHS's consolidation of headquarters functions has been complicated by components occupying leased space. In testimony before the House Appropriations Committee, DHS highlighted the challenge of expiring leases for headquarters components, leading to increased overhead costs. Delays in new space completion result in more expensive short-term leases, potentially reducing funding for front line operations. Consolidation of headquarters could bring savings through centralized support services. The DHS is facing challenges with expiring leases for headquarters components, leading to increased overhead costs. Consolidation of headquarters could bring savings through centralized support services, aiming to create a more unified department. The Department of Homeland Security is struggling to achieve its goals, facing resistance from components hesitant to relinquish control and resources. The focus is on defining and refining the department's mission for effective and efficient performance. The structure of DHS has not been fundamentally altered since December 2010, with challenges including the persistence of pre-DHS era organizational structures and lack of integration between components. The Department of Homeland Security faces challenges in achieving its goals due to resistance from components, lack of integration between missions, and statements from political figures. Despite efforts to consolidate headquarters functions, creating a unified department with strong management capacity will take time and ongoing effort. Testimony from the Government Accountability Office emphasizes the need for sustained integration efforts. The Government Accountability Office highlighted the challenges in implementing and transforming the Department of Homeland Security, emphasizing the need for consistent leadership and integration of disparate agencies and missions. The successful transformation of large organizations, like the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), can take years to achieve. Departmental leadership acknowledges the challenge of integrating systems, cultures, and procedures. Secretary Napolitano emphasized the progress made over the years but recognized the time needed for the merger. The \"unity of effort\" initiative aims for better coordination in planning, procurement, and mission prioritization. Johnson emphasizes the need for greater coordination in planning, procurement, and mission execution within DHS. Consolidation of headquarters functions is seen as a potential solution, but not a cure-all for the department's issues. Morale problems at DHS have been a concern, with job satisfaction declining for the fifth consecutive year. DHS's morale declined for the fifth consecutive year, with the agency receiving the lowest ranking among the 19 largest federal agencies. While some subcomponents scored well, others were among the worst places to work government-wide. Observers suggest that the lack of a unified organizational culture may contribute to low employee morale. The lack of a unified organizational culture at DHS headquarters may be contributing to low employee morale. Comparing job satisfaction and engagement between headquarters and field offices showed a 5% difference in scoring. The Office of the Secretary and the Management Directorate ranked poorly among the 315 subcomponents in terms of places to work. The lack of a unified organizational culture at DHS headquarters may be contributing to low employee morale. Comparing job satisfaction and engagement between headquarters and field offices showed a 5% difference in scoring. The Office of the Secretary and the Management Directorate ranked poorly among the 315 subcomponents in terms of places to work. There was no data reported from the OPM survey to confirm or refute the impact of headquarters consolidation on morale. Question #14 in the survey addressed the adequacy of facilities, with 65.6% government-wide agreeing that physical conditions allow employees to perform well, compared to 59.4% at DHS. Subcomponent-specific data on this question were unavailable from OPM at the time of publication. The attitudes of DHS component staff towards a consolidated headquarters could be positively impacted by benefits such as daycare facilities for employees relocating to St. Elizabeths. Co-locating headquarters may improve teamwork ratings and leadership perceptions. However, issues like pay, advancement, diversity, and skills matching would likely remain unaffected. The funding of the project could indirectly affect morale. The funding of the project could indirectly affect morale, as Congressional decisions on capital investments in the department could be seen as validation or criticism of the department's work. The Coast Guard, operating from a consolidated headquarters at St. Elizabeths, already scores well in employee satisfaction. Comparing 2013 and 2014 scores would provide more insight, but the data is limited. The Coast Guard's move to its new headquarters at St. Elizabeths could impact morale, but the available data is limited. Congress could consider various approaches to the DHS headquarters consolidation process, with options like termination of the proposal becoming less realistic. With over a billion dollars invested, the focus now shifts to how far and how quickly the consolidation should proceed. Four possible ways forward are discussed: consolidating the Coast Guard headquarters on the St. Elizabeths campus without proceeding further, proceeding with DHS as the sole tenant on the West Campus, downsizing the projected DHS presence at St. Elizabeths for use by other federal partners, or expediting completion beyond the current funding baseline. Congress may not invest further in the consolidated headquarters for DHS due to budget constraints or a desire to rethink the model. The Coast Guard's immediate headquarters needs have been met, providing operational benefits. The Coast Guard's headquarters needs have been met with a new single facility, providing operational benefits. The modern facility may boost morale, but concerns exist about its isolated location. Design changes were made for the Coast Guard as a single tenant, reducing costs and improving efficiency. The Center Building project faces potential termination, leading to uncertainty about the future of the DHS headquarters. Congressional intervention could prompt a reevaluation of alternatives, but the benefits of the St. Elizabeths project may not be replicated, potentially impacting taxpayer resources. If Congress does not fund DHS use of the St. Elizabeths facility, the GSA would still be responsible for maintaining the campus. Disposal of the site may be considered if no other federal client requires the space, but complications may arise due to its historic landmark status and security concerns. Supporting further DHS consolidation at St. Elizabeths could involve post-Katrina efforts. If Congress supports further DHS consolidation at St. Elizabeths, funding would be provided for the completion of a department-wide operations center and renovation of necessary buildings. This option addresses the lack of a department-wide operations center, but full headquarters presence may take several years. Fully funding the reuse of historical buildings for the Secretary's offices would be a significant investment, taking advantage of existing infrastructure improvements. The current plan for DHS headquarters consolidation at St. Elizabeths includes infrastructure improvements in the Center Building complex. The cost and schedule estimates released in June 2013 were criticized by GAO, leading to a new plan expected with the FY2016 budget request. However, due to funding constraints, the construction schedule is likely to be slower. The current plan for DHS headquarters consolidation at St. Elizabeths includes infrastructure improvements in the Center Building complex. While Congress may question the sustainability of funding over time, exploring a downsizing of the final DHS presence could open space for other federal agencies. This could lead to a more efficient use of space, but the operational impacts on DHS remain unclear. The DHS's plan for headquarters consolidation at St. Elizabeths includes infrastructure improvements in the Center Building complex. Exploring a downsizing of the final DHS presence could open space for other federal agencies, potentially leading to a more efficient use of space. However, the operational impacts on DHS remain unclear, and capping DHS's space to accommodate another federal agency could pose risks. The historic re-use of existing buildings presents challenges for potential clients, and cost savings from reductions in leased space may be lost without additional partners identified. Sharing efforts may not result in cost savings for GSA, regardless of the ultimate tenants. Congress could also play a role in decision-making. Congress could prioritize funding for the DHS headquarters consolidation project at St. Elizabeths to expedite completion and maximize operational benefits. This option aims to reduce barriers to information flow, support coordinated planning, and promote a unified DHS culture. The budgetary impact is uncertain, but potential savings have been mentioned by the Administration. The Administration's new plan accompanying the FY2016 budget request may require a significant adjustment of priorities in the federal discretionary budget for a higher investment in DHS and GSA allocations. Pursuing this option could signal Congress's acceptance of the DHS structure but does not guarantee improved performance or morale. The creation of DHS was a reaction to a national crisis, but unresolved issues like the consolidation of DHS headquarters functions remain. The Bush Administration's plan did not address how transition costs would be paid for and where the new headquarters would be located. Coordination is a key reason for the new department. The creation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was a response to a national crisis, with unresolved issues like consolidating DHS headquarters functions. Questions remain about funding transition costs and determining the department's location. Real property management and budget constraints are ongoing concerns, influenced by changing security threats and budgetary situations. Expectations for workspace have evolved with the acceptance of telework and flexible office arrangements. The Administration's pending revised plan for St. Elizabeths may or may not align with the growing acceptance of telework and flexible office arrangements. Regardless of the decision on DHS headquarters consolidation, costs will need to be rebalanced between construction, move costs, rents for leases, and other impacts. GSA will also bear the cost of restoring and maintaining the St. Elizabeths campus. The significant cost of restoring and maintaining the St. Elizabeths campus for the DHS headquarters consolidation effort will be a long-term issue of congressional interest due to the importance of DHS missions and the scale of costs involved. Appropriations for construction needs are typically funded through the General Services Administration, while the pending revised plan for St. Elizabeths may need to consider the growing acceptance of telework and flexible office arrangements. The House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees for Homeland Security rejected funding for the Coast Guard Headquarters project at St. Elizabeths due to lack of information on site choice, costs, and components moving. The Senate Homeland Security appropriations report and final conference report rejected funding for the Coast Guard Headquarters project at St. Elizabeths due to concerns about wasting money on the Nebraska Avenue Complex. The House Appropriations Committee also rejected the project, citing little positive impact on the local community. Funding was denied in the year ending continuing resolution. For FY2008, partial funding was recommended by the House Appropriations Committee. In FY2008, the House Appropriations Committee recommended partial funding for the project at the Nebraska Avenue Complex and St. Elizabeths. The Senate also provided partial funding, but the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 allocated $6 million for improvements at the Nebraska Avenue Complex instead of the $101 million proposed by the House or the $88 million proposed by the Senate for St. Elizabeths. The GSA appropriations were moved to the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act in FY2008. The House Financial Services Appropriations Subcommittee expressed concerns about the size of the Coast Guard project and possible overinvestment in the Nebraska Avenue Complex. The Senate funded the requested projects in full, but in the final version of P.L. 110-161, only $28 million in funding for the NAC remained. For FY2011, the Administration requested $380 million for construction and infrastructure projects, but the combined appropriation fell over half a billion dollars short of the total request. For FY2011, the Administration requested $381 million for the headquarters consolidation project through DHS, but only $30 million was provided under the continuing resolution. In FY2012, the Administration requested $215 million for the project, including $160 million for new construction at St. Elizabeths. The House did not fund the project in the House-passed DHS budget. The House did not fund the motor vehicle access project to the campus in the House-passed DHS appropriations bill. The committee expressed concerns about the costs and schedule of the project, noting that costs have increased from $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion mainly due to the General Services Administration's share. Delays are expected as the Department plans to postpone work on the FEMA section of the facility. Coordination of funding and management with GSA is necessary, as the proposed DHS request may not align with GSA funding. The House committee expressed concerns about the increased costs and delays in the construction of the new DHS headquarters. They criticized the decision to not provide funding for the project, stating it will result in higher costs in the future and delay the completion of the Coast Guard's new headquarters facility. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $56 million in funding for the Coast Guard headquarters facility, significantly below the President's request. They also required DHS to provide an expenditure plan within 60 days. The House Appropriations Committee rejected the Administration's $840 million request for construction, citing concerns about adding to the Federal building inventory. The House subcommittee and full committee expressed concern about deep cuts in GSA's budget, noting it reversed a position taken in the FY2008 bill. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided $65 million for construction and acquisition at GSA, instead of the $840 million requested. The final appropriations bill for FY2012 only allocated $93 million for GSA and DHS contributions to St. Elizabeths, with $56 million for DHS construction. No mention was made of the DHS headquarters project specifically. In FY2012, $93 million was allocated for construction at St. Elizabeths, with $56 million for DHS and $37 million from GSA. The FY2013 budget requested $89 million for St. Elizabeths construction and $24.5 million for Coast Guard operational transition costs. No funding request was included in the GSA budget. The DHS budget justification requested funding for infrastructure improvements at I-295/Malcolm X Avenue interchange and West Campus access road extension. The House Appropriations Committee recommended no funding for the highway interchange or St. Elizabeths project through the management accounts, citing irregularity. The bill would have provided funding for the Coast Guard and $10 million through their construction budget for additional support. The House Appropriations Committee recommended no new construction funding for the Departmental Headquarters Consolidation expansion in H.R. 5855, which is $89 million below the request. Funding for the Coast Guard headquarters move to St. Elizabeths is included in the Coast Guard appropriation. The Department is exploring options to modify or consolidate current leases due to delays in permanent headquarters construction. The Committee encourages the Department to continue efforts on the permanent headquarters construction site, with $10,000,000 allocated for Phase 1 construction. The ranking members noted the lack of $89 million for site access improvements for DHS personnel. The new DHS headquarters project has faced delays and cost increases, with funding only allocated for the Coast Guard's relocation in 2013. Phase 2 construction for DHS central headquarters and FEMA is not funded, but $89 million is recommended for highway interchange improvements. The Coast Guard's operational transition costs are fully funded. The $89 million allocated for the highway interchange improvements was not funded through the Coast Guard construction budget. An amendment to use this funding as an offset for another amendment failed, and the funding remained in the legislation. The Under Secretary for Management is required to submit an expenditure plan detailing how the funds will be allocated for headquarters consolidation and mission support consolidation. Quarterly briefings on the progress are also mandated. The Department is developing an updated plan with the General Services Administration to complete headquarters consolidation in smaller segments. The plan will identify construction segments, resource requirements, and funding timelines. $29 million was provided for necessary expenses related to building infrastructure. The DHS is working on constructing, renovating, and equipping buildings for the department headquarters project. The FY2014 budget included funding requests for the St. Elizabeths project through GSA and DHS, with $155 million allocated through GSA and $35 million through DHS.
