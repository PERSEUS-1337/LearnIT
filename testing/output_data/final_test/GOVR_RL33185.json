    "content": "Liberia's President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is visiting the United States to deepen her contacts with the Obama Administration and Congress. She will meet with President Obama and possibly Secretary of State Clinton to discuss Liberia's progress and challenges in areas like security reform, anti-corruption efforts, and economic growth. Her visit may also include events related to the Millennium Challenge Corporation and the Global Food Security Initiative. On March 18, 2010, President Obama extended Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) status for eligible Liberian U.S. resident aliens for 18 months, allowing them to stay in the U.S. DED suspends deportation and permits work. Two bills in the 111th Congress aim to grant permanent residency to certain Liberian aliens. The trial of former Liberian President Charles Taylor, ongoing since mid-2007, faces procedural delays. In early 2010, President Sirleaf announced her intention to seek reelection despite recommendations from Liberia's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The Unity Party, Liberia Action Party, and Liberia Unification Party were holding party conventions. In mid-2010, a Peace Corps Volunteer country program for Liberia is set to begin, building on a humanitarian service program from 2008. Delta Airlines plans to start U.S.-Liberia flights in mid-2010 after delays due to security concerns at Liberia's airport. TSA is assisting Liberia to enhance aviation security. In May 2009, former NTGL Chairman Gyude Bryant and four LPRC executives were acquitted of corruption charges. Bryant faces another corruption case from his time as chairman. In late 2009, Liberia held a Senatorial by-election where President Sirleaf's Unity Party lost to the opposition Congress for Democratic Change. The election served as a test for the NEC ahead of the 2011 national elections. The Sirleaf government has entered into multi-billion dollar natural resource and agricultural concession deals, showing foreign investors' confidence in the country's progress. Economic growth has averaged 7% annually under Sirleaf's administration. Liberia has historical ties with the United States dating back to the founding of the modern state by former slaves from the Americas. The United States has been a historical ally of Liberia, providing support during World War II, the cold war, and civil wars. The relationship includes hosting communication facilities, development assistance, meditational support, and humanitarian aid. Strong ties were cultivated with various Liberian governments, including the Sirleaf administration, with substantial aid for peacekeeping and post-war rebuilding efforts. Relations have remained close under different U.S. administrations. Liberia, a small West African country, is undergoing a post-conflict transition after its second civil war. The war, which started in 2000, involved Charles Taylor's forces against two rebel groups, leading to severe political, economic, and humanitarian crises. Neighboring states hosted Liberian refugees and anti-Taylor forces. Relations with the U.S. have remained strong, with support for peacekeeping and rebuilding efforts. The Taylor regime in Liberia sponsored armed aggression against neighboring countries. A peace accord was signed in 2003 after international mediation, facilitated by Charles Taylor's resignation and the deployment of an ECOWAS military intervention force. The force aimed to end fighting, provide relief aid, and pave the way for the UN Mission in Liberia. UNMIL, authorized by the U.N. Security Council in 2003, deployed to Liberia before the National Transitional Government took office. It absorbed ECOMIL's military forces and provides peacekeeping, policing, and socioeconomic assistance. UNMIL also guards the Special Court for Sierra Leone and has a force strength of 9,644 as of late April 2010. The UNMIL force in Liberia consists of individual police, formed police units, military observers, and contingent military troops. As of late April 2010, there were 10 individual police, 3 military observers, and 5 contingent troops from the U.S. The UNMIL force is undergoing a gradual drawdown based on benchmarks set by the Security Council in 2006. The UNMIL force in Liberia is undergoing a gradual drawdown based on benchmarks set by the Security Council in 2006. The Secretary-General proposed a two-year \"consolidation period\" with an adjusted mandate focused on key tasks like maintaining a stable environment, reintegration of ex-combatants, security sector reform, and governance capacity. He suggested reducing the military component by one infantry battalion in mid-2006 and another in early 2007, with a drawdown beginning in early 2007 if security conditions permit. By mid-March 2007, significant progress was reported in meeting key benchmarks. In March 2007, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon recommended a year-long extension of the UNMIL's mandate due to limited progress in meeting consolidation benchmarks. This was followed by assessments and adjustments to benchmarks, along with phased force repatriations. On September 15, 2009, Resolution 1885 was passed by the Security Council. Resolution 1885, passed on September 15, 2009, authorized a third-phase drawdown of UNMIL forces between October 2009 and May 2010. This involves repatriating 2,029 military personnel, 3 attack helicopters, and 72 armored personnel carriers. The resolution also reauthorized UNMIL's mandate through September 30, 2010, and ordered the maintenance of the force size until the completion of elections in late 2011, which UNMIL was authorized to assist in administering. Resolution 1903 (December 17, 2009) renewed Liberia-related sanctions and emphasized the importance of free and fair elections as a core benchmark for UNMIL's future drawdown. It also called for the development of national security and rule of law institutions and requested a strategic plan for post-conflict peace-building in Liberia. The Security Council remains cautious about Liberia's post-war evolution. The Security Council renewed Liberia-related sanctions in Resolution 1903 (December 17, 2009) due to ongoing threats to international peace and security in the region. UNMIL has implemented measures to prevent sexual exploitation and abuse, following U.N.-wide regulations. In 2006, five crew members of a UN contractor left Liberia after being investigated for alleged rapes and assault of Liberian police officers. The departure of five crew members of a UN contractor from Liberia after being investigated for alleged rapes and assault of Liberian police officers was highly regretted by UNMIL. Multiple sexual exploitation and abuse incidents were reported in Liberia between 2009 and 2010. The Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2003 laid out a peace process and established the National Transitional Government of Liberia (NTGL) to prepare for national elections in 2005. President Sirleaf's elected government replaced the NTGL in 2006. The NTGL, led by chairman Gyude Bryant, oversaw the central government and faced challenges due to the aftermath of years of war in Liberia. The transition involved former armed factions, political discord, limited state capacities, and corruption. Elections were held in October. In October 2005, peaceful Senate, House of Representatives, and presidential elections were held in Liberia. A presidential runoff vote took place on November 8 between George Weah, a former soccer player, and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a Harvard-trained economist. Sirleaf won with 59.4% of the votes, becoming the first female president of an African country. Despite claims of fraud by Weah, the National Elections Commission rejected them. In the 2011 presidential election in Liberia, George Weah claimed fraud. The bicameral legislature had diverse election results, with no party dominating. Weah's Congress for Democratic Change (CDC) won 15 seats in the House of Representatives. Other parties like the Liberty Party (LP), Unity Party (UP), and Coalition for Transformation of Liberia (COTOL) also won seats. COTOL won seven seats in the Senate, while UP won four. Political party mergers in 2009 and 2010 have impacted the political landscape. Several former Taylor regime officials and leaders of armed factions or security services were elected as legislators in Liberia in 2011, including senators Jewel Howard-Taylor, Prince Yormie Johnson, and Saye-Taayor Adolphus Dolo. Johnson, infamous for the murder of Samuel Doe, returned from exile in Nigeria to run in the election. Dolo, a former militia leader known as General Peanut Butter, reportedly committed war-time atrocities and recruited child fighters. Political party mergers in 2009 and 2010 changed the allocation of seats among parties. Several former Taylor regime officials and leaders of armed factions or security services were elected as legislators in Liberia in 2011, including senators Jewel Howard-Taylor, Prince Yormie Johnson, and Saye-Taayor Adolphus Dolo. Dolo, known as General Peanut Butter, reportedly committed war-time atrocities and recruited child fighters. Other legislators include Edwin Snowe, Saah Richard Gbollie, and Kai G. Farley, who have controversial backgrounds and are subject to U.N. travel sanctions. Snowe, a former Taylor in-law, was elected speaker of the House in 2006 but has since stepped down. Gbollie is a former Taylor fighter and police official accused of human rights abuses, while Farley is an ex-MODEL commander and NTGL official accused of threatening the 2003 peace accord. In 2005, Liberia held well-administered elections with 1.35 million citizens registering to vote. Some NTGL ministers violated the peace accord by running for office, sparking controversy. Over 1 million voters participated in the elections, with voter registrations guiding decision-making on polling places and materials. In 2005, Liberia held well-administered elections with 1.35 million citizens registering to vote. Key election issues included national reconciliation, unity, corruption, jobs, economic growth, and social services. U.N. Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) and other agencies provided extensive support for voter education and polling materials. The large number of presidential candidates and political parties caused confusion for some voters. Polling on both election dates was peaceful, with UNMIL aid totaling $8 million and the European Union pledging $1 million. U.S. elections assistance supported nonprofit democracy strengthening organizations. The nonprofit democracy strengthening organizations IFES, NDI, and IRI provided elections technical assistance, civic education, and political party training in Liberia. The elections were monitored by numerous international organizations, governments, and civil society groups. Weah contested his loss in the second round and called for a re-run of the vote, but his claim was dismissed by the NEC. In late December 2005, Weah agreed to drop his claim and accept the poll results after meeting with Sirleaf and under international pressure. Observers doubted election fraud, and the process was seen as orderly and fair by U.S. officials and other governments. A by-election in late 2009 for the Montserrado County Senate seat did not produce a winner with the required 51% of votes. The election in Liberia saw a run-off between the Unity Party and Congress for Democratic Change candidates, with the CDC candidate winning with 56% of the votes. The election had a low voter turnout but was seen as a test for the National Elections Commission ahead of the 2011 national elections. According to IFES, an electoral capacity-building NGO working with the NEC, the 2011 election process in Liberia was free, fair, and transparent. The first round had challenges, but the second round improved significantly. IFES supported the NEC with technical and financial assistance under a USAID project. President Sirleaf's cabinet was seen as dominated by technocrats and professionals. President Sirleaf's administration was characterized by a detailed governance agenda, actions against corruption, and a focus on national reconciliation. She emphasized political inclusion, non-violence, and safeguarding civil liberties. Within the first 150 days, rapid impact projects were implemented in areas such as security, economic revitalization, basic services, and good governance. These pillars continued to guide her administration's long-term development efforts. President Sirleaf's administration's medium- to long-term development efforts are defined by the Liberia Reconstruction and Development Committee (LRDC), focusing on economic growth, job creation, natural resource exploitation, land reform, and infrastructure rehabilitation. Emphasis is placed on creating an investment-friendly climate and addressing high unemployment rates to ensure sustained economic growth and stability. The economic and educational disenfranchisement of Liberia's youth population has fueled armed conflicts, with joblessness leading to popular dissatisfaction. President Sirleaf aims to combat corruption by enforcing asset declarations and a national code of conduct. She also plans to address economic and financial management deficiencies through the Governance and Economic Management Program (GEMAP) and overhaul the civil service. President Sirleaf vowed to overhaul the \"seriously bloated\" civil service, improve civil servant pay, and institutionalize a meritocratic, performance-based system. She emphasized economic private sector-focused regional integration and security cooperation in her foreign policy. Sirleaf pledged to maintain strong international partnerships and ensure that Liberian soil is not used for aggression against neighboring countries. Her government also established diplomatic relations with Cuba and China after the departure of President Taylor. She acknowledged the special role of women in her election and the peace process. In her inaugural address, President Sirleaf pledged to empower Liberian women, strengthen laws to protect against rape, support children's education, and involve women in economic revitalization. She appointed women to key positions, audited the previous government, and revoked timber concession contracts. President Sirleaf took action to address corrupt timber concession contracts, leading to the lifting of a ban on Liberian timber exports by the U.N. Security Council in June 2006. She also initiated reviews of other contracts, fired officials accused of corruption, and released audit reports of state agencies. Additionally, her administration laid out a detailed status report on short-term policy and project implementation efforts in a document titled \"150 Day Action Plan: A Working Document for a New Liberia.\" President Sirleaf's administration demonstrated progress in implementing her plans, including increasing government transparency. Challenges remain in meeting high voter expectations, such as providing public electricity in Monrovia within six months of her election. The public expects rapid job growth, improvements in social services, and infrastructure development, especially in education and healthcare. President Sirleaf's administration is focused on building physical infrastructure to support education, healthcare, and transportation. She assures Liberians that ongoing investments in infrastructure and foreign investment projects will lead to sustained growth, but urges patience as these projects take time to generate jobs and incomes. Road building projects are underway, and the government is exploring options for electricity generation. Despite being largely donor-financed, Liberia's economy is growing rapidly, with a sharp increase in GDP reported by the Economist Intelligence Unit. Liberia's GDP is projected to increase significantly, with rates expected to reach 9.5% in 2008 and 11% in 2009. President Sirleaf is actively involved in economic policy, offshore oil exploration contracts, and African Union activities, often taking stances different from other African leaders. President Sirleaf has been involved in efforts to strengthen the Mano River Union and resolve the political crisis in Guinea. She has faced criticism for various decisions, including the nomination of Kabineh Janneh as a Supreme Court Justice. Despite praise for her support of human rights and the rule of law, her administration has been faulted for not establishing an Independent National Commission for Human Rights as required by a peace agreement. In 2009, President Sirleaf ratified an amended act and forwarded INCHR nominees to the Senate, which faced criticism for not confirming them. Reports of assaults on journalists by security agencies led to threats of a news blackout by the Press Union of Liberia. President Sirleaf promised to punish violators of rights, and her government emphasized respect for journalists. The Committee to Protect Journalists expressed concern over alleged attacks on the press in Liberia and urged President Sirleaf to investigate and punish those responsible. They emphasized the need for the government to restrain security forces from harassing journalists. The Committee to Protect Journalists urges President Sirleaf to investigate attacks on the press in Liberia and ensure a transparent investigation into corruption allegations. The government's efforts to address corruption include law enforcement actions, institutional reforms, and education programs, but may face challenges due to limited capacity. President Sirleaf's administration in Liberia has made progress in fighting corruption, but it remains a significant challenge. She acknowledged corruption as a systemic issue rooted in a long-standing culture of dependency and dishonesty. In 2008, she established the Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission to address the problem. President Sirleaf's administration in Liberia has made progress in fighting corruption by appointing Frances Johnson Morris as the chair of the Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission. The government has supported initiatives like GEMAP and LEITI to ensure transparency in governance. Additionally, efforts are being made to increase public sector compensation and capacity-building in the judicial sector. President Sirleaf's administration in Liberia has focused on combating corruption through initiatives like GEMAP and LEITI, along with efforts to increase public sector compensation and capacity-building in the judicial sector. Despite these efforts, some officials have faced corruption allegations, leading to the appointment of the Dunn Commission to investigate such claims. The Dunn Commission investigated corruption allegations in President Sirleaf's administration, including attempts to cover up issues and bribery of journalists. The General Auditing Commission, led by Auditor-General John Morlu, uncovered unaccounted spending in various ministries. Prominent cases involve former information minister Lawrence Bropleh. The Dunn Commission investigated corruption allegations in President Sirleaf's administration, including attempts to cover up issues and bribery of journalists. The General Auditing Commission uncovered unaccounted spending in various ministries, with prominent cases involving former information minister Lawrence Bropleh and other officials. The presidency has taken control due to allegations of mismanagement and possible corruption regarding county development funds. Liberia's security situation has improved since August 2003, but remains \"generally stable, but fragile.\" The Liberia National Police, supported by UNMIL civilian police, has seen increased patrols in the capital leading to a decrease in armed robbery. However, rates of other serious crimes, such as rape, remain high. Despite increasing capacity, challenges persist for the LNP. Despite increasing LNP capacity, challenges persist as rape rates, notably among juvenile females, remain high. The public relies on UNMIL CIVPOL for security, as the LNP faces operational deficits, absenteeism, and bribery issues. Judicial sector capacity is limited, with low public confidence. Clashes occur between police, security agencies, and AFL, with reports of violent assaults by AFL members. Former fighters associated with armed factions in Liberia were largely neutralized after the 2003 peace agreement. Over 101,000 ex-combatants were demobilized by UNMIL and NTGL by late 2004. Some ex-combatants still protest due to joblessness and lack of reintegration support, with a few turning to crime like armed robbery. A small minority of ex-combatants in Liberia have turned to crime, such as armed robbery and illegal exploitation of natural resources. Public security threats include armed robbery in Monrovia and periodic civil unrest related to socioeconomic grievances. Price increases for rice, fuel, and cement are also causing public dissatisfaction. In response, President Sirleaf temporarily suspended a $2 tax on bags of rice pending legislative tax reform consideration. Ritual-related killings by \"heartmen\" also pose a public safety concern. Community-level property disputes in Liberia, particularly in Nimba County, often involve the Gio/Mano and Mandingo ethnic groups. These conflicts stem from contested claims over home and land ownership, exacerbated by issues like lack of land rights documentation, property fraud involving state officials, and ineffective dispute resolution mechanisms. A Presidential Commission recommended pursuing community reconciliation and dispute resolution processes to address these issues. President Sirleaf ordered contested properties in Nimba to be returned to legal owners, and a national Land Commission was created to reform land tenure policies. The Commission, operational since 2010 with UN assistance, aims to prevent land conflicts. Political parties losing in elections pose a potential source of instability, as seen with threats to a witness in the Charles Taylor trial. In early 2008, former president Taylor faced death threats. Concerns were raised about his interference in Liberian affairs from exile in Nigeria. Speculation about his influence in the 2005 elections did not materialize, but some of his close associates were elected. Liberia, under U.N. sanctions, had top military officer Julu and associates arrested for treason but acquitted in 2008. Sanctions target individuals linked to Taylor regime, with travel bans and asset freezes. Partial arms embargo in place. Threat from instability in neighboring C\u00f4te d'Ivoire has decreased. The threat to Liberia's security from neighboring countries like Guinea has decreased after political accords were signed. President Sirleaf has received security support from the United States. An electrical fire occurred in the Executive Mansion. An electrical fire in the Executive Mansion in July 2006 highlighted Liberia's lack of emergency services. Firefighters from UNMIL, Firestone rubber company, and the international airport were called in to fight the blaze. The National Fire Service lacks capacity to respond to fires in the capital, as shown by incidents in August 2006 involving the U.S. Navy's Apache and a commercial freighter in the Port of Monrovia. Marine safety experts from the International Maritime Organization later assessed Liberia's search and rescue capabilities. The International Maritime Organization assessed Liberia's search and rescue capabilities. Ex-combatants on rubber plantations undermined post-war redevelopment by robbing workers and engaging in unsustainable practices. In 2006, the government and UNMIL troops took possession of a major plantation from former fighters. In western Liberia, the government and UNMIL repossessed a rubber plantation from former LURD ex-combatants involved in forced child labor and violent crimes. The objective was to make the rubber industry transparent, environmentally sustainable, and a source of legal jobs. UNMIL also planned to seize another ex-combatant-occupied plantation in Sinoe county. In May 2006, UNMIL's Human Rights and Protection Section studied Liberia's rubber sector and made key recommendations. The UNMIL studied Liberia's rubber sector and published key findings and recommendations on human rights concerns, post-conflict business practices, worker rights, environmental implications, and the rule of law within the sector. Despite the sector being under state regulatory control, labor disputes and conflicts over control of rubber at plantations continued to be a concern in February 2010. In November 2009, the president and general manager of a rubber plantation in Liberia was murdered by disgruntled workers. Liberia created a new military force with U.S. assistance, led by officers from West African countries. The recruit pool is ethnically diverse, but only 5% of the force is female, falling short of the 20% target. Selection of volunteer enlistees began to screen out human rights abusers. Selection of volunteer enlistees for screening out human rights abusers began in early 2006, with less than 20% of applicants accepted. Recruits underwent vetting by U.S. contractors, the U.S. embassy, UNMIL, and other donor governments. By late January 2009, 2,057 personnel were recruited, with basic training completed in late 2009. By mid-August 2008, 45 recruits had become officers, but UNMIL officials noted limited command effectiveness. Military restructuring was delayed by the need to demobilize over 13,000 irregular forces and AFL soldiers. The eligibility of over 13,000 irregular forces and AFL soldiers was confirmed, and funds were initially scarce for demobilization. U.S. assistance for post-war military SSR activities was managed by the State Department and carried out by DynCorp International and PAE. DynCorp assisted in vetting, recruiting, and training the new force, as well as providing maintenance services for two AFL bases. PAE offered construction services, specialty training, and logistics support. State Department expenditures for military SSR and AFL training are estimated. U.S. assistance for military SSR and training of the post-war AFL in Liberia totaled $240.56 million by the end of FY2009. Additional funding may be provided in FY2010 and FY2011. FMF and IMET programs administered by DSCA have supported these efforts. Capacity-building for Liberia's Ministry of Defense and defense policy framework establishment were also part of the assistance, although funding lapses led to mixed results. In early 2010, U.S. assistance for defense sector reform in Liberia entered a new phase, shifting towards military-to-military mentoring and advice for the newly trained Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL). This transition followed the approval of a new national security strategy and the passage of a national defense act in 2008. The AFL achieved operational status by December 2009, with the Liberian Ministry of Defense assuming full control in early 2010. The focus of U.S. support has moved from basic training to mentoring, with continued assistance for base operations and maintenance. DynCorp International has been contracted to provide $5.2 million worth of support for electrical power generation, water supply, waste disposal, and vehicle maintenance at two AFL bases during the first half of 2010. The Army Corps of Engineers plans to fund the design, construction, upgrade, and revitalization of arms and ammunition storage facilities at AFL bases. UNMIL troops are pursuing joint training with specialized AFL units. The mentoring mission, supported by State Department Foreign Military Financing, began in early 2010 and is led by a Marine-led team of approximately 60 U.S. Africa Command military personnel. Operation Onward Liberty is a military mission in Liberia led by a Marine team from U.S. Africa Command. The objective is to assist the Liberian government in building a professional and apolitical military that respects human rights. The team advises AFL units at various command levels to enhance locally led training. The activities are authorized by the U.S. Ambassador to Liberia, with day-to-day work overseen by a designated AFRICOM officer. The continuing training for the Armed Forces of Liberia is seen as crucial, with a focus on unit-level training. The Defense Department's Defense Institution Reform Initiative (DIRI) is working on improving the capacity of the Ministry of Defense and Liberia's defense policy structure. The DIRI Liberia program is in progress, with visits and assessments conducted in 2009 and 2010. The Liberian Ministry of Defense has established a working group to collaborate with the U.S. DIRI team, showing strong interest in the project. Planned activities include finalizing the National Defense Strategy to empower the Ministry in policy development, budgeting, and resource management. A long-term program roadmap with benchmarks will be implemented, assessed every 12-18 months. The U.S. will continue to provide support to the Armed Forces of Liberia as capacity-building progresses for long-term success and sustainability. The Liberian government aims to manage and fund the new AFL for long-term success. Defense Minister Brownie Samukai, Jr. plans to keep the defense budget at 9% or less of the national budget to ensure fiscal sustainability. However, competing development priorities may limit resources for the defense sector in the future. The Liberian government aims to fund the new AFL for long-term success, despite competing development priorities. Professionalization of the military is crucial for national defense and to prevent past destabilizing roles. Training and institution-building are necessary to ensure the military does not intervene in civilian politics. The new AFL is designed to be apolitical and professional, but there have been issues with absenteeism, protests about living conditions, and indiscipline among some members. While these problems have not threatened state stability, history suggests they could escalate if not addressed. Military absenteeism and indiscipline have led to negative outcomes in the past, including military ineffectiveness and abuse of civilians. The ineffectiveness and abuse of civilians by military units, along with protests over pay and living conditions, have led to state instability and coups. Liberia is developing a coast guard to protect its coast and exclusive economic zone, with U.S. assistance funded by the State Department. In August 2008, a USCG team conducted a technical needs assessment in Liberia to identify coast guard needs. The Ministry of Defense then selected new AFL members for the Liberian Coast Guard. In February 2009, a delegation of Liberian MOD and U.S. Embassy personnel visited USCG facilities in Washington and Virginia to discuss prospective LCG development plans. The assessment report provided core recommendations for creating a detailed LCG development plan, emphasizing a staged approach for program sustainability. Liberia was advised to prioritize constructing and staffing LCG headquarters at Freeport before establishing additional stations, and to coordinate training, facilities, and infrastructure effectively. The Liberian government initiated development of a LCG with a mission to carry out scaled-down versions of applicable USCG functions. An AFRICOM-funded USCG maritime/LCG advisor was deployed to Monrovia in September 2009 to provide training to LCG personnel. Training is expected to continue for multiple years with periodic supplementation. The Liberian Coast Guard (LCG) is undergoing training with the assistance of the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard. President Sirleaf attended an activation ceremony for the new LCG in February 2010. U.S. efforts include building waterfront facilities at Freeport and providing boats and equipment to the LCG. The duration of U.S. assistance will depend on LCG development progress. The U.S. is assisting the Liberian Coast Guard (LCG) with training and equipment. The duration of assistance will depend on LCG development progress, with informal projections suggesting it may last at least five years. Liberia joined the National Guard State Partnership Program (SPP) in 2009, twinned with the Michigan National Guard for civil-military and security cooperation activities. The Michigan-Liberia SPP partnership program is in its early stages, initiated in 2009. Michigan was chosen as Liberia's SPP partner. A specific engagement plan is yet to be finalized, but it is expected to align with existing AFRICOM and State Department plans. The next step may involve a Michigan NG field visit to Liberia for consultation. The Michigan-Liberia SPP partnership program is in its early stages, with plans for a Michigan NG field visit to Liberia to consult with U.S. embassy-based officials and finalize a partnership plan. Liberia has shown support for hosting the U.S. Africa Command, despite infrastructure limitations. Liberia has previously received U.S. Africa Partnership Station ship visits. The U.S. Africa Partnership Station (APS) program conducts ship visits to ports in the region for training, capacity-building, humanitarian, and cultural activities. It serves as a \"maritime university\" on U.S. navy ships, integrating personnel from various agencies to provide maritime safety and security training, as well as humanitarian assistance. Liberia has signed a ship boarding agreement with the U.S. under the Proliferation Security Initiative. The United States is involved in the Proliferation Security Initiative to prevent trafficking of weapons of mass destruction. The United Nations reports progress in police reform in Liberia, with challenges remaining. Despite training 3,661 Liberian National Police officers, operational capacity remains weak due to limited deployment and lack of infrastructure and equipment. The United Nations reports challenges in police reform in Liberia, including high rates of absenteeism, disciplinary problems, and limited leadership and skills within the Liberian National Police. Despite efforts to address these issues, mob violence and vigilante justice remain common due to operational weaknesses. The United Nations provides daily support to maintain law and order and sustain peace and stability in Liberia. Efforts to address misconduct and absenteeism in the Liberian National Police include the development of a Professional Standards Division and vetting payroll records. In collaboration with U.N. agencies, a workshop was held in mid-2008 to strategize long-term development in areas such as professional standards, logistics, human resources, and management. A strategic plan and capacity building projects costing $18 million were presented to donor governments in 2009, with limited support received. The UNDP established a Liberia Justice and Security Trust Fund in 2009 to potentially fund police needs. The Liberian National Police (LNP) is currently unarmed due to previous U.N. Security Council arms embargos. The Police Support Unit (PSU) and Emergency Response Unit (ERU) were established to provide armed backing and respond to public disorder and critical threats. The ERU currently has 287 personnel, with plans to add 47 more after training in March 2010. The ERU will not be further expanded in the short-term due to tactical demands. The ERU in Liberia, heavily reliant on UNMIL air assets for deployment, faces challenges in long-term sustainability and effectiveness due to resource constraints and lack of equipment. The United States continues to provide training assistance to the LNP and ERU through UNMIL, primarily through U.S. civilian police officers. The United States provides aid to the Liberian National Police (LNP) through the State Department's INL bureau to develop a credible and competent police service that respects human rights and the rule of law. This aid includes equipment, logistical support, and training to improve police-community relations and prevent human rights abuses. Additionally, a U.S. police Senior Advisory Team (SAT) works with UNMIL to enhance LNP leadership in various areas such as personnel policies, internal affairs, and civilian oversight. In FY2010, the Obama Administration plans to deploy additional ERU advisors to provide field training and mentoring program for the ERU; provide training and equipping for the PSU; and provide non-lethal equipment and support police infrastructure improvements. U.S. and UNMIL assistance efforts also support the rehabilitation of the judicial and penal systems through programs like the INL-administered Justice Sector Support Liberia (JSSL) project and USAID-funded rule of law programs. The JSSL program aims to improve the administration of justice, adherence to the rule of law, and respect for human rights by deploying legal and technical advisors, providing training and equipment, and strengthening justice sector effectiveness and infrastructure. The program aims to develop and strengthen the justice sector in Liberia, focusing on the judicial system, Ministry of Justice, corrections system, and rule of law organizations. Efforts include creating a public defender program, training prosecutors, renovating judicial buildings, implementing a case-numbering system, and enhancing LNP-prosecutor linkages. The Special Security Service is undergoing restructuring and professionalization. The Special Security Service (SSS), led by Benjamin Yeaten, a former Taylor militia commander, gained a brutal reputation. Under the Sirleaf Administration, some SSS leaders were seen as corrupt and unprofessional. Following restructuring, 841 SSS members accepted buyout packages funded by the US and UK in May 2006. However, there are reports of decommissioned officers not receiving their severance packages, leading to protests. Some claimants are reportedly ineligible for severance. The restructuring of the Special Security Service (SSS) under the Sirleaf Administration involved professionalizing the organization with the assistance of the State Department's Diplomatic Security Service (DSS). DSS provided close protection services for President Sirleaf and trained SSS agents in close protection and perimeter security. Additionally, 600 SSS officers received UNMIL police training, leading to improved humanitarian conditions post-war. Some protesting claimants are reportedly ineligible for severance payments. Liberia has seen improvements in conditions post-war, with high rates of poverty still prevalent. The country remains heavily reliant on international food aid and assistance, focusing more on resettlement and socioeconomic recovery rather than emergency humanitarian needs. By mid-February 2006, 200,000 Liberian refugees had returned, and by late April 2006, over 321,000 internally displaced persons had resettled with assistance from various organizations. Reconstruction efforts are ongoing with support from U.N. agencies, NGOs, and NTGL ministries. Reconstruction and capacity building projects in Liberia have been implemented by NGOs and NTGL ministries, focusing on nutrition, water, sanitation, health care, and transport infrastructure. Schools have reopened with UNICEF's assistance, and most child ex-combatants have been reintegrated into their communities. The U.N. Secretary-General reported in March 2006 that 65,000 demobilized ex-combatants had benefited from reintegration projects, with funding still needed for about 5,125 ex-fighters. Liberia continues to face public health challenges. Liberia faces public health challenges with endemic malaria, water-borne illnesses, and inadequate health infrastructure. Donor-backed initiatives, such as UNICEF and WHO, are helping to improve healthcare capacity through reopening health clinics, vaccination campaigns, and coordinating efforts to combat diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. WHO and FAO are also assisting in creating an avian flu surveillance and response plan. The government in Liberia is focusing on creating an avian flu surveillance and response plan. Recent survey data shows lower HIV prevalence rates than previously assumed, with a national adult infection rate of 1.5%. Efforts are being made to support public education on AIDS prevention and care for orphans and vulnerable children. The World Health Organization, along with other U.N. agencies and the NTGL, is developing project proposals to combat AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis in Liberia. The U.N. Population Fund supports AIDS awareness and prevention programs, while USAID implements various AIDS-related programs in partnership with other donors. President Sirleaf has vowed to address the 12% HIV infection rate in Liberia. President Sirleaf vowed to tackle the 12% HIV infection rate in Liberia. Members suggested Liberia be considered for U.S. assistance under PEPFAR. Liberia has received about $.7 million a year in GHAI funds. Liberia's government is modeled on the U.S. system with three branches: bicameral legislature, executive branch, and judiciary. Liberia's government consists of a 30-member Senate, a presidentially led executive branch, and a judiciary. Legislators and the president are directly elected, with term limits in place. The NTGL government operated outside the constitution, suspending certain provisions during its tenure. The constitution provides for checks and balances among the branches of government. The executive branch historically exerted extensive influence over the legislature, judiciary, and local governments in Liberia. Presidents wielded exceptional powers, controlled the legal system, security forces, and economy. Public sector corruption and political patronage led to uneven development, depriving rural populations of services. President Sirleaf focused on national unity and robust governance, avoiding aggregating power in her office. The new president of Liberia emphasizes building national unity, robust governance, fighting corruption, and developing state institutions. She may not rule unilaterally like her predecessors due to her focus on institutional development. Despite a weaker electoral mandate, with no party holding a legislative majority, there is potential for opposition parties to cooperate in strengthening their institutional power vis-\u00e0-vis the executive branch. The legislature in Liberia aims to increase its institutional power in policy-making, but President Sirleaf has been dominant due to strong executive leadership and limited legislative capacity. Most bills originate from the executive branch, with few exceptions like the rejection of an asset seizures bill in 2007. The Sirleaf administration focuses on anti-corruption initiatives due to the governance record of its predecessor, the NTGL. The NTGL faced challenges in restoring state authority and rehabilitating institutions due to inefficiencies, resource constraints, and lack of capacities. Despite obstacles, progress was made with the deployment of officials outside Monrovia and the opening of regional Central Bank offices, supported by USAID. The NTGL faced challenges in restoring state authority and rehabilitating institutions. Governance capacity-building efforts were hindered by reports of corruption within the NTGL, particularly in import-export transactions and government contracts. Lack of transparency in revenue collection and resistance to reforms were noted by the U.N. Secretary-General and the World Bank. National fiscal mechanisms under the NTGL were chaotic and prone to manipulation. The NTGL governance faced challenges with chaotic and manipulative fiscal mechanisms, including misuse of government funds and resources, drawing condemnation from local and foreign entities. This jeopardized critical developmental programs and international donor support. The U.S. Embassy criticizes the misappropriation of Liberian government resources, stating it undermines trust and perpetuates a culture of impunity. Officials engaging in such actions may face consequences, including ineligibility for U.S.-funded programs and services. A corruption case involving embezzlement of funds from the Liberia Petroleum Refinery Company is under investigation. Former National Transitional Government of Liberia (NTGL) Chairman Gyude Bryant and four former LPRC executives are being tried for alleged embezzlement of $1.3 million. Bryant faces charges of economic sabotage and possible 10-year prison sentence. He unsuccessfully claimed sovereign immunity as a serving head of state during the alleged crimes. Liberia's Supreme Court approved his trial in August 2007. Former NTGL Chairman Gyude Bryant was denied immunity for alleged embezzlement of $1.3 million. Other NTGL officials, like former Finance Minister Lusinee Kamara, also faced corruption charges. Court proceedings in these cases have been slow. Deals during NTGL's tenure, like a diamond concession deal and oil exploration permits, raised concerns about transparency and propriety. The NTGL granted oil exploration permits to three small firms before elections and signed long-term concession deals with Firestone and Mittal Steel. The Firestone deal extended rights to cultivate rubber on large plantation areas for 36 years in exchange for $.50 per acre per year and various investments. The NTGL signed long-term concession deals with Mittal Steel Holdings, allowing for the extraction and shipment of iron ore from northern Liberia in exchange for capital investments totaling $900 million. The initial 25-year term was extendable for an additional 25 years, drawing criticism from civil society groups. The Mittal deal signed by the NTGL for iron ore extraction in Liberia was politically controversial and faced legal challenges. Critics alleged lack of transparency, but Mittal defended the deal as won through a competitive bid process. The deal was expected to bring foreign investment and infrastructure development to Liberia. Former U.S. Ambassador John Blaney advocated for a multi-use railroad as part of the investment arrangement. Investment would be made into a multi-use railroad, regardless of the firm awarded mining rights. Firestone contract has drawn attention for poor working conditions, high production quotas, and pollution allegations. Firestone denies polluting the Farmington River, stating compliance with environmental laws and safe drinking wells development. The Firestone group is facing a class action suit in California alleging child labor and forced labor practices. Firestone denies the charges, stating compliance with Liberian laws and providing well-paid adult workers with social services. In June 2007, a U.S. District Court judge granted Firestone's motion to dismiss most counts in a case involving child labor claims. Firestone production decreased due to a labor strike over worker benefits and union leadership control. The Liberian Supreme Court ratified the election of a new Firestone workers union, which had been contested by the previous company-controlled union. President Sirleaf vowed to address labor issues upon taking office. President Sirleaf vowed to review and renegotiate concession contracts signed by the NTGL to ensure fair terms and protect Liberia's interests. A renegotiated contract with ArcelorMittal took effect in May 2007, with the firm increasing its investment to $1.5 billion over ten years. The government expects the new contract to create 20,000 jobs for Liberians. Global Witness released a detailed summary comparing the old Mittal contract with the new one. Improvements in the revised contract include provisions for iron ore prices to be set by the market, a limited five-year tax holiday for Mittal, Liberian control over key infrastructure assets, non-exemption from future laws, and recognition of the parent company's liabilities. Global Witness criticizes the Mittal contract for prioritizing the company over Liberian law on taxes and royalties, as well as for a confidentiality clause hindering revenue monitoring. Challenges may change with Liberia joining EITI in 2009. A new contract with Firestone was renegotiated in 2008, with an investment of $130 million. The new Firestone contract, renegotiated in 2008, includes a $130 million investment in replanting and a rubber wood processing plant. Firestone is now subject to paying taxes, improving living conditions for workers, and limited land holdings. The government plans to use this agreement as a model for other plantation concessions. The NTGL took steps to combat corruption, establishing a Task Force and Cash Management Committee to eliminate bribery, especially in commodity imports through better port management. In late April 2005, the National Transitional Legislative Assembly (NTLA) created a committee to investigate irregularities by its leadership, leading to the removal of key NTLA leaders. Some officials resisted transparency measures, hindering an African Development Bank loan and an ECOWAS-sponsored audit mission. Chairman Bryant suspended two officials in July 2005 for alleged fund diversion. The NTGL suspended Bureau of Maritime Affairs officials and Liberia's International Maritime Organization representative for fraud involving funds from Inmarsat. The United States sent Treasury Department experts to advise on tackling corruption and building judicial capacity in Liberia. Efforts continued under the Sirleaf administration to address concerns over transparency. Efforts to address concerns over transparency in NTGL-led Liberia led to hesitancy in providing aid, impacting resettlement and rehabilitation. Despite this, progress has been made by various organizations through the Results-Focused Transitional Framework. However, a more comprehensive strategy is needed for long-term development. Relations between Liberia and donor governments have improved under President Sirleaf. President Sirleaf has improved Liberian-donor government relations by supporting anti-corruption efforts and initiating financial audits of the outgoing transitional government. She also canceled existing logging concessions and implemented forestry sector reforms based on recommendations from the Liberian Forest Concession Review Committee. The Liberian government effectively canceled logging concessions and established the Forestry Reform Monitoring Committee (FRMC) to regulate future contracts. Global Witness praised the move but called for greater support from UNMIL to ensure a secure environment for the Forestry Development Authority. UNMIL and the Liberia Forest Initiative are assisting with timber reforms, with the FRMC tasked with implementing land-use planning principles, a timber tracking system, and a market-based tax system. The Liberian government established a timber production and export chain-of-custody tracking system, a market value-based tax system, revised contract requirements, transparent forest concession allocation procedures, and a regulatory and law enforcement regime to counter financial and tax fraud, human rights abuses, economic sabotage, and violations of labor laws. The Forestry Reform Monitoring Committee (FRMC) was tasked with implementing these reforms and advising on the implementation of GEMAP goals related to the Liberian Forestry Development Authority. Sirleaf's actions included canceling logging concessions, creating the Forestry Reform Monitoring Committee (FRMC), and implementing forestry reforms. The UN Security Council lifted the ban on Liberian timber exports in 2006 due to these steps, citing the government's commitment to transparent forest management. However, Global Witness opposed the lifting of sanctions and warned of reinstating the ban if forestry reform legislation is not adopted. In October 2006, President Sirleaf signed the National Forestry Reform Law of 2006, dividing Liberia's forest lands into three categories. Global Witness opposed the Security Council's lifting of sanctions, citing concerns over the government's control of forest lands and forestry sector reforms. The U.S. Treasury is preparing regulations to allow the import of Liberian timber into the United States. The National Forestry Reform Law of 2006 in Liberia divides forest lands into categories for logging and wood processing. Logging firms must disclose revenues, with 30% going towards community services. The law lacks clarity on revenue distribution, leading to potential political controversy. Liberia's Forestry Development Authority has implemented a timber concession bidding process in line with the law. Environmental activists monitor to ensure conservation goals are met in Liberia's diverse forests. Liberia's forests, constituting 45% of the remaining Upper Guinea Forest, are home to rare and endangered flora and fauna. Timber exports contributed significantly to the country's foreign exchange earnings, totaling at least $146 million in 2002. However, sanctions imposed in 2003 led to a decline in earnings. Pre-war timber revenues were estimated to make up half of all export earnings. Future export levels are uncertain, depending on factors like price and sustainable forestry practices. The Taylor regime in Liberia was accused of allowing unsustainable forestry practices and diverting earnings from the timber sector for illicit activities. Liberia was admitted into the Kimberley Process in 2007, following the lifting of an export ban on diamonds. The future export levels of timber are uncertain due to factors like price and sustainable forestry practices. Liberia joined the Kimberley Process in 2007, opening diamond screening offices and issuing licenses. The government suspended diamond mining licenses until meeting certification criteria. The United States supported capacity building efforts, including establishing a diamond office in Monrovia. U.S. assistance in Liberia includes training diamond evaluators, supporting regional offices, providing salary support, offering technical training in various areas, conducting geological assessments, and establishing a database for tracking diamond production and Kimberley Process compliance. The U.S. provided assistance in Liberia for tracking diamond production and Kimberley Process compliance, including issuing 1,000 rough diamond export certificates. Diamond deposits in Liberia are mostly alluvial, but Diamond Fields International discovered kimberlite in Grand Cape County in January 2006. Liberia's future diamond production could increase significantly if the kimberlite in Grand Cape County is confirmed to be rich in diamonds. The Sirleaf Administration strongly supports the Governance and Economic Management Assistance Program (GEMAP) to improve financial management, budgeting, and control corruption in the country. The Sirleaf Administration strongly supports the Governance and Economic Management Assistance Program (GEMAP) in Liberia, which focuses on governance reform, capacity building in key ministries, public accountability, and contract-based management of revenue and expenditure flows in key public sector entities. International financial comptrollers were appointed to enforce central government controls over state revenues and improve public fiscal capacities. The Governance and Economic Management Assistance Program (GEMAP) in Liberia involves key ministries, revenue-earning agencies, and donor-assisted support for economic governance and financial management. GEMAP's international comptrollers relinquished co-signatory authority to government counterparts in agencies meeting program goals. Liberia is also a signatory of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Liberia is a signatory of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and became the second EITI Compliant Country in October 2009 after undergoing EITI validation. The country committed to join EITI in October 2006 and formally agreed to participate under a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in April 2008. This commitment was made shortly after the formation of the Liberia Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (LEITI), a national group comprising government, civil society, and private business stakeholders. The MOU committed LEITI members to implement EITI principles in Liberia, including forestry and agricultural sectors. Actions taken included a forestry scooping, a presidential proclamation, a public communications strategy, and EITI validation reports. In July 2009, a public act established LEITI as an independent state entity. The public act established LEITI as an independent state entity in Liberia, requiring public access to all contracts subject to LEITI reporting compliance. Liberia's current Congress could potentially have a more prominent role in governance, with many enthusiastic Members determined to assertively exercise constitutional powers despite challenges like legislators' relative inexperience. Many Members of Liberia's current Congress lack lawmaking or policy-making experience and struggle with basic legislative functions. Staff often lack training and expertise, with university students sometimes filling in due to low pay for professional staff. Many offices in Liberia's Congress struggle due to low pay, lack of skilled staff hired through contacts, and limited institutional resources. Bill drafting expertise is lacking, with most bills drafted by the executive branch or outside organizations. Record keeping is done by hand, leading to incomplete documentation of legislative debates and decisions. The size of Liberian Members' office staffs is large, with a high proportion performing non-legislative services. The legislature faces challenges such as duplicate services, lack of office space and equipment, and a Capitol building in need of upgrades. Some are concerned about legislators' lack of knowledge and the institution's potential effectiveness being curtailed. Legislators' lack of knowledge about their roles may lead to misuse of office for personal gain, highlighted by reports of looting government property. Similar concerns arose during negotiations for forestry law reforms. Some legislators viewed successful reform as personally benefiting from processes like forestry concessions, amid public skepticism due to past corruption. The United States supported a $1.8 million project to rehabilitate the Capitol and assist the legislature. The United States supported a $1.8 million USAID project to rehabilitate the Capitol and provide legislative capacity-building assistance through the National Democratic Institute (NDI) for modernizing the Liberian legislature. NDI's program aims to improve legislative effectiveness, staff capabilities, and legislator capacity in fulfilling their roles. The National Democratic Institute (NDI) is working closely with the Joint Legislative Modernization Committee (JLMC) and the Women's Legislative Caucus of Liberia (WLCL) to strengthen legislative capacity in Liberia. NDI is also providing support to a local radio partner to connect lawmakers with constituents and disseminate information on legislative activities nationwide. Additionally, Congress is directly supporting governance capacity-building in Liberia through the House Democracy Assistance Commission (HDAC) House Democracy Partnership (HDP) program. The HDAC House Democracy Partnership (HDP) program aims to provide technical assistance to newly democratic countries' parliaments. This includes Member Outbound Programs and Staff Institutes to improve legislative capabilities and bilateral relations. Overseas training sessions for partner legislature staff focus on budget analysis, committee operations, research, and administration. Member Inbound Programs involve partner legislature members traveling to the US for training on Congressional operations and constituent services. Specialized trainings cover defense oversight, ethics, and budget committee work. HDAC provides material assistance for legislative research and library capacity-building in Liberia. Former Liberian President Charles Taylor is defending himself against war crimes charges. Former Liberian President Charles Taylor is facing war crimes charges for aiding activities in support of the armed insurgency in Sierra Leone. His trial is being held at the SCSL in the Hague, Netherlands, with proceedings delayed due to Taylor boycotting the trial and changing his defense team. The new team requested more funding and a postponement to review extensive evidence before the trial resumed. The trial of former Liberian President Charles Taylor at the SCSL in the Hague, Netherlands, resumed in January 2008 with testimony from 91 witnesses for the Prosecution. The defense began its case in July 2009, and cross-examination of defense witnesses by the Prosecutor's Office continued into early 2010. Taylor was taken into SCSL custody in March 2006 after his arrest at a border checkpoint in Nigeria while trying to cross into Cameroon. He had fled Calabar, Nigeria, where he had lived since 2003 under asylum, two days after Liberia was declared free to take him into custody. After Nigeria's government declared Liberia free to take Charles Taylor into custody, he was captured and extradited to Liberia in a Nigerian presidential jet. He was then flown to the premises of the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) in Freetown, where he pleaded not guilty but questioned the court's jurisdiction. In June 2006, Taylor was transferred to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague, Netherlands, where the trial took place with the agreement of the Dutch government. The Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) will conduct Charles Taylor's trial in the Hague, Netherlands, with legal control retained by the SCSL. The decision to transfer Taylor was made for security reasons and to prevent potential instability in Sierra Leone and Liberia. Some debate the implications of moving the trial outside of Africa, arguing it should have been held in the country where the crimes took place. Some argue that holding Charles Taylor's trial in Sierra Leone would demonstrate accountability for human rights violations in the region. Concerns exist about limited local media coverage due to cost and access issues. Some argue for holding Charles Taylor's trial in Sierra Leone to demonstrate accountability for human rights violations in the region. Concerns about limited local media coverage and logistical challenges favoring a trial in the Hague. Moving the trial overseas has sparked debate over potential risks to witness participation and the reputation of the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL). Moving Charles Taylor's trial to the Hague has reduced the risk of political unrest in Sierra Leone and Liberia. Holding the trial in a distant location is seen as a way to help the countries overcome the trauma of war and focus on peace and reconstruction. President Sirleaf's government has faced challenges due to Taylor's extradition and the delicate nature of his case. President Sirleaf's government faced challenges regarding Charles Taylor's extradition and the delicate nature of his case. Concerns were raised about potential instability if Sirleaf alienated Taylor's supporters, given his past as a warlord. Sirleaf had expressed intentions to repatriate or transfer Taylor to the Special Court for Sierra Leone under certain conditions. President Sirleaf's government faced challenges regarding Charles Taylor's extradition. She managed the process leading to his exile, considering timing and security concerns. Any solution required the approval of the EU, AU, and West African leaders. Despite initial reluctance, her government eventually requested Taylor's extradition from Nigeria, leading to his capture. In mid-July 2007, a bill was submitted to seize and recover allegedly misappropriated assets. The government attempted to seize assets allegedly misappropriated by Charles Taylor and his associates, but the bill was rejected due to concerns about due process rights. The United States supports the Special Court for Sierra Leone's mandate to try war crimes, seen as a more efficient alternative to larger international criminal tribunals. The Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) has been questioned for its cost-effectiveness compared to larger war crimes courts. However, officials argue that the court has maintained a rapid trial process, is expected to leave a legacy of buildings and institutions to bolster the rule of law in the region, and has achieved milestones in international justice. The Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) is the first international court to indict a sitting African head of state for war crimes. It faces a funding shortfall that could impact its ability to complete judicial activities and wind up operations on schedule. Additionally, the court may encounter difficulties in financing long-term residual activities related to witness protection and archival activities. The Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) faces challenges in funding its judicial activities and residual activities. There is occasional friction between the Bush Administration and the SCSL regarding the court's actions and their impact on political events in West Africa. Some critics fault the Administration for not pushing harder to extradite former Liberian President Taylor from Nigeria. The United States pursued the extradition of Taylor from Nigeria after he was granted asylum in 2003. Calls for a special court to try crimes from Liberia's civil wars have been made, with some Liberians seeking justice for past atrocities. President Sirleaf may not support prosecuting war time atrocities to avoid reigniting old conflicts. Many Liberians have personal ties to the conflict and fear tribunals could lead to further unrest. Some argue that creating a tribunal for Liberia's civil wars may face legal and political obstacles, including potential opposition from lawmakers who could be targeted for prosecution. Peace agreements for the first civil war included amnesty provisions, but there is no legal barrier to one for the second civil war. The 2003 Comprehensive Peace Agreement suggested general amnesty but did not explicitly provide for it, aiming to address impunity and allow victims and perpetrators to share their experiences. President Sirleaf inaugurated the Liberian Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in 2006 to investigate crimes and human rights abuses from 1979 to 2003. The TRC faced financial challenges but resumed operations in 2007, collecting testimony from the Liberian community in the United States with support from advocacy groups. The Liberian Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) resumed field hearings in Liberia in October 2007 with support from the U.N. Development Program and USAID. In June 2009, the TRC released a draft of its final report, formally published in December 2009, which examined the root causes of armed conflict in Liberia and presented findings on human rights violations. Recommendations included lists of alleged perpetrators for prosecution and non-judicial public sanctions. The Liberian Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) released a controversial final report in December 2009, recommending prosecution and public sanctions for alleged perpetrators of human rights violations during the armed conflict in Liberia. President Sirleaf was included on the list of individuals recommended to be barred from holding public office for thirty years. The report also addressed issues such as public integrity, corruption, human rights, and national reconciliation. The Liberian Truth and Reconciliation Commission recommended barring President Sirleaf from holding public office for thirty years. Sirleaf's initial support for Charles Taylor was attributed to being \"fooled by\" him, but she later became disillusioned with him and never joined his armed rebel movement. President Sirleaf rejected the TRC's recommendation to bar her from holding public office, citing concerns about due process rights. She announced her intention to seek reelection in 2011 and proposed amendments to the INHRC Act in response to the TRC's recommendations on criminal sanctions. Amendments were made to the INHRC Act of 2005 to address recommendations from the TRC Report. Former President Taylor's son, Roy M. Belfast Jr., pleaded guilty to passport fraud in 2006 and was sentenced to 11 months in prison. Roy M. Belfast Jr. was sentenced to 11 months in prison for passport fraud in December 2006. Following this, he pled not guilty to charges of torture and conspiracy to torture while serving as the head of the Liberian Anti-Terrorist Unit during his father's presidency. Belfast is the first person charged under a U.S. statute allowing prosecution for acts of torture committed abroad. The initial charges related to the alleged 2002 torture of one person, with other victims accusing him of similar crimes. In November 2007, Roy M. Belfast Jr. was charged with torturing at least seven Liberians under a conspiracy to maintain his father's political power. The charges included violent acts like burning, beating, stabbing, and electrical shocks, some associated with murder, between April 1999 and July 2003. Human Rights Watch submitted a dossier to the Justice Department in support of the allegations against Belfast. After a U.S. Southern District of Florida judge denied a defense motion to dismiss the case, Belfast's trial was held over six weeks. Roy M. Belfast Jr. was convicted on multiple counts of torture, conspiracy to torture, and using a firearm while committing a violent crime. He was sentenced to 97 years in prison in January 2009. In a civil court case, plaintiffs won a default judgment against Belfast and were awarded $22.4 million in compensation for physical and mental suffering. Belfast, like former President Taylor, is also subject to a U.S. asset freeze and a United Nations travel ban. The United States and Liberia have a historical relationship, with the US providing substantial assistance. Current US-Liberian relations are warm, despite past issues with corruption and human rights abuses. Belfast may have supported the Revolutionary Front of Sierra Leone, leading to his conviction for torture and a US asset freeze. U.S.-Liberian relations have been warm since the Bush Administration, with former President Bush admiring President Sirleaf's leadership and achievements. The U.S. has provided substantial post-war rebuilding assistance to Liberia. In 2007, President Bush awarded President Sirleaf the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 2008, President and Mrs. Bush visited Liberia and other African countries. Various U.S. officials have consistently supported President Sirleaf's government. During a visit in April 2010, Under Secretary of State William J. Burns praised Liberia's progress since the 2005 election but noted the need for further recovery from the civil war. He reiterated the U.S.' commitment to supporting Liberia's democratic development, echoing previous statements by Secretary of State Clinton in 2009. During a visit in April 2010, Under Secretary of State William J. Burns praised Liberia's progress since the 2005 election and announced a U.S. commitment of $19.75 million for Liberia National Police force training, fulfilling a promise made by Secretary Clinton. Clinton's 2009 visit emphasized the importance of democratic participation, institution-building, and addressing challenges like corruption, land tenure reform, lack of access to jobs, electricity, housing, education, and law enforcement in Liberia. President Sirleaf called on the legislature to develop budgetary oversight, counter corruption, promote transparency, and ensure ethical standards for the common good. She also urged the legislature to help ensure free and fair elections in 2011. Additionally, she discussed the importance of U.S., multilateral, and Liberian partnership in rebuilding Liberia's police force, emphasizing the U.S. investment in the development of the LNP Emergency Response Unit. Sirleaf announced a prospective increase in U.S. financial support for LNP training. President Sirleaf has made several official visits to the United States, including meetings with U.S. officials to discuss priorities for Liberia and the status of Charles Taylor. She is expected to undertake another visit in late May 2010 to deepen high-level contacts with Obama Administration officials. President Sirleaf is expected to update U.S. policy makers on Liberia's progress and challenges in areas such as security sector reform, anti-corruption efforts, and economic growth during her upcoming visit to meet with Obama Administration officials. The visit may also involve discussions on potential development assistance programs for Liberia. Issues likely to continue drawing attention in the 111th and forthcoming 112th Congress include Liberia's progress in security sector reform, anticorruption efforts, economic growth prospects, and politico-military stability before the UNMIL drawdown. The 111th Congress allocated funds for Liberia-related provisions in FY2009 and FY2010 appropriations, including a $6 million international exchange grant program for Marquette University. The US allocated $90.3 million in Economic Support Fund assistance for Liberia, with a focus on increasing access to electricity and strengthening the rule of law. Efforts to trace and freeze assets allegedly controlled by former Liberian President Charles Taylor were also supported. Funding was encouraged for programs working with the Liberian Solicitor General to recover these funds. The Trade and Development Agency was directed to consult on the next phase of work related to the Mount Coffee Hydro Power Station. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 allocated $153 million in ESF assistance and $10 million in regional Peacekeeping Operations funding for Liberia. Funds were directed to promote transparency and accountability in natural resource extraction. Some Members have advocated for measures to allow certain Liberian refugees to reside in the United States. Some Members are urging for an extension of Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) for eligible Liberian aliens in the United States. Two bills propose permanent residence status for Liberian refugees. A conference was held to support the extension of DED, with Representative Donald M. Payne leading efforts to urge President Obama for an extension. In late February 2010, over 20 Members wrote a letter to President Obama urging an extension of DED. Two bills, S. 656 and H.R. 2258, seek to adjust the immigration status of Liberians in the United States, with S. 656 directing the Secretary of Homeland Security to adjust residency status to lawful permanent residents for qualifying applicants. H.R. 2258 provides a similar immigration status adjustment process for qualifying Liberians as S. 656, but with different eligibility criteria. Eligibility under H.R. 2258 is limited to Liberian U.S. alien residents granted TPS on or after March 27, 1991. Liberia-related bills in the 111th Congress include H.R. 2410, which has not been passed into law. The Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 2010 and 2011, proposes a State Department exchange program with the Liberian Women's Legislative Caucus to increase female participation in Liberian politics. H.R. 2475, the Foreign Relations Authorization and Reform Act, contains a similar provision. The program is estimated to cost under $.5 million per year and $1 million between 2010 and 2014. S. 1434, the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2010, would mandate assistance funds for Liberia. The Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 2010 and 2011, proposes a State Department exchange program with the Liberian Women's Legislative Caucus to increase female participation in Liberian politics. The program is estimated to cost under $.5 million per year and $1 million between 2010 and 2014. The Act mandates that assistance funds for Liberia be used to promote transparency and accountability in the extraction of natural resources, including by strengthening implementation of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme. The 110th Congress continued Liberia-related activities from the previous Congress, focusing on aiding post-war governance and economic rebuilding. Key issues included rehabilitating public facilities, progress under the GEMAP transparency initiative, security sector restructuring, and maritime and land border monitoring capacity building. The 110th Congress provided funding for Liberia's post-war rebuilding process, including $120.81 million in FY2007 and $48.95 million in supplementary funding under P.L. 110-28. In FY2008, Congress allocated $125.35 million for Liberia under P.L. 110-161. In FY2008, Congress allocated $163 million to Liberia under P.L. 110-161 for various development projects including roads, bridges, water, sanitation, electricity, vocational education, government accountability, narcotics control, educational exchanges, and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Other bills related to Liberia were also introduced in the 110th Congress. Several Liberia-related bills were introduced in the 110th Congress, including H.R. 1941 (Kennedy) - Liberian Refugee Immigration Protection Act of 2007, H.R. 1591 (Obey) - U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007, and S. 396 (Dorgan) - a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Energy Production Tax Incentives Act of 2007 and S. 1903 aimed to extend temporary protected status for Liberians until September 30, 2008.
