    "content": "In recent years, congressional interest in federal workforce compensation has increased due to the federal fiscal situation and the state of the economy post-recession. The pay differential between federal and private sector employees is a key issue, with studies showing conflicting results on whether federal workers have a wage penalty or premium compared to their private sector counterparts. The comparison of compensation between federal and private sector workers has yielded conflicting findings, making it challenging to determine the actual disparity. This report aims to explain the varying conclusions of recent studies and highlight the limitations of their methodologies. Despite some studies being methodologically sound, the lack of a universally accepted approach results in divergent outcomes. Any modeling of the relationship between federal and private sector worker compensation involves assumptions that influence results. Data limitations hinder researchers from fully specifying models due to the lack of a dataset combining detailed worker and job characteristics. Various attempts have been made to address the issue of compensation between the federal and private sectors, with conflicting findings. Two basic approaches to comparing federal and private-sector compensation are the human capital approach and the jobs analysis approach. These approaches may produce opposite results and are difficult to combine due to data limitations. The \"human capital\" approach aims to control observable characteristics that affect compensation when comparing workers. Recent studies comparing federal and private sector compensation have been conducted by official government bodies or have received significant attention in policy debates. The human capital approach aims to control observable characteristics that affect compensation when comparing workers. Various forms of human capital, such as educational attainment and job tenure, are positively associated with earnings. Other individual characteristics like age, sex, and race also impact earnings. Studies using this approach aim to isolate the effect of the variable of interest, which is sector of employment in federal compensation studies. Studies using a human capital model, such as the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) study, compare compensation of workers in federal and private sectors. Data sources for these models are typically household surveys like the U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey (CPS). The \"jobs analysis\" approach focuses on comparing compensation for similar jobs based on duties and responsibilities. The \"jobs analysis\" approach compares compensation for similar jobs in different sectors based on duties and responsibilities. Matching comparable jobs in different sectors is key, but data limitations often restrict the ability to match jobs with identical tasks and responsibilities. This can be a significant limitation when trying to assess actual job responsibilities and tasks. The \"jobs analysis\" approach compares compensation for similar jobs in different sectors based on duties and responsibilities. Job titles like \"manager\" can mask differences in job functions. For example, a manager of a small retail store and a manager of a federal department may have very different responsibilities. Even within the same sector, differences in duties exist. The President's Pay Agent uses this approach to study pay differences between federal and private sector workers. The President's Pay Agent compares pay differences between federal and private sector workers by analyzing actual tasks and responsibilities, aiming to control for demographic factors to attribute compensation differences solely to the sector of employment. Omitted variable bias is inevitable in such studies due to limitations in measuring all individual and job characteristics. Data limitations may hinder researchers from comparing pay differences between white males of the same age with bachelor's degrees working in the federal government and private sector. Omitted variable bias affects human capital and job analysis studies, as variables not included in models may contribute to observed pay differences. Inaccuracies in measuring individual or job characteristics, such as industry classification, can also introduce errors in the analysis. There may be uncertainty in data due to misclassification of private-sector employees as federal employees. This measurement error can impact studies comparing different groups of workers. It is challenging to isolate the compensation effect of working for the federal government due to factors that cannot be measured or observed. The differences between human capital studies and jobs analysis make it difficult to compare across studies. Table 1 summarizes the main features of five studies. Control variables in compensation studies are crucial for isolating the effect of sector on compensation. The differences between human capital studies and jobs analysis make it challenging to compare across studies. Control variables in compensation studies are essential for isolating the sector's effect on compensation. Data limitations hinder precision in controlling for occupation or job responsibilities in human capital studies. The PPA study focuses in greater detail on job content but does not control for individual worker characteristics. Researchers have various options for designing studies to compare compensation across sectors, with different studies controlling for different variables to varying degrees, particularly educational attainment and experience. Workers' educational attainment significantly influences compensation differences, with higher education levels leading to higher earnings in both federal and private sectors. Federal employees generally have higher educational levels than private sector workers. Occupation and firm size must be considered when comparing compensation between the two sectors, as the federal government has unique job roles not found in the private sector. Federal workers are typically employed by large entities, while private sector workers are spread across firms of varying sizes. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analyzes compensation differences between federal and private-sector employees, focusing on how costs would differ if federal workers were paid the same as private sector workers with similar characteristics. CBO uses the \"human capital\" approach to compare wages and benefits, without labeling pay differences as \"premia\" or \"penalties\" due to data limitations. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) uses the human capital approach to analyze compensation differences between federal and private-sector employees. The study controls for various factors like educational attainment, race, sex, age, marital status, immigration status, citizenship status, firm size, occupation, and geographic location to isolate sector-specific effects on compensation. By comparing individuals with similar characteristics, the difference in compensation between federal and private sector workers can be attributed to sector-specific factors. The CBO study analyzes compensation differences between federal and private sector workers using demographic and wage data from the Current Population Survey. Benefits calculated include paid leave, retirement income, health insurance, and legally required benefits. Estimating benefits across sectors is more challenging than wage differences due to different data sets and assumptions. The CBO study uses demographic and wage data from the Current Population Survey to analyze compensation differences between federal and private sector workers. Stronger assumptions are needed to estimate benefits, with one challenge being the difficulty in controlling for the type of work individuals are performing. The data source used in the study, the CPS, does not allow for comparisons between narrowly delineated occupational groups. The aggregation of two-digit occupation codes hides the diversity of occupations within those categories. For example, \"protective service occupations\" include lifeguards, private detectives, and managers of police. Similarly, \"transportation and material moving occupations\" include aircraft pilots, bus drivers, and ship engineers. Compensation differences between federal and private sector workers in the same broad occupational category can vary due to different sectors, tasks, responsibilities, and job complexities. The comparison of compensation between federal and private sector workers within broad occupational categories may be affected by differences in sectors, tasks, responsibilities, and job complexities. The demographic and educational profiles of workers in similar occupations can vary, leading to concealed differences in compensation levels. The CBO categorizes wage and benefit differences based on five levels of educational attainment. The CBO study categorizes wage and benefit differences between federal and private sector workers based on educational attainment levels. The data shows a positive wage differential for federal workers with less than a bachelor's degree and a negative wage differential for those with more than a bachelor's degree. For benefits, the differential varies by educational attainment, with a positive benefit differential for federal workers with a master's degree or less. Total compensation shows the largest differential when combining wages and benefits. Federal workers with some college education or less have a 32% to 36% compensation differential compared to private sector workers. On the other hand, those with a professional degree or doctorate face an 18% lower compensation compared to their private sector counterparts. This discrepancy has raised concerns about the federal government's ability to attract and retain high-skilled individuals. The Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA) of 1990 was passed to address the pay gap between federal workers and private sector employees. The President's Pay Agent annually compares the average pay rates of General Schedule (GS) employees to non-federal workers to determine adjustments needed to close the gap. Pay adjustments are made through annual and locality changes based on the size of the discrepancies. The process for federal pay adjustment under FEPCA was established by Congress with specific processes and formulas. However, FEPCA has never been fully implemented as originally enacted. There were reduced annual pay adjustments in various years, along with reduced locality payments. The adjustments are not based on cost-of-living measures but on an analysis of comparable jobs by the President's Pay Agent using data from the National Compensation Survey. The President's Pay Agent (PPA) compares pay between General Schedule (GS) workers and non-federal workers using data from the National Compensation Survey and the Occupational Employment Statistics. Unlike other studies, the PPA provides a time series estimate and matches federal GS jobs with non-federal jobs in multiple localities. The methodology of the PPA is complex, employing sophisticated weighting methods to account for job characteristics. The President's Pay Agent (PPA) uses sophisticated methods like grade leveling to compare job content and assign federal grade equivalents to non-federal jobs based on the General Schedule's Factor Evaluation System (FES). This system classifies positions by job content and responsibilities rather than individual characteristics, consolidating nine FES factors into four for grade construction. The PPA uses grade leveling to assign federal grade equivalents to non-federal jobs based on the FES factors. These factors are Knowledge, Job Controls and Complexity, Contacts, and Physical Environment. Point values are assigned to each factor, with the most weight given to Knowledge and Job Controls and Complexity. The President's Pay Agent study uses grade leveling to compare federal and non-federal salaries based on job factors like Knowledge and Job Controls and Complexity. It calculates salary differentials by locality and expresses the GS rate of pay compared to the non-federal rate of pay. The study matches job content and responsibilities, but is subject to bias and measurement error. The President's Pay Agent study compares federal and non-federal salaries based on job factors like Knowledge and Job Controls and Complexity. It attempts to measure job content and responsibilities, but there is evidence of measurement error due to differences in education and tenure between federal and private sector workers. The 2011 PPA study reports a pay disparity of -26.3% across all occupations. The 2011 PPA study reports a pay disparity of -26.3% across all occupations, with federal workers earning 26.3% less than non-federal workers. The disparity varied across different localities, ranging from -17.3% in Houston to -36.9% in Washington, DC. The study does not calculate the value of benefits, unlike other studies, and compares pay using the human capital and jobs analysis approaches. The Heritage Foundation released a report comparing compensation of federal workers with non-federal workers, controlling for worker characteristics related to human capital. The study found a wage premium of 19% and a total compensation premium of 31% for federal workers compared to non-federal workers. The Heritage study comparing compensation of federal workers with non-federal workers has methodological issues that limit the strength of its findings. The study used log-linearized models which can lead to inaccurate estimates of average wages due to wage data characteristics like skewness and heteroscedasticity. This analytical technique generates larger wage differential estimates compared to the CBO study, which corrects for different properties of wage distributions. The Heritage study excludes workers earning below $5 per hour and above $60 per hour, affecting the results by compressing pay of higher earners in the private sector. The American Enterprise Institute also compares federal and non-federal worker compensation using a human capital approach. The AEI study, like the Heritage study, compares federal and non-federal worker compensation using regression equations. It reports an overall wage premium of 14% and a total compensation premium of 61% for federal workers. This includes a benefits premium of 63% and a job security premium of 17%. Wage premia are calculated by the education level of the worker, showing a declining premium as educational attainment increases. The AEI study excludes high hourly earnings, uses fewer occupational categories as controls, and has been criticized for its job security premium estimate. The Cato Institute study compared federal worker compensation without control variables. The Cato study compared federal civilian workers' average annual wages and total compensation to private sector workers in 2010, showing higher figures for federal workers. However, the study lacks controls for worker or job characteristics, limiting its usefulness in comparing compensation differentials between the two sectors. Other studies have highlighted differences in human capital distribution and job types between the federal and private sectors. The Cato study compared federal civilian workers' wages and compensation to private sector workers in 2010, showing higher figures for federal workers. However, the study lacks controls for worker or job characteristics, limiting its usefulness in comparing compensation differentials between the two sectors. Researchers face choices in modeling and data limitations impact the robustness of comparisons. The human capital models in the studies reviewed do not allow detailed comparisons of job responsibilities and characteristics. The PPA does not include demographic characteristics of individuals in occupational crosswalks. Of the five studies, one shows a wage penalty for federal workers, one shows no wage premium or penalty, and three show a wage premium compared to private sector workers. Only two studies report earnings differentials by educational attainment. The CBO study found that federal workers with less than a bachelor's degree have a wage premium compared to private sector counterparts, while those with post-graduate education experience a wage penalty. Estimating benefit differentials is more challenging than wage differentials due to varying measurement methods and assumptions. Despite the uncertainty, the largest compensation differentials are seen in benefits. The CBO study shows that federal workers have a benefit premium compared to private sector workers, with the premium decreasing as educational attainment rises. The average benefit differential is 48% for federal workers. The Heritage and AEI studies also find a benefit premium for federal workers, although comparisons are complicated by different components included in the benefit estimates. The review of approaches to evaluating federal workforce compensation highlights the complexity of comparing findings. There is no \"average\" employee in either sector, with variations in worker and job characteristics driving differences in compensation. Studies show variations in compensation differentials based on control variables like education or occupation. Benefit comparisons are more challenging than wage comparisons due to data availability and the need for assumptions by researchers. Benefits data are less available and require assumptions by researchers. Benefit differentials are a significant component of compensation differentials, but are harder to interpret than wages. Wage gaps may not solely be attributed to observable characteristics like sector of employment, as unobservable characteristics can also influence wages. In the literature on the pay gap between men and women, researchers struggle to measure factors like discrimination, career investment, and work preferences. Studies compare federal and private sector compensation, assuming private sector pay is determined by market forces. The assumption that federal pay should match private sector pay is not empirically proven. Private sector pay may need to be adjusted to align with federal compensation in certain fields like finance and law, where private sector pay can exceed public sector pay. Some specialized technical roles value consistency and longer tenures, possibly warranting a premium. Certain federal occupations lack a clear private benchmark, making it unclear how compensation compares. In areas where the federal government is the main employer, like intelligence and regulatory fields, a private benchmark may not be relevant. Adjustments to federal employee compensation may have unintended consequences due to wide compensation differentials across human capital characteristics. Uniform adjustments could narrow differences for some workers but widen them for others, potentially making it harder to attract higher-skilled workers to the federal government."
