    "content": "The federal government has a history of assisting farmers with obtaining loans for farming, justified by factors like asymmetric information, lack of competition in rural lending markets, and targeted lending to disadvantaged groups. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) in the U.S. Department of Agriculture is the main government-controlled lender, providing direct loans to farmers and guarantees on loans from commercial lenders. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) is a lender of last resort and first opportunity for farmers who do not qualify for regular credit. Other government-intervened lenders include the Farm Credit System (FCS) and Farmer Mac, while commercial banks operate without direct government involvement. The Farm Credit System (FCS) and commercial banks are the main providers of farm credit, with FCS leading in real estate loans and commercial banks in non-real estate loans. FSA provides about 2.6% of debt through direct loans and guarantees 4%-5% through loans made by commercial banks and FCS. The total farm debt is $374 billion, with 60% in real estate debt and 40% in non-real estate debt. Market shares have shifted among lenders in recent years. Market shares among farm lenders have changed over time, with commercial banks now holding a significant amount of farm real estate debt. The share of loans from \"individuals and others\" has decreased, while FSA's share of farm debt has declined since the 1980s. Despite pressure on other real estate sectors, farm sector assets have remained strong, with the value of farm assets steadily increasing. In 2018, USDA forecasts a 1.6% increase in farm assets. The Federal Reserve reports a 1.6% increase in farm assets, with real estate comprising 83% of total assets. Farm debt reached a historic high of $385 billion in 2017, but remains below peak levels from the 1980s. The debt-to-asset ratio has steadily declined since the 1980s financial crisis, reaching a historic low of 11.3%. The debt-to-asset ratio for farms rose slightly to 12.9% in 2009-2010 before dropping to a low in 2012. However, it increased to 12.7% in 2017 and is expected to remain steady in 2018. Net farm income has been volatile since 2000, with highs in 2004 and 2008 followed by significant declines. The forecasted net farm income for 2018 is 29% below the 10-year average, with government payments not always offsetting income variability. Fixed direct payments were the main form of government support for farm income in recent years, but did not effectively help farmers manage risks. Net farm income has shifted towards market sources compared to the 1980s. The farm-debt-to-net-farm-income ratio has risen to over 6, exceeding the typical range of 2-4, due to the decline in net farm income. The farm-debt-to-net-farm-income ratio has risen to over 6, exceeding the typical range of 2-4 over the past 50 years. This has led to an observed rise in repayment risk, with credit standards being tightened after the global financial crisis in 2008-2009. Farm income fluctuated, with some farmers facing challenges in repaying loans, particularly in sectors such as dairy, hogs, and poultry. Since 2014, weakness in farm income has increased pressure on farmers' repayment capacity, especially in sectors like dairy, hogs, and poultry. Delinquency rates for agricultural loans began to rise in mid-2008, peaking in June 2010 at 3.3%. Residential mortgages and all loans saw a recent peak in delinquency rates in mid-2010. Delinquency rates on farm production loans at commercial banks have risen slightly since 2015 but appear to have stabilized in 2017. Nonperforming loans, including nonaccrual loans and accruing loans 90 days or more past due, represent a smaller subset of loans and are more in jeopardy than delinquent loans. The FCS nonperforming loan rate has maintained levels indicating recovery from the farm financial crisis of the 1980s, with a peak of 2.8% in 2009 decreasing to 0.73% in 2015. While FCS nonperforming loans have risen slightly in 2016 and 2017, they remain below 0.85% in 2018. Commercial banks also saw an increase in nonperforming farm loans. Nonperforming farm loans at commercial banks have risen due to declining farm income, with rates for farm real estate loans and production loans reaching about 1.5% and 1.3% respectively by the end of 2017. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) serves as a lender of last resort, providing direct loans to family-sized farms unable to obtain credit elsewhere and guaranteeing timely payment on qualified loans from commercial banks. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) guarantees timely payment on qualified loans made by commercial banks and the FCS. In FY2017, $90 million in budget authority supported $8 billion of new direct loans and guarantees. Direct loans are limited to $300,000 per borrower, guaranteed loans to $1,399,000. Funds are reserved for beginning farmers, socially disadvantaged farmers, and emergency loans are available for disasters. The Farm Credit System (FCS) provides credit to rural areas and is not a government agency but a network of borrower-owned lending institutions. It raises funds through bond sales on Wall Street and is overseen by the House and Senate Agriculture Committees. The FCS is a for-profit lender with a statutory mandate to serve agriculture. The Farm Credit System (FCS) is governed by the Farm Credit Act of 1971 and provides benefits such as tax exemptions. Eligibility is limited to farmers, certain farm-related agribusinesses, rural homeowners, and cooperatives. The Farm Credit Administration (FCA) is the federal regulator. Farmer Mac, a separate entity, acts as a secondary market for agricultural loans. It purchases mortgages from lenders and guarantees mortgage-backed securities. The FCS is unique among government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) as it directly competes with commercial banks by lending directly to farmers. This competition often leads to an adversarial relationship between the FCS and commercial banks. The FCS and commercial banks have an adversarial relationship due to tax advantages benefiting the FCS. Commercial banks call for increased oversight, while the FCS cites its mandate to serve agricultural borrowers. The FSA loan programs are supported by both parties, with FSA not seen as a competitor. Credit issues are not expected to be a major part of the 2018 farm bill. The 2014 farm bill (P.L. 113-79) made small policy changes to USDA's farm loan programs, allowing for alternative legal entities and increasing maximum loan sizes. The FSA farm loan program has a maximum loan size of $300,000 for direct loans, last increased in the 2008 farm bill from $200,000. Potential issues in the agricultural credit statutes include targeting resources to specific farmer groups and raising maximum loan sizes per borrower. The maximum size for FSA guaranteed loans is currently $1,399,000, with potential limitations for some farmers due to increasing farm sizes and capital needs. Proposed bills in the 115th Congress aim to raise the maximum loan sizes, with S. 1736 suggesting an increase to $600,000 for direct loans and $2.5 million for guaranteed loans, while S. 1921 proposes a raise to $600,000 for direct loans and $3 million for guaranteed loans, indexed for inflation. The FSA farm loan program is set to be updated with increased authorization levels and mandatory funding. Term limits were added in 1992 and 1996 to restrict eligibility for government farm loans, but were suspended until 2010. The 2014 farm bill eliminated term limits on guaranteed operating loans."
