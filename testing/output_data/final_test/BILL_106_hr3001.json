    "content": "The Nutraceutical Research and Education Act is cited as the short title of this Act. Any amendments or repeals in this Act refer to sections of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Act includes findings and a statement of purpose. The Congress finds that consumers spend billions on dietary supplements and medical foods, but their health benefits are often unproven. Companies want to make specific health claims based on clinical testing, but the government requires scientific evidence of safety and effectiveness. The lack of economic incentive for research on dietary supplements and similar products hinders the development of new products with proven health benefits, leading to a focus on promotional activities over public health interests. It is in the national interest to encourage clinical research into the health benefits of dietary supplements, medical foods, and other foods, and establish a regulatory system for these products. The purpose of this Act is to promote research on the health benefits of dietary supplements, medical foods, and other foods, and establish a less burdensome regulatory system for reviewing health claims related to disease prevention and management. The Act aims to simplify the process for reviewing health claims of nutraceutical products, provide exclusive marketing protection for products with demonstrated health benefits, confirm benefits through clinical trials, and disseminate this information to the public and healthcare professionals. The Act aims to simplify the process for reviewing health claims of nutraceutical products, provide exclusive marketing protection for products with demonstrated health benefits, confirm benefits through clinical trials, and disseminate this information to the public and healthcare professionals. The public and the health care profession may integrate this knowledge into practice. The Act defines 'nutraceutical' as a dietary supplement, food, or medical food that provides health benefits and is safe for human consumption. A 'health benefit' of a nutraceutical refers to preventing or reducing the risk of a disease, managing a disease, or improving health. The Act allows for nutraceutical health claims to be regulated by the Secretary through a petition process that includes submitting a clinical trial report on the product. The Act allows for nutraceutical health claims to be regulated by the Secretary through a petition process that includes submitting a clinical trial report on the product. Clinical trial results must demonstrate the health benefits and safety of the product, as well as its relationship to a disease or health condition. The trial should be of sufficient size with endpoints to support the claim, and additional epidemiological or preclinical studies may be included. The amount of evidence required will be determined on a case by case basis. The Secretary will determine the evidence needed for a nutraceutical health claim on a case-by-case basis, including safety for human consumption, product description, processing methods, and labeling samples. When a petition is filed for a nutraceutical claim, the Secretary will publish it in the Federal Register within 7 days, providing details such as the petitioner's name, product description, and proposed health claim. No other similar petitions can be filed until final action is taken on the first petition. The Secretary will refer any petition for a nutraceutical claim to the Advisory Council on Nutraceuticals and take final action within 6 months of filing if deemed worthy by the Council. SEC. 5. MARKET PROTECTION FOR NUTRACEUTICAL. In response to a petition for a nutraceutical claim, the Secretary may not issue another regulation for the same claim for 10 years, unless a petition for a more effective or safer nutraceutical is submitted. The Secretary may not issue a regulation for the same nutraceutical claim within 10 years of a petition, unless a petition for a more effective or safer nutraceutical is submitted. If a nutraceutical has not had a petition approved under section 403(r)(4)(D), it is considered misbranded. SEC. 6. GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICES. Amends Section 402(g) to include nutraceuticals in dietary supplements. SEC. 7. ADVISORY COUNCIL ON NUTRACEUTICALS. Establishment of the \"Advisory Council on Nutraceuticals\" within the FDA to evaluate nutraceutical health claim petitions and their labeling. Membership includes ex officio and appointed members. The Advisory Council on Nutraceuticals includes ex officio members such as the Secretary and the Director of NIH, along with appointed members distinguished in health, nutrition, or biomedical research. Members who are government officers or employees serve without additional compensation. The Advisory Council members receive compensation for their engagement in council functions, with travel expenses covered. Appointed members serve a 4-year term, filling vacancies for the remainder of the term. The Advisory Council members serve 4-year terms, with staggered expiration dates to prevent all terms ending in the same year. A member can serve for 180 days after their term ends and cannot be reappointed before 2 years. The Secretary appoints members to fill vacancies within 90 days. The chair is selected by the Secretary from appointed members for a 2-year term. Meetings are called by the chair or the Director of the National Institutes of Health. The Advisory Council, appointed by the Secretary, evaluates nutraceutical petitions promptly. Meetings and proceedings are not subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Secretary maintains an index listing approved nutraceutical petitions and pending petitions. Additionally, there is a small business antitrust exemption. Small businesses can combine resources to meet nutraceutical health benefit requirements under an antitrust exemption. Definitions include antitrust laws, nutraceutical, and small business. The term \"small business\" is defined in section 736(d)(3)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Act and its amendments will become effective 90 days after enactment."
