    "content": "Congressman Christopher H. Smith introduced H.R. 2601 on May 24, 2005, which was forwarded to the full committee after markup sessions. The House International Relations Committee completed its markup on June 9, 2005. Senator Lugar introduced a Senate version of the legislation on March 10, but Senate debate was delayed due to various factors. Congress is required to authorize spending for the State Department and foreign policy activities every two years, acting as a ceiling for appropriations. In the past decade, there has been inconsistency in passing stand-alone foreign relations authorization bills, with Congress often waiving the requirement since 1995. Since 1995, Congress has often waived the requirement for foreign relations authorization laws. The most recent authorization Act was for FY2003. The legislation typically covers State Department spending for various activities. The foreign relations authorization legislation covers a wide range of foreign policy issues, including nonproliferation, human rights, and international health and environment. The bills introduced in the 109th Congress differ significantly, with S. 600 including provisions for foreign assistance programs, radiological terrorism security, and safe water, while H.R. 2601 focuses on democracy promotion and U.N. reform. H.R. 2601 includes measures on democracy promotion, U.N. reform, export controls, security assistance, and nonproliferation. Congress Members are determined to produce foreign policy authorization legislation this year. The bill covers State Department authorizations, activities, organization, personnel, international organizations, and international broadcasting. Authorization is required before spending funds on foreign policy agencies and programs. Authorization legislation for foreign policy agencies and programs is required prior to expenditure of appropriations. H.R. 2601 and S. 600 contain measures such as authorizing an international litigation fund, medical reimbursement issues, accountability review boards, and the designation of a federal building in Kingston, Jamaica as the Colin L. Powell Residential Plaza. The Colin L. Powell Residential Plaza in Kingston, Jamaica is mentioned in both H.R. 2601 and S. 600. Sec. 214 of S. 600 authorizes the enhancement of the U.S. diplomacy center, while Sec. 215 establishes scholarship programs in eligible countries for students in the Islamic world. H.R. 2601 allocates $5 million for Cuban human rights dissidents to participate in exchange programs. The Senate does not have a comparable provision. The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) was established by the U.S. International Broadcasting Act of 1994 to consolidate international broadcasting activities of the U.S. government. It consists of a 9-member board appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, overseeing nonmilitary international broadcasting including Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and others. The Middle East Broadcasting Networks (MBN) consist of two TV channels -- Alhurra and Alhurra Iraq -- and Radio Sawa, established by the Broadcasting Board of Governors to promote U.S. views in the Middle East. Legislation would authorize grants for MBN broadcasting activities, subject to limitations and restrictions. U.S.-government sponsored radio and television broadcasts to Cuba, Radio and TV Marti, have been ongoing since 1985 and 1990 respectively. Congress has allocated approximately $493 million for broadcasting to Cuba from FY1984 through FY2005. Cuban jamming of the broadcasts, especially TV Marti, has been a persistent issue. Critics argue that TV Marti has limited audience reach due to the jamming. In 2004, the Bush Administration called for the deployment of the EC-130E/J Commando Solo airborne platform for airborne radio and television broadcasts to overcome Cuban jamming. The Bush Administration called for the deployment of the EC-130E/J Commando Solo airborne platform for radio and television broadcasts to Cuba to overcome Cuban jamming. The Broadcasting Board of Governors is requesting $37.7 million for a dedicated aircraft to transmit Radio and TV Marti programming into Cuba, aiming to counter Cuban government jamming. Both H.R. 2601 and S. 600 include provisions for this initiative. Both H.R. 2601 and S. 600 authorize additional frequencies for Radio Marti to overcome Cuban jamming. H.R. 2601 allocates $37.7 million for Cuba broadcasting in FY2006 and $29.9 million in FY2007, including funds for an aircraft. S. 600 authorizes funding for Cuba broadcasting without a specific earmark. Senate rejected an amendment prohibiting funds for TV broadcasting to Cuba. The House-passed version of H.R. 2862 includes $27.9 million for Cuba broadcasting, $10 million below the Administration's request. The Committee does not provide funding for an aircraft to transmit Radio and TV Marti programming but assumes periodic Commando Solo flights for transmissions. The Senate version of the FY2006 Foreign Operations appropriations bill, H.R. 3057, includes $37.7 million for Cuba broadcasting, with funds for an aircraft. During July 19, 2005 Senate floor consideration, S.Amdt. 1294 (Dorgan) to eliminate funding for television broadcasting to Cuba was defeated (33-66). H.R. 2601 and S. 600 contain provisions for reports on combating international terrorism in Western Africa, with H.R. 2601 focusing on expanding the Pan Sahel Initiative into the Trans-Sahara Counter Terrorism Initiative (TSCTI). The report would be submitted in classified form within 120 days after the passage of H.R. 2601, listing TSCTI participant countries and types of programs. The passage of H.R. 2601 requires a list of TSCTI participant countries, types of security assistance needed for rapid reaction security forces, training for respect of human rights, and a strategy for combating terrorism in West Africa. The measure focuses on the broader region of West Africa, including sub-Saharan Sahel and coastal countries, with a focus on promoting development and countering radical Islamist elements gaining a foothold in the region. A report to Congress is required six months after the passage of S. 600, detailing a strategy for combating terrorism in West Africa. The report includes an assessment of terrorist activities, an interagency plan to address the threat, necessary resources, expected cooperation from countries in the region, and coordination with other counter-terrorism efforts. Groups with alleged connections to Al Qaeda, Hizballah, and Hamas have been active in the Sahel region of West Africa. The United States has provided security assistance in the Sahel region of West Africa through programs like the Pan Sahel Initiative, aimed at creating military rapid reaction forces to counter insurgencies and terrorist activities. The Pan Sahel Initiative (PSI) was funded with $6.85 million in FY2002 and FY2003 Peacekeeping Operations funds. There was no PSI funding in FY2004, but potential sustainment activities may use $3.968 million in FY2005 Africa Coastal/Border Security Program funds. The Bush Administration is considering expanding PSI into the Trans-Sahara Counter Terrorism Initiative (TSCTI), which would involve CT training in Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Nigeria, and Senegal, along with development assistance and increased funding. The Trans-Sahara Counter Terrorism Initiative (TSCTI) is estimated to cost about $125 million per year for a five to six year program. State Department officials view TSCTI as a conceptual plan agreed upon by key U.S. agencies. The Administration seeks Congressional approval to use funds for TSCTI start-up activities, with full funding potentially requested in FY2007. Despite not being fully-fledged, U.S. European Command (EUCOM) already uses TSCTI to describe activities under PSI, including training exercises like Exercise Flintlock in June 2005. In June 2005, U.S. special operations forces provided tactical military training to Saharan armed forces to enhance regional security. The use of the term TSCTI by EUCOM before full authorization created tensions with the Defense Department. Humanitarian emergencies worldwide lead to population movements, with various groups like refugees and vulnerable populations requiring protection and assistance under international humanitarian law. The curr_chunk discusses the protection and assistance of vulnerable populations during humanitarian emergencies, focusing on women, children, and refugee populations. S. 600 addresses strategies for their protection, while H.R. 2601 authorizes a pilot program to study and improve living conditions for long-term refugee populations. H.R. 2601 authorizes $3 million in FY2006 and FY2007 for emergency aid to internally displaced people of Burma. The Bush Administration's initiatives to enhance U.S. civilian capabilities for stabilization and reconstruction activities have faced enthusiasm and skepticism in Congress, with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee providing support for the establishment of the State Department Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction. The Senate Armed Services Committee and several foreign policy think tanks have expressed support for the establishment of the State Department Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS). Legislation has been proposed in both the Senate and the House to create a similar office for civilian capabilities. The House, however, has provided little funding for these initiatives in 2006. In 2003 and 2004, legislation was proposed in the House to establish civilian capabilities to relieve stress on the military and improve post-conflict state-building operations. The Administration created S/CRS in 2004 with the goal of developing effective policies, processes, and personnel for building stable and democratic states in post-conflict situations. The Administration established the Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS) in 2004 to develop policies and personnel for post-conflict state-building. The FY2005 emergency supplemental appropriations requested $17.2 million for S/CRS operations, software, and training. The Senate approved $7.7 million, closer to the House-approved $3.0 million. The President's FY2006 budget requested $24.1 million for 54 new S/CRS positions and a 100-person \"Ready Response\" cadre within the State Department. The President requested the establishment of a $100 million emergency Conflict Response fund and a 100-person \"Ready Response\" cadre within the Department of State. Critics question the necessity of S/CRS and the additional cost, especially the creation of the ready response cadre. Analysts criticize the Administration's request for post-conflict reconstruction assistance. There are few similarities among the cases the United States has been involved with so far regarding post-conflict reconstruction assistance. S. 600 would authorize full funding for S/CRS and a larger ready response corps than requested by the Administration. H.R. 2601 contains no authorization for FY2006 funding for S/CRS. H.R. 2601 does not authorize FY2006 funding for S/CRS but includes an amendment for an Active Response Corps for stabilization and reconstruction activities. Limited funding was provided for S/CRS and the Conflict Response fund in the Science State, Justice, Commerce appropriations bill. The House foreign operations appropriations bill includes $7.7 million for S/CRS operations. The House bill does not provide new funding for the Conflict Response fund but authorizes the Secretary of State to transfer $100 million for reconstruction and stabilization assistance. The Senate version of the bill funds S/CRS at $24 million and provides $74 million for the Conflict Response Fund. The Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) is the primary U.S. program supporting Plan Colombia to combat drug trafficking and guerrilla activity. U.S. support for Plan Colombia began in 2000 with $1.3 billion in assistance for Colombia and neighboring countries. The Administration has requested $734.5 million for FY2006, including $40 million for a Critical Flight Safety Program. The U.S. has requested $40 million for a new Critical Flight Safety Program in Colombia to upgrade aging aircraft. Congress is concerned about various issues related to Colombia's struggle against drug trafficking and armed groups, including human rights abuses, counterterrorism assistance, aerial fumigation effects, alternative development progress, risk to U.S. personnel, and American hostages held by FARC. Critics of U.S. policy argue that the war on drugs is futile as long as demand persists, despite successful eradication efforts. The Bush Administration emphasizes the threat of drug trafficking and insurgent guerrilla groups fueled by the drug trade in Colombia. Supporters believe U.S. assistance is crucial for the democratic government facing armed groups. The House International Relations Committee reported H.R. 2601 with a provision making U.S. assistance to Colombia contingent on certification from the Secretary of State for demobilization of combatants and cooperation on extradition. A Representative Burton amendment was approved to transfer marine patrol aircraft to the Colombian Navy for drug interdiction. S. 600 authorizes funding for ACI with conditions consistent with current law. The bill authorizes a unified campaign against narcotics trafficking and terrorist activities in Colombia, with conditions on military and civilian personnel, prohibiting them from participating in combat operations. Reporting requirements on human rights conditions and U.S. operations are maintained. Congress last enacted a broad foreign assistance authorization act in 1985, with most foreign assistance legislation now part of annual Foreign Operations appropriation measures. Division B of S. 600 aims to reinforce the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's role. Division B of S. 600 aims to strengthen the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's role in foreign assistance policymaking. It includes provisions similar to those in the 108th Congress and is the first step in updating legislative provisions for current policy. Senator Lugar plans to revamp the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 in the future. Division B is divided into eight titles, three of which provide general authorizations for foreign aid programs. Title XXI of Division B of S. 600 authorizes $18.4 billion for 25 foreign assistance programs, matching annual Foreign Operations appropriations. The amounts are in line with the Administration's FY2006 request, providing $2 billion more than FY2005. Title XII updates existing foreign aid authorities, while Title XXV addresses new reporting requirements. The House International Relations Committee added new submissions on various issues such as Haiti, the Global Peace Operations Initiative, international HIV/AIDS programs, and tsunami relief in Aceh, Indonesia. Titles XXIII to XXVIII in Division represent specific initiatives, including the Radiological Terrorism Security Act, Global Pathogen Surveillance Act, water for health and development program, Protection of Vulnerable Populations During Humanitarian Emergencies Act of 2005, and Conventional Arms Disarmament Act of 2005. H.R. 2601 includes several foreign aid provisions. Title IX of H.R. 2601 addresses specific foreign aid issues, including aid for democracy in various countries, conditions on aid to Egypt, assistance to Afghanistan and Colombia, famine relief in Ethiopia, and promoting democracy in Vietnam. It also includes provisions for disaster mitigation and establishing centers for obstetric fistula treatment. One provision in H.R. 2601 focuses on establishing centers for treating obstetric fistula, a condition affecting millions of women in Africa due to prolonged labor. Women with this condition face stigma and limited access to healthcare services, especially in developing countries. H.R. 2601 allocated $5 million for 12 centers to treat obstetric fistula in developing nations, providing surgical repair, post-surgery support, educational activities, and expanded access to contraceptive services. An amendment proposed by Representative Smith removed the requirement for contraceptive services and added activities promoting abstinence and postponement of marriage and child-bearing. The Smith amendment increased funding to $7.5 million annually for obstetric fistula centers. It made prevention activities discretionary, allowing faith-based hospitals to provide family planning services. Opponents argued that the amendment weakened the prevention aspect by making activities optional. The House adopted the Smith amendment on a 223-205 vote, increasing funding for obstetric fistula centers to $7.5 million annually. Sec. 806 of S. 600 and Sec. 1114 of H.R. 2601 advocate for full membership for the Israeli Magen David Adom Society in the International Red Cross Movement, despite their use of a different emblem. The Swiss government seeks international support to amend the Geneva Conventions and adopt a new symbol, excluding Magen David Adom. Members of Congress are offended by this exclusion. Legislation prohibits U.S. consulate operation in Jerusalem not under the U.S. Ambassador's supervision and listing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in official documents. In 1967, Israel annexed East Jerusalem and declared it as its undivided capital. U.S. legislation reflects the view that Jerusalem should be considered part of Israel, with calls to move the U.S. embassy there. However, successive administrations have maintained that Jerusalem's status should be determined through negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Congress debates its power regarding this issue. Congress debates its power to require U.S. passports to indicate Jerusalem, Israel, as the place of birth of a citizen, in contrast to the State Department's stance. Previous legislation mandated this designation, but it has not been implemented due to concerns about prejudging negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. The issue has also been the subject of litigation, with the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv refusing to issue passports with Jerusalem, Israel, as the place of birth. The U.S. State Department refused to issue passports with Jerusalem, Israel as the place of birth for children born in Israel to U.S. citizens. Two sets of parents sued the State Department, but the lawsuits were dismissed by the U.S. District Court in Washington in September 2004. The judge ruled that the status of Jerusalem is a sensitive foreign policy issue and not a simple administrative matter. The parents have filed an appeal. The House bill authorizes $5 million for equipment and training for foreign law enforcement, judges, and prosecutors, as well as assistance with copyright and intellectual property treaties. Section 204 of S. 600 allows the Secretary of State to provide support for training and technical assistance projects on intellectual property rights protection. The House incorporated the text of the Henry J. Hyde United Nations Reform Act into H.R. 2601, which includes requirements for State Department certifications and reports related to U.N. reform. In 2007, 32 out of 40 specific changes for UN reform must be in place, including 15 mandatory reforms. The Bush Administration has concerns about legislation that withholds funds and limits the President's foreign affairs authority. Congress and the Administration prioritize promoting freedom and democracy globally through legislative measures like H.R. 2601, which emphasizes democracy as a key component of US foreign policy. Title VI of the proposed legislation aims to enhance democracy promotion efforts by creating an office within the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor to work with democratic movements and transitions. It also mandates the establishment of regional democracy hubs at U.S. missions abroad and the formation of a nine-member Democracy Promotion and Human Rights Advisory Board. Additionally, an annual report on democracy will be required to provide definitions and basis for State Department activities in democracy promotion worldwide. The Advance Democracy Act of 2005 aims to strengthen the Community of Democracies by supporting the establishment of an International Center for Democratic Transition. It authorizes the appropriation of $1 million each for FY2006, FY2007, and FY2008. Title XIII of H.R. 2601 highlights the importance of foreign students to the U.S. economy and institutions of higher learning, noting a decline since September 11, 2001. It requires the Secretary of State to act within one year of enactment. The Advance Democracy Act of 2005 aims to strengthen the Community of Democracies by supporting the establishment of an International Center for Democratic Transition. Title XIII of H.R. 2601 requires the Secretary of State to encourage foreign students to study in the United States within one year of enactment. It also involves amending existing laws on visa processing for students and exchange visitors. Lawmakers are considering renegotiating foreign assistance agreements with Egypt to include specific benchmarks for aid qualification. Egypt indirectly supports Palestinian terrorism, suppresses its own population, including minority Christians, and spreads unsubstantiated conspiracies about Israel and the Jewish people. The U.S. government argues that reducing military aid to Egypt could harm peace between Israel and Egypt. Supporters of U.S. assistance believe it stabilizes the region and extends U.S. influence in the Arab world. An unsuccessful amendment in 2004 sought to decrease military aid to Egypt by $570 million. The U.S. government has attempted to reduce military aid to Egypt multiple times, with unsuccessful amendments in 2004 and 2005. Proposed reductions ranged from $570 million to $750 million, with funds potentially redirected to child survival and health programs. Additionally, there are earmarks in the House FY2006 foreign operations bill for good governance and education programs in Egypt. The Senate version provides funding for democracy and governance programs in Egypt as well. Another bill aims to decrease military assistance to Egypt by $240 million over three fiscal years, reallocating the funds towards economic changes, poverty alleviation, and education in Egypt. H.R. 2601 proposes requirements for Egypt to receive U.S. economic assistance focused on economic reform, education, and poverty reduction. It also transfers interest earned from Egypt's FMF to MEPI for reform-oriented programming. Title VII of H.R. 2601 addresses export control policies. S. 600 has few comparable provisions. Section 711 of H.R. 2601 proposes creating the position of Deputy Under Secretary of State for Strategic Export Control and establishing an inter-agency Strategic Export Control Board. Section 712 would form this board with representatives from relevant departments to enforce U.S. export controls. Defense trade registration fees could be used to cover the board's costs. The Strategic Export Control Board, chaired by the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, would enforce U.S. export controls. Sections 721 and 722 require publication of export jurisdiction determinations and establish Congressional notification for comprehensive export licenses. Section 723 directs the State Department to not give preferential treatment in processing export licenses for items needed by the U.S. Armed Forces. Section 724 mandates the State Department to report on officers handling munitions export licensing for U.S. Armed Forces. Section 725 requires reports on U.S. Munitions List items transferred abroad to be searchable by the public. Section 726 designates a coordinator for small defense firms in export license procedures. Section 727 is not summarized. Section 727 would create an exemption from export licensing for certain technical data related to commercial satellites, with conditions set by the Secretary of Defense. Section 728 would amend reporting requirements for defense articles being exported without a license. Section 731 would require an annual report to Congress on sensitive items needing licensing scrutiny before transfer to a foreign person in the U.S. Section 732 would mandate a report on certain U.S. Munitions List items for licensing before transfer. Section 732 of the report would require the Secretary of State to certify that there is no national security risk from the current exemption allowing foreign persons to bring unclassified weapons into the U.S. from Canada. It would also ensure that the State Department is providing guidance to Homeland Security and Border Protection to detect and enforce unlawful use of Canadian license exemptions. Section 735 of H.R. 2601 would amend the Arms Export Control Act to require a report to Congress on unauthorized transfers of U.S. defense articles to state sponsors of terrorism. Other sections in the bill cover reporting requirements, transfers of naval vessels, military stocks, and reimbursement for international military education and training. Additionally, a new Title IX was added during House consideration by Chairman Henry Hyde. Chairman Henry Hyde added a new Title IX (Sections 901-910) to tighten oversight over exports of defense articles, services, and technology to prevent re-export to China. The title includes reporting requirements on arms exporting activities in the European Union and U.S. defense exports licensing to safeguard national security interests. Section 734 mandates annual certification on U.S. missile technology controls by the Secretary of State. The certification requirement for U.S. missile technology controls is in response to GAO findings of jurisdiction ambiguity between State and Commerce Departments. Section 741 imposes a three-year probation on sanctioned entities for dual-use licenses. The three-year probation for sanctioned entities can be waived if illegal activities cease and transparency measures are implemented. Section 742 extends U.S. missile sanctions to four years to increase costs for proliferants. Section 743 expands missile sanctions to all foreign persons and government entities to deter government-sponsored trade in missiles and related technologies. Some governments conduct trade and transfers of missiles to avoid U.S. sanctions, leading to increased monitoring of missile-related trade. Nonproliferation experts were alarmed in 2004 by A.Q. Khan's sale of nuclear technology to Iran, Libya, and North Korea, prompting nonproliferation proposals from President Bush. The response to nonproliferation concerns includes proposals such as bans on uranium enrichment sales, strengthening measures like the Proliferation Security Initiative, and the Nuclear Black Market Elimination Act in H.R. 2601. This act aims to enhance U.S. efforts to combat nuclear black market transfers through sanctions, penalties for entities involved in proliferation, cooperation incentives, and nonproliferation conditions for U.S. assistance. Sanctions may be imposed on individuals transferring enrichment and reprocessing technology to non-nuclear weapon states without full operational capability or an Additional Protocol. The President can suspend sanctions after 15 days with congressional notification. Assistance to countries cooperating in proliferation interdiction is authorized, with a prohibition on transferring excess aircraft or ships to states not supporting U.S. interdiction efforts. Nonproliferation cooperation is a precondition for U.S. assistance, with arms sales suspended. The President can impose sanctions on individuals transferring nuclear technology to non-nuclear weapon states without full operational capability. Nonproliferation cooperation is required for U.S. assistance, with arms sales suspended to countries hosting nuclear proliferation networks. Congress aims to address frustrations over the lack of leverage on Pakistan's A.Q. Khan network. Additionally, there are resolutions related to nonproliferation, including calls for Russia to cease assistance to Iran's Bushehr nuclear facility. Section 1423 of the bill calls for direct access to A.Q. Khan to investigate his nuclear black market network. Section 1431 urges strengthening the Proliferation Security Initiative. The United States should seek authority to seize illicit shipments of WMD-related items through international instruments like UN Security Council resolutions. In recent years, there has been concern about the World Bank providing loans to Iran while it pursues nuclear weapons. H.R. 2601 includes language directing the Secretary of State to address this issue. The Secretary of State is directed to work with the Treasury to gain support from World Bank Group members to oppose further assistance to Iran until it abandons its nuclear weapons program. The G8 and European countries hold a majority on the World Bank executive board, making it possible to block future assistance to Iran. However, existing projects may continue due to contractual obligations. The consensus among major European countries on influencing Iran's policy through dialog has broken down. Several loans have been approved, and new legislation aims to strengthen efforts to reestablish the consensus. The Secretary of State may lead the effort, but the Treasury typically handles U.S. participation in international financial institutions. The President is required to undertake an international effort to pressure Iran to stop developing weapons. The House passed an amendment authorizing the Broadcasting Board of Governors to broadcast to Venezuela. S. 600 includes measures for State Department appropriations, foreign assistance programs, radiological terrorism security, global pathogen surveillance, safe water, protection of vulnerable populations, and conventional arms disarmament. The U.S. limited assessed payments to U.N. peacekeeping accounts to 25% in 1995 due to increasing costs and other governments not accepting higher assessment levels. This led to a growing arrearage in U.S. contributions. In 2001, the U.S. responded to an agreement by the U.N. General Assembly regarding regular budget assessments. In response to a 2000 U.N. General Assembly agreement, the U.S. reduced its regular budget assessment from 25% to 22%. The U.S. peacekeeping assessment level also decreased towards 25%. In 2002, Congress raised the cap for peacekeeping payments to a range of 28.15% for CY2001 through 27.4% for CY2004. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act set the peacekeeping assessment cap for CY2005 at 27.1%. The Senate accepted an amendment to S. 600 to lower the peacekeeping assessment cap from 27.1% to 25% for CY2005. Senator Biden's amendment for a 27.1% cap for CY 2005, 2006, and 2007 was not adopted. The U.S. may accumulate arrearages in its U.N. peacekeeping contributions if the Senate's action becomes law. H.R. 2601 does not address the peacekeeping cap. The Brahimi Report, issued in August 2000, assessed UN peacekeeping shortcomings and provided recommendations for reform. Many recommendations were implemented after review by the UN General Assembly and Security Council. Section 403 of S. 600 requires the Secretary of State to report on progress in implementing the recommendations within 120 days of enactment. The State Department report, as required by Section 403 of S. 600, will assess the progress of the United Nations in implementing recommendations from the Brahimi Report on UN peacekeeping operations. It will also describe efforts to strengthen the UN's capability to deploy civilian police forces and rule of law teams in emergency situations. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee emphasizes the importance of UN peacekeeping operations and supports the implementation of these recommendations. The Senate Committee has recommended a report assessing the progress of implementing recommendations from the Brahimi Report on UN peacekeeping operations. This report is seen as crucial for oversight of U.S. efforts and support for implementing recommendations. The Senate Committee recommended a report on UN peacekeeping operations progress. The legislation did not address U.S. international family planning assistance and abortion, but a Senate floor amendment aims to reverse the \"Mexico City\" policy. The Reagan Administration restricted U.S. population aid by terminating USAID support for organizations involved in voluntary abortion activities. The \"Mexico City\" policy, initially presented at the 2nd U.N. International Conference on Population in 1984, was lifted by President Clinton in 1993 but reinstated by President Bush in 2001. Critics argue that the policy creates uncertainty for family planning organizations, jeopardizing their USAID funding eligibility. They also believe it undermines relations with foreign NGOs and multilateral groups, restricting their ability to advocate for changes to abortion laws in developing countries. Critics argue that the \"Mexico City\" policy restricts foreign NGOs from advocating for changes to abortion laws in developing countries, which they believe is unconstitutional. Supporters claim the policy prevents the misuse of USAID funds for abortion-related activities by closing the fungibility loophole. Senator Boxer's amendment to overturn the policy was approved by the Senate. Foreign NGOs may not be disqualified from U.S. funding based solely on the health services they provide with non-U.S. government funds, as long as the services comply with local laws and would not violate U.S. laws. Non-U.S. government funds used for advocacy by foreign NGOs will be subject to similar conditions as U.S. NGOs. This exemption could potentially lift current restrictions on overseas NGOs. In the past decade, there has been strong public concern about poor countries burdened by external debt. The G7 countries have adopted plans for debt cancellation, requiring countries to implement economic reforms. In 2005, the G8 announced a program for 100% debt cancellation for qualifying countries. S. 600 includes language authorizing $99.75 million for debt reduction under the HIPC program and the Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998. The curr_chunk discusses the appropriation of funds for debt cancellation under the HIPC program and the Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998. The Administration requested $105 million for U.S. bilateral debt cancellation for the Democratic Republic of the Congo in fiscal 2005. S. 600 includes language authorizing the President to reduce debts owed by the poorest countries, in line with the G8's debt reduction plan. H.R. 2601 does not have similar language on debt cancellation. The curr_chunk discusses debt relief as part of a comprehensive strategy to eliminate extreme poverty in developing countries. Supporters believe greater debt cancellation will help fight poverty and enhance development prospects. Concerns exist that future aid levels from the World Bank may be reduced proportionally to planned debt cancellation, resulting in few net benefits for aid recipients. The State Department is responsible for protecting government and contract employees in embassies worldwide from terrorist threats, including potential Chemical, Biological, Radiological, or Nuclear (CBRN) attacks. S. 600 includes provisions to address preparing for and responding to such threats under the Radiological Terrorism Security Act of 2005. Section 2303 of S. 600 requires the Secretary of State to provide reports to Congress detailing preparations of U.S. diplomatic facilities for detecting and mitigating radiological attacks. Reports must prioritize security and consequence management efforts at facilities where improvements are most needed, to be submitted annually starting in FY2007. The Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in U.S. embassies includes radiological response efforts, providing CBRN equipment and training to personnel. Section 2304 of the act requires training for foreign first responders to detect and handle radioactive material. This complements the Antiterrorism Assistance Program (ATA) that trains first responders in host nations. Section 2305 proposes $2 million in FY2006 for these efforts. In FY2006, $2 million is proposed for radiological response efforts under the Radiological Terrorism Security Act of 2005. The State Department's funding request for safeguarding overseas diplomatic security facilities is $689.5 million, a 6 percent increase from FY2005. The H5N1 avian flu virus, which first jumped from poultry to humans in Hong Kong in 1997, has re-emerged in various countries since 2003, infecting 97 people. The H5N1 avian flu virus has infected people in Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam since 2003, resulting in 53 deaths. There is concern that if the virus develops the ability to transmit efficiently between people, Asia could become the epicenter of a global influenza pandemic. Health authorities believe that while influenza pandemics are inevitable, their progress can be slowed by rapid detection and local efforts to control spread. This would allow affected nations to better manage the situation and prepare countries not yet affected. Asian countries affected by avian flu must track the virus spread in birds and detect human cases. This affects global welfare and presents policy challenges for developed nations. Section 2117 of S. 600 calls for an international strategy to prevent and respond to outbreaks, coordinating efforts with other nations. The task force for avian flu outbreaks will consist of high-level officials and receive $25 million for assistance in FY2006. H.R. 2601 does not address avian flu, while related legislation includes funding for prevention efforts and global preparedness for pandemic influenza. The Global Pathogen Surveillance Act, Title XXIV of S. 600, aims to enhance developing nations' capability to detect and contain infectious disease outbreaks. Introduced in the 107th Congress, the legislation received Senate approval but was not enacted in subsequent sessions. H.R. 2601 does not address pathogen surveillance. Global surveillance is crucial in detecting and tracking the spread of infectious diseases worldwide, whether natural or from a bioterrorist attack. International trade, travel, and migration facilitate rapid pathogen spread, posing threats to health, economy, and social stability. The World Health Organization established the Global Pathogen Surveillance Act to contain microbial threats before they escalate into pandemics. The Global Pathogen Surveillance Act prioritizes assistance to countries that provide early disease outbreak notification, share data with U.S. authorities, and allow WHO and CDC investigations. It aims to strengthen disease surveillance in developing nations through training and support for medical and laboratory personnel. Eligible nationals from these countries may also receive training in the United States. The Global Pathogen Surveillance Act aims to provide assistance for the purchase of laboratory equipment and communications technology, authorize the assignment of public health officials to diplomatic missions, and expand CDC facilities overseas for global disease monitoring. The Global Pathogen Surveillance Act authorizes funding of $35 million in FY2006 for various activities, including training public health officials, procuring lab equipment, assigning officials to U.S. missions, expanding government labs overseas, and enhancing WHO's surveillance capabilities.
