    "content": "On May 25, 2009, North Korea conducted a nuclear test that produced seismic signals indicating human activity. Despite no detection of radioactive materials, the ability to contain them could be valuable for North Korea. This report discusses the test, detection, containment, and implications for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. The Treaty (CTBT) aims to improve monitoring of nuclear testing. States with nuclear weapons may need tests for advanced designs and weapon safety. Nonnuclear experiments can help with some aspects, but actual tests provide essential data for weapon functionality. Nuclear testing provides crucial data for various technical disciplines, including weapon design, physics, metallurgy, engineering, computer modeling, instrumentation, radiochemistry, and containment. Efforts to ban nuclear tests have been ongoing for decades as an arms control measure. Efforts to ban nuclear tests have been ongoing for decades as an arms control measure. The Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963 banned atmospheric, space, and underwater tests. The Threshold Test Ban Treaty and Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty in 1974 and 1976 limited underground nuclear explosions. Negotiations for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) were completed in 1996, aiming to ban all nuclear explosions. The treaty includes an International Monitoring System (IMS) to detect signs of explosions and procedures for on-site inspections (OSIs) to investigate suspected tests. Efforts to ban nuclear tests have been ongoing for decades. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) was completed in 1996 with the aim to ban all nuclear explosions. As of November 2010, 182 nations had signed the treaty and 153 had ratified it. To enter into force, 44 specified nations must all ratify, with 35 having done so by 2010. The U.S. Senate voted against ratification in 1999 due to concerns about verifying compliance and maintaining the nuclear stockpile without testing. President Obama pledged to pursue U.S. ratification in 2009. North Korea conducted its first nuclear test in 2006. North Korea conducted its first nuclear test on October 9, 2006, confirmed by radioactive debris analysis. The explosion yield was less than a kiloton and was powered by plutonium harvested from its small nuclear reactor. The CTBTO PrepCom also commented on the event two weeks later. The CTBTO PrepCom and the Swedish Defence Research Agency used atmospheric models to trace the origin of radioactive xenon following North Korea's second nuclear test in 2009. The analysis indicated a high probability that the gas originated from the test site in North Korea. On May 25, 2009, North Korea conducted a second nuclear test in the vicinity of P'unggye with an estimated yield of a few kilotons. The lack of certainty regarding the test being nuclear is due to the absence of physical evidence like radioactive isotopes. The CTBTO PrepCom mentioned that the detection of radioactive noble gas, particularly xenon, could confirm the seismic findings. The CTBTO has not detected xenon isotopes from the 2009 DPRK nuclear test, raising doubts about the event being nuclear. The short half-life of xenon makes it unlikely to be detected after several weeks, potentially undermining confidence in verifying compliance with the CTBT. The 2009 event in North Korea may have been a nonnuclear test, as it is difficult to differentiate between nuclear and chemical explosions of similar energy. A scientist suggests a scenario where a large amount of TNT could create a similar explosion, potentially going undetected. The CTBTO rejects the possibility of a chemical explosion based on analysis. The 2009 event in North Korea may have been a nonnuclear test, as it is difficult to differentiate between nuclear and chemical explosions of similar energy. Verification technology experts reject the possibility of a chemical-explosive scenario due to the implausibility of creating a nuclear explosion-like seismic signal using conventional explosives. It would have required several thousand tons of explosives fired instantaneously, which would have been virtually impossible and easily detected. Satellite imagery could have revealed preparations for a large chemical explosion. Questions remain about whether the May 25 event in North Korea was nuclear or nonnuclear. Onsite inspections could confirm a nuclear test, but require CTBT enforcement or North Korea's permission. Nonseismic methods like satellite imagery and communications intercepts could also provide evidence. The absence of radioactive material from the event raises concerns about detection methods. The May 25 event in North Korea raises questions about detection and containment of nuclear material. Negotiating arms control agreements involves establishing regimes for detecting cheating and ensuring compliance. The CTBT and CTBTO play key roles in monitoring and verifying treaty obligations. The CTBT treaty establishes a detailed verification regime to ensure compliance with nuclear test bans. The Protocol outlines provisions for consultation, on-site inspections, and confidence-building measures. The Provisional Technical Secretariat operates the verification regime, but does not determine if a nation has cheated. The CTBT treaty establishes a verification regime to ensure compliance with nuclear test bans. IMS sensors provide evidence of nuclear tests, while an OSI can confirm the occurrence of a test at a specific location. The Technical Secretariat's role ends once data is provided to states parties. In case of a suspected violation, the Conference of the States Parties may recommend collective measures or bring the issue to the attention of the United Nations for further action. Nations would use various means to determine if an event was a nuclear test. Nations use various means to determine if an event was a nuclear test, combining data from multiple sources for effective verification, rather than perfect verification. Detection of violations relies on the ability to detect any significant treaty breaches in time. Judgments on the effectiveness of verification in detecting treaty violations have been crucial in past nuclear testing treaties and will likely be important in future CTBT debates. Nations may use intelligence capabilities to gather details such as weapon yield, fuel type, and design to track the advancement of a nation's weapons program. Technical analysis can also help attribute a nuclear detonation to a specific nation, especially in cases like remote ocean detonations or terrorist attacks. The International Monitoring System (IMS) is crucial for detecting nuclear tests, with various methods like atmospheric and underwater tests being easily detectable. China conducted the most recent atmospheric nuclear test in 1980. Satellites can detect tests in space, while underground tests, like those conducted by North Korea, are harder to detect. The IMS will have 321 monitoring stations, 16 laboratories, and a Global Communications Infrastructure. The International Monitoring System (IMS) uses four technologies to detect nuclear tests: Seismic: Seismographs filter out seismic signals characteristic of explosions from other seismic signals. Analysis of seismic and other waves alone cannot prove an explosion was nuclear. Hydroacoustic and infrasound technologies can detect underwater and atmospheric explosions, respectively, but have limitations in detecting underground nuclear tests. The IMS monitors for radioactive particles and gases to detect nuclear explosions. 80 stations will be able to detect radioactive particulates, with 40 also equipped to detect radioactive forms of xenon. Data from 59 particulate stations, including 25 with radioxenon collection capability, are sent for analysis to the IDC and national data centers. Many technological advances have improved the ability to detect nuclear explosions, such as imaging the Earth's inner structure and using satellite-borne radar technology. The CTBT utilizes various technologies such as radar imaging and seismic wave detection to improve the ability to discriminate between earthquakes and explosions. Onsite inspections (OSIs) are conducted to search for specific signatures that indicate a nuclear test, including radioactive noble gases and physical signs of a test site. The CTBT utilizes technologies like radar imaging and seismic wave detection to distinguish between earthquakes and explosions. Onsite inspections (OSIs) search for radioactive debris and physical signs of a nuclear test, with the United States having its own detection methods through the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC). The Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC) operates the U.S. Atomic Energy Detection System, which detects nuclear events globally. AFTAC analyzes events for nuclear identification and reports findings to national command authorities. AFTAC also serves as the U.S. National Data Center under the CTBT, receiving data from the International Data Center. Underground nuclear tests can release particulates and gases into the atmosphere, indicating a nuclear test occurred. Gases released during nuclear tests, such as krypton-85, argon-37, and xenon isotopes, can indicate a nuclear event. Krypton-85, generated by nuclear power plants, has a long half-life. Argon-37, produced when neutrons interact with calcium-40, is valuable for onsite inspections. Argon-37 is a valuable indicator of underground nuclear explosions, with the potential to be detected at long range. Instruments could be developed to automatically detect argon-37 at remote locations. It is suggested that argon-37 could be separated from air samples collected by radioxenon detection equipment to measure the fraction of argon-37 when xenon isotopes indicate a possible nuclear explosion. The amount of argon-37 detected from a nuclear test depends on bomb yield, release rate from the explosion cavity, and detection system sensitivity. Developing instruments to detect argon-37 as part of the International Monitoring System is desirable. Elevated xenon concentrations combined with atmospheric transport modeling are clear indicators of a nuclear explosion, while argon-37 has low background levels due to its short half-life and lack of civilian sources. Argon-37 is produced from neutron reactions on calcium in the soil, making it difficult to find a test site devoid of calcium. Calcium is abundant in the Earth's crust and even if a site was found without calcium, it would also need to be free of potassium for accurate detection. Argon-37 is detected in soil free of potassium, as neutron reactions with potassium produce argon-39. Long-range detection of argon-37 from nuclear tests is valuable due to its longer half-life, making clandestine testing more difficult. Detection of argon-37 along with radioxenons and seismic signals would indicate a nuclear explosion. Argon-37 decay energy can be detected easily. Uncertainties include background levels, automated detection system design, and detectability for long-range nuclear explosion detection. The detectability of argon-37 and radioxenons at IMS radionuclide stations for long-range nuclear explosion detection is influenced by factors such as release rate and decay rates of isotopes like iodine-133 and iodine-135. Radioxenons, produced by nuclear explosions and reactors, are valuable for detection due to their ability to be detected at great distances, but must be detected promptly due to their short half-lives. The half-life of xenon-133, crucial for identifying nuclear explosions, is 5.24 days, limiting long-range detection to about 3 weeks. Other useful radioxenons include xenon-135 (half-life, 9.14 hours), xenon-133m (half-life, 2.19 days), and xenon-131m (half-life, 11.84 days). Improved technologies now allow for detecting radioxenons thousands of miles away within weeks of a nuclear test, using gamma-ray spectroscopy among other techniques. IMS equipment collects air, separates xenon, and transmits data to the IDC for analysis. Gamma-ray spectroscopy is a technique used to identify radioxenon sources based on the unique energy spectrum of gamma rays emitted during radioactive decay. Beta-gamma coincidence counting is another method that detects xenon-133 decay by measuring the simultaneous emission of a beta particle and an 81-keV gamma ray. This technique is sensitive even to trace amounts of xenon-133. Improved sensitivity of radioxenon detection instruments enhances techniques for long-range detection of nuclear tests. Atmospheric transport modeling (ATM) can determine the region where a nuclear test occurred by calculating air mass paths carrying radioactive materials. This model uses data from weather satellites, World Meteorological Organization stations, and the IMS network to predict the movement of radionuclides. Atmospheric transport modeling (ATM) can predict the movement of radionuclides released at a specific location. It can also be used in reverse to trace back radionuclides to their source region, aiding in the detection of nuclear tests. In 2006, ATM helped identify a hypothesized release of radionuclides from North Korea after the detection of xenon-133 in Yellowknife, Canada. The International Data Centre (IDC) staff concluded that the containment of xenon in North Korea during the 2009 event was above 99.9 percent, indicating a possible nuclear test. Monitoring releases from nuclear reactors can help rule out specific sources of radioxenons. The ratio of radioactive xenon isotopes can differentiate between nuclear tests and reactor emissions. Analyzing the ratio of xenon-135 to xenon-133 can indicate whether the nuclear explosive was fueled by uranium or plutonium. The information on whether the nuclear explosive was fueled by uranium or plutonium is important for analyzing the nuclear device characteristics. However, it is not necessary to determine if the test would violate the CTBT. Don Barr, a retired Los Alamos radiochemist, calculates that this determination can be made within an hour or two. The ratio xenon-133m/xenon-131m can differentiate between these fuels for a longer time, but the IMS could not perform ratio analysis for the 2006 North Korean test due to detection limitations. Jungmin Kang, Frank von Hippel, and Hui Zhang explain that ratio analysis is valuable for only a short time due to the release of xenon isotopes. Most xenon isotopes released after a nuclear test come from radioactive iodines, making it difficult to determine the fuel type accurately. While there is a slim chance of determining the fuel type from xenon ratios shortly after an explosion, it becomes less reliable within two days. Nuclear tests also release particulates containing various fission products and materials of different sizes. Particulates released after a nuclear test vary in size, ranging from large diameters to very small ones. Analyzing these particulates can provide evidence of a test, as demonstrated by the U.S. Air Force in 1949 when they collected samples over the Pacific Ocean. By chemically separating fission products and measuring radioactive decay rates, the U.S. determined that the Soviet Union had conducted its first atomic bomb test on August 29, 1949. The U.S. Air Force collected particulate samples over the Pacific Ocean in 1949 to determine the Soviet Union's first atomic bomb test. Radiochemistry techniques were developed to analyze nuclear explosions, such as the Trinity test in 1945. IMS radionuclide stations collect and analyze particles to confirm detection for CTBT verification. The sample would be shipped to an IMS laboratory for confirmation and detailed investigation. IMS radionuclide stations near North Korea show gaps in monitoring equipment and variations in background levels of radionuclides due to weather and sources other than nuclear tests. Context is crucial for interpreting measurements. The Provisional Technical Secretariat collaborates with other organizations to measure and characterize background levels at radionuclide stations to detect elevated levels of radioxenons from nuclear tests. Releases of radionuclides from underground nuclear tests can occur through vents, which are high-pressure gas pathways to the surface caused by leaks in the excavation or natural fractures in the rock. Certain geologic formations can contribute to venting. Certain geologic formations with preexisting fractures can increase the probability of vent paths. Carbonates in rock can produce carbon dioxide when heated by an explosion, raising gas pressure in the cavity and the likelihood of venting. A nuclear explosion can turn water in rocks into steam, adding pressure in the cavity and potentially leading to venting. Noble gases are released by large vents, while smaller vents release mainly noble gases with minimal particulate matter. The Soviet Union observed water and carbonate rock leading to venting at one test site, while different conditions at another site did not result in venting. The first North Korean test likely vented gases. The first North Korean nuclear test likely vented gases, releasing radioxenon detectable two weeks later at Yellowknife. Seeps, a smaller release of radioactive material, can occur over weeks to months through porous rock or fractures. Seeps can confirm a test at the site but are unlikely to be detected hundreds of miles away. Seeps and vents are caused by high-pressure gases escaping from a nuclear explosion cavity through pathways in the surrounding geology. Barometric pumping is another release mechanism where gases are drawn upward towards the Earth's surface due to pressure differentials in fractures. Gases can diffuse into porous walls and be temporarily stored, even when atmospheric pressure changes. Increased atmospheric pressure causes gases in a fracture to flow downward, creating a ratcheting effect that transports noble gases to the surface after seeps and vents induced by pressure have ceased. Barometric pumping may not aid long-range detection due to small quantities of radioactive noble gases released, but it can produce enough for detection by an OSI. Containment of these gases is challenging, as shown in recent Russian papers on underground nuclear testing. The Semipalatinsk test site in Kazakhstan and U.S. nuclear tests released radioactivity. Containment failures occurred in U.S. tests like the \"Des Moines\" and \"Baneberry\" tests. The U.S. took measures to contain nuclear tests by understanding geology and engineering containment. Deep burial and gas blocking techniques were used to virtually eliminate risks. The containment of nuclear devices involves deep burial and gas blocking techniques to prevent seepage of noble gases to the surface. However, imperfect knowledge of surrounding geology may lead to hidden pathways for vents and seeps, adding an element of uncertainty to containment efforts. Empirical rules and approximations are used to model the behavior of earth materials post-detonation, but complexities arise due to important processes occurring over varying time spans. The containment of nuclear devices involves deep burial and gas blocking techniques to prevent seepage of noble gases to the surface. Experience and empirical evidence from previous detonations are crucial in judging the outcome of a specific detonation. Information on containing tests can be found in unclassified U.S. literature, including details on burying nuclear explosive devices and evaluating containment procedures. The containment of nuclear tests involves deep burial and gas blocking techniques to prevent seepage of noble gases. The Limited Test Ban Treaty signed in 1963 improved containment practices, with all tests designed to be completely contained underground. The Atomic Energy Commission implemented new containment measures following the Baneberry incident. The Atomic Energy Commission improved containment practices after the Baneberry incident. The Department of Energy reported fewer accidental radiation releases in nuclear tests post-1970 compared to pre-1970 tests. Some noble gases seeped into the atmosphere after tests from 1984 to 1989. Radioactive material was intentionally released after post-1970 tests for analysis. The effectiveness of post-Baneberry containment was evaluated in a 1989 OTA report. Some U.S. nuclear tests may have released radioactive material below detection thresholds. North Korea's containment methods for its second test could have been influenced by lessons learned from the first test, such as stemming methods and burial depth. Lessons learned from other nations include how factors like stemming methods, depth of burial, and rock type affect containment of nuclear explosions. Higher-yield devices are easier to contain as they produce more energy that pushes against surrounding rock, forming a strong stress containment cage. The explosion can also melt rock, sealing leak paths like fractures that could allow gases or particulates to escape. North Korean tests had low yield, with the second test having higher yield than the first. The test site may have had solid rock with no fissures, allowing for containment of radioactive material. Venting below detection threshold is possible due to sensitive equipment. The May 25 event may not have been a nuclear test, explaining the lack of radioactive effluents. Attention to atmospheric conditions could impede detection of radionuclides, preventing collection by radionuclide stations. North Korea's ability to hold venting of its second test below detection threshold would be a significant achievement. North Korea's ability to contain radioactive material from its 2009 test could benefit the country by reducing fallout and potential harm to its relationships with China and Russia. Monitoring North Korea's containment capability for future tests is crucial. North Korea's focus on containing fallout from its nuclear weapons program is crucial to avoid antagonizing neighboring countries like Japan and South Korea. Additionally, proper containment could prevent other nations from analyzing radioactive materials to gain insight into North Korea's weapon characteristics, hindering the progress of their nuclear program. Furthermore, successful containment could make it harder for the CTBTO Executive Council to authorize an On-Site Inspection, providing scientific cover for nations looking to deny such requests on political grounds. North Korea's focus on containing fallout from its nuclear weapons program is crucial to avoid antagonizing neighboring countries like Japan and South Korea. Successful containment could prevent other nations from analyzing radioactive materials to gain insight into North Korea's weapon characteristics, hindering the progress of their nuclear program. Additionally, a lack of radioactive noble gases combined with a nuclear explosion-like seismic signal and other technical evidence would provide a compelling case for requesting an OSI. Iran is a possible candidate for conducting nuclear tests in North Korea, given their history of conventional arms trade and missile cooperation. Events in 2009, such as the discovery of a covert uranium enrichment facility, increased suspicions that Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons. Iran conducting nuclear tests in North Korea could benefit both countries by providing data for weapons development and giving the impression of rapid progress. This arrangement would require confidence in North Korea's containment ability to prevent radioactive samples from being obtained. Conducting tests in North Korea could help Iran develop nuclear weapons while potentially avoiding consequences of testing in Iran, such as an attack on its facilities. Iran conducting nuclear tests in North Korea could benefit both countries by providing data for weapons development. High confidence in North Korea's containment ability is necessary to prevent the attribution of the test to its partner. Iran might use nuclear tests to demonstrate its nuclear capability, gain leverage in the Middle East, and deter potential attacks on its nuclear facilities. North Korea is pursuing uranium enrichment but not plutonium reprocessing, making it difficult to determine the origin of nuclear test devices. Siegfried Hecker reported on this development in late 2010. Siegfried Hecker, a nuclear expert, visited North Korea's nuclear complex at Yongbyon and was shown a new uranium enrichment facility with 2,000 centrifuges. The facility was completed recently and is likely using advanced P-2 design centrifuges. He expressed concern about the possibility of another facility producing highly enriched uranium. A new uranium enrichment facility with 2,000 centrifuges was shown to nuclear expert Siegfried Hecker at North Korea's Yongbyon complex. He raised concerns about the possibility of another undetected facility producing highly enriched uranium. The centrifuges were initially claimed to be for low-enriched uranium production but could be rearranged to produce up to 40 kg of highly-enriched uranium per year. Siegfried Hecker inspected a new uranium enrichment facility in North Korea's Yongbyon complex with 2,000 centrifuges. He expressed concerns about the potential for undisclosed facilities producing highly enriched uranium. While no plutonium reprocessing activity was observed, it was noted that Pyongyang could resume plutonium operations within six months, producing one bomb's worth per year. Identifying the origin of a nuclear weapon through particulate debris analysis could be challenging in practice. David Asher, involved in countering North Korea's proliferation, highlighted the difficulty in attributing a weapon to North Korea based on uranium analysis. The George W. Bush administration expressed concerns about Iran's expanding demands for enriched uranium and the possibility of North Korea supplying it. Speculations arose in late 2010 about North Korea preparing for another nuclear test, with reports of brisk movement in Punggye-re. However, the chances of a third nuclear test were considered low at the moment. The Defense Minister of South Korea stated that North Korea is working on making its nuclear weapons smaller for potential delivery by missiles or bombers. There are no clear signs of another nuclear test being prepared, despite renewed activities in northeastern North Korea. Seoul has not found substantial evidence of North Korea planning a nuclear test. A U.S. analyst from Jane's defense intelligence group suggests that a nuclear test in North Korea is imminent based on images showing activity at a site in North Hamgyong Province. Japanese and South Korean officials also express concerns about potential nuclear testing, with estimates of three to six months before a test could be conducted. North Korea is conducting work at its nuclear test site in Gilju County, North Hamgyeong Province, but it is not ready for a nuclear test yet. There are concerns about potential nuclear testing, with estimates of three to six more months before a test can be conducted. The data from a future North Korean test is being analyzed to determine if it was nuclear, with questions about the evidence, yield, and advanced design features like boosting or thermonuclear capabilities. The analysis of a future North Korean nuclear test includes questions about evidence of tritium production, sensor detection effectiveness, containment techniques, and verification methods. The 2009 North Korean nuclear test raises questions about containment, foreign assistance, and implications for the CTBT. Supporters and opponents may debate the absence of detectable radionuclides and its implications for verifying compliance. Opponents argue that without radionuclide detection, there is no proof of a nuclear test. The 2009 event in North Korea may have been a large conventional explosion to inflate progress in their weapons program. Supporters argue that the IMS seismic component's ability to detect signals characteristic of an explosion shows its capability. The IMS identified the event as an explosion before North Korea announced it, indicating the difficulty of evading detection. Opponents claim that without radionuclide detection, there is no proof of a nuclear test. North Korea is unlikely to ratify the treaty preventing entry into force as long as it has interest in future nuclear tests. Even if ratified, inspections may be barred or inconclusive. Supporters believe OSIs could find evidence leading to U.N. sanctions on North Korea for violations. Refusal to permit inspections is seen as evidence of violation. Opponents argue that decoupling nuclear tests in large underground cavities could evade detection by IMS technologies. They claim that if tests are conducted evasively, the IMS may not be effective in detecting them. This raises concerns about the system's ability to detect clandestine tests. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) faces challenges in detecting evasive nuclear tests, with supporters questioning the feasibility of hiding tests over 1 or 2 kilotons. Despite debates on evasion techniques, entry into force requires ratification by North Korea, among others, which may be difficult to obtain. Some CTBT supporters suggest provisional entry into force to allow states that ratified the treaty to behave as if it had entered into force, enabling On-Site Inspections (OSIs) and formal CTBTO operation. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) faces challenges in detecting evasive nuclear tests, with debates on evasion techniques. Provisional entry into force could enable On-Site Inspections (OSIs) and formal CTBTO operation, but there are concerns about detecting simulated nuclear tests and attributing tests to the correct parties. Regular entry into force would address these concerns by allowing OSIs to determine if a test was nuclear or conventional. The 2009 North Korean nuclear event raised questions about the nature of the explosion and the need for improved monitoring capabilities. Congress may consider enhancing monitoring systems through research, deploying more equipment, improving system performance, and identifying new signatures for detecting nuclear tests. Government agencies involved in monitoring and verification regularly update strategic plans to enhance their capabilities. \"The U.S. nuclear test program focused on containment of particulates, not gases. Understanding how the Earth contains gases, especially in nuclear tests, could help evaluate North Korean containment efforts.\" Korean efforts to contain radioactive material from nuclear tests are being analyzed by the Intelligence Community. Improving atmospheric transport modeling and seismic data analysis could enhance tracking and monitoring capabilities. The past decade has seen fluctuations in funding for nuclear explosion monitoring programs, leading to a shortage of experts in the field. To address this issue, steady support for training programs is needed to ensure an adequate number of experts to meet national needs. The Nuclear Forensics and Attribution Act aims to address the decline in radiochemistry programs and experts in the United States. It proposes establishing a National Nuclear Forensics Expertise Development Program. There is a push to equip all 80 radionuclide stations with radioxenon equipment instead of the current 40 to enhance monitoring capabilities as outlined in the treaty. The CTBTO PrepCom suggests adding radioxenon equipment to all 80 radionuclide stations to strengthen monitoring capabilities. The European Union and the United States have contributed to this effort. Additional stations in Japan, South Korea, China, and Russia near North Korea would be valuable for monitoring nuclear testing. Adding radioxenon equipment to all 80 radionuclide stations would still leave gaps in coverage, especially for monitoring North Korea. Mobile detection systems, including ships and aircraft, could help address these gaps by deploying immediately after detecting a nuclear test. These systems may or may not be part of the International Monitoring System, depending on treaty regulations. Mobile systems, such as ships and aircraft, could close gaps in the International Monitoring System by collecting data over broad ocean areas and near suspected detonation sites. Gathering radioxenons quickly is valuable for analyzing nuclear test signatures, providing high confidence in test origins and weapon characteristics. The decay of xenon-135, iodine-133, and -135 hinders analysis after a short time. Close-in collection of radionuclides can enhance concentration for easier analysis and determination of test origin. Airborne or ground sensors can increase radionuclide concentration by a factor of more than a million. Obstacles may exist for collection systems over international waters. The 2009 nuclear test aimed to deter surveillance planes. Improving detection of radioactive noble gases would increase detection probability. Onsite detection shows xenon-133 signal diminishes faster due to shorter half-life. Detection window opens when gas reaches the surface after detonation. The Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC) operates two WC-135 \"Constant Phoenix\" aircraft to collect particulates and gases from nuclear explosions. The aircraft are operated by the 55th Wing, 45th Reconnaissance Squadron at Offutt Air Force Base, Neb. The detection window for xenon and argon reaching the surface after a detonation is about 50 and 80 days, respectively, due to barometric pumping. A more sensitive detector could potentially \"open\" the window slightly earlier. The Air Force is conducting an Analysis of Alternatives to find long-term solutions for the aging WC-135 aircraft used to collect debris from nuclear explosions. The aircraft may need wing re-skinning by 2022 and engine sustainment through 2040. The analysis will also consider other manned and unmanned aircraft for the mission. The Air Force is evaluating options for the aging WC-135 aircraft used for collecting debris from nuclear explosions. One WC-135 serves as the primary aircraft, with another as a backup. Both aircraft can fly the mission simultaneously, but one is usually in maintenance. It is important to collect samples quickly to narrow down the region of a nuclear test and minimize sample loss. Having more than one aircraft may be desirable for this mission. The Air Force is considering options for the aging WC-135 aircraft used to collect debris from nuclear explosions. It may be beneficial to have more than two aircraft for this purpose, with some forward-based. Forward basing could be more cost-effective for long-range drones like Reapers or Global Hawks. There is a decision to be made on whether to extend the service life of WC-135s or acquire new aircraft. Additionally, adding airborne sensors to the IMS may be worth considering in accordance with the CTBT. Congress recognizes the importance of promptly collecting samples due to the short half-lives of radioisotopes produced in nuclear detonations. The United States must restore its ability to gather atmospheric samples for nuclear testing monitoring. Modern technologies should be pursued to complement or replace existing techniques. The previous administration focused on improving monitoring but did not seek entry into force of the CTBT. Funds were requested for the CTBTO Preparatory Commission to support the IMS. The $19.8 million will pay for the ongoing development and implementation of the International Monitoring System (IMS) to detect nuclear explosions. The funds will not support Preparatory Commission activities unrelated to the IMS. The Obama Administration favors the CTBT and directs funding towards IMS technologies over On-Site Inspections (OSIs) to make verification more effective. Developing more sensitive detectors and integrating geophysical methods could enhance OSIs. One approach to enhance On-Site Inspections (OSIs) is to develop more sensitive detectors and integrate geophysical methods for detecting anomalies underground. Field experiments on noble gases reaching the surface could provide valuable data. Conducting similar experiments under various conditions would help calibrate computer models for gas leakage from underground tests. Research on satellite-borne means of detection may also be warranted. Congress may consider additional R&D on satellite-based detection of nuclear activities. The CTBT allows for the addition of monitoring technologies like satellites to the IMS. The United States is likely conducting classified R&D in this area. Congressional committees should assess these efforts and ensure appropriate levels of investment. The Intelligence Community continues to study and debate evasion scenarios related to the CTBT, some dating back to the 1950s. Detecting argon-37 at a distance may be feasible, but developing an operational system would require further research on background levels of this isotope. Public discussion of new evasion scenarios is limited to prevent aiding potential evaders. Developing an operational system to detect argon-37 at a distance would require characterizing background levels of the isotope, studying calcium distribution, developing automated detection equipment, and assessing cost-effectiveness. This effort is crucial to differentiate between nuclear and chemical explosions, as seen in the 2009 North Korean test. Chemical explosion effluents would not provide conclusive evidence due to the prevalence of hydrocarbons in the atmosphere, but other signatures could be indicative, such as seismic activity. The 1993 NPE aimed to distinguish between nuclear and chemical explosions by studying seismic waves. The inability to definitively prove the 2009 North Korean event was nuclear highlights the need for further research. Monitoring nonnuclear explosion signatures is crucial, especially before the CTBT is enforced. Onsite inspections post-CTBT entry into force could help resolve such situations."
