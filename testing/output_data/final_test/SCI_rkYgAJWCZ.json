    "content": "Humans have a remarkable ability for one-shot or few-shot learning, inferring meanings of new words from context. Deep learning systems typically require large amounts of data to learn concepts, but a simple technique using deep recurrent networks can help them learn new words from little data, making natural language processing systems more flexible. Despite the presence of nonsense words in Lewis Carroll's poem, readers can still understand the narrative through context. Humans have the ability to quickly adapt to new situations, aided by complementary learning systems theory. This theory suggests that a slow-learning system, similar to deep learning, and a fast-learning system, like memory, work together to allow rapid adaptation from limited experiences. In contrast, standard deep learning systems typically require more data to learn concepts. In contrast to standard deep learning systems, which require more data to learn concepts, deep learning systems need to integrate prior knowledge to effectively learn from limited information. This paper explores creating a useful word representation based on context, emphasizing the effectiveness of continuous word representations. Deep learning systems have been effective in representing words as vectors learned from large text corpuses. However, there is limited prior work on learning embeddings for new words once the system is trained. Previous methods incorporate morphological information for limited generalization to new words, but require strong structural assumptions and labeled data. BID7 explored multi-modal word learning by averaging surrounding word vectors to infer a new word's meaning. However, this method ignores syntactic information and relies on linear combinability of semantic information. Deep learning systems trained for language tasks encode useful semantic and syntactic structures in their weights, offering potential for improved word inference. Backpropagation can be used to update a network's representations when learning a new word without causing catastrophic interference. By freezing most weights and only optimizing those connecting the new input, the network can make appropriate generalizations without disrupting prior knowledge. This approach was used as a model for human concept learning. In this approach inspired by human concept learning, weights in the network are frozen except for those representing the new word. Stochastic gradient descent is then used to update the weights for the new word over 100 epochs of training. Three possible initializations for the embeddings are considered, including starting with an embedding for a token placed in the softmax but never used during training. The approach involves freezing network weights except for those representing the new word and updating them using stochastic gradient descent over 100 epochs. Three different initializations for embeddings are considered, including starting with a token embedding placed in the softmax but never used during training. The framework for updating embeddings is applied to predicting the next word in a sentence on the Penn Treebank dataset. The study focuses on using a large model architecture on the Penn Treebank dataset for language understanding. The approach involves training the model on a prediction task, with potential for deeper understanding by grounding language in situations and goals. The one-shot word-learning algorithm was tested by removing sentences containing a specific word and training the model for 55 epochs. The study involved training a large model on the Penn Treebank dataset for language understanding. The one-shot word-learning algorithm was tested by removing sentences containing a specific word and training the model for 55 epochs. The dataset contained over 40,000 sentences, with 20 missing ones having minimal impact on performance. The approach included splitting the 20 sentences with the new word into 10 train and 10 test sets, and training on different permutations. The evaluation was done on words like \"bonuses,\" \"explained,\" \"marketers,\" and \"strategist,\" initializing from different embeddings and comparing the results. The study involved training a large model on the Penn Treebank dataset for language understanding. The one-shot word-learning algorithm was tested by optimizing from the centroid of surrounding words, outperforming other approaches for learning new words. Embedding initialization strongly affected the optimizing approaches with few training sentences, but by 10 sentences, they performed similarly. Replicated findings with four new words showed changes in perplexity on the PTB test corpus. The study tested a one-shot word-learning algorithm by optimizing from the centroid of surrounding words, showing a decline in test perplexity with more training sentences. The use of replay buffers to interleave learning was suggested to address the problem of biased training data. Using a replay buffer during new word learning reduced interference, with a maximum increase in perplexity of 0.06%. Interleaving sentences without the word helped decrease interference, although there was slightly less improvement on new-word test sentences. The optimizing approach reduced perplexity on the new word dataset by up to 33%, outperforming the centroid approach by 10 percentage points. The study compared the impact of changing input and output embeddings on learning new words. Results showed that changes in output embeddings were mainly responsible for improvement, especially in one-shot learning. However, with more training sentences, updated input embeddings also showed some improvement, although still smaller compared to output embeddings. The study found that the output embedding had a greater impact on learning new words compared to the input embedding. Training with new words did not interfere significantly with prior knowledge when using a replay buffer. The study showed that training with new words had a greater impact on learning compared to prior knowledge. The model had less data to learn about how the new word predicts surrounding context, which may explain why full training with the word produced better results in some cases. Adjustments to intermediate weights may be needed to efficiently pass information about the new word through the model. The study analyzed the effects of learning new word embeddings by evaluating the model's predictions of the new word's probability in different contexts. They compared the model's performance when the new word was the target word, when it was relevant but not the target, and when it was irrelevant. The analysis aimed to determine if the model was learning effectively or overfitting to new data. The study also compared different approaches to learning new words, including the centroid approach and a replay buffer method. The study compared different approaches to learning new words, including the centroid method and a replay buffer. Results showed that the model had clear distinctions between relevant and irrelevant cases, but underestimated the probability of the word when it appeared. The centroid method also struggled to distinguish between contexts effectively. The study compared different approaches to learning new words, including the centroid method and a replay buffer. Results showed that the model had clear distinctions between relevant and irrelevant cases, but underestimated the probability of the word when it appeared. The new approach resulted in a good distinction between contexts, with the word being predicted to be about 5 times as likely in relevant contexts compared to irrelevant ones, and about 25 times as likely when the word actually appears. This approach appeared superior to the centroid method, but base rate estimates of the word's prevalence were inflated, leading to a small increase in test perplexity on datasets without the new word. The study compared different approaches to learning new words, showing that the optimized embeddings captured important features of word presence. Results indicated a need for bias adjustment or more negative samples to improve model performance. Additional experiments were conducted to validate findings across a broader sample of words. In an experiment, a single model was trained without 100 selected words from the PTB train corpus. Few-shot learning techniques were tested with a replay buffer and centroid technique, compared to full training with all words. The comparison showed a slight increase in training efficiency. The model trained without 100 selected words showed improved performance with few-shot learning techniques compared to full training. Optimizing from the centroid resulted in a 64% improvement over the centroid method, with no words performing worse. The optimizing method significantly outperformed the centroid technique. See FIG2 for detailed results. The optimizing approach shows significant improvement over the centroid method, performing comparably to full training despite being exposed to less data. This technique allows for substantial reductions in perplexity on text containing new words without interfering with knowledge about other words. The new approach shows promising results in capturing useful word structures in context, performing close to full training. This technique could be extended to adapt systems to new experiences, such as adding filters to a vision network for an RL agent. The strategy may fail when dealing with schema-inconsistent knowledge, as suggested by complementary learning systems theory. Our technique for one-or few-shot learning of word embeddings from text data involves freezing all network weights except for the new word embeddings and optimizing them. This approach shows promise in adapting systems to new experiences and could be applied to more complex tasks like question answering or in a grounded context. The technique involves optimizing new word embeddings in a network, leading to improved word prediction in context. It allows natural language processing systems to adapt flexibly to new experiences, serving as a model for integrating rapid adaptation into deep learning systems. The model was trained with a hidden size of 1500 units, 35 recurrent steps, and dropout applied to non-recurrent connections. Gradients were clipped to a max global norm of 10, weights were initialized uniformly, and the loss function used was cross-entropy. The model was trained for 55 epochs with stochastic gradient descent. Input embeddings, softmax weights, and biases were extracted for each word in the sentence except the new word, and new input embeddings were optimized in three ways.

The model was trained for 55 epochs with stochastic gradient descent. Input embeddings, softmax weights, and biases were extracted for each word in the sentence except the new word, and new input embeddings were optimized in three ways. Starting from this point, 100 epochs of batch gradient descent were run with a learning rate of 0.01, using cross entropy loss plus 0.01 times the 2 norm of the new embedding. The similarity structures of word vectors produced by one-shot learning were compared to those produced by full training. The dot product of the new word output embedding with all other word output embeddings was computed to create a similarity map. The similarity maps of word vectors produced by one-shot learning methods were compared to those produced by full training. The centroid method showed negatively correlated similarity structures in three out of four cases, while the optimizing method had mostly uncorrelated structures with the full training similarity structure. Only for one word did the optimizing method produce slightly more similar structures. The one-shot learning methods showed varied correlations with full training similarity structures. While some words had strongly positive correlations, others were uncorrelated. The results suggest that the network's semantic knowledge is consistent when fully trained with a word, but later learning approaches can produce even more internal consistency, especially when trained with multiple sentences. The approach is performing well at distinguishing contexts where the new word appears or not. Different representational structures are created due to the removal of contextual cues in isolated sentences. Full training with the word allows attention to relationships across sentence boundaries, resulting in exposure to word co-occurrences. Including surrounding context sentences in training may lead to more similar representational structures. Our results improve upon previous work by showing benefits of learning from a word in context, rather than just from definitions. We also demonstrate behaviorally relevant improvements, unlike previous studies that only evaluated embedding similarity. Additionally, we analyze the effects of varying data parameters and where the improvements are occurring."
