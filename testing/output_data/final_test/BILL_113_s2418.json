SEC. 203 requires a report from the Comptroller General. The Comptroller General of the United States must submit a report to Congress within 180 days on how corporations avoid paying promised employee and retiree benefits. The report will discuss strategies like spin-offs, mergers, bankruptcies, and their impact on employees, retirees, and government budgets. Retirees seek government assistance due to loss of employment benefits, with recommendations to prevent corporations from avoiding payment obligations."
