While GANs have shown success in image processing, adapting them for materials science to synthesize data with higher complexity remains a challenge. CrystalGAN is a novel GAN proposed for generating chemically stable crystallographic structures with increased complexity. The method is illustrated on a problem of novel hydrides discovery for hydrogen storage materials. Designing new structures in a vast chemical space is a challenge in physics, chemistry, and materials science. In this work, the focus is on applications of hydrogen storage and investigating novel chemical compositions with stable crystals. Density functional theory (DFT) is traditionally used for predicting chemically relevant compositions, but it is computationally expensive. Machine learning approaches have been proposed to facilitate the search for stable compositions by generating relevant chemical compositions based on recommender systems. Recent advancements in the crystallographic field have shown that machine learning methods, such as support vector machines and deep learning, can efficiently predict stable crystal structures based on chemical compositions. These methods provide faster and reliable results compared to traditional approaches, highlighting the importance of data representation for effective learning algorithms. Recent advancements in machine learning have shown success in synthesizing data and learning transferable representations. GANs have been used in cross-domain learning applications for image processing. The goal is to develop an approach to identify stable ternary chemical compounds from observations of binary compounds, as there is currently no direct method for this task in materials science. GANs are limited in generating samples with increased complexity, such as constructing crystals with three elements from observations of two elements. Our contribution introduces CrystalGAN, a GAN-based method for discovering novel crystal structures and generating new chemical compositions. The model generates complex data with constraints and prior knowledge, showing competitiveness in chemistry and materials science challenges. The algorithm is efficiently implemented in Python and will be publicly available soon. The paper introduces CrystalGAN, a GAN-based method for generating novel crystal structures and chemical compositions. It discusses related work, formalizes the problem, presents results of numerical experiments, and concludes with remarks. The aim is to synthesize new data in an unobserved domain with increased complexity, using adversarial nets framework. The generator G and discriminator D in GANs are trained simultaneously in a two-player minimax game. Techniques to improve GAN training have been proposed. Conditional GANs are used for image-to-image translation and multi-model tasks. The idea of combining observed data to create new data was also discussed. The proposed method involves a generator function that translates input features between two domains, AH and BH. Data is reconstructed after two generator translations, and features are transferred between the domains AH and BH. This technique is used in CrystalGAN for image-to-image translation. The proposed method involves a generator function that translates data between domains AH and BH. Data is reconstructed after two generator translations, introducing new data for exploration by experts. The approach aims to learn high-level semantic features and train a model for multiple tasks, addressing overfitting. Multiple discriminators with varying roles were discussed, and various GANs were adapted for materials science and chemical applications. The CrystalGAN approach introduces a method for generating crystal data of augmented complexity. It consists of three procedures: a GAN that generates pseudo-binary samples, a feature transfer procedure, and a model for predicting new chemical properties. This approach aims to address the limitations of existing methods in generating complex crystal data. The CrystalGAN approach involves three steps: generating mixed domain samples, transferring features to create higher order complexity data, and synthesizing novel ternary stable chemical structures. This novel architecture uses cross-domain GAN algorithms with constraint learning to discover complex crystallographic systems and generate new materials, focusing on ternary hydride compounds as an example. The CrystalGAN approach involves generating ternary hydride compounds of the form \"A-H-B\" using a machine learning algorithm. The architecture consists of two steps with a feature transfer procedure in between. The first step generates new data with increased complexity, utilizing reconstruction loss functions. The first step of CrystalGAN involves reconstruction loss functions to ensure accurate reconstruction of original observations. Generative adversarial loss functions aim to control the reconstruction accuracy, with discriminative loss functions distinguishing samples from different sources. The full generative loss function includes hyper-parameters for controlling the ratio between terms, while the discriminator loss function is defined as L D1. The first step of CrystalGAN involves reconstruction and discriminative loss functions to ensure accurate reconstruction and distinguish samples from different sources. The second step generates higher order complexity data by transferring attributes from two domains to construct a new dataset for training. A placeholder is added to prepare the datasets for generating complex samples. The second step of CrystalGAN involves using geometric constraints to generate ternary chemical compounds that are stable. The constraints ensure the quality of the generated data by describing the crystallographic structure through distances to nearest neighbors. These constraints are enforced to meet the scientific domain application requirements. The second step of CrystalGAN involves applying geometric constraints to generate stable ternary chemical compounds. These constraints define the distances between nearest neighbors in the crystallographic structure, enhancing the quality of the generated data. The constraints are crucial for meeting the scientific domain application requirements. In the second step of CrystalGAN, geometric constraints are applied to generate stable ternary compounds. These constraints, based on crystallographic and materials science expertise, aim to satisfy environmental requirements and increase the synthesis rate of stable compounds. Crystallographic structures are represented using POSCAR files for DFT calculations under the VASP code. The POSCAR files used in DFT calculations under the VASP code contain lattice geometry, atomic positions, and atom composition. The CrystalGAN generates POSCAR files with abc matrix, H atom positions, and metallic atom coordinates. The information is fed into 4-dimensional tensors for processing. The CrystalGAN generates 3D structures from binary hydrides, focusing on ternary compositions like \"Palladium -Hydrogen -Nickel\" and \"Magnesium -Hydrogen -Titanium\". Nearest neighbor distances are computed for each generated POSCAR file. The CrystalGAN generates 3D structures from binary hydrides, focusing on ternary compositions like \"Palladium -Hydrogen -Nickel\" and \"Magnesium -Hydrogen -Titanium\". Nearest neighbor distances are computed for each generated POSCAR file using geometric constraints and the Pymatgen library. Distances between atoms are fixed at specific values, and hyperparameters are set through cross-validation. The CrystalGAN architecture uses AdamOptimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001 and 1000 epochs. Mini-batch size is 35. Each block consists of a multi-layer neural network with 5 hidden layers of 100 units each, using ReLU activation function. Parameters were fixed through cross-validation for \"Palladium -Hydrogen\" and \"Nickel -Hydrogen\" domains. Implementation is in Python (TensorFlow) on a GPU with NVIDIA Quadro M5000. In numerical experiments, CrystalGAN outperforms classical GAN and DiscoGAN in generating ternary structures that satisfy geometric constraints. CrystalGAN with geometric constraints generates the most successful results compared to other methods. In chemistry, the number of novel stable compounds is limited, and success is achieved by synthesizing stable structures that meet constraints. Evaluation of stability is complex, requiring costly DFT calculations. CrystalGAN generates data for pre-selected ternary compositions for practical utility assessment. CrystalGAN is a novel approach in materials science that aims to generate new ternary crystallographic structures from observed binary compounds. It integrates prior knowledge from experts and has been successful in discovering new materials for hydrogen storage. The method utilizes GANs and elements of reinforcement learning to produce data of higher complexity. CrystalGAN, a method in materials science, uses GANs and reinforcement learning to generate complex data, such as compounds with four or five chemical elements. It can be adapted to various scientific problems beyond materials science."
