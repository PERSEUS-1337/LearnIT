Congress finds that the United States faces increasing competition from countries with large populations, and to maintain its global leadership, it should invest in STEM education, character development for youth, justice reinvestment, and medical research. Funding for these investments should come from revenue generated by acts against the public interest. Revenue generated by corporate and financial wrongdoing should be used to support programs in youth mentoring, justice reinvestment, and medical research. Congress recognized the work of organizations like Boys and Girls Clubs of America and Big Brothers Big Sisters of America in helping children succeed in American public life. Innovations in medical research and development benefit Americans by improving diagnosis and treatment of diseases, leading to longer and more productive lives. Organizations like Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, National CARES Mentoring Movement, and Girls Inc. support youth mentoring programs. Investments in medical research and development contribute to public health and productivity in America. State governments participating in the Justice Reinvestment Initiative have implemented cost-effective criminal justice reforms, reducing recidivism risks and providing alternatives to incarceration for non-violent offenders. A report suggests that states in the Initiative could save $3.3 billion over the next decade with additional funding enabling better implementation of these reforms. SEC. 3. AMERICA'S FOCUS FUND.
