    "content": "The \"Fair, Accurate, Secure, and Timely Redress Act of 2008\" or the \"FAST Redress Act of 2008\" establishes an appeal and redress process for passengers wrongly delayed or prohibited from boarding a flight, or denied a right, benefit, or privilege. The Secretary will establish a process for individuals who believe they were wrongly identified as a threat when screened against terrorist watchlists. An Office of Appeals and Redress will be established to implement this process. The Secretary will establish an Office with representatives from various Department offices to maintain a 'Comprehensive Cleared List' of individuals misidentified on terrorist watchlists, who completed an appeal and redress request. The Secretary will transmit the Comprehensive Cleared List and necessary information to resolve misidentifications for improved administration of the advanced passenger system. The Comprehensive Cleared List will be transmitted to various entities to improve the advanced passenger prescreening system and reduce false positives. This includes federal, state, local, and tribal entities, as well as domestic and foreign air carriers using terrorist watchlists. The list must be considered by all relevant offices for effective implementation. The Comprehensive Cleared List is transmitted to relevant entities for security risk assessment. The transmission to air carriers will end when the government takes over terrorist watchlist screening functions. Notification of termination must be given to Congress within 15 days. The Secretary may enter into agreements with other agencies to enhance the appeal process and verify identities. Termination of the transmission to air carriers for security risk assessment must be reported to Congress promptly. The Secretary may collaborate with other agencies to improve the redress process and verify identities. Employees handling personally identifiable information must undergo privacy and security training. The Secretary must ensure that personally identifiable information is secured through encryption and limit the collection of information to only what is necessary. Information must be shared through an encrypted network with strong security measures in place. The Department must ensure that security software functions properly, employees handle information according to relevant laws, retain information only as needed, and engage in cooperative agreements with Federal agencies. The Department must work with Federal agencies to update terrorist watchlists with legal name changes and improve the appeal process. A privacy impact assessment of the redress process must be conducted and published. The Office will provide information to air carrier passengers at airports on how to start the appeal and redress process. A Transportation Security Administration supervisor trained in appeal and redress processes is available at airports with a significant Department presence to assist air carrier passengers. The term 'terrorist watchlist or database' is defined in this section. Secure Flight is incorporated into the amendment of title 49, United States Code.
