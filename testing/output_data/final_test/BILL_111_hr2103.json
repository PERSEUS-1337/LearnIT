    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"International Protecting Girls by Preventing Child Marriage Act of 2009\". Child marriage, also known as forced or early marriage, deprives girls of their dignity and human rights. It is a violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which emphasizes free and full consent in marriage. An estimated 60 million girls in developing countries aged 20-24 were married before 18, with projections of over 100 million more in the next decade. Child marriage is a global issue that treats young girls as property and poses risks to their rights, health, independence, education, and societal status. A 2005 survey by the Department of State found child marriage to be prevalent in 64 out of 182 countries, with sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South Asia being most affected. In Ethiopia's Amhara region, half of girls are married by age 14, with alarming statistics regarding lack of knowledge about their husbands, unawareness of marriage, and early sexual initiation within marriage. Child marriage is prevalent in various countries, with factors like poverty, lack of opportunities for girls, parental concerns, dowry system, and devaluation of girls contributing to the issue. In some regions, a high percentage of girls are married off before the age of 18, with significant age gaps between them and their husbands. This practice has negative impacts on girls' health. Child marriage has detrimental effects on girls' health, increasing the risk of maternal death, morbidity, infant mortality, obstetric fistula, and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS. Girls aged 15 are five times more likely to die in childbirth than women in their 20s in developing countries. Child marriage can also lead to bonded labor, commercial sexual exploitation, and violence against the victims, as reported by UNICEF. Child marriage increases the risk of maternal death, morbidity, and infant mortality. Girls face pressure to withdraw from school due to costs and lack of facilities, leading to increased risk of sexual violence. In Mozambique, 60% of uneducated girls marry by 18, compared to 10% with secondary education. UNICEF reports that poor water and sanitation facilities contribute to girls dropping out of school in Sub-Saharan Africa. Investments in improving school sanitation led to increased school enrollment for girls in Guinea and Bangladesh. Strategies like investing in girls' schooling, creating safe spaces, and skills building programs help prevent child marriage and empower girls. Despite legal minimum age of marriage in most countries, strong traditional norms and lack of enforcement contribute to child marriage persistence. In Afghanistan, 57 percent of marriages involve girls below the legal age of 16, including those younger than 10 years old. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton condemns child marriage as a violation of human rights and child abuse. The sense of Congress is that child marriage is a violation of human rights and should be a foreign policy goal of the United States. Child marriage undermines investments in foreign assistance for education, health, and poverty reduction. Expanding educational and economic opportunities for girls is crucial for achieving global health and development goals, including efforts to prevent HIV/AIDS.

Expanding opportunities for girls is crucial for achieving global health and development goals. The President is authorized to provide assistance to prevent child marriage in developing countries, prioritizing regions with high rates of child marriage. This includes supporting successful community-based programs. The President is authorized to provide assistance to prevent child marriage in developing countries by establishing pilot projects, sharing successful program evaluations, and integrating assistance with existing programs for education, health, and human rights. To prevent child marriage in developing countries, assistance can be provided by enrolling girls in school at the appropriate age, reducing education fees, and creating safe and supportive conditions in schools. This includes access to water and hygiene facilities, female teachers, safe routes to school, and eliminating violence and coercion. Ensuring access to healthcare, nutrition, financial literacy, and education for adolescent girls is crucial in promoting gender equality and preventing child marriage. This includes providing training in livelihood skills, savings, microfinance, and small-enterprise development, as well as supporting education programs that challenge gender stereotypes and promote zero tolerance for violence. These efforts help increase the perceived value of girls and remove biases against them. Creating peer support and mentoring networks, safe social spaces, and legal literacy programs at the community level are essential in promoting gender equality and preventing child and forced marriage. SEC. 5. STRATEGY TO PREVENT CHILD MARRIAGE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. The President, through the Secretary of State, must establish a multi-year strategy to prevent child marriage in developing countries and empower at-risk girls under 18. This strategy should focus on high prevalence areas and involve diplomatic initiatives with governments, emphasizing human rights and legal reforms.
