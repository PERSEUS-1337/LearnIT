The \"Prescription Drug Price Monitoring Commission Act of 1998\" acknowledges the high cost of prescription drugs, especially for vulnerable populations, due to excessive price inflation. Between 1981 and 1998, prescription drug inflation rates were over 2.5 times higher than the general inflation rate, leading to significant out-of-pocket costs for the elderly. The pharmaceutical industry receives substantial subsidies from the Federal Government and taxpayers through tax incentives, write-offs, and grants. In 1994-95, the industry claimed over $6 billion in deductions for advertising and marketing. This statistic may not reflect current deductions due to changes in regulations since 1996. The Act of 1996 expanded deductible advertising costs for the pharmaceutical industry. The industry claimed $2,115,690,000 in tax credits for locating production facilities in US possessions. It is important to assess if Federal subsidies are efficiently used by the industry to develop new drugs. The \"Prescription Drug Price Monitoring Commission\" is established by the Act to monitor drug prices and assess the efficiency of Federal subsidies in developing new drugs. The Commission will conduct studies on the impact of a pharmaceutical price review board on drug costs, the use of tax credits and subsidies to influence pricing behavior, drug prices in other countries, and the feasibility of establishing a price review board in the US. The Commission will study the impact of a pharmaceutical price review board on drug costs, recommend how such a board might operate in the United States, suggest guidelines for determining excessive drug prices, and propose incentives for fair pricing by drug manufacturers. The Commission will submit annual reports to Congress on national and international drug policy issues, including trends in drug prices in the US and other countries. The curr_chunk discusses the availability, affordability, and use of prescription drugs in the United States, including coverage under federal programs like Medicare and Medicaid. It also considers the impact of changes in prescription drug use on government expenditures. The curr_chunk focuses on evaluating technologies for efficient prescription drug program administration, reimbursement methods for providers under Federal health care programs, and the use of tax credits and subsidies in the pharmaceutical industry. The Commission will submit a special report to relevant committees by October 1, 1999, on the study conducted regarding the evaluation of technologies for efficient prescription drug program administration, reimbursement methods for providers under Federal health care programs, and the use of tax credits in the pharmaceutical industry.

STUDY AND REPORT: A study on Federal subsidies and incentives for the pharmaceutical industry will be conducted.

This study will determine the total cost to Federal taxpayers over the past 5 fiscal years, the purposes of these subsidies, the Federal role in researching and developing patented pharmaceutical products, and the incorporation of pharmaceutical industry marketing research costs into allowable Federal tax. The study will analyze Federal subsidies and incentives for the pharmaceutical industry, including research costs in allowable tax credits, financial support comparisons with other nations, impact on drug prices, and the relationship between tax credits and research and development subsidies. The study will analyze Federal subsidies and incentives for the pharmaceutical industry, including research costs in allowable tax credits, financial support comparisons with other nations, impact on drug prices, and the relationship between tax credits and research and development subsidies.
