    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Civil Rights History Project Act of 2008\". Congress finds that individuals should stand up for their rights and beliefs, as demonstrated by the actions of those who participated in the Civil Rights movement. The movement had visible leaders like Thurgood Marshall, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Rosa Parks, but also many others whose impact was equally important. The Civil Rights movement participants hold valuable first-hand memories that should be recorded for future generations to learn from. A Federal project to collect oral histories would provide a detailed history of this important period and serve as a model for similar projects in the future. The purpose of this Act is to create a federally sponsored project to collect video and audio recordings of personal histories from individuals who participated in the American Civil Rights movement. The Library of Congress and the Smithsonian Institution will preserve and make these oral histories available to the public, serving as models for future projects in museums, libraries, and universities nationwide. The Act aims to support documentary work on the American Civil Rights movement by collecting personal histories to preserve the memories of individuals involved, allowing future generations to appreciate their sacrifices.
