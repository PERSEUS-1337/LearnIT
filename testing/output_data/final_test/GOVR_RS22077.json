    "content": "Unemployment Compensation (UC) is a joint federal-state program funded by federal and state taxes. The UC system is governed by the Social Security Act, with different titles authorizing grants to states, components of the federal Unemployment Trust Fund, and loans to insolvent state UC programs. If a state UC program follows federal rules, employers pay a 0.6% FUTA tax on the first $7,000 of each worker's earnings. This tax covers administrative costs, the Extended Benefit program, loans to insolvent state UC accounts, and state employment services. Federal law determines the jobs that must be covered by a state UC program for employers to comply. Federal law defines jobs covered by state UC programs to avoid maximum FUTA tax rate. A temporary FUTA surtax was first passed in 1976, with a 0.2% rate until 2011. Since then, the FUTA tax rate for employers is 0.6% on the first $7,000 of wages. States levy payroll taxes on employers for UC benefits. SUTA tax rates are based on UC benefits paid, with a maximum set by state law. The UTF is a trust fund in the U.S. Treasury for federal accounting purposes. The UTF is a trust fund in the U.S. Treasury that directly links revenues and distributions for UC programs. It includes various accounts such as ESAA, EUCA, FUA, state accounts, FECA, and accounts related to the Railroad Retirement Board. Federal and state unemployment taxes are credited to specific accounts for UC administration grants and benefits. The EB program is typically funded 50% by the federal government and 50% by states, but there have been temporary changes in funding percentages. The Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF) in the U.S. Treasury directly links revenues and distributions for UC programs. It contains 59 separate accounts for program purposes, allowing surplus spending authority to carry over to subsequent years. During recessions, the reserve spending authority is used when UC outlays exceed tax revenues. The Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF) in the U.S. Treasury is a bookkeeping entry where all UC tax receipts and outlays flow through, affecting federal revenue and the overall financial position. It accumulates legal spending authority but does not contain financial resources, requiring cash from current resources through taxation or borrowing. Federal unemployment taxes are deposited into the trust fund, and all receipts are invested by the Treasury as per federal law. The Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF) in the U.S. Treasury accumulates federal unemployment taxes and state unemployment taxes, which are invested in federal securities. These investments increase the federal debt and are redeemed to pay for administration of the program, lend funds to states, or pay for extended benefits. When states pay UC benefits to unemployed individuals, the Treasury redeems securities held within the state's UTF account, decreasing the federal debt. States can borrow funds from the UTF if they do not have enough reserves. The Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF) allows states to borrow funds from the Federal Unemployment Account (FUA) within the UTF. If the FUA is insolvent, it can borrow funds from the Treasury, increasing the federal debt. Repayment of state loans to the FUA decreases the federal debt. The UTF is funded by state and federal unemployment taxes and U.S. revenues. The Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF) is funded by state and federal unemployment taxes, U.S. government agency transfers, and federal income tax on UC benefits. States can use these funds for UC benefits and administrative costs. In FY2016, states collected $40.9 billion and spent $32.3 billion on UC benefits. In FY2016, the Secretary of Labor certified administrative payments from the ESAA for states' unemployment compensation program costs. The net monthly activity in federal accounts by the end of FY2016 was $4.8 billion. By the end of FY2016, federal accounts collected $4.8 billion, with the ESAA having a net balance of $2.1 billion. $0.4 billion in excess funds from the ESAA were transferred to the EUCA. The ESAA distributed $4.1 billion to states for administrative costs. EUCA distributions are made for the federal portion if states have an active EB program. The EUCA balance is limited to $750 million or 0.5% of covered wages. Any excess is distributed to the FUA. No funds were expended for the federal share of EB benefits in FY2016 as no state met the economic criteria. The EUCA net balance was a shortfall of $11.0 billion. At the end of FY2016, the FUA had a shortfall of $11.0 billion, with $8.7 billion owed to the Treasury and $3.5 billion owed to FUA/ESAA. FUA funds are distributed as loans to states through state unemployment accounts, with a maximum balance of $550 million or 0.5% of covered wages. The estimated net FUA balance was $8.2 billion, with $4.5 billion borrowed by states and $3.5 billion owed from ESAA/EUCA. The ESAA/EUCA had a year-end cash balance of $0.14 billion, below the $28.8 billion ceiling, so no Reed Act distribution occurred. Distributions are made to state unemployment accounts from the FECA to reimburse states for employment compensation. There are limitations on the balance in the ESAA, with excess amounts distributed to EUCA and then FUA. If FUA balance exceeds the limit, excess is distributed to states as a Reed Act distribution. During the most recent recession, state unemployment accounts required loans to cover UC benefits. States can borrow from the FUA, but if they don't increase SUTA taxes to repay the loan, federal tax credits for SUTA taxes are reduced to repay the principal. Interest on the loans must be paid from state general revenues. During the recession, state unemployment accounts needed loans to cover benefits. States can borrow from the FUA, with interest paid from state revenues. If borrowing needs exceed FUA balance, Congress can appropriate additional funds. From FY2009 to FY2015, FUA borrowed from Treasury to loan to states."
