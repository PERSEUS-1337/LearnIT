    "content": "The \"Partnership for Professional Renewal Act of 1997\" amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to establish a program that aims to provide training for teachers in public schools and opportunities for professional development for school faculty. It also encourages community involvement in public education by utilizing various resources such as students' homes, local neighborhoods, businesses, and community organizations. The Partnership for Professional Renewal Act of 1997 requires institutions of higher education to submit an application with a plan for a program providing training and support for teachers. The plan must include details on selecting schools for participation and the duration of teacher assignments in classrooms. The Partnership for Professional Renewal Act of 1997 outlines the formation of consortia involving various stakeholders like higher education faculty, school faculty, parents, technology experts, administration, businesses, and community leaders. These consortia collaborate on developing program objectives and promoting community involvement in education. The Partnership for Professional Renewal Act of 1997 emphasizes collaboration between postsecondary faculty and classroom teachers to enhance teacher training. It also highlights the importance of academic resources for professional development and sharing knowledge among teachers and students. The Secretary will establish selection criteria for grant applications under the Partnership for Professional Renewal Act of 1997. Criteria will focus on fulfilling program purposes, geographic and institutional diversity, assigning teachers to classrooms for extended periods, and meeting specific requirements outlined in the legislation. Funds received under a grant can be used for hiring an administrative officer, advertising the program, developing curriculum, providing supplies and staff, funding educational technology opportunities, offering professional development, and other purposes approved by the Secretary. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal year 1998 and the following 4 years is granted to carry out the program."
