    "content": "The federal government supported the development of railroads in the West through various forms of assistance, including granting rights of way across public lands. As rail lines were sold or closed, issues regarding title and Congress's authority to dispose of rail corridors arose. This report discusses the history of federal railroad rights of way grants and the laws governing their disposition. Legislation was passed to support the construction of railroads in America, driven by factors like the discovery of gold in California, the Civil War, and the desire to develop new territories. Federal assistance, including land grants and financial support, was necessary for building transcontinental rail lines. Land grants were given to states or directly to railroad corporations to facilitate the completion of rail segments. Several transcontinental railroads were authorized in a ten-year period, including the Union Pacific/Central Pacific, Northern Pacific, Atlantic and Pacific, and Texas Pacific. These railroads received land grants in a \"checkerboard\" layout to finance their construction and increase the value of government-retained lands. Other non-transcontinental railroads also received federal assistance. By 1871, opposition to railroads grew as they were slow in selling lands, leading to hostility and a halt in congressional land grants. Congress still aimed to support railroad expansion, passing special acts for right of way through public lands, but this approach was cumbersome. In 1875, the \"General\" statute was enacted to address these issues. In 1875, Congress enacted the \"General Railway Right of Way Act (GRRWA)\" granting a right of way two hundred feet wide across public lands to railroad companies for construction and material acquisition. Railroads acquired rights of way for station buildings, depots, and other facilities through various means, including state and federal eminent domain powers or direct purchase. The scope and conditions of the title obtained depended on the specific authority and condemnation proceedings. This report does not cover privately-owned railroad rights of way. The report discusses railroad rights of way granted by the federal government, either as part of a land grant or under the 1875 right of way statute. The courts have interpreted these rights in various ways, making it difficult to reconcile congressional enactments and judicial holdings. The Supreme Court has differentiated between pre-1871 rights of way as a \"limited fee\" and those granted under the 1875 statute as an easement. Recent cases suggest that the terminology used may not be crucial, with the context being more important. The significance of terms used in property law depends on the context of the inquiry. The \"rail banking\" provisions of the Rails to Trails Act have raised questions about the nature of right of way interests and Congress's authority over rail corridors. Recent cases have addressed whether the banking of rail corridors constitutes a taking of private property, requiring compensation under the 5th Amendment. Land grants and conveyances to private citizens by Congress to encourage settlement of the West have also been a focus of legal scrutiny. In property law, the interest conveyed can range from fee simple to easement, depending on the rights granted. A right of way interest may include a reversionary interest for the grantor. Fee grants can be structured to last only as long as a specific use or circumstance persists. A fee grant may be made to last only as long as a specific use or circumstance continues, reverting automatically to the grantor once it ceases. This type of grant is known as a determinable grant or a grant on a condition subsequent. These are considered \"limited fees\" as they are less than full fee title. The key difference between the two is that in a determinable grant, title reverts automatically by law, while in a grant on a condition subsequent, the grantor must take action to reassert title upon the breach or fulfillment of the condition. When a grant on a condition subsequent is breached or fulfilled, a judicial proceeding is usually required to determine if the conditions have been met. If a right of way is a mere easement, it disappears when the easement use ceases. Congress has the power to dispose of property and make rules regarding it, allowing for different terms than usual property grants. Congress can specify terms different from common law in railroad grants. A grant can be a property interest and a contractual agreement. The Supreme Court ruled in Schulenberg v. Harriman that a legislative grant is a transfer of property with the force intended by the legislature. The court found that railroad interests granted were a fee on condition, breach enforceable only by the government. The Supreme Court distinguished between common law and congressional property interests, stating that breach enforcement is the government's responsibility. A case interpreted a land grant railroad right of way as a limited fee with an implied condition of reverter. The Court emphasized that no express provision for forfeiture was necessary to fix the Government's rights. The Supreme Court ruled that in cases involving land grants for railroad right of ways, no express words of forfeiture are needed for the grantor to reenter in case of breach. Congress approved a general railroad right of way grant in 1875, granting only a surface easement rather than the strip of land right of way. The Supreme Court ruled that in cases involving land grants for railroad right of ways, no express words of forfeiture are needed for the grantor to reenter in case of breach. The Court looked to other language of GRRWA, administrative interpretations, and subsequent enactments by Congress referring to \"easements\" given by the 1875 Act. Congress granted a surface easement rather than a strip of land right of way. The Court pointed to \u00a7 4 of the Act as persuasive, stating that all lands over which the right of way passes shall be disposed of subject to the right of way. The intent to convey an easement was clear. In Great Northern, the United States sued to enjoin a railway company from drilling for oil and gas beneath a right of way. The court allowed a stipulation that the United States retained title to certain tracts of land over which the right of way passes, avoiding resolution of issues involving adjacent landowners or Congress's retained authority. In another case, the Supreme Court ruled that a right of way grant to a railroad company did not include mineral rights due to language in the Act excepting out mineral lands. The Supreme Court ruled that a right of way grant to a railroad company did not include mineral rights due to specific language in the Act. The Court held that the grant only conveyed surface rights and rights incident to railroad purposes, not mineral rights. The Court suggested that all railroad rights of way were easements. The court strongly suggested that railroad rights of way are easements, conditioned on continued use for railroad purposes. Congress authorized railroads to convey parts of their rights of way for highway use, ensuring the conveyance does not diminish the right of way to less than 100 feet. Railroad companies granted rights of way through public lands can convey portions for public highways or streets, as long as the width of the right of way remains at least 50 feet on each side of the main track. The Federal Highway Act of 1921 allowed railroads to transfer property to state highway departments without specifying the need to retain the central right of way. The Federal Highway Act of 1921 amended the requirement for the width of the retained central core in railroad rights of way. If a railroad is legally abandoned, the public highway exception allows for the abandoned portion to be used for a public highway within one year. The Supreme Court ruled that a federal right of way cannot be obtained for private purposes through adverse possession. Congress determined that a 400-foot wide strip was necessary for public work, and courts cannot adjudicate otherwise in favor of private parties. Despite limitations on the alienability of federal rights of way, railroads still conveyed and adjacent landowners encroached upon rights of way. Congress legislated to legitimize conveyances and activities, asserting its authority to dispose of rail corridors. Validation statutes involved limited fee grants with a reversionary interest in the federal government. Congress has enacted statutes for over a century referring to the reversionary interest of the United States in rights of way no longer used for railroad purposes. This view has not been prominent in judicial decisions. The 1922 statute provides for the disposition of lands granted to railroad companies, stating that upon forfeiture or abandonment, the lands would pass to a municipality. The 1922 statute dictates that if public lands granted to a railroad company for a right of way cease to be used for railroad purposes, the lands would pass to a municipality or adjacent landowners, except for areas designated as public highways within one year of abandonment. The 1922 statute allows for the transfer of railroad lands to municipalities or adjacent landowners if they are not used for railroad purposes within one year of abandonment, except for areas designated as public highways. The 1922 statute allows for the transfer of railroad lands to municipalities or adjacent landowners if they are not used for railroad purposes within one year of abandonment, except for areas designated as public highways. This statute validates and confirms grants of lands for railroad rights of way before March 8, 1922, with reservations for the United States of oil, gas, and minerals in the transferred land. Abandonment of railroad rights of way requires a declaration by a court or Congress, with uncertainty on what constitutes abandonment. The definition of abandonment in relation to railroad rights of way remains uncertain, with no clear definition provided in statutes or court decisions. Courts often refer to common law principles, requiring a present intent to abandon along with physical actions like ceasing tax payments, discontinuing services, and removing tracks. However, specific requirements vary among different circuits, with a key point of contention being the validity of abandonment determinations by the Interstate Commerce Commission or the Surface Transportation Board. The definition of abandonment in relation to railroad rights of way is uncertain, with courts requiring a present intent to abandon along with physical actions like ceasing tax payments and removing tracks. The Tenth Circuit deems an Interstate Commerce Commission or Surface Transportation Board determination necessary for abandonment, while the Ninth Circuit may not always require it. Vieux v. East Bay Regional Park District states that a railroad could abandon without ICC involvement if a court decrees abandonment. Section 912 also established a public highway exception for state or local agencies. State or local agencies have the right to include abandoned railroad right of ways in public highways within one year of abandonment, eliminating other title claims. The committee report emphasizes the value of these abandoned strips for establishing highways and suggests amendments to safeguard public interest in road establishment. The committee report suggests amendments to safeguard public interest in road establishment, allowing state or local agencies to include abandoned railroad rights of way in public highways within one year of abandonment. Congress believed it retained the authority to provide for the disposition of railroad rights of way, including reversionary interests and adjacent landowners' rights. Congress believed it had the authority to provide for the disposition of railroad rights of way, whether due to traditional property interests or retained authority over termination of grants. The one-year window for establishing highways in abandoned rail corridors suggests Congress could deviate from common law property rights. Congress has established a National Trails System to designate and manage a system of national trails, including banking railroad rights of way for possible future use and interim recreation. This is highlighted by recent cases involving Rails to Trails litigation. The \"Rails to Trails\" provisions were enacted to preserve rail corridors for potential future railroad use by allowing negotiations with entities to convert them into trails, avoiding abandonment status. The 1988 amendment (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1248(c)) allows the federal government to retain all interests in railroad rights of way, even after abandonment or forfeiture. This change ensures that all federal interests in federally-granted rail corridors are retained by the United States instead of passing to adjacent entities. The 1988 amendment (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1248(c)) allows the federal government to retain all interests in railroad rights of way, even after abandonment or forfeiture. Section 1248(c) confirms the continuing force of the 1922 Act, specifically reinforcing the vitality of \u00a7912 public highway exception. Courts have recognized \u00a7912 as long as it does not conflict with section 1248(c). Cases post-Rails to Trails have examined whether retaining non-operating railroad rights of way for recreational trails constitutes a taking under the 5th Amendment. The Supreme Court in Preseault held that the law was constitutional, providing a compensation avenue under the \"Tucker Act.\" Subsequent cases found compensable takings had occurred. The Preseault cases involved private fee-title landowners whose predecessors had sold an easement for railroad purposes to a railroad. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit decided that use of the right of way for recreational purposes constituted a compensable taking. Federal rights of way post-1988 statutory change concluded that the federal government retained an implied interest in lands crossed by federal railroad easements into private ownership. In the Hash case, landowners challenged the conversion of a railroad right of way to a recreational trail, arguing that they were entitled to compensation under the Trails Act. The federal district court found no taking, but the decision was vacated and remanded in light of an Idaho Supreme Court decision. The landowners claimed that the application of the Trails Act prevented the railroad easement from reverting to them. The Hash case involved landowners disputing the conversion of a railroad right of way to a recreational trail, claiming compensation under the Trails Act. The court had to determine if the federal right of way was an easement and if subsequent landowners took ownership subject to the right of way. The court noted that previous cases held the 1875 statute granted only easements and that settlers took lands subject to the railroad right of way. The court in the Hash case determined that settlers took lands subject to the railroad right of way, which was considered an easement. There was no indication that the United States retained the fee to the land underlying the right of way when granting land to homesteaders. The court also found that language directing railroads to share rights of way with highways did not imply the retention of the fee by the United States. Additionally, the court concluded that highways within the right of way did not weaken the position of landowners as long as the rights of the United States were conveyed to the private owner. The court in the Hash case determined that settlers took lands subject to the railroad right of way, which was considered an easement. The court concluded that highways within the right of way did not weaken the position of landowners as long as the rights of the United States were conveyed to the private owner. Congress has repeatedly enacted statutes premised on some legislative or proprietary interest over termination of the rights of way. The statute directs that all right, title, and interest of the United States be conveyed, except for highways within the year after abandonment. The Beres case involved an 1875 right of way where the Court of Federal Claims held that the right of way granted only an easement. When the right of way was no longer used for railroad purposes, the easement was lifted and no property interest reverted to the United States. The government argued that the United States had retained some interest. The government in Beres argued that the United States retained an interest in the railroad rights of way, citing federal statutes rather than common law principles. Congress affirmed this understanding in the 1922 Act, stating that the US had a reversionary interest in the rights of way even after the land had been patented. The court debated whether the 1988 legislation could retroactively affect land rights transferred years earlier. The court noted that the 1875 Act did not explicitly create a reversionary right in the United States, especially considering the 1922 Act clarified the issue. Arguments were made that the court's reasoning missed the mark as the question of transferred land rights from years earlier was crucial. Congress may have had the authority to dispose of rights of way differently from common law under the Constitution. This authority could explain Congress' consistent enactments regarding its \"reversionary interest\" in rights of way. Congress may have had the authority to dispose of rights of way differently from common law under the Constitution, as indicated by committee reports on its \"reversionary interest\" in rights of way. The courts should focus on Congress' intent from decades of enactments rather than contradictory property/title words. The government's \"navigational servitude\" allows for the taking of private property without compensation under the 5th Amendment. This concept is based on the idea that property damage resulting from this power is not subject to compensation because it is a background principle applicable to all property titles. The government's power to control the disposal of federal rights of way is tied to the property rights of railroads and homesteaders. If Congress changes the disposition of lands before private title fully vests, no compensation may be owed. Congress must clearly surrender this authority, as waivers must be explicit. This contrasts with the navigational servitude, where waivers must be unmistakable. The legal status of land within railroad rights of way depends on various factors, including the interest held by the railroad or landowner, applicable statutes, and conveyances. Congress has legislated on this issue over the last century, but controversies may still arise due to questions about Congress' authority and the nature of railroad interests. The legal status of land within railroad rights of way is influenced by Congress' authority and the nature of the railroad's interest. Disputes may arise over conveyances, abandonment dates, and compensation owed. Congress has legitimized conveyances and permitted certain types of conveyances in the past. The conversion of federal rail corridors to recreational use under the Rails to Trails legislation may lead to further litigation between the United States and adjacent landowners."
