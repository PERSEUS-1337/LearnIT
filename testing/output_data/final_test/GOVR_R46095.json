    "content": "Congress is considering legislation for a long-term reauthorization of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), managed by FEMA. The NFIP offers primary flood insurance and aims to reduce flood risk through floodplain management standards. The program's last long-term reauthorization was in 2012, and it is currently authorized until September 30, 2020. The NFIP is the main source of flood insurance for residential properties in the US, with over 5 million policies and $1.3 trillion in coverage. It generates $4.6 billion in annual revenue and involves 22,000 communities. The program saves $1.87 billion annually in flood losses and is crucial for managing floods, the most common natural disaster in the US. Since May 2018, various U.S. territories have faced flood events, with significant flood losses in recent years. The NFIP, the main flood insurance source in the US, plays a crucial role in managing floods, which are the most common natural disaster in the country. The program does not have a comprehensive expiration clause but relies on different legal provisions tied to key components. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) faces expiration of key components after September 30, 2020, unless reauthorized by Congress. This includes the authority to provide new flood insurance contracts and borrowing funds from the Treasury. The House Financial Services Committee has proposed a bill for long-term reauthorization (H.R. 3167) to address these issues. The Flood Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019 (H.R. 3167) was reported on October 28, 2019, and would reauthorize the NFIP until September 30, 2024. A Senate bill (S. 2187) and a House companion bill (H.R. 3872) have also been introduced to reauthorize the NFIP. These bills aim to make significant changes to the NFIP, but have not yet been considered by committees. The NFIP is undergoing significant changes to address issues identified by the GAO, including outstanding debt, premium rates, affordability, consumer participation, barriers to private sector involvement, and flood resilience efforts. The program aims to provide flood insurance in flood-prone areas and reduce government costs after floods. The NFIP aims to provide flood insurance in flood-prone areas, assist owners in obtaining insurance, reduce government costs after floods, and engage in non-insurance activities for public interest. These activities include disseminating flood risk information, requiring communities to adopt building standards, contributing to community resilience, and protecting lending institutions against mortgage defaults. The program has multiple objectives, some of which may conflict with each other. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) aims to have risk-based premiums, secure community participation, and earn income to cover expenses. Congress passed a reauthorization bill in December 2018 to prevent a lapse in the NFIP during a government shutdown. FEMA announced changes to NFIP operations during the shutdown, instructing Write-Your-Own (WYO) companies to suspend sales operations. Following the reauthorization of the NFIP, FEMA rescinded guidance that WYO companies were entitled to a fee from flood insurance policies. Legislation includes provisions to reduce the impact of future government shutdowns on NFIP operations, allowing for continuous operation during lapses in appropriations. The NFIP faces challenges in balancing affordability and fiscal solvency, with premiums not fully reflecting the risk of loss. Various administrations and Congresses have different priorities for premium setting, making reform difficult. The NFIP struggles to balance affordability and fiscal solvency due to legislative requirements exacerbating fiscal exposure. Congress directed FEMA to provide subsidized premium rates without funding, leading to borrowing from the U.S. Treasury. Enacting changes unrelated to program extension could increase spending by $678 million over 2020-2029. As of June 2019, written premiums totaled $3.5 billion with additional fees. Maximum coverage for single-family dwellings is $100,000 for contents and up to $250,000 for buildings. The NFIP offers maximum coverage limits for different types of buildings, with fees and surcharges included in premiums. The Federal Policy Fee helps cover administrative expenses, set by FEMA and can vary yearly. A reserve fund assessment was authorized by Congress in BW-12. FEMA is required to maintain a reserve fund to cover future claim and debt expenses, with a target reserve ratio of 1% of total loss exposure. As of June 2019, approximately $13.16 billion was required for the reserve fund ratio. The reserve fund assessment has increased to 15% of the premium for all NFIP policies since April 2016. FEMA requires a reserve fund to cover future claim and debt expenses, with a target ratio of 1% of total loss exposure. The reserve fund assessment is now 15% of the premium for all NFIP policies. A surcharge is also applied based on property type, with primary residences charged $25 and others $250. Revenues from the surcharge go into the reserve fund. FEMA started a 5% premium on severe repetitive loss properties in April 2019. An additional surcharge may be imposed on communities in NFIP probation. The NFIP may impose a probation surcharge on communities in probation, charging all policyholders $50 for a year. Flood insurance rates are based on risk and actuarial principles, but certain properties receive discounts to make insurance affordable. Three main categories pay less than full risk-based rates, including Pre-FIRM properties built before December 31, 1974. Pre-FIRM structures, built before December 31, 1974, or before FEMA's first Flood Insurance Rate Map, receive lower premiums to help with predicted claims. This subsidy allows properties to contribute to their recovery from floods. Around 13% of NFIP policies have this subsidy as of September 2018. BW-12 phased out most subsidized premiums, reducing the percentage of pre-FIRM policies in the total policy base. The BW-12 phased out most subsidized insurance premiums, increasing rates on certain properties by 25% per year until full-risk rates were reached. Subsidies were eliminated immediately for properties with lapsed policies, those who refused mitigation assistance, and properties purchased after July 6, 2012. Properties not phased out were required to start paying actuarial rates after five years, phased in at 20% per year following a revised FIRM issuance. Subsidies on pre-FIRM properties would be eliminated within five years of a new FIRM issuance. HFIAA, enacted in response to concerns over rate increases from BW-12, reinstated premium discounts and slowed down some rate increases. It repealed the property-sale trigger for full-risk rates and slowed the phaseout of pre-FIRM subsidies for primary residences. The phaseout for all primary residences was set at 5%-18% annually, while other property categories retained a 25% annual phaseout. HFIAA established a new subsidy for properties newly mapped into a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) on or after April 1, 2015. The rate for eligible properties is initially equal to the PRP rate with a higher Federal Policy Fee for the first 12 months. After the first year, the rate transitions to a full-risk rate with annual increases calculated using a multiplier. As of September 2018, about 4% of NFIP policies receive this subsidy. FEMA has the authority to set rate classes and offer lower premiums for properties built in compliance with regulations. FEMA allows properties built in compliance with the FIRM to maintain their old flood insurance rate class when remapped, known as \"grandfathering.\" This is not considered a subsidy as the discount is offset by other policyholders. Congress eliminated grandfathering for policyholders after new maps were issued in BW-12. FEMA reinstated grandfathering in HFIAA, allowing grandfathered status to be passed on to new owners. About 9% of NFIP policies were grandfathered as of September 2018. FEMA is introducing Risk Rating 2.0 for flood insurance premiums, the biggest change since NFIP's inception. New rates are set to start on October 1, 2021. NFIP's current rating structure has not changed significantly since the 1970s, using a nationwide system that may not reflect individual flood risk factors. The FEMA models expected losses for groups of structures with similar flood risk and key structural aspects, charging the same rate per $100 of insurance for properties in the same NFIP risk category, regardless of location or topography. The premium calculation considers flood zone, building occupancy type, foundation type, and pre-FIRM or post-FIRM status. The NFIP premiums under Risk Rating 2.0 will reflect individual property flood risk by considering factors such as foundation type, pre-FIRM or post-FIRM status, property elevation relative to BFE, coverage amount, deductible, and a broader range of flood frequencies and sources including pluvial flooding, urban flooding, and coastal erosion. Geographical variables will also be used in Risk Rating 2.0 to determine premiums. The Risk Rating 2.0 system will consider geographical variables such as distance to water, elevation, and stream order, as well as structural variables like foundation type and replacement cost value. Premiums may vary based on these factors, with properties at the landward boundary potentially seeing lower premiums. NFIP premium rates will now be based on individual property flood risk factors, including coverage amount and deductible, rather than just the amount of insurance purchased. The NFIP currently classifies the first $60,000 of building coverage for single-family residences ($175,000 for businesses) and $25,000 of contents coverage as the basic limit. Rates for additional coverage above the basic limit are lower, with a two-tiered rating structure used to account for tendency to buy less insurance than the replacement value. The NFIP uses a two-tiered rating structure to ensure premiums cover typical claims and encourage full insurance coverage. Inequity arose as replacement values increased, with structures closer to the $60,000 limit paying more. Structures with values closer to the $60,000 limit pay more due to the lower additional rate, while those above the $250,000 cap pay less. High-valued structures can result in higher claims. If replacement cost value is used for NFIP premium rates, structures with higher replacement costs may pay more, and those below average may pay less. The extent of these changes is uncertain. Risk Rating 2.0 will not exceed annual premium increase caps set by statute. Primary residences face 5%-18% yearly rate limits, while individual properties can increase by up to 18%. Rate class increases are capped at 15% annually. Certain property categories must see a 25% yearly premium increase until reaching full risk-based rates. FEMA excludes some NFIP payments from premium calculations subject to caps. When calculating premium rates for compliance with statutory caps, FEMA only includes specific coverages and assessments. Other fees and surcharges are not subject to premium cap limitations. The current categories of properties paying less than full risk-based rates are determined by the structure's build date relative to the FIRM adoption date, not flood risk or policyholder ability to pay. This approach will remain unchanged with Risk Rating 2.0, as subsidies will be phased out based on flood risk. The shift towards actuarially sound rates aims to make the NFIP more financially sustainable. The move towards actuarially sound rates in the NFIP aims to improve financial sustainability and provide clearer flood risk understanding to policyholders. Repealing the HFIAA surcharge could decrease policyholder costs, but may lead to affordability issues for some properties. This change would not affect premium rate increases under Risk Rating 2.0. Section 104 authorizes monthly installment payments for NFIP premiums, with a maximum fee of $25 per year in the first year. Section 304 allows cooperative building owners to purchase flood insurance like condominium owners. Section 402 permits FEMA to offer umbrella policies for multiple structures on one property, making flood insurance more accessible. Section 102 prohibits FEMA from increasing covered costs by more than 9% per year for five years. Section 102 of the NFIP reform bill limits premium increases to 9% per year for five years, covering various costs including premiums, surcharges, and the Federal Policy Fee. This cap could impact policies with phased-out subsidies and potentially hinder FEMA's ability to implement rate increases under Risk Rating 2.0. Additionally, the bill would exclude catastrophic loss years from premium calculations, likely reducing premiums for all policyholders. Section 104 allows for monthly installment payments of NFIP premiums instead of annual payments. Section 106 allows cooperative building owners to purchase flood insurance under NFIP like condominium owners. Section 107 sets baseline amounts for mortgage purchases by Fannie Mae, with contents coverage limits at 50% of the baseline amount. Coverage limits for single-family dwellings are set at the baseline amount, while other properties are set at 200% of the baseline amount. The NFIP proposes increasing coverage limits for buildings and contents insurance, with a larger increase in high-cost areas. Premiums would rise by 25% annually for properties where policyholders reject mitigation assistance until they accept it or the risk premium is actuarially sound. The NFIP's funding comes from premiums, appropriations, and borrowing from the U.S. Treasury when needed. The NFIP's funding comes from premiums, appropriations, and borrowing from the U.S. Treasury when needed. Premiums are transferred to FEMA and deposited in the NFIF, with Congress authorizing FEMA to withdraw funds for NFIP operations. Fluctuating levels of mandatory spending occur to pay and adjust claims on affected NFIP policies, with the program able to borrow money from the Treasury for extreme events. The NFIP covers its costs by borrowing from the U.S. Treasury, with a borrowing limit of $30.425 billion. The debt is not tied to specific incidents but was heavily borrowed after catastrophic flood seasons in 2005, 2012, and 2017. In 2017, the NFIP reached its $30.425 billion borrowing limit due to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Congress cancelled $16 billion of NFIP debt to help cover claims. FEMA borrowed an additional $6.1 billion for losses, bringing the total debt to $20.525 billion. The NFIP has $9.9 billion in remaining borrowing authority and did not need to borrow for the 2018 hurricane season or other floods. The NFIP borrowed funds to pay claims for the 2018 hurricane season. Current and future participants are responsible for repaying NFIP debt, which includes principal repayments and interest. The NFIP is currently paying $375-$400 million a year in interest, which GAO argues is contrary to actuarial principles. The NFIP debt, totaling $16 billion, was cancelled in October 2017, marking the first time this has occurred. GAO suggested eliminating FEMA's debt to the Treasury to reallocate funds for other purposes and ensure fairness for current policyholders. This would require Congress to cancel the debt outright, appropriate funds for repayment, or change the law. The NFIP debt of $16 billion was cancelled in October 2017, a first-time occurrence. FEMA submitted a report to Congress in May 2018 on repaying the debt within 10 years, but it is unlikely to be fully repaid. Rising interest rates could hinder debt repayment, especially in low-loss years. No projections account for the cancelled debt or claims from the 2017 hurricane season. The NFIP debt of $16 billion was cancelled in October 2017, but since 2005, more resources have been devoted to interest payments than repaying the debt. Section 301 proposes freezing interest accrual on the NFIP's debt for five years and using the saved interest for flood mitigation grants. Increasing flood insurance policy purchases has been a long-standing NFIP objective. The Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 introduced the mandatory purchase requirement for flood insurance as a condition of receiving a federally backed mortgage in SFHAs. Property owners in mapped SFHAs must purchase flood insurance for federally backed mortgages. Compliance rates are not officially reported by federal mortgage regulators. The mandatory purchase requirement for flood insurance introduced in 1973 mandates property owners in SFHAs to buy flood insurance for federally backed mortgages. Compliance rates vary by region, with rates as low as 43% in the Midwest and as high as 88% in the West. A study in New York City showed an increase in compliance from 61% in 2012 to 73% in 2016. Escrowing insurance premiums since 2016 may further boost compliance. Section 103 proposes raising the minimum loan amount triggering the requirement to $25,000. Loans under $5,000 or with a repayment term under one year are currently exempt. Section 408 and Section 108 of the proposal would require the GAO to determine the percentages of properties with federally backed mortgages in SFHAs and the 500-year floodplain that satisfy the mandatory purchase requirement for flood insurance. This could potentially allow homeowners and businesses to drop their flood insurance earlier than currently possible. The GAO and NFIP reports suggest expanding the mandatory purchase requirement for flood insurance to more mortgage loans, increasing consumer participation in the NFIP. Private insurers believe this mandate could help diversify their flood insurance portfolios and address concerns about adverse selection. The NFIP policies are concentrated in a few states, with Florida having the highest percentage. Participation rates are higher in coastal areas and mandatory purchase requirements contribute to this. To improve financially, NFIP should diversify its policy base geographically and increase coverage in lower-risk areas. FEMA recognizes the need to boost flood insurance participation. FEMA aims to double flood insurance coverage by 2023 through increased sale of NFIP and private policies. GAO will conduct studies on increasing participation rates through programmatic and regulatory changes. Concerns exist regarding flood insurance affordability and balancing actuarial soundness with NFIP goals. The NFIP faces challenges in balancing actuarial soundness with affordability of flood insurance premiums. Studies have been conducted to assess the affordability of premiums for households, with no clear objective definitions established. The NRC report suggested eligibility criteria for government assistance to address affordability of flood insurance, including being cost-burdened by insurance, loss of subsidies, housing tenure, income, and mitigation. Key questions for Congress or FEMA include who will receive assistance, what assistance will be provided, and how it will be administered. Policy measures to reduce premium burden and direct mitigation assistance towards qualifying households include means-tested grants, loans, vouchers, tax deductions, disaster savings accounts, and expanding individual mitigation measures. Policymakers must decide how to define cost burden and consider affordability programs to encourage consumer participation. The text suggests that an affordability program should provide means-tested assistance through appropriations rather than discounted premiums to encourage consumer participation and promote resilience. This approach would make premium assistance more transparent and open to oversight by Congress and the public, ensuring that only those who cannot afford full-risk rates receive assistance. The GAO estimated that a significant percentage of policyholders could be eligible for subsidies based on income levels. They suggested providing assistance for mitigation measures to reduce flood risk, which would lower premium rates and federal fiscal exposure. Congress also required FEMA to develop an Affordability Framework to address flood insurance affordability issues. FEMA published its Affordability Framework on April 17, 2018, defining affordability based on cost burden or ability to pay perspective. They analyzed the 2015 NFIP portfolio of 4.8 million policies, focusing on residential policies, particularly single-family homes. Data from the American Community Survey was used to assess affordability for those living in Special Flood Hazard Areas. The study analyzed income differences between those living inside and outside Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) using NFIP and census data. They found that generally incomes are higher outside the SFHA, with median income higher for policyholders and non-policyholders exposed to coastal risk. However, income differences by flood risk source were not significant compared to differences between mortgage holders, outright homeowners, and renters. The data supported FEMA's evidence of a significant population in SFHA of lower-income families sensitive to flood insurance costs. FEMA lacks authority and funding for an affordability program, which could be funded through NFIP funds or congressional appropriations. Section 102 proposes a five-year affordability demonstration program for means-tested discounted rates on NFIP policies. The proposed legislation aims to provide discounted premium rates for NFIP policies to owner-occupants of residences with no more than four units, whose income does not exceed 80% of the area median income. FEMA would need to issue guidance for the program within 12 months of enactment and submit a report to Congress within five years of implementation. The proposed legislation requires FEMA to evaluate the effectiveness of a program offering discounted NFIP premium rates based on income levels. The report to Congress must include participation rates, cost estimates, and potential benefits for low-income areas. For example, households in areas where 2% of the AMI exceeds the average premium may not benefit from the provision. The proposed legislation requires FEMA to evaluate a program offering discounted NFIP premium rates based on income levels. The average NFIP premium in Washington, DC is $720.68, with no chargeable premium rate exceeding 2% of the annual area median income. In Detroit, a household with low income paying the average premium would receive a discount of $76.93. FEMA would be authorized to consider the impact of including replacement cost value in setting premium rates for affordability. Additionally, FEMA would establish an Affordability Assistance Fund separate from other NFIP funds. The proposed legislation requires FEMA to establish an Affordability Assistance Fund to provide financial assistance to eligible households with high housing costs relative to income. Assistance can be in the form of a voucher, grant, or premium credit, based on specific income and asset criteria. The NFIP was created due to the unavailability of private flood insurance in the US. Private insurance companies mainly handle the day-to-day operations of the NFIP, while FEMA manages and oversees the program. Assistance for high housing costs relative to income can be provided through a voucher, grant, or premium credit from the Affordability Assistance Fund. The NFIP relies on private insurance companies, mainly through the Write-Your-Own (WYO) Program, to sell and service policies. Roughly 86% of NFIP policies are sold through this program. There are debates over the compensation levels for companies in the WYO program, with some arguing it is too generous and others saying it is insufficient. Congress required FEMA to establish a methodology for reimbursing insurance companies for selling, writing, and servicing flood policies. FEMA published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on revisions to the methodology for payments to WYO companies on July 8, 2019. A small private flood insurance market exists, with few private insurers competing with the NFIP in the primary voluntary flood insurance market. Some suggest that a \"non-compete clause\" has limited competition by WYO carriers in offering standalone private flood products. In FY2019, FEMA removed restrictions on WYO companies choosing to offer private flood insurance. In FY2019, FEMA removed restrictions on WYO companies offering private flood insurance, allowing private insurers to compete with the NFIP. Private insurer interest in providing flood coverage has increased due to advances in analytics and data for quantifying flood risk. Private insurance is seen as a way to transfer flood risk from the federal government to the private sector, but FEMA's subsidized rates and differing definitions of full-risk rates are barriers to private sector involvement. FEMA's new rating system, Risk Rating 2.0, aims to align premiums with flood risk, potentially impacting the competitive balance between NFIP and private insurers. Acceptance of private insurance for mandatory flood coverage has affected the market potential for private insurers. Congress allowed private flood insurance to fulfill the mandatory purchase requirement in BW-12. The final rule announced in February 2019 requires private flood insurance to provide coverage as broad as NFIP, effective July 1, 2019. This rule was welcomed by the banking industry, but its impact on encouraging private flood insurance growth is uncertain. FEMA's policy on continuous coverage is a barrier to private insurance market growth, as property owners risk losing subsidies if they switch to private insurance. Many insurers see the lack of access to NFIP data on flood losses as a barrier to offering private flood insurance. Increasing access to past NFIP claims data could help private insurance companies estimate future losses and price premiums. However, FEMA faces privacy concerns in providing property level information to insurers due to the Privacy Act of 1974. Congress revised FEMA's authority to secure reinsurance for the NFIP from private markets in HFIAA, leading to larger-scale reinsurance purchases starting in 2017. The NFIP has purchased reinsurance since 2017 to cover losses from large-scale events, starting after $4 billion in losses. As of December 2019, the reinsurance has been a net fiscal positive with $655 million in premiums paid and $1.042 billion received from claims. However, the balance may turn negative in the next few years if similar reinsurance purchases continue, especially after the high losses from Hurricane Harvey. The purchase of private market reinsurance by FEMA reduces the need to borrow from the Treasury to pay claims. Reinsurance transfers and manages risk, but the primary benefit is not to reduce the NFIP's long-term fiscal exposure. Section 107 directs FEMA to provide prorated refunds for NFIP premiums if policyholders switch to private flood insurance. Section 401 instructs FEMA to consider private flood insurance that meets certain criteria. Section 401 would direct FEMA to consider private flood insurance that satisfies the mandatory purchase requirement as also satisfying the continuous coverage requirement to keep NFIP premium subsidies in place. Section 404 would allow FEMA to provide property-specific flood insurance information to private insurers, potentially conflicting with the Privacy Act of 1974. This data could help private insurers offer better flood insurance options. Section 406 and 407 of the NFIP would allow FEMA to evaluate transferring risk to private markets and terminate WYO arrangements for fraud or noncompliance. Section 302 would cap reimbursement to WYO companies at 22.46% of premiums. Section 304 of the NFIP would require FEMA to develop a schedule to determine the actual costs of WYO companies and reimburse them only for the actual costs of services or products provided. Reimbursements made to WYO companies must be made public, including a description of the product or service provided. Section 305 would require FEMA to report on the feasibility of selling historical NFIP claims data to non-governmental entities while protecting policyholder privacy. Section 408 grants FEMA the authority to terminate contracts with entities detrimental to the NFIP. Section 415 allows for a pilot program investigating pre-existing conditions affecting NFIP claims. The NFIP's role goes beyond insurance, often overlooked in discussions about its future. The NFIP's main goal is to reduce flood risk through floodplain management standards and FEMA develops Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) with participating communities. FIRMs determine insurance rates and identify properties requiring flood insurance. The age and quality of flood maps vary across the country, with no set timetable for updates. FEMA is required to assess floodplain areas every five years for updates, but FIRMs may not be updated on the same schedule. Updates are needed for new developments, changes to flood protection systems, and environmental changes. The mapping process has been criticized for using outdated data and being time-consuming. The Technical Mapping Advisory Council (TMAC) was established by Congress in BW-12 to review and recommend improvements to FEMA's national flood mapping program. TMAC submits annual reports to the FEMA Administrator with recommendations for improving the mapping program. Additionally, TMAC was required to submit a one-time report with recommendations on how to ensure FIRMs incorporate the best available climate information. The Future Conditions report, submitted in February 2016, provides recommendations for FEMA to incorporate the best available climate science in assessing flood risks and considering sea level rise and future development impact. FEMA is required to include TMAC recommendations in updating FIRMs, with no specific guidance on implementation timing. BW-12 mandates FEMA to report annually to Congress and OMB on TMAC recommendations and actions taken. FEMA is addressing TMAC recommendations to improve flood insurance rate maps and flood risk data. If FEMA does not act on certain TMAC recommendations, they must explain in the mandated annual report. TMAC has produced annual reports from 2015 to 2018. NFIP flood mapping is funded through appropriations and the Federal Policy Fee. Funding for flood hazard mapping has increased from $100 million in FY2015 to $262.5 million in FY2019. In recent years, Congress has generally followed FEMA's budget request for the Federal Policy Fee (FPF) revenue. FEMA received $195 million in FY2017 and $188.2 million in FY2018 from the FPF. Congress directs that excess FPF revenue should be spent on floodplain management and mapping. In recent years, FEMA has received $195 million in FY2017 and $188.2 million in FY2018 from the Federal Policy Fee (FPF). About 66% of FPF resources are allocated to flood mapping, with concerns raised about maintaining funding for floodplain mapping and management as policies move to private insurers. H.R. 3167 and S. 2187 include provisions related to flood mapping, appeals, communication on map changes, adoption of partial flood maps, and TMAC membership. Section 201 reauthorizes the National Flood Mapping Program at $500 million annually for fiscal years 2019 to 2023. Section 202 requires FEMA to update maps with cadastral features and parcel identification data, coordinate with USGS for stream flow data sharing, and provide a national geospatial data repository on the FEMA website. FEMA must verify FIRM data every five years for accuracy. Section 202 of the National Flood Mapping Program reauthorizes FEMA to update flood maps with cadastral features and parcel identification data, coordinate with USGS for stream flow data sharing, and provide a national geospatial data repository on the FEMA website. This provision could lead to additional responsibilities for FEMA in map updates and potential conflicts with the Privacy Act of 1974 regarding Personally Identifiable Information. FEMA may also face increased costs related to parcel identification acquisition. Additionally, Section 203 authorizes FEMA to conduct a pilot program for enhancing urban flooding mapping and data availability to homeowners, businesses, and local governments. Section 203 of the National Flood Mapping Program authorizes FEMA to enhance urban flooding mapping and data availability for homeowners, businesses, and local governments. It requires FEMA to submit progress reports to Congress and a final report with mitigation recommendations. $1.2 million is authorized for FY2020 and $4.3 million for FY2021. This program will provide new information on urban flood risk not currently addressed in NFIP flood models. Section 204 of the National Flood Mapping Program mandates the use of digital display technology to provide building-specific flood hazard information within five years. FEMA is prohibited from sharing data in violation of privacy laws and must submit annual progress reports. Section 205 establishes an appeal process for updating flood maps based on new information. Section 209 of the National Flood Mapping Program requires FEMA to create a new flood zone designation for areas behind non-accredited levees, making flood insurance available to properties in those areas. Section 208 continues funding for the National Flood Mapping Program at $400 million annually and mandates the establishment of standards for mapping risk and developing alternative maps. Section 208 mandates local governments and organizations to develop alternative maps to NFIP Flood Insurance Rate Maps within one year. It also requires FEMA to certify these maps within 90 days and prohibits any revisions for three years. Partnerships with federal agencies and private entities are authorized to facilitate mapping, and FEMA must use the latest technology. FEMA is also required to establish a digital display environment for building-specific flood hazard and risk information. Section 208 mandates the development of alternative maps to NFIP Flood Insurance Rate Maps within one year. It also offers NFIP policyholders a one-time premium credit of up to $500 for purchasing an elevation certificate or appealing the chargeable premium rate. A new appeal process is created for updating flood maps based on new information, with certain expenses refunded or reimbursed. FEMA is required to develop a new flood zone designation for areas behind non-accredited levees, making flood insurance available at actuarial rates. Flood insurance will be available at actuarial rates for properties behind non-accredited levees, with rates based on the level of protection provided by the levee. FEMA will develop a fee schedule for providing flood maps, allowing private entities to contribute to mapping costs. Flood insurance helps with financial recovery after a flood, but it's better to prevent flooding through mitigation efforts. FEMA's flood mitigation program is crucial for creating safer communities and saving money for individuals and taxpayers. Research shows that for every $1 invested in flood mitigation by FEMA between 1993 and 2003, society saved $7 due to reduced future flood losses. NFIP encourages communities to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations, resulting in structures built to FEMA standards experiencing 73% less damage. Mitigation activities have been found to avoid losses of $206 million to $234 million in North Carolina. The NFIP offers programs to reduce flood risk through insurance incentives, such as the Community Rating System, FMA Grant Program, and ICC coverage. Linking insurance risk transfer with physical risk reduction measures could help address increasing flood risk concerns by incentivizing policyholders and communities to mitigate risks. However, a study found little evidence of governments or insurance companies actively promoting risk reduction in residential flood insurance markets. The NFIP offers programs like the Community Rating System to incentivize flood risk reduction. FEMA estimated that only 5% of eligible NFIP communities participate in the CRS program, but these communities hold over 69% of all flood policies. However, CRS discounts are cross-subsidized into the NFIP program, offsetting discounts with increased premium rates for all communities. The NFIP offers programs like the Community Rating System to incentivize flood risk reduction. FEMA operates an FMA Grant Program funded by NFIP revenue to mitigate flood-damaged properties and reduce NFIP claims. The FMA Program awards grants for various purposes, with federal funding available for up to 75% of eligible costs. In FY2019, $175 million of NFIP revenue was authorized for the FMA Program, with $160 million available for grants. States, tribal governments, territories, and local communities can apply for FMA grants. Funding for NFIP programs can cover up to 75% of eligible costs, with potential for up to 90% for repetitive loss properties and 100% for severe repetitive loss properties. There is debate over insuring properties with multiple flood losses due to increased risk and cost concerns. Different definitions of repetitive loss are used for various NFIP programs, with a consistent definition for severe repetitive loss properties. Section 105 of the NFIP authorizes FEMA to provide capitalization grants to eligible states for establishing state revolving funds for flood mitigation. These funds aim to reduce flood risk for homeowners, businesses, and communities to decrease loss of life and property, lower flood insurance costs, and reduce federal disaster payments. Participating states are limited to receiving 15% of the total fund per fiscal year, with any excess going to non-capped states. FEMA must reserve 5% of funds for tribal governments and insular areas, and states must provide a 15% matching fund from nonfederal sources. Section 105 of the NFIP authorizes FEMA to provide capitalization grants to eligible states for establishing state revolving funds for flood mitigation. States must provide a 15% matching fund from nonfederal sources. Priority is given to projects addressing severe repetitive loss structures, low-income homeowners, and flood risk for pre-FIRM buildings. States can offer additional subsidization to low-income recipients, including loan forgiveness. $50 million is authorized to be appropriated annually from 2020 to 2024 for the fund, marking the first national-level flood mitigation fund. Section 210 allows local zoning authorities to grant variances for agricultural structures in SFHAs under certain conditions. Section 302 introduces a new category of \"multiple-loss property\" including repetitive loss, severe repetitive loss, and extreme repetitive loss properties. The new definition of repetitive loss property includes structures with two or more flood damage claims exceeding the deductible. Extreme repetitive loss properties have had at least two claims exceeding 150% of the maximum coverage. FEMA can consider a community's efforts to address repeatedly flooded areas for financial assistance. This broader definition brings more properties into the multiple-loss categories. FEMA must offer policyholders a reduced risk premium rate. The curr_chunk discusses the requirement for FEMA to offer policyholders a reduction in the risk premium rate for using approved flood risk mitigation actions. It also mentions the creation of a voluntary community-based flood insurance pilot project for purchasing a single community-wide flood insurance policy. This policy would cover all properties in the community and prevent redundant claims. A community flood insurance policy must prevent redundant claims payments for property owners covered by both community and individual NFIP policies. FEMA needs to establish a pilot program within 180 days, ending on September 30, 2022. $200 million per year for five years is authorized for the Flood Mitigation Grant Assistance Program. FEMA must provide Community Rating System credits for floodplain protection measures. The proposed measures aim to protect floodplain functions and provide CRS credits to communities. FEMA would grant funds for coordinating CRS responsibilities and develop a program to enhance flood risk management. $7 million per year for five years is allocated for grants, and $20 million per year for fiscal years 2019 through 2024 is authorized for capacity-building programs. FEMA may also allocate additional assistance to states as needed. Section 201 requires the President to set aside 10% of the Disaster Relief Fund for mitigation activities for properties with increased flood risk due to Risk Rating 2.0. This is the first time NFIP would receive funding from the DRF. Section 203 prioritizes grants for mitigation activities that reduce flood damage to repetitive-loss properties and those with unaffordable premium rates. Section 204 authorizes $1 billion annually for five years to provide mitigation assistance for properties with unaffordable premium rates or excessive losses. FEMA must offer policyholders a 10% reduction in risk premium rates for using approved flood risk mitigation actions. Section 205 of the legislation would require FEMA to appoint regional coordinators in each region to assist small communities in participating in the CRS program. This provision aims to enhance mitigation efforts for NFIP policyholders. Section 207 of the legislation authorizes FEMA to provide capitalization grants to eligible states for establishing state revolving funds for flood mitigation. This section also allows for the appropriation of necessary funds for fiscal years 2020 through 2029. Additionally, FEMA must consider activities funded through state loan funds when setting NFIP premium rates, marking the first national-level fund for flood mitigation. The NFIP requires policyholders to purchase ICC coverage, a separate insurance policy to comply with building codes. ICC coverage is capped at $75/year and provides up to $30,000 for eligible expenses like elevating or flood-proofing buildings. FEMA sets rates and claim limits for ICC coverage. According to ICC data, elevation is the most common form of mitigation for non-residential structures. The average cost of elevating an existing property ranges from $33,239 to $91,732. Section 301 proposes to increase ICC coverage to $60,000 and exempt the ICC payment from the maximum payout limit. Section 301 proposes to increase ICC coverage to $60,000, exempt ICC payment from the maximum payout limit, and make ICC coverage available for mitigation activities before damage occurs. Policyholders can use ICC coverage for alternative mitigation methods, pre-disaster projects, and property acquisition or relocation costs. Section 202 proposes to increase ICC coverage to $60,000, exempt ICC payment from the maximum payout limit, and make ICC coverage available for mitigation activities before damage occurs. Policyholders can use ICC coverage for alternative mitigation methods, pre-disaster projects, and property acquisition or relocation costs. The report discusses the disclosure requirements and studies of the NFIP, highlighting the lack of federal requirement for sellers to disclose flood risk and history to buyers. Property owners may not be aware of their property's full flood history, and lenders are only required to inform buyers of flood hazards before closing on a loan. The disclosure notifies properties in a SFHA that flood insurance is required for the loan. Lenders must inform buyers of flood hazards, but not the full flood history. Section 404 would require FEMA to provide flood insurance program coverage information to homeowners. The disclosure requirement under Section 417 mandates sellers to provide flood risk information to buyers within 14 days of a request. This may impact property sales and values, especially for properties with a flood history. Additionally, new flood insurance coverage after September 30, 2022, is contingent on sellers disclosing property flood hazards to purchasers or lessees. This requirement also applies to lessors of rental properties with leases of 30 days or longer. Section 403 requires FEMA to conduct an annual actuarial study of the NFIP's financial position and report to Congress. Section 105 mandates a study on offering coverage for business interruption losses caused by floods in NFIP policies. Section 402 requires a study on the impact of street-raising on flood insurance coverage for affected properties. The study focuses on the cost implications for property owners, particularly for ground floor residential and business properties that could become basement properties if the adjacent street is raised. It also mentions the requirement for GAO to report on fines imposed by FEMA for underpayment of claims by WYO companies. Additionally, it discusses the increased risk of flooding for properties due to land development, flood mapping, and climate change, with a projected national growth of the 1% annual-chance fluvial floodplain area by about 45% by 2100. The National Academies of Science warns that a warming climate will likely increase the risk of pluvial flooding, as a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, increasing frequency and intensity. NFIP models do not currently include pluvial flood risk but will be included in premium rates with Risk Rating 2.0. Approximately 13.5% of the growth in the fluvial SFHA is likely due to population growth, while 70% is attributed to climate change. The frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall events have increased across the United States since 1950, with the largest increases in the Midwest and Northeast. Predictions indicate a 40% increase in heavy precipitation events in those areas by 2100. Coastal areas are projected to experience a 55% increase in the coastal SFHA by 2100, leading to greater variability in expected total losses. Nuisance flooding and minor tidal flooding are already occurring in many areas due to increased frequency and duration. The frequency and duration of minor tidal flooding has increased significantly along U.S. coasts in recent decades, disrupting normal commerce and activity. Even without named storms, flood costs can be considerable. Recent events like the South Carolina floods in 2015 and Hurricanes Harvey (2017) and Florence (2018) have shown the scale of losses possible from heavy rainfall. Approximately 33% of NFIP claims are for properties outside SFHAs. Recent floods have impacted properties outside SFHAs, challenging the belief that these areas are safe. The introduction of Risk Rating 2.0 will change premium rates but the SFHA boundary will still be used for mandatory purchase requirements. Future flood maps need to communicate temporal variation in flood risk as FIRMs only provide a snapshot of risk at the time of mapping. New York City and FEMA have developed a new map product for future land-use decisions to account for flood risk due to climate change and sea level rise. Floodplains and coastal areas in the US will continue to face catastrophic flooding, posing a challenge to private insurers' capacity. FEMA's report to Congress addresses the privatization of flood insurance. The FEMA report to Congress on privatization of the NFIP highlighted the necessity of government involvement in flood insurance due to the high correlation of risks and potential catastrophic events. Despite the NFIP's borrowing authority, a robust approach to repaying catastrophic flood losses has not been developed. The National Research Council affordability report suggested forgiving part of the NFIP debt as a potential solution. The NRC report proposed forgiving part of the NFIP debt and suggested Congress designate the Treasury as reinsurer for the NFIP to provide funds for claims exceeding a certain threshold, potentially lowering NFIP premiums and reducing disaster assistance spending. The American Academy of Actuaries (AAA) argued that neither private insurers nor government entities can fully absorb any level of catastrophic loss and continue to operate. Private insurance systems have triggers for socializing risk of extreme events, such as a solvency standard based on a particular event, beyond which mechanisms like guaranty funds pay losses. The premiums charged to policyholders for the NFIP would require a volatility loading large enough to service and eventually repay any debt generated by catastrophic events over a multi-decadal time horizon. The AAA report suggests establishing a sufficiency standard for NFIP revenue to fully fund a maximum amount of short-term loss from catastrophic events. Any losses exceeding this standard would be publicly funded, similar to how state guarantee funds reimburse policyholders for claims from insolvent private insurers. Adopting this explicit standard for the NFIP is recommended. The NFIP may need a financial structure to ensure solvency after catastrophic events, including using reserve funds, borrowing authority, reinsurance, and a Treasury backstop. GAO suggests defining scenarios the system can sustain and those it cannot. The GAO concluded that Congress's actions in NFIP reform are crucial, including addressing affordability concerns and protecting flood resilience activities. Premium rate reform is recommended to address outstanding debt. A central question for Congress is who should bear the costs of floodplain occupancy in the future, with three possible ways to distribute the costs according to the NRC study on affordability. The costs of floodplain occupancy can be borne by policyholders, federal taxpayers, or uninsured individuals. These stakeholders may bear the costs through insurance premiums, government assistance programs, or uncompensated losses. Ultimately, the majority of the cost will be allocated among policyholders, taxpayers, and the uninsured. The costs of floodplain occupancy can be borne by policyholders, taxpayers, and the uninsured, requiring potentially difficult policy choices by Congress."
