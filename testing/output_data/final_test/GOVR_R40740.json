    "content": "U.S. global health funding has increased significantly in the past decade, driven by infectious disease outbreaks like HIV/AIDS, SARS, avian flu, XDR-TB, and the 2009 influenza pandemic. Funding comes from various appropriations vehicles, with a large portion allocated to PEPFAR for global HIV/AIDS programs. Global HIV/AIDS programs are implemented by various U.S. agencies and departments, including USAID, HHS, Department of Commerce, DOD, DOL, and the Peace Corps. PEPFAR funds also support the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. Congressional appropriations for global health efforts primarily go to USAID and CDC for global health activities. U.S. agencies and departments allocate portions of their budgets for global health programs. U.S. agencies and departments allocate portions of their budgets for global health programs, including transferring funds among each other. They implement programs addressing development and health challenges like clean water access, climate change, urbanization, conflict support, and natural emergencies. Some advocacy groups view these activities as part of health assistance funded by Congress. Global health assistance funded by Congress includes activities implemented by USAID, CDC, DOD, and OGAC for programs such as child survival, maternal health, and HIV/AIDS. Funds are allocated to various departments for implementation, addressing key diseases and supporting vaccination, safe delivery, and nutrition. Global health assistance funded by Congress includes activities implemented by USAID, CDC, DOD, and OGAC for programs such as child survival, maternal health, HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, addressing infectious diseases, and family planning/reproductive health services. The CDC global health programs funded by Congress include HIV/AIDS, malaria, and Global Disease Detection (GDD) aimed at improving capacity in laboratory services, surveillance systems, and public health training. The CDC global health programs funded by Congress include Global Disease Detection (GDD) for public health surveillance and rapid response capacity, Immunizations for children under five, and other programs to build public health capacity in country leaders. Congress also allocates funds for international assistance in tuberculosis and pandemic preparedness, as well as bilateral HIV/AIDS programs managed by the Department of State. The bulk of funds allocated by Congress are transferred to various agencies including the Departments of Commerce, Labor, and the Peace Corps. Additional funds are provided to the Departments of State and Health and Human Services for U.S. contributions to the Global Fund. USAID and CDC collaborate with international organizations like WHO and UNICEF for health emergencies. Congress initially provided $1.4 billion to USAID for global health activities during the George W. Bush Administration. During the George W. Bush Administration, Congress allocated funds for global health activities, including $1.4 billion to USAID for the Child Survival and Health Programs Fund, $529.5 million to CDC for immunization activities, and additional funds for global HIV/AIDS programs to various U.S. agencies and departments. During the George W. Bush Administration, Congress significantly increased support for USAID's global health programs, nearly doubling funding to $2.1 billion by FY2008. This increase focused on countering infectious diseases like pandemic flu, avian flu, malaria, and TB. However, water and sanitation programs for mothers and children were funded separately through the Development Assistance account and were not included in annual reports or budget justifications for global health assistance until FY2008. In FY2008, Congress consolidated funding for USAID's global health programs with OGAC's Global HIV/AIDS Initiative and the Global Fund into the Global Health and Child Survival (GHCS) account. Funding for CDC's global health programs also increased by 66% from FY2001 levels, reaching $372.2 million by FY2008 for various global health efforts. In recent years, U.S. global health spending has seen fluctuations with increased support for disease interventions like HIV/AIDS, disease detection, immunizations, and pandemic interventions. Congress has shown high interest in funding these efforts, with significant appropriations for various global health programs. PEPFAR, initiated in FY2004, is a U.S. government-wide effort to combat global HIV/AIDS. It was proposed by President George W. Bush in 2003 and authorized by the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. Coordinated by the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, PEPFAR is implemented with various government agencies. Congress allocated over $15 billion from FY2004 to FY2008 for rapid scale-up of HIV/AIDS programs, focusing on treatment with antiretroviral drugs. The 110th Congress enacted the Lantos-Hyde Act in 2008, authorizing $48 billion for U.S. international HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria programs from FY2009 through FY2013. This Act included higher funding levels for programs targeting the three diseases, the establishment of the U.S. Global Malaria Coordinator within USAID, and strategies to promote sustainability of health care systems in affected countries. In FY2005, Congress provided emergency funds for U.S. global pandemic influenza preparedness and response, training health workers in foreign countries for potential pandemics like H5N1 avian flu and H1N1 \"swine flu.\" WHO reported high mortality rates for H5N1 avian flu cases since 2003, while H1N1 had lower mortality rates. Influenza A/H5N1 is one of many avian flu strains that can affect poultry globally. Since 2003, H5N1 avian flu outbreaks have been closely monitored due to a high human fatality rate of about 60%. In 2009, 436 people contracted the virus, with 262 deaths reported. The United States pledged nearly $950 million for international avian and pandemic influenza efforts, supporting over 100 nations. Since 2005, Congress has increased funding for U.S. global malaria interventions, focusing on providing commodities to prevent and treat malaria in selected countries. Some Members of Congress and health experts criticized U.S. bilateral malaria interventions for yielding few tangible results, as funds were mostly spent on preventative measures like information campaigns and insecticide distribution. In 2005, President Bush announced the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI), a U.S. government response to malaria in sub-Saharan African countries. Led by USAID and CDC, PMI focuses on distributing insecticide-treated bed nets, indoor residual spraying, and procuring malaria commodities. U.S. spending on malaria commodities increased significantly from FY2004 to FY2008. In FY2008, Congress allocated $162.2 million to USAID for global TB efforts, an increase of $67 million from FY2007 levels. Additionally, $1.6 million was allocated to CDC for TB programs. Congressional support for global TB programs rose after a man with XDR-TB entered the U.S. in 2007. Funding for global TB efforts remained stable from FY2004 to FY2007, ranging between $90 million and $95 million. In FY2008, Congress allocated $162.2 million to USAID and $1.6 million to CDC for global TB efforts. The 111th Congress supported key global health issues by providing nearly $10.0 billion for global health efforts in the FY2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act. This included funds for USAID, CDC, and the State Department for bilateral and multilateral global HIV/AIDS programs. The 111th Congress allocated $10.0 million for global HIV/AIDS interventions in the FY2010 Department of Defense Appropriations. This Congress emphasized coordination of all global health programs, support for health systems, and rapid response to new health challenges. Gender-based issues like violence against women and access to reproductive health services were also highlighted. Over half of the funds allocated to USAID through GHCS in FY2010 were directed towards addressing infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS. The FY2010 Consolidated Appropriations Bill (P.L. 111-117) allocated over $8 billion for global health programs, with a focus on HIV/AIDS. Funding increases were provided for bilateral and multilateral programs, including contributions to the Global Fund. Congress also increased appropriations for USAID global health programs, with a significant boost in funding for other infectious diseases. Overall, funding for global health programs in FY2010 saw significant increases, particularly for infectious diseases. Support for diseases like malaria, TB, and neglected tropical diseases rose substantially, while funding for pandemic and avian flu response decreased. Congressional appropriations for CDC global health programs increased by about 6%, with a focus on immunizations, Global Disease Detection Centers, and other global health initiatives. The goal was to establish at least one new program. Increased provisions were allocated to establish new regional GDD facilities and enhance capacity at existing centers. Funding for HIV/AIDS programs under the Department of State increased by 1% to $5.4 billion, including contributions to the Global Fund. Additional funds were provided through the NIH for the Global Fund and other multilateral entities supporting global health programs. Transparency and accountability were highlighted as key themes for the 111th Congress. The FY2010 Foreign Appropriations conference report included provisions for oversight of global health programs, requiring a report on U.S. global health programs' impact, outcomes, and effectiveness in each country. Recommendations for program improvements and adequate support were also mandated. The FY2010 Foreign Appropriations conference report mandates oversight of global health programs to assess impact, outcomes, and effectiveness. It requires a report on HIV/AIDS prevention interventions, collaborative efforts, and integration of PEPFAR programs within a U.S. global health strategy. President Obama's budget proposal aims to double U.S. foreign assistance and increase investments in global health programs. President Obama requested Congress to approve $8.6 billion for the Global Health and Child Survival Account. He also announced the Global Health Initiative, a $63 billion six-year plan to improve coordination of U.S. global health programs, addressing reproductive health challenges and the need for global action against diseases like the H1N1 virus. The Global Health Initiative (GHI) is a new initiative aimed at improving coordination of U.S. global health programs. The full scope, objectives, and implementation strategy of the GHI are still to be determined. The Administration has set up a steering committee and working groups to plan the GHI strategy and recommend funding levels for U.S. global health programs starting in FY2011. However, it is unclear which U.S. agencies and departments will be involved in the GHI. The GHI does not include a comprehensive examination of all global health funding. The GHI-suggested six-year global health funding level of $63 billion is based on the budgets of the Department of State and USAID, leading to debate on its sufficiency. Some experts support the proposal for key programs like malaria and family planning, while others argue it may be too low to meet goals and scale up programs. The Global Health Initiative Coalition proposes increasing U.S. global health funding to $95 billion for FY2009 through FY2014 to meet the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Concerns arise about the lack of coordination and integration in U.S. global health programs, except for specific initiatives like PEPFAR, PMI, NTD Initiative, and Avian Flu Task Force. Congress is working to understand the scope and impact of global health programs. Congress is urged to define global health and global health assistance to improve U.S. global health programs. One supporter argues that the lack of an established global health definition hinders consensus on aid goals and strategies. Health experts suggest Congress draft a bill to define U.S. global health assistance scope, agencies involved, and roles. Some critics argue for a unified U.S. global health strategy to improve effectiveness of health assistance. Global health experts suggest Congress direct the Administration to develop a comprehensive strategy for addressing global health challenges. Some propose a global health task force to develop a strategy for all U.S. global health assistance, focusing on evidence-based approaches, measurable results, and specific goals such as reducing mortality and eradicating key diseases. This strategy aims to clarify sources of assistance, goals, measurement methods, and strengths of each agency and department involved. Proponents of a global health strategy argue that aligning the goals of U.S. global health programs is crucial to prevent agencies with competing priorities from operating independently. Critics believe that disease-specific funding like PEPFAR and PMI may not complement ongoing efforts, affect funding for other health programs, and disrupt country health systems. Supporters suggest that a U.S. global health strategy could address these concerns through the Global Health Initiative (GHI). The Global Health Initiative (GHI) aims to address concerns by creating concept papers for U.S. activities in various health areas. Stakeholders advocate for using these papers to evaluate program efficiency, align with development priorities, and garner congressional support. Health experts are urging greater congressional support for programs addressing infectious diseases and health systems, such as Health Systems 20/20 and USP DQI. Congress backs global health programs like PEPFAR and the Global Fund. The 111th Congress debates allocating funds to fight diseases and strengthen recipient countries' health systems. Some suggest focusing on disease-specific initiatives for measurable outcomes and political support. Some argue for disease-specific interventions to bolster health systems by building capacity and expertise in key areas, with investments in activities targeting key diseases seen as better spent. While advancements in disease-focused efforts like PMI and PEPFAR are applauded, others advocate for a greater emphasis on strengthening health systems. Critics of single disease initiatives highlight the interconnected nature of health care challenges and potential competition for limited resources in resource-poor countries. Some experts argue that disease-specific initiatives may not be necessary if investments are increased in healthcare infrastructure and training opportunities. Without sufficient investment in health systems, progress in disease-focused projects may not be sustainable. Global health efforts should combine both disease-specific and health system strengthening approaches. President Obama supports a better integrated approach to U.S. health assistance, emphasizing the need to improve health systems globally and focus on child and maternal health. Experts suggest a single global health strategy to balance support for disease-specific initiatives and healthcare infrastructure development. The United States has provided substantial funding for bilateral and multilateral global health efforts, including support for organizations like the Global Fund, WHO, UNICEF, IAVI, GAVI Alliance, and MMV. Congress debates the balance of funding between bilateral and multilateral efforts, with proponents of multilateral funding arguing for greater impact and reduced reporting burdens. Opponents of increasing funding for multilateral activities argue that bilateral programs promote accountability and reflect U.S. priorities. Some Members of Congress are discussing foreign assistance reform, but few proposals address how they relate to U.S. global health programs. Various reform proposals could have unique implications for U.S. global health programs, including the challenge of rewriting the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to be more concise and comprehensive. Observers suggest that any rewrite should address the various U.S. global health assistance efforts authorized under different Acts, such as CDC's programs authorized through the Public Health Assistance Act. The United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 authorizes U.S. global health assistance activities related to HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, requiring a comprehensive review of authorizing Acts for any foreign assistance reform. The Millennium Challenge Corporation is funded through foreign operations appropriations bills but is not authorized by the Foreign Assistance Act. Congress may need to consider various authorities for reform proposals affecting U.S. global health programs. Congress may need to consider the variety of authorities and oversight challenges related to U.S. global health assistance, with multiple committees holding oversight authority. Reform proposals may involve creating a cabinet-level international development agency to oversee all global health and development programs. Some suggest the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator as a model for an independent high-level international development entity, while others have political concerns. Supporters argue that a cabinet-level development agency could enhance U.S. global health efforts by expanding support avenues and elevating the status of health interventions, drawing on the success of PEPFAR. However, concerns exist about the agency's political influence compared to the Department of State, potentially impacting domestic and global support for its programs. Some health experts have concerns about integrating global health programs into a cabinet-level development agency, fearing politicization and diplomatic concerns outweighing global health priorities. Critics worry about health assistance being used as a political tool and suggest improving coordination without restructuring foreign aid. Health assistance coordination can be improved through mechanisms like OGAC, which clarifies oversight and funding structures. OGAC has helped agencies coordinate better, but there are concerns about parallel structures like PMI. Some experts suggest mandating cooperation to formalize the process. The CDC coordinated an interagency forum through Project Horizon for U.S. global health policy discussions, but the results and impact have not been published. Efforts to improve coordination between programs, such as the International Health Office at DOD overseeing funding and coordination of key programs, are needed. The 111th Congress has urged OGAC to expand efforts to address health and development challenges through PEPFAR programs. The Lantos-Hyde Act allows organizations receiving PEPFAR funds to opt out of certain aspects of HIV programs for moral or religious reasons. Faith-based and other NGOs argue that these protections are necessary for them to accept U.S. funding. Some argue that respecting organizations' moral and religious views is crucial for them to accept U.S. funding for expanding programs. Critics of the conscience clause believe that withholding information from HIV-positive mothers weakens prevention efforts. Health experts suggest providing HIV/AIDS services in existing health clinics to reduce stigma and improve access to prevention services. Experts have noted the increasing use of the term \"global health\" in the past 15 years but question if a clear definition has emerged. Global health differs from terms like tropical health and international health, focusing on disease challenges in developing countries. Global health emphasizes the interconnectedness of health between rich and poor countries, highlighting mutual vulnerability to global health threats like pandemic influenza and increasing disease resistance. Health challenges that once affected industrialized countries now disproportionately impact developing countries, with chronic diseases and transportation-related injuries being major causes of death. The Committee on the U.S. Commitment to Global Health at the Institute of Medicine defined global health in 2009 to reflect this interconnectedness. The concept of global health has evolved to include improving health for all people in all nations by promoting wellness and eliminating avoidable disease, disability, and death through population-based health promotion and disease prevention measures. The U.S. global health enterprise involves collaboration across sectors and disciplines, with no universal definition of \"health assistance\" but acknowledgment of the various factors impacting health. Many think tanks focus on key global health issues like HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, neglected tropical diseases, maternal and child health, reproductive health, family planning, and hunger. Some also address chronic diseases, climate change's impact on health, international medical research, and equal access to medicine. They advocate for coordinated support in related sectors like education, infrastructure, agriculture, and women's rights. The water and sanitation sector is increasingly considered part of global health due to its links to diseases like diarrhea and cholera. U.S. global health assistance is defined as activities and funding to address health problems beyond national boundaries, aiming to improve health by reducing disease and deaths. U.S. Global Health Assistance includes disease detection, reproductive health, maternal and child health, nutrition, water, environmental health, and research. Implementing agencies like USAID and CDC collaborate with international organizations to respond to health emergencies. According to USAID's website, global health interventions include nutrition, environmental health, and health systems to address issues like poor nutrition, clean water access, and efficient health systems in developing countries. Funding for family planning and reproductive health was shifted to the CSH account in FY2002. Before the 2006 outbreaks of avian influenza, there was little discussion about USDA's role in global health. Since then, efforts have been made to contain and control infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, polio, and malaria. Some health experts have identified U.S. efforts to contain zoonotic infections like avian flu as part of global health assistance. Congress has funded USDA for avian influenza interventions since FY2005, with about $37 million spent. There is debate on whether these funds should be considered part of U.S. global health assistance or international animal health efforts. The USDA focuses on improving animal and plant health globally. The Department of Commerce's ITA and NOAA are involved in global health efforts, working with FDA to address manufacturing practices and counterfeit medicines in the pharmaceutical industry. OHCG collaborates with foreign regulators on \"Quality by design.\" The Department of Commerce's NOAA scientists develop satellite-derived products for global health efforts, including drought and famine early warning, malaria monitoring, wildland fire detection, and smoke monitoring. Commerce's work is considered a global health effort, supporting the State Department's Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator in engaging the private sector in U.S. global HIV/AIDS activities. The U.S. Department of Defense engages in global health efforts through programs like the Department of Defense HIV/AIDS Prevention Program (DHAPP) and the Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System (GEIS). DHAPP works with African militaries to prevent HIV infections, while GEIS focuses on addressing emerging infectious diseases. The U.S. military is involved in global health initiatives worldwide. The U.S. military engages in global health efforts through partnerships with various organizations and governments to provide care during humanitarian disasters and conflicts in different regions. Their goal is to promote stability, security, and assist foreign governments with disaster response. Activities include health operations as part of Stability, Security, Transition, and Reconstruction Operations (SSTRO) and Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief. The U.S. military engages in global health efforts through various programs such as the U.S. Military HIV Research Program, Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster and Civic Aid, and international research on infectious diseases. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services provides annual appropriations to CDC for global health activities. CDC's global health programs receive funds through budget lines including Global HIV/AIDS, Global Malaria, Global Disease Detection, Global Immunization, and Other Global Health. CDC integrates its domestic and global programs, using the same experts for both. It also responds to global requests for technical assistance in areas like outbreak response and injury prevention. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services provides annual appropriations to CDC for global health activities, including influenza preparedness, TB prevention, injury and chronic disease control, emergency assistance, environmental health, reproductive health, and safe water initiatives. Congress also funds research efforts of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to improve global health, with a focus on the Office of AIDS Research (OAR) and the NIH Fogarty International Center for global health research and training. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) supports global health activities by including health infrastructure and capacity building projects in compact agreements with developing countries. These projects improve water and sanitation facilities, diagnostic and treatment protocols, laboratory facilities, health centers, and management of health resources. MCC also emphasizes the impact of clean water on the health of populations in developing countries and supports U.S. global HIV/AIDS activities. The U.S. Department of State plays a key role in global health efforts, with various offices overseeing foreign assistance resources for fighting global HIV/AIDS and coordinating foreign policy related to health issues. The Department also works on promoting global health awareness and considers public health expenditure and immunization rates in its selection process for global health initiatives. The Office of Global Women's Issues (S/GWI) coordinates State Department efforts on women's issues, including advancing women's rights globally. The Oceans, Environment, and Science (OES) Bureau within the G Bureau focuses on environmental and scientific issues in U.S. foreign policy, such as infectious diseases, climate change, and space exploration. The Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) supports healthcare services for refugees and formulates US foreign policy on population and migration. The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs partners with private sectors and NGOs to address global health. Other offices contributing to global health efforts include the Office of the Science and Technology Adviser to the Secretary (G/STAS) and the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (G/TIP). The Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (G/TIP) provides technological expertise on global health and food security issues to the Secretary of State and U.S. embassies. It leads U.S. efforts in science diplomacy, promotes science and technology capacity in developing countries, and supports efforts to identify and protect trafficking victims. Peace Corps volunteers, with 23% working on health-related projects, contribute to global health in a volunteer-driven approach that sets them apart from other agencies. The Peace Corps volunteers work on various health projects globally, including hygiene, sanitation, water systems, food security, maternal and child health, communicable diseases, chronic illnesses, and healthy lifestyles. They use different methods such as classroom instruction, materials development, training for healthcare providers, and informal health sessions through murals, theater, radio, television, and puppet shows. In FY2008, over 1,700 health and HIV/AIDS volunteers were involved in 52 projects worldwide. Peace Corps global health activities are not typically included in U.S. global health assistance, except for those related to PEPFAR. In 2007, the United States provided $1.1 billion on health assistance and $4.5 billion on population and reproductive health programs, including support for HIV/AIDS control. This includes aid for basic health, general health, health infrastructure, nutrition, infectious disease control, health education, and personnel development. Total USAID and CDC health assistance levels closely mirror those reported to the OECD. In FY2007, U.S. global health assistance, excluding HIV/AIDS and family planning, reached $1.2 billion. Total funding for population and reproductive health programs, including all bilateral HIV/AIDS assistance, was $4.1 billion. The list of agencies involved in U.S. global health assistance activities in 2007 was extensive."
