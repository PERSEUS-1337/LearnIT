The National Science Foundation Innovation Corps Program, known as I-Corps, has successfully increased the commercialization of Government-funded research by providing valuable entrepreneurial education to graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and other researchers. The I-Corps Teams program focuses on providing specific types of education and mentoring for entrepreneurs at the early stage of their ventures. The I-Corps Program provides valuable entrepreneurial education and mentoring to entrepreneurs in the early stages of their ventures. It is suggested to expand this success by offering additional training to small businesses as they advance towards commercialization. Additionally, the training should be made available to all Federal grantees and businesses willing to pay for it. The program has been successful in promoting entrepreneurship within research institutions and encouraging research commercialization. The National Science Foundation has been working on building a network of science entrepreneurs by convening stakeholders, promoting I-Corps courses, cataloguing best practices, encouraging sharing, and developing a mentor network. As the I-Corps Program grows, the focus should remain on networking and information sharing to help innovators learn from each other and stay competitive. SEC. 3. EXPANDED PARTICIPATION IN I-CORPS.
