    "content": "The Act titled \"Imported Seafood Safety Standards Act\" ensures the safety of imported seafood by amending the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to include regulations for imported seafood safety. The Imported Seafood Safety Standards Act requires the Secretary to certify that imported seafood meets US standards and conduct annual inspections of foreign facilities exporting seafood to the US. The Imported Seafood Safety Standards Act mandates reliable analytical methods for seafood compliance with US standards. The Secretary must inspect and test at least 20% of imported seafood annually, with additional testing for new exporters. Failure to pass inspection results in consequences. The Imported Seafood Safety Standards Act requires inspections and testing of seafood imports. If a shipment fails inspection, subsequent shipments from the exporter must pass inspection until 15 consecutive shipments pass. If more than 3 shipments fail in a year, no shipments from that exporter can be imported for the following year. The Imported Seafood Safety Standards Act mandates inspections and testing for seafood imports. If an exporter has more than 3 failed shipments in a year, they cannot import to the US for the following year unless certified by the Secretary for compliance with US standards. The Imported Seafood Safety Standards Act mandates inspections and testing for seafood imports. If shipments repeatedly fail inspection or testing requirements from a specific country, all seafood shipments from that country will be refused entry into the US until the Secretary certifies compliance with US standards. The Secretary will impose fees on exporters to fund an inspection service for seafood imports. Fees collected will be used for inspection purposes, including salaries for additional inspectors if needed. If a seafood shipment fails to meet requirements, it may be refused entry into the US. If a shipment of seafood imported into the United States fails safety standards, it will be detained or destroyed unless it meets re-export criteria. Refused shipments must be labeled with 'UNITED STATES: REFUSED ENTRY'. If a foreign country agrees to accept the rejected shipment within 45 days, it can be exported there. If a shipment fails safety standards upon import into the United States, it may be detained or destroyed. The Secretary can order destruction if the shipment poses significant health risks. Ports of entry must be notified within 5 days if a shipment fails safety standards, is detained, or destroyed. Seafood imported into the United States may only enter through ports certified by the Secretary for testing and inspection. Ports must have trained personnel for this purpose. Certification determines which ports can handle seafood imports. If a port accepted seafood before this regulation, it must meet the new certification requirements. The Secretary will provide necessary personnel and training to ports not meeting certification requirements. An annual report to Congress will detail inspections, testing, noncompliance, and recommendations for improvements. Authorization of appropriations is granted for these purposes. Authorization of appropriations is granted for carrying out the provisions related to seafood import inspections and penalties for violations under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Penalties for knowingly false statements or misbranding seafood imported under section 805 can result in civil penalties up to $250,000 per violation and $1,100,000 for multiple violations within a 3-year period. Paragraphs (5), (6), and (7) of subsection (f) apply to civil penalty assessments in the same manner as they do under subsection (f)(1). SEC. 805A. COOPERATION WITH STATES TO CONDUCT SEAFOOD INSPECTIONS. The Secretary may establish a program for States to inspect, test, and certify imported seafood. States will receive training and certification to carry out inspections in accordance with Federal requirements. States receiving grants must participate in the program. States receiving grants under subsection (c) must comply with Secretary requirements for training and certification of officials, inspect and certify imported seafood according to Federal standards, and perform any additional activities deemed necessary by the Secretary for ensuring seafood safety. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a State must submit an application to the Secretary with required information. Authorization of appropriations is provided for carrying out this section."
