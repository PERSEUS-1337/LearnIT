    "content": "The term \"charter\" in the Anglo-American linguistic tradition has been used to refer to various legal writs, including contracts and articles of incorporation. Its etymology suggests a connection to the Latin or Greek word for \"paper.\" In federal statutory law, a congressional or federal charter establishes a corporation with specific characteristics such as name, purpose, governance structure, powers, and federal oversight. A charter provides a corporation with operational powers such as the ability to sue, contract, acquire property, etc. Congress chartered its first corporation, the Bank of the United States, in 1791. The Supreme Court's decision in McCulloch v. Maryland in 1819 settled any dispute over Congress's power to charter corporations. In 1819, the Supreme Court ruled in McCulloch v. Maryland that incorporation could be a \"necessary and proper\" means for the federal government to achieve its constitutional ends. Congress issued charters for the District of Columbia's affairs, including establishing the office of the mayor and the Washington City Orphan Asylum. In the 20th century, Congress chartered corporations in response to national crises like World Wars and the Great Depression. These corporations were deemed better suited for commercial-type activities. Each congressionally chartered corporation is unique and may be sorted into rough types, including nonprofit entities. Congress chartered corporations in response to national crises in the 20th century. These corporations can be divided into nonprofit and for-profit types. Table 1 outlines a typology of congressionally chartered corporations, raising issues for Congress such as membership practices, political activities, confusion over governmental status, and federal management. In 2011, Congress revised membership criteria for the Blue Star Mothers of America, Inc. to allow for a larger number of members. In response to national crises, Congress chartered corporations in the 20th century, including nonprofit and for-profit types. Membership requirements for organizations like the Military Order of the Purple Heart and American Gold Star Mothers have been amended to be less stringent. Congress may need to address membership issues for the approximately 100 Title 36 corporations, some of which have prohibitions against political activities. Title 36 corporations' charters often include prohibitions against political activities, such as contributing to or supporting political parties or candidates. Some organizations have requested Congress to remove these restrictions, as seen in the case of H.R. 6118 introduced by Representative James P. Moran in 2008. James P. Moran introduced H.R. 6118 (110th Congress) to remove political activities prohibition from Gold Star Wives' charter, citing it hindered advocacy for military families. The bill faced inaction in the Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security, and International Law. Questions arise on whether Title 36 corporations should engage in political activities and what defines political activities for them. The power to draft corporate charters for Title 36 corporations raises questions about defining political activities for them. Congress can include various elements in these charters, leading to confusion when corporations have both governmental and private sector attributes. This distinction is significant as governmental entities operate under different legal authorities and restrictions compared to private sector corporations. The National Veterans' Business Development Corporation (NVBDC) was declared a government corporation by the Department of Justice in 2004, but the 2004 Omnibus Appropriations Act clarified it as a private entity. Federal courts have been involved in determining the status of corporations, which is complicated by the lack of centralized oversight for congressionally chartered corporations. The federal management of chartered corporations is challenging due to their independence from departments and limited federal appointees. The Government Corporation Control Act provides tools for managing these corporations, but many are exempt from its provisions. Additionally, most congressionally chartered entities have perpetual succession, allowing them to operate indefinitely unless abolished by law. Chartered entities can continue to operate indefinitely without being abolished by law, often accused of expanding beyond their charters and developing protective networks."
