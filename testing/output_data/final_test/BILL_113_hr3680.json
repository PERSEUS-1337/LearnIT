Breast cancer is the most common cancer among American women, with 1 in 8 women developing invasive breast cancer in their lifetime. It is the second leading cause of cancer death in women, but death rates have decreased since 1989 due to early detection and improved treatment. The National Cancer Institute estimates $16.5 billion is spent annually on breast cancer treatment in the United States. The United States Government is dedicated to finding a cure for breast cancer, with significant funding allocated for research. In Fiscal Year 2012, $800 million was dedicated by the National Institutes of Health, and $120 million by the Department of Defense's Breast Cancer Research Program. Despite reductions in funding from the National Cancer Institute and the Department of Defense in 2012, the U.S. is projected to spend $925 million on breast cancer research in Fiscal Year 2013. Additional private sector support is encouraged to further advance research efforts. Research on breast cancer is crucial for finding a cure, especially with high diagnosis and death rates in the United States. Black women have the highest death rates and are 40% more likely to die than White women. Younger women are increasingly being diagnosed with aggressive forms of the disease. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among various racial and ethnic groups. Since 1990, death rates from breast cancer have dropped over 30 percent among various racial and ethnic groups. Clinical advances resulting from research have led to increased survival. In 2013, there were 2,240 new cases of invasive breast cancer and 410 deaths among men in the United States. There are currently over 2.9 million breast cancer survivors in the country, with estimated costs of $12.5 billion in lost productivity. Breast cancer mortality rates remain steady in the future, with a focus on early detection through mammograms and clinical exams. The Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF) is a highly efficient charity, with 91% of donations going towards research and awareness programs. Founded in 1993, BCRF has raised over $450 million for breast cancer research aimed at prevention and finding a cure. Susan G. Komen for the Cure has funded research and community services in numerous states and countries. Over the past 5 years, the organization has allocated more than 80 cents of every dollar towards its mission to end breast cancer. Since 1982, Susan G. Komen has invested over $2 billion in saving lives. The BCRF and Susan G. Komen have collectively invested over $2 billion in research funding to end breast cancer and support patients and families. They continue to advance research and support programs for those affected by the disease. SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS.\n\nThe Secretary of the Treasury will mint and issue $1 silver coins with specific weight, diameter, and composition. These coins will be legal tender and considered numismatic items.\n\nSEC. 4. DESIGN OF COINS. The design of the coins minted under this Act will symbolize the fight against breast cancer, with inscriptions including the face value, year \"2018\", and words like \"Liberty\" and \"In God We Trust\". The design will be chosen by the Secretary through a design competition. Compensation will be provided to the winner for designing the obverse. The design competition for coins minted under this Act will provide compensation for the winner to design the obverse and reverse. The competition will be judged by an expert jury chaired by the Secretary and consisting of members from the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee and the Commission of Fine Arts. Proposals can be submitted by artists, engravers of the United States Mint, and the general public, with a preference for 3-dimensional designs. The Secretary will determine compensation for the winning design, not less than $5,000, and consider it when determining the sale price. Coins minted under this Act will be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities, and the Secretary may only issue them during a 1-year period starting on January 1, 2018. The Secretary will sell coins at a price including face value, surcharge, and design costs. Bulk sales will be discounted, and prepaid orders will receive a reasonable discount. Surcharges will also be applied. All sales of coins minted under this Act will include a $10 surcharge per coin. The surcharges received will be split equally between Susan G. Komen for the Cure in Dallas, Texas, and the Breast Cancer Research Foundation in New York, for furthering research. Recipients of the surcharge will be audited, and there are limitations on the surcharge. The surcharge for issuing commemorative coins under this Act cannot exceed the annual limit set by section 5112(m)(1) of title 31, United States Code. The Secretary of the Treasury may provide guidance on this limitation. SEC. 8. FINANCIAL ASSURANCES. The Secretary will ensure that minting and issuing coins under this Act will not cost the US Government. No funds will be disbursed until the total cost of designing and issuing all authorized coins is recovered by the US Treasury."
