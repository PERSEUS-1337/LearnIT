    "content": "Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure governs the procedures for obtaining a search warrant in federal court, requiring probable cause for the search. It allows for extraterritorial warrants in limited instances, with specific criteria to be met. The amendment to Rule 41 would expand DOJ's ability to seek extraterritorial warrants, allowing for remote access to search electronic storage media and seize electronically stored information. This includes instances where the location of the target is unknown, broadening the scope of search warrants in federal court. The amendment to Rule 41 would expand DOJ's ability to seek extraterritorial warrants for remote access to search electronic storage media and seize stored information. This technology, known as \"network investigative techniques\" (NIT), allows for gathering metadata and content from a target's computer. The use of Network Investigative Techniques (NIT) allows for accessing a target's computer's IP address and data stored on it, like email communications or photographs. Court cases in 2007 and 2013 involved obtaining warrants to access this information for investigations into bomb threats. The FBI used phishing attacks to gather information from target computers, including IP addresses, MAC addresses, open communication ports, running programs, operating system details, web browser information, time zone data, and URLs. This method helped identify a suspect in Tehran, Iran. Additionally, the DOJ targeted nefarious websites, such as in Operation Torpedo to dismantle a child pornography network. The FBI conducted a large-scale operation to take down an online child pornography network that used the Tor network for anonymity. A warrant was issued to install a NIT to collect IP addresses and other identifying information from visitors. This led to the arrest of 14 individuals on child pornography charges. The FBI also mentioned the ability to remotely access devices to activate microphones and cameras without user knowledge. The proposed Rule 41 amendment was influenced by a 2013 case where a government request for covert searches on an unknown computer in an unknown location was denied by Magistrate Judge Stephen Smith. The government sought access to IP addresses, Internet activity records, and camera photos, but the application was rejected due to territorial limitations and lack of specific target location information. Judge Smith found that the government's application failed to meet the Fourth Amendment's particularity requirement as the target's location was unknown, risking innocent computers being targeted. The proposed Rule 41 amendment was prompted by situations where law enforcement knew the device to be searched but not its location. The proposed Rule 41 amendment allows law enforcement to conduct surveillance on multiple computers in different jurisdictions, even if the location of the target device is unknown. The Supreme Court transmitted the proposed rule change to Congress, and unless Congress enacts legislation in response, the rule will take effect on December 1, 2016. Senator Ron Wyden and Representative Ted Poe introduced bills to reject the rule change. The proposed Rule 41 amendment, which allows law enforcement to conduct surveillance on multiple computers in different jurisdictions, will not take effect as per the Supreme Court order. One rationale for the amendment is to address situations where the government knows the computer to be searched but not its location, often due to criminals using anonymizing technologies like proxy servers to mask their IP addresses. The proposed Rule 41 amendment allows law enforcement to conduct remote searches on electronic storage media located within or outside the district if the location has been concealed through technological means. This addresses the issue of knowing the computer to be searched but not its location, as seen in a case cited by the DOJ. The proposed Rule 41 amendment allows for remote searches on electronic storage media in any district where crime-related activities may have occurred and if the target's location has been concealed through technology. This would also authorize \"remote access\" searches, not currently explicitly allowed. Additionally, it addresses the need for searching multiple computers in various districts during large-scale computer crime investigations. The proposed Rule 41 amendment allows for remote searches on electronic storage media in any district where crime-related activities may have occurred. DOJ seeks authorization for investigations of large-scale online attacks, such as botnets, spanning multiple districts. The proposed Rule 41 amendment allows for remote searches on electronic storage media in any district where crime-related activities may have occurred, including investigations of violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030(a)(5) involving protected computers in multiple districts. The Advisory Committee received comments both supporting and opposing the amendment, with concerns raised about potential privacy violations and forum shopping. Commenters also argued in favor of the rule change based on DOJ's need to conduct remote searches in certain cases. The DOJ has faced challenges in remotely searching a target's computer without knowing the location. They argue that criminals are increasingly using anonymizing techniques, making it difficult for law enforcement to locate them. The proposed Rule 41 amendment would allow for remote searches on electronic storage media in any district where crime-related activities may have occurred. The National Association of Assistant United States Attorneys and the DOJ argue that coordinating requests from multiple districts in botnet investigations wastes resources and causes delays. Opponents of the proposed Rule 41 amendment claim it could violate the Fourth Amendment's particularity requirement. Rule 41 may allow practices that do not meet the particularity requirement, especially with \"watering hole\" attacks. Civil liberties groups are concerned that innocent individuals could be targeted due to the government's broad surveillance tactics. Targeted surveillance efforts could also inadvertently involve innocent third parties. The proposed Rule 41 amendment raises concerns about government searches without probable cause, potential for infecting innocent devices, and allowing searches of multiple computers with one warrant without demonstrating probable cause for each. Multiple-location search warrants must have sufficient probable cause for each location. The proposed Rule 41 amendment raises concerns about government searches without probable cause, potential for infecting innocent devices, and allowing searches of multiple computers with one warrant without demonstrating probable cause for each. One commenter argues for the need for particularity in eavesdropping cases. The Advisory Committee included a Committee Note to Rule 41, stating that the Fourth Amendment standards for warrants in electronic searches are left to ongoing case law development. Some privacy advocates believe the proposed Rule 41 amendment will be ineffective, as it allows for remote access searches without sufficient safeguards. They argue that Title III of the Wiretap Act should be used for certain situations involving electronic communications interception in real time, as it provides more robust procedural safeguards than a traditional warrant. Title III provides more robust procedural safeguards than a traditional warrant, including limitations on surveillance and minimizing irrelevant communications. It should be applied to remote access searches involving electronic communications interception in real time, rather than just relying on Rule 41. The proposed amendment to Title III raises concerns about the installation of malware or spyware on a target computer for collecting information. Some argue that it may not meet the Fourth Amendment standard for covert-entry remote access searches. Others believe that using malware and zero-day exploits is more invasive than other permissible methods. The use of malware and zero-day exploits is considered more invasive than other permissible searches due to unpredictable and irreversible consequences. Poorly designed malware could destroy data or corrupt the operating system, posing risks of spreading to bad actors. The Judicial Conference notes that the rule does not prejudge constitutional issues, leaving them to be resolved case by case. Some commenters challenge the sufficiency of notice requirements under the proposed rule. One privacy advocate criticized the proposed rule for lessening notice requirements, arguing that officers would only need to make reasonable efforts to serve a copy of the warrant, rather than providing it directly. The advocate highlighted challenges in providing notice in common situations, such as targets accessing wireless networks in public places. The Advisory Committee defended the proposed notice requirements, stating they aim to mirror those for physical searches, which may not always allow for direct notice. The current rule does not require actual notice but rather notice be given to the person from whom the property was taken. One commenter suggested notice should be given to both the owner of a computer and others who may have used it, but this was rejected. The government argued that providing notice to each customer would be burdensome. Several commenters raised concerns about potential delays in giving notice as the proposed requirement only asks for \"reasonable efforts\" to provide it. The proposed notice requirement for Rule 41(f)(3) only requires \"reasonable efforts\" for notice, not prompt notice. Concerns were raised about hindering judicial review due to ex parte proceedings and lack of technical expertise in the judiciary. Good faith is also a key consideration. The good faith exception to the exclusionary rule allows unlawfully obtained evidence to be admissible if obtained in reasonable reliance on an invalidated search warrant. Qualified immunity protects government officials from civil liability if their conduct does not violate clearly established rights. Courts can address these procedural questions before the constitutional merits. Some argue that qualified immunity and good faith could prevent judicial review of untested search and seizure techniques. Concerns about forum shopping arise with remote searches under Rule 41. Critics question the process of changing the rule, suggesting that such sensitive topics should undergo formal congressional lawmaking rather than rulemaking. The proposed changes to FRCrmP Rule 41 are not a Congressional amendment and should be handled through Congress rather than judicial rulemaking. Critics argue that expanding magistrates' authority in this manner should be accomplished through formal congressional lawmaking. The current Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure does not explicitly address \"remote access\" searches, leading to judges having to interpret and apply the rule as needed. The Department of Justice has obtained warrants for remote access searches over the past 15 years, including accessing metadata and content from criminals' devices. However, the current rule limits judges to issuing warrants within their jurisdiction, which poses challenges when the location of the target device is unknown due to the use of anonymizing technology by criminals. The Department of Justice has requested changes to Rule 41 to allow remote access searches of hidden computers and use one warrant for multiple computers in hacking cases. The amendments have been approved by the Judicial Conference and are pending before Congress, set to take effect on December 1, 2016. Opponents argue it could violate Fourth Amendment privacy rights. The proposed rule change to Rule 41 would allow remote access searches of hidden computers and use one warrant for multiple computers in hacking cases. Opponents argue it could undermine Fourth Amendment privacy protections, while DOJ and the Judicial Conference claim it only changes venue requirements. The final proposed amendment has been transmitted from the Supreme Court to Congress. A judge in any district where a crime may have occurred can issue a warrant for remote access to search and seize electronic information if the location is concealed or in cases of damaged protected computers in multiple districts. The executing officer must provide a copy of the warrant and a receipt to the person from whom the property was taken. When a warrant is issued for remote access to search electronic information, the officer must make efforts to serve a copy of the warrant and receipt on the person whose property was searched or who possessed the information seized. Service can be done through any means, including electronic methods."
