It establishes thresholds to determine cost overruns in programs, with breaches requiring notification to Congress by the Department of Defense. In the early days of the Reagan Administration, high-profile weapon systems like the Black Hawk helicopter and the Patriot missile system faced significant cost overruns. The Nunn-McCurdy Act was created to address cost overruns in defense programs, spearheaded by Senator Sam Nunn and Representative David McCurdy. It aimed to expose cost overruns to force the Department of Defense to control expenses. The provision was intended to prompt senior Pentagon officials to reassess the value of programs with escalating costs. The Nunn-McCurdy Act was established to tackle cost overruns in defense programs, led by Senator Sam Nunn and Representative David McCurdy. It aimed to reveal cost overruns to compel the Department of Defense to manage expenses. The Act categorizes breaches as significant or critical based on cost increases. The Program Unit Cost (PAUC) and Procurement Unit Cost (PUC) are key metrics used by the Department of Defense to track cost growth in defense programs. According to Title 10 of the U.S. Code, DOD is required to establish a baseline description of all Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs) when the program officially starts. This baseline description, contained in the Acquisition Program Baseline (APB), includes information on the program's planned cost, schedule, and performance. APBs can only be revised at program milestones. The Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) is required to initiate a program and can only be revised at milestone reviews, when full rate production begins, due to major program restructuring, as a result of a program breach, or if the program has significantly changed. Current APBs cannot be revised to avoid a Nunn-McCurdy breach. Original baseline estimate is the cost estimate in the first APB prepared before entering \"engineering and manufacturing development\" or at program initiation. It can only be revised in case of a critical Nunn-McCurdy breach. Current baseline estimate is the most recently revised APB baseline estimate. In June 2015, DOD released a list of Nunn-McCurdy breaches from 2007-2015, totaling 37 breaches. Most breaches occurred in the production phase. The number of Nunn-McCurdy breaches has decreased in recent years, dropping from an average of six breaches annually from 2007-2010 to just two breaches from 2011-2015. Possible reasons for this decline include constrained budgets, improved cost estimating, fewer new starts, cancellation of troubled programs, and the impact of acquisition professionals trained under the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act. The continuity and consistency of actions taken by the office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (AT&L) have had a positive influence on acquisition program results. Under Secretary Frank Kendall and his team have been the longest-serving AT&L leadership, which could be affecting the culture of the acquisition workforce. The Budget Control Act expiration, new administration, and upcoming acquisition programs like the next-generation bomber and Ohio-class submarine replacement may impact cost growth trends in the acquisition workforce. Program managers must submit quarterly unit cost reports promptly, especially if they suspect a significant Nunn-McCurdy breach. Service acquisition executives review these reports to determine breach occurrences. When a breach is determined based on a quarterly unit cost report, notification to Congress must be submitted within 45 days. The notification must include 17 data elements, such as reasons for cost increase, program completion status, and actions taken to control cost growth. The Department of Defense (DOD) must notify Congress within 45 days of a breach based on a quarterly unit cost report. The notification includes data on cost increase reasons, program status, and actions taken to control cost growth. For significant breaches, no further action is required, but for critical breaches, DOD must conduct a root-cause analysis to determine factors leading to cost growth and assess estimated program costs with current requirements. The program's estimated cost must be reassessed, including potential modifications and alternatives, as well as the impact on funding from other programs. If the program does not meet certain requirements, it must be terminated unless the Secretary of Defense certifies its importance to national security and reasonable cost estimates. The program must be restructured to address cost growth, with prior milestone approval rescinded and new approval required before any contract actions. DOD must notify Congress of funding changes to cover cost growth and hold regular reviews. A Nunn-McCurdy breach can occur for reasons unrelated to program management. For example, DOD planned to buy 24,000 Small Diameter Bomb Increment I units but reduced the order. The Department of Defense planned to buy 24,000 Small Diameter Bomb Increment I units but cut the order in half to 12,600 due to updated inventory assessment. The per unit cost decreased from $24,000 to $23,000, but the program acquisition unit cost increased by 17% due to sunk costs being spread over fewer units. This breach triggered a significant milestone approval rescindment requirement, which was later exempted by Congress in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012. The amended statute allows for a Nunn-McCurdy breach exception if the program acquisition unit cost or procurement unit cost would not have increased by more than 5% of the current baseline estimate or 10% of the original baseline estimate due to a change in the number of units purchased. The Secretary of Defense must provide Congress with a written determination within 60 days, explaining the basis for the exception. The Nunn-McCurdy Act has been amended multiple times, with a significant change in reporting requirements in the FY2006 National Defense Authorization Act. The time from a critical breach to program certification by the Secretary of Defense to Congress can be up to 255 days. The FY2006 changes to the Nunn-McCurdy Act increased the number of programs breaching Nunn-McCurdy, with 11 programs re-categorized as having significant breaches. Congress aimed to encourage more realistic cost estimates and aggressive management of programs. The FY2009 Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform included a requirement for programs with critical breaches to be presumed terminated unless certified by the Secretary of Defense. The Nunn-McCurdy Act underwent changes in FY2006 to address programs with cost growth and schedule delays. Congress required revoking milestone approvals, restructuring programs, and providing explanations for cost growth. The FY2012 NDAA waived milestone rescission for programs with cost growth due to strategic decisions. No significant changes have been made to the Act since then. Reporting timelines for Nunn-McCurdy have been adjusted. The Nunn-McCurdy Act reporting timelines have been amended multiple times since its enactment in 1983. Initially, there was a 97-day limit for reporting critical breaches, but now it can take up to 195 days. Congress has used the act not only for reporting but also for managing cost growth in recent years. Some analysts believe it has been effective in informing Congress about cost overruns in MDAPs. The Nunn-McCurdy Act provides Congress with visibility into cost performance of MDAPs experiencing cost growth. While it helps improve weapon system acquisitions, some analysts believe it lacks comprehensive reporting as program managers may manipulate data to avoid breaches. For example, the Marine Corps AH-1Z program reduced planned purchases to lower costs and avoid breaching the act. The program manager reduced planned helicopter purchases to avoid a Nunn-McCurdy breach, potentially depriving Congress of crucial budgetary information. Analysts argue that Nunn-McCurdy reporting is not comprehensive as it does not cover all life-cycle costs, such as operations and support. O&S costs, which make up a significant portion of total life-cycle costs, are often overlooked in decision-making during the acquisition process. Decisions at Milestone B and Milestone C can impact acquisition costs and long-term O&S costs. Lack of O&S data hinders budget decisions for DOD and Congress. Nunn-McCurdy is seen as a tool to manage MDAPs, with some advocating for stricter measures. Good O&S data can improve cost estimates for future programs and provide insight into acquisition trade-offs. While Nunn-McCurdy is a good reporting mechanism, it is not an effective program management tool. Cost growth in MDAPs has decreased in recent years, but few attribute this to the Nunn-McCurdy Act. Congress has pursued acquisition reform, but there has been little effort to use Nunn-McCurdy to manage cost growth in MDAPs. A Nunn-McCurdy breach usually does not result in program cancellation, but there have been exceptions like the Navy Area Defense program in 2001. In July 2008, the Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter program was cancelled due to a Nunn-McCurdy breach. The Secretary of the Army justified the cancellation, citing invalid cost and schedule. The Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009 amended the Nunn-McCurdy Act, introducing a \"presumption of termination\" for programs with critical breaches. The Nunn-McCurdy Act allows for termination of programs with critical breaches unless a certification is submitted to Congress. Unrealistically low cost estimates at program inception are a primary cause of cost growth, leading to Nunn-McCurdy breaches. Gary Payton linked unrealistically optimistic estimates to Nunn-McCurdy breaches in 2006. In a presentation titled Nunn-McCurdy Breaches, it was argued that unrealistic cost estimates lead to lower budgets, industry bidding below budget, and eventual breaches. More realistic cost estimates could prevent breaches, and there have been proposals to apply the Nunn-McCurdy approach to other acquisitions or agencies. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2010 includes provisions similar to the Nunn-McCurdy Act, requiring reporting on major intelligence programs with cost growth exceeding baseline estimates. The Department of Homeland Security Headquarters Reform and Improvement Act of 2015 also implements a Nunn-McCurdy-type approach for DHS acquisitions. Congress has used the Nunn-McCurdy Act as both a reporting and management tool by amending it over the last 25 years to increase visibility into MDAP cost growth. This includes adding thresholds to measure cost growth and improving data reliability. The Act has been enhanced to provide information on programs exceeding 15% and 20% cost growth or 180 days and 365 days schedule slip. The Nunn-McCurdy Act serves as a management tool for Congress to address cost growth in defense programs. The Ford-class aircraft carrier program has experienced significant cost increases, but has not breached Nunn-McCurdy thresholds due to its multi-ship nature. Congress may need to clarify the Act's role in oversight to amend it effectively in the future. Congress may consider designating individual carrier procurement efforts as major subprograms for Nunn-McCurdy reporting requirements, similar to the approach taken with the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle in the FY2012 NDAA. Some analysts argue that the current statute results in delays in addressing critical breaches in defense programs. Some analysts suggest shortening Nunn-McCurdy timelines for reporting critical breaches to Congress, potentially by notifying Congress earlier based on Unit Cost or Contract Performance Reports. DOD acknowledges the challenge of determining breach timing. Timing of breach determinations under Nunn-McCurdy is challenging, with extensive discussion and deliberation within the department before formal breach notification to Congress. Premature breach indications from contractors or program managers could lead to cost reductions or program descope by senior leadership. Using Unit Cost Reports or Contractor Performance Reports for breach determinations may hinder DOD's ability to manage programs and control cost growth. Congress may consider extending Nunn-McCurdy reporting requirements to operations and support costs to aid in budget prioritization and cost tracking for future analysis. Congress may set budget priorities and track cost data for analysis. One option is to require the Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation office to compare original O&S cost estimates to current actual costs for ongoing programs. The reliability of available data determines the viability of these options. SAR data may not be reliable for analyzing Nunn-McCurdy breaches, as it can be amended. For example, the Chemical Demilitarization-Assembled Chemical Weapons Alternatives program was initially reported as a significant breach but later determined to have a critical breach. The program had a critical breach, not a significant breach, as reported to Congress. Information on the critical breach was included in the December 2010 SAR. SAR data may not accurately reflect the timing of Nunn-McCurdy breaches. In its 2013 Annual Report, DOD published data on programs with Nunn-McCurdy breaches. The Nunn-McCurdy Act was signed into law in 1982 by President Ronald Reagan. The Government Accountability Office published a report in 2011 on Nunn-McCurdy cost breaches in defense acquisition programs. The data in the report was the most comprehensive at the time, but subsequent restatements of program data were not included in the report. The Nunn-McCurdy Act, signed into law in 1982, was a response to cost growth in major defense systems. Senator Sam Nunn introduced an amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization Act of 1982 to notify Congress of cost increases in MDAPs. The purpose was to control rising costs and ensure spending priorities aligned with national strategy. Senator Nunn highlighted the escalating unit costs of defense systems, emphasizing the need for cost control measures. Senator Nunn introduced an amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization Act of 1982 to hold Pentagon officials and defense contractors accountable for managing costs. The amendment aimed to assess the effectiveness of DOD's acquisition process. Despite initial opposition, it passed by a vote of 94-0 and was included in the Act. The 1982 Department of Defense Authorization Act introduced thresholds for significant and critical breaches in cost increases for Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs). A significant breach occurred when the Program Acquisition Unit Cost (PAUC) or Procurement Unit Cost (PUC) increased by more than 15%, while a critical breach happened when the increase was over 25%. Program managers were required to submit quarterly unit cost reports under this act. Under the 1982 Department of Defense Authorization Act, program managers had to submit quarterly unit cost reports. If a breach was suspected, an immediate report had to be submitted to the service secretary. If a breach was confirmed, Congress had to be notified promptly with a detailed report within 30 days. This report included reasons for cost increase, personnel responsible for management, actions taken to control costs, performance changes, contractor information, and an index of previous documents provided to Congress. The Nunn-McCurdy Act required the secretary to certify to Congress within 60 days if a critical breach occurred in a program, stating its importance to national security, lack of cost-effective alternatives, reasonable cost estimates, and sufficient management structure. Failure to submit timely reports resulted in no additional funds for the program. This statute applied to programs with cost overruns in FY1982. Dave McCurdy, as chairman of the House Armed Services Committee Special Panel on Defense Procurement Procedures, conducted hearings on weapon system cost growth. The panel aimed to improve Congress's ability to review and evaluate major weapons systems' cost categories. Senator Nunn and Representative McCurdy worked to make the reporting requirements from the FY1982 Defense Authorization Act permanent. The Department of Defense Authorization Act of 1983, signed into law by President Ronald Reagan, included the Nunn-McCurdy Act. This Act established reporting requirements for weapon system cost overruns. The Nunn-McCurdy Act, part of the FY1983 Defense Authorization Act, modified reporting requirements for weapon system cost overruns. It redefined Program Acquisition Unit Cost and Procurement Unit Cost, established cost growth baseline, and set thresholds for measuring cost growth. The Nunn-McCurdy Act, part of the FY1983 Defense Authorization Act, introduced reporting requirements for weapon system cost overruns. Program managers were required to submit quarterly unit cost reports and immediately report breaches to the secretary concerned. The original act included inflation in breach determinations. The Nunn-McCurdy Act, part of the FY1983 Defense Authorization Act, introduced reporting requirements for weapon system cost overruns. Program managers had to submit quarterly unit cost reports and report breaches immediately to the concerned secretary. The FY1983 NDAA made changes to the reporting requirements, including the removal of the index of all previous testimony and documents provided to Congress on estimated costs, and added new requirements such as cost and schedule variance information and changes to performance or schedule milestones contributing to cost growth. The FY1985 Department of Defense Authorization Act amended the definition of procurement unit cost and major contract. The Act required the service secretary to review unit cost reports for breaches and notify Congress within 30 days. Failure to report timely could result in a funding prohibition, which could be waived by the House and Senate Armed Services Committees. The FY1985 Department of Defense Authorization Act revised the definitions of procurement unit cost and major contract. It also introduced reporting requirements for SARs, including status reports for MDAPs in certain fiscal quarters. The threshold for major contracts was increased to $40 million in 1986. The FY1985 act introduced reporting requirements for SARs, stating that a report was not needed if there were minimal changes in program cost or schedule. Reporting requirements under Nunn-McCurdy do not apply if 90% of end units have been delivered or expenditures made. Timeline for SAR submission to Congress was also changed. The FY1985 act extended the deadline for submitting SARs to Congress to 60 days after the President sends the budget and 45 days after the end of other quarters. It also changed the deadline for program managers to submit unit cost reports to within seven days of the budget submission. The FY1990 and 1991 NDAA added the role of the Service Acquisition Executive to the Nunn-McCurdy Act. The Nunn-McCurdy Act, amended in FY1990 and 1991, now allows for a SAR to exclude a status report if there is less than a 15% increase in program acquisition unit cost. The baseline for measuring a breach is the previous fiscal year's SAR or the SAR submitted in connection with a breach. The Nunn-McCurdy Act was amended to change the consequences of failing to submit required reports for breaches. If reports are not filed in a timely manner, funds cannot be obligated for certain program aspects until reports are submitted. Additionally, the deadline for submitting unit cost reports was changed to within seven days of the end of the quarter. The Nunn-McCurdy Act was amended to change reporting requirements for breaches, including timelines for notifications and certifications to Congress. The FY1993 NDAA modified the Nunn-McCurdy thresholds to at least 15% and at least 25%. When a program breaches these thresholds, DOD must submit a SAR to Congress. The FY1993 NDAA amended the Nunn-McCurdy Act to change reporting requirements for breaches, including timelines for notifications and certifications to Congress. It added flexibility for submitting a SAR to Congress for the quarter in which a breach occurred or the preceding quarter. Timeline changes included extending the deadline for submitting quarterly unit cost reports to 30 calendar days after the quarter end and notifying Congress of a breach within 30 days of the service acquisition executive's determination. The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (FASA) amended the definition of Procurement Unit Cost and Baseline Estimate. It required the Secretary to develop a baseline description with a cost estimate for each major milestone. FASA also changed the way cost growth is measured. FASA changed the measurement of cost growth to be in constant base year dollars, excluding inflation. The FY2006 NDAA amended Nunn-McCurdy to include the original baseline estimate as a standard and introduced terms like significant and critical cost growth. These changes aimed to prevent DOD from avoiding breaches by re-baselining programs, encouraging more realistic cost estimates and better management of programs. The FY2007 NDAA expanded the baseline estimate definition to include the original description established before program development. The FY2009 NDAA further refined cost measurement criteria to prevent cost growth on programs. The FY2007 NDAA expanded baseline estimate definition to include original description. The FY2009 NDAA refined cost measurement criteria to prevent cost growth. The FY2009 Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act applied Nunn-McCurdy to major subprograms of MDAPs. The Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act of 2009 introduced changes to the Nunn-McCurdy Act, including conducting analysis for critical breaches and cost projections for program completion. The FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 112-81) requires a program to be terminated unless the Secretary of Defense provides certifications and a root-cause analysis to Congress. If not terminated, the program must be restructured to address cost growth, have milestone approvals revoked, and report funding changes to cover cost increases. In the FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 112-81), Congress waived the requirement to rescind milestone approval for programs with cost growth due to changing the quantity of items purchased. A program can avoid milestone approval rescission if the acquisition unit cost would not increase by more than 5% of the current baseline estimate or 10% of the original baseline estimate, and the change in quantity was not due to increasing costs, schedule delays, or meeting requirements. The Secretary of Defense must submit a written determination to Congress within 60 days of the SAR submission for DOD to invoke this exception. In the FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act, Congress waived the requirement to rescind milestone approval for programs with cost growth due to changing the quantity of items purchased. The Secretary of Defense must submit a written determination to Congress within 45 days of the President's budget submission, stating that the program acquisition unit cost would not increase by more than 5% of the current baseline estimate or 10% of the original baseline estimate, and the change in quantity was not due to increasing costs, schedule delays, or meeting requirements."
