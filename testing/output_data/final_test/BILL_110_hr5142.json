Additionally, there is a temporary increase in the child tax credit. The \"Family Economic Stimulus Act of 2008\" includes a temporary increase in the child tax credit to $1,200 for the first taxable year beginning in 2008. Additionally, there is a 2008 stimulus credit outlined in section 6428 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Family Economic Stimulus Act of 2008\" provides a tax credit of $400 ($800 for joint returns) for eligible individuals in their first taxable year beginning in 2008. The credit is reduced to zero if the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income exceeds the threshold amount of $115,000 for joint filers and heads of household. The \"Family Economic Stimulus Act of 2008\" offers a tax credit of $400 ($800 for joint returns) for eligible individuals in their first taxable year starting in 2008. The credit decreases to zero if the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income surpasses $115,000 for joint filers and heads of household. The credit is nonrefundable and is treated as a personal credit under the tax code. An eligible individual excludes estates, trusts, nonresident aliens, and individuals for whom a deduction under section 151 is claimed by another taxpayer. Section 151 allows a tax credit for eligible individuals in their first taxable year starting in 2008. The credit is reduced by refunds and credits received under subsection (e) and is split equally for joint returns. Each eligible individual's first taxable year starting in 2006 is treated as having made a payment against the tax imposed by chapter 1 in an amount equal to the advance refund amount. The advance refund amount is the credit that would have been allowed for that taxable year if certain conditions were met. The text chunk discusses the timing of payments for any overpayment attributable to a specific subsection of the tax code. The Secretary is required to refund or credit the overpayment as quickly as possible, ideally before 120 days after the overpayment date. The text chunk specifies the deadline for refunds or credits for overpayments under a specific subsection of the tax code, with no interest allowed on overpayments after December 31, 2008. Additionally, a conforming amendment and clerical amendment are made to related sections of the tax code. The text chunk outlines amendments related to the 2008 stimulus credit and alternative extended-benefits indicators for State unemployment compensation. It also mandates the distribution of State-specific information packets. The amendment to section 3304 of the Internal Revenue Code mandates State distribution of information packets on unemployment insurance eligibility conditions, effective for certifications of States from 2008 onwards, with an exception for State laws before July 1, 2009."
