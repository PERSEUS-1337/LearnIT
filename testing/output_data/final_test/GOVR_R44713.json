    "content": "The United States has strengthened ties with the African Union (AU) since establishing a diplomatic mission in Addis Ababa in 2006. President Obama addressed the AU in 2015, focusing on democracy, governance, and security. The Obama Administration aimed to support AU efforts in democratic reform, economic development, and capacity building. The United States has increased cooperation with the African Union (AU) in areas such as agriculture, education, peace, and security. Direct annual U.S. assistance to the AU for nonmilitary activities has ranged from $521,000 to $1 million in recent years, with a requested increase to $2.4 million for FY2017. Additional one-off U.S. efforts have supported special AU activities like the response to the Ebola outbreak and the establishment of an African Centre for Disease Control. The United States has increased cooperation with the African Union (AU) in various areas, including agriculture, education, peace, and security. U.S. aid funding supports AU objectives indirectly through programs like Feed the Future. The bulk of U.S. aid for the AU has traditionally supported military peacekeeping missions, such as the AU Mission to Somalia (AMISOM) and the AU Mission in Sudan (AMIS). The African Union (AU) relies heavily on external funding for its program and security operations budgets, but is working to increase member state contributions. Congressional engagement with AU institutions has been limited but is growing, especially as U.S. funding for AU missions increases. Some Members of Congress have met with AU leaders to discuss common concerns. Limited congressional oversight has focused on the African Union (AU), despite potential for expanded U.S.-AU ties and cooperation. Areas of cooperation include peace and security, trade and investment, socioeconomic development, and science and technology. Some policymakers aim to counter objectionable efforts by individual AU members. The AU is being used by some African governments to further their own interests, which the US may seek to counter through engagement with AU institutions. This includes efforts to withdraw from the International Criminal Court, limit US financial support for AU military operations, subvert democratic processes, and restrict the rights of LGBTQ individuals. Some Members of Congress may want to tie US aid to the AU to programs that align with US objectives. The African Union (AU) is seen as bureaucratically cumbersome and technically weak, leading some in Congress to prefer bilateral relations with Africa over engaging with the AU. However, this approach may limit the US's ability to negotiate on issues like climate change and trade with the region as a whole. The AU, established in 2002, includes all African countries except Morocco and is based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The African Union (AU) was established in 2002 as the successor to the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to achieve the goals of the African Economic Community (AEC) Treaty. The AU aims to promote African regional economic integration, peace, security, democratic governance, human rights, and gender equality. The AU recognizes exceptions to noninterference in member states' affairs and can intervene in \"grave\" situations like crimes against humanity. It can also act to restore peace, reject unconstitutional changes of government, and combat terrorism. The creation of the AU was influenced by criticisms of the OAU's noninterference policy prioritizing sovereignty over human rights. The AU is more proactive in condemning unconstitutional changes in government and investigating such cases. The AU has faced criticism for its inactivity in addressing human rights abuses and providing immunity to heads of state facing ICC prosecution. In 2013, the AU celebrated its 50th anniversary and released Agenda 2063, a development plan focusing on improving standards of living, education, skills, and health for citizens. Agenda 2063 aims to improve living standards, education, health, gender equality, and youth empowerment. It also focuses on economic growth through agricultural investment, infrastructure development, and environmental sustainability. The agenda promotes regional integration, governance, human rights, and peace and security in Africa. The African Union (AU) focuses on enhancing performance monitoring, securing funding, and improving communications at all levels. Various donors support initiatives to strengthen the AU's organizational development and program implementation, including a World Bank program. The AU is a policymaking and diplomatic body involved in peace and security efforts, with the Assembly being its supreme decision-making organ supported by subsidiary institutions. The executive council coordinates the AU Assembly's work and elects the AU Commission (AUC) from the five sub-regions. The AU delegates goals to regional economic communities for economic growth and integration. The AUC implements various initiatives and manages relations with RECs. Key organs include the Peace and Security Council, Department of Political Affairs, and NEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency. The African Union (AU) has key organizations like the NEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency, specialized technical agencies, and working groups addressing various issues. The current AUC Chairperson is Dr. Dlamini-Zuma, whose term was extended until January 2017. Chadian President Idriss D\u00e9by was elected chair of the African Union in early 2016, succeeding Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe. The post is largely ceremonial and rotates annually, providing a platform for policy advocacy. The AUC faces challenges in resolving Africa's conflicts, promoting economic growth, and securing funding. Dlamini-Zuma's priorities as AU Chair include securing funding, streamlining the AU Commission, crisis resolution, post-conflict aid, election monitoring, and promoting regional economic growth and integration. Dlamini-Zuma's priorities as AU Chair include promoting regional economic growth, gender equity, and peace and security in Africa. She aims to ensure that the sale of Africa's natural resources benefits the economy and increase access to social services and jobs. Insecurity from armed conflict hinders investment and socioeconomic development in the region. The AU focuses on strengthening peace and security in Africa through various approaches, including promoting inclusive development, accountable governance, and conflict prevention. The African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA) plays a key role in managing conflicts and fostering stability on the continent. The Peace and Security Council (PSC) is the main decision-making body for security policies within the AU, with a mandate to prevent, manage, and resolve conflicts in Africa. The AU Department of Peace and Security consists of various units focusing on conflict prevention, management, peace support operations, defense, and security. The AU coordinates with Africa's RECs, the UN Security Council, and other international entities to mediate in armed conflicts and political crises. Currently, the AU is involved in resolving conflicts between Sudan and South Sudan, internal conflicts in Sudan, civil war in South Sudan, Burundi's political crisis, and mediation efforts led by EAC and IGAD. The AU has also intervened militarily in African crises on a first-response basis. The AU Department of Peace and Security coordinates with Africa's RECs, the UN Security Council, and other international entities to mediate in armed conflicts and political crises. The AU has intervened militarily in African crises on a first-response basis, with notable missions like AMISOM in Somalia and the authorization of the Multinational Joint Task Force to combat Boko Haram in the Lake Chad Basin region. The Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) combats Boko Haram in the Lake Chad Basin region with support from the United States. The African Union (AU) coordinates military responses in central Africa, including countering the Lord's Resistance Army. The AU aims to establish an African Standby Force (ASF) composed of five brigades for peacekeeping and conflict management, with slow progress but advancements made by all five forces. Development of the ASF brigades has been slow, but all five forces have made progress. The State Department's Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI) provides capacity building aid to ASF contributing countries. The United States has offered ASF-related support to the AU, and DOD has established liaison officers to regional brigade headquarters. In response to challenges faced by ECOWAS in marshaling troops for AFISMA in Mali in 2013, the AU established the African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises (ACIRC). The AU prioritizes the promotion and protection of human and peoples' rights according to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights. The African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, a binding AU document, outlines various human rights, duties, and freedoms for member states to enforce. The AU established the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights to help enforce the Charter and improve human rights protection in Africa. Despite challenges, the Charter remains crucial for justice administration in a continent where human rights abuses and violations of international law are prevalent. The African Union has established institutions like the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights in Tanzania, the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights in The Gambia, and an AU Commission on International Law in Ethiopia. These institutions aim to defend human rights, interpret human rights instruments, and promote legal research in Africa. However, activists have raised concerns about their effectiveness, as some member states have resisted their jurisdiction or decisions. The African Union has established various justice mechanisms, including special purpose commissions of inquiry and ad-hoc institutions like the AU-Senegalese hybrid court. One successful example was the trial of former Chadian dictator Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9, who was convicted of crimes against humanity. The AU is also tasked with establishing an independent hybrid court for war crimes in South Sudan, but has not taken concrete steps to do so. Key South Sudanese leaders reportedly oppose the court, fearing indictment and loss of power. The African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights (AfCHPR) in Arusha, Tanzania, has limited juridical record since its establishment in 2009. It has handled cases involving AU entities, member states, and individuals alleging violations of the Charter or other instruments. The court's focus has been on procedural issues, with few major international legal precedent-setting rulings. The African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights (AfCHPR) in Arusha, Tanzania, has the potential to act as a check on national judicial systems and address human rights violations in African countries. The court's ability to enforce its judgments and the impact of merging with the Court of Justice as the African Court of Justice and Human Rights (ACJHR) are still uncertain. The African Court of Justice and Human Rights (ACJHR) is proposed to replace the AfCHPR, with expanded jurisdiction over legal matters and disputes within the AU. However, establishment is pending as 15 member states need to ratify the protocols. The controversial 2014 statute does not clarify the relationship with the ICC. The planned AU court is seen as a rejection of the ICC's jurisdiction over genocide and serious international crimes. The protocol would protect AU heads of state from prosecution during their tenure, addressing concerns over the ICC's prosecution of African leaders. Some African countries, like Botswana, support the ICC, while the AU has criticized its politicization and misuse of indictments against African leaders. The AU Assembly criticized the ICC for politicization and misuse of indictments against African leaders. They declared immunity for sitting AU heads of state and high officials from international courts, requested suspension of ICC cases against Kenya's leaders, and called for reforms to the ICC's Rome Statute. The Assembly also pushed for the expansion of the AfCHPR mandate to include genocide and other high crimes. Despite repeated demands, their proposed reforms have gained little traction. The AU Assembly criticized the ICC for politicization and misuse of indictments against African leaders, declaring immunity for sitting AU heads of state and high officials from international courts. Despite calls for reforms, little traction has been gained. Other international courts like the ICTR and SCSL have played a role in addressing human rights crimes. The United States supports international courts like the ICTR and the SCSL, and backs the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) as a key strategy for Agenda 2063. NEPAD focuses on areas like agriculture, climate change, regional integration, human development, and governance, with funding from various donors. One of NEPAD's main programs is the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) aimed at boosting food and agriculture investment. The NEPAD-linked African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) is a voluntary process where participating states assess adherence to AU standards. It aims to improve state capacities, but lack of resources often hinders efforts. Other NEPAD initiatives include the Program for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA). The EU supports AU initiatives like PIDA and the Africa-EU Infrastructure Trust Fund by providing technical assistance, subsidies, grants, and guarantees. Other joint AU initiatives with international agencies include ARLI for ecosystem restoration and CLIMDEV Africa for climate change. Progress towards regional integration in Africa has been slow but is improving, with challenges including sovereignty concerns, economic disparities, protectionism, and institutional incompatibilities. Despite the presence of two multi-country central banks, there is not full participation from all countries. Regional integration in Africa faces challenges such as uneven member state performance, slow interstate travel and trade, and difficulties in macroeconomic convergence initiatives. Despite issues like poor infrastructure and high tariffs, some regions have made progress with regional passports, trade facilitation efforts, and improved communication links. Additionally, there have been advancements in developing regional electricity pools and natural gas trade. Despite challenges like poor infrastructure and high tariffs, regional economic integration in Africa is making progress. In June 2015, COMESA, EAC, and SADC formed the Tripartite Free Trade Area, while negotiations for the Continental Free Trade Area were launched by the AU. The goal is to integrate the eight RECs into a single continental customs union by 2017. Regional integration is a key goal of the U.S. Trade Africa presidential initiative. The U.S. Trade Africa presidential initiative aims to increase U.S. trade and investment in Africa through regional integration. Despite challenges, the AU has made rapid progress in institutional development and regional political unification. Financial resources remain a significant challenge for the AU. The AU faces challenges in securing financial resources to strengthen its capacities. While member states fund the AUC's operational budget, external donors cover 95% of the AU program budget. The AU has had to reduce its budget due to insufficient donor commitments, leading to efforts to enhance technical and fiscal management capacities. The organization aims to reduce reliance on external funding and increase funding from member states. The AU aims to fund its activities from member states' resources and reduce reliance on external funding. A new scale of assessment was adopted in June 2015 to have member states fund a percentage of the operational, program, and peace support operations budgets. A 0.2% levy on imports was instituted in July 2016 to further these goals. U.S.-AU ties have strengthened in recent years, with a higher profile in U.S.-African relations. President Obama addressed the African Union in July 2015, emphasizing the importance of democratic norms, adherence to term limits, and respect for human dignity. He also discussed peace, security, counterterrorism efforts, human rights, social equality, and the rule of law. Obama's engagement with the AU included meetings with AUC Commissioner Dlamini-Zuma in 2013 and 2014. In mid-2013 and 2014, President Obama engaged with the African Union on key topics such as U.S.-AU partnership, peace and security, development, women and youth, and trade and investment. The U.S. began closer ties with the AU in 2005, granting it international organization status and establishing the first AU ambassador in 2007. The U.S. AU mission (USAU) was initiated in 2006, with key goals under the Obama Administration to support the AU in democratic and electoral reform, and inclusive economic development. The AU plays a lead role in democratic and electoral reform, economic development, peace and security challenges, and human capacity projects. The US has been involved in conflict prevention, peace operations, and observer roles in peace negotiations. US aid to the AU for peace and security capacities is modest compared to other donors. The US provides logistical support to AU member states. The United States provides significant logistical support to AU peace operations, with funding totaling $1.8 billion for AMISOM and $472 million for AMIS. While the US also supports peace operations in Mali and CAR, its aid for non-security development activities is smaller compared to European donors. Direct funding for AU institutions from the US is limited. The United States provides limited direct funding for AU institutions, focusing on technical assistance and selected initiatives. Total U.S. aid for the AU is challenging to track but was estimated at $7.6 million in 2015. Most U.S. aid related to AU goals is provided on a bilateral basis or to regional RECs, rather than directly to the AU itself. Cooperation between the United States and the AU has increased in recent years, with key agreements signed in 2013. The United States has increased cooperation with the African Union through agreements signed in 2013, including support for the AU's Strategic Plan 2014-2017. This partnership focuses on peace and security, democracy, economic growth, and technical exchanges to strengthen democracy initiatives. The United States supports AU democracy strengthening initiatives by assisting in the implementation of the AU African Charter on Democracy, Elections, and Governance. This includes capacity-building of the African Governance Architecture and deploying advisors to support the AU's Democracy and Elections Assistance Unit. The partnership aims to improve electoral systems and increase African youth participation in democracy. The National Democratic Institute (NDI), an organization funded by the U.S. government, signed an MOU to increase African youth involvement in democratic processes. NDI also signed an MOU with the Pan African Parliament during a global summit of the Open Government Partnership, focusing on cooperation in various areas. The programs are supported by the U.S. National Endowment for Democracy (NED). Other areas of cooperation, mostly administered by USAID, include supporting AU development goals such as reducing maternal mortality and increasing intra-African trade. In 2013, USAID and the AU agreed to pursue geothermal energy development in East Africa. U.S. sectoral aid is funded through bilateral, sectoral, or regional programs, often in collaboration with other donors. Aid also supports the RECs in implementing programs linked to AU policies. U.S. and AU officials engage in dialogue on peace, security, criminal justice, and political crises. The U.S. and other donors support the African Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. The Budget Justification (CBJ) focuses on strengthening diplomatic and nonmilitary approaches to advocacy for implementation, policy harmonization, strategic communication, resource mobilization, and partnership within the AU. The goal is to develop AU public diplomacy tools and strategic communication capacities to drive reform across African countries, prevent conflict, and accelerate investment. The planned FY2017 U.S. assistance aims to support the AU 2014-2017 Strategic Plan and strengthen future prospective AU leadership through staffing and technical assistance for AUC departments. The AU is focusing on activities promoting human rights, youth empowerment, economic governance, and reducing illicit activities. Efforts include political consensus building, donor cooperation, private sector and civil society collaboration, and boosting youth employment. The request includes maintaining a rule of law adviser for the AU Department of Political Affairs. The future of US aid to the AU in FY2017 under the Trump Administration is uncertain. The current continuing resolution extends foreign aid funding at FY2016 levels. The AU is engaged in development efforts but faces challenges like political tensions and funding issues. Leadership changes could impact its goals, but overall policy objectives are set by member states. There is potential for increased cooperation with the AU for the United States. There is potential for expanded cooperation with the AU in security, political, and development goals. The AU can be an effective partner for trade, investment, and economic integration. Some policymakers see U.S.-AU engagement as a way to promote African solutions to African problems and advance national interests. However, AU bureaucracy may pose challenges. The AU can be an effective partner for trade, investment, and economic integration, but AU bureaucracy and heavyweight member states may hinder its effectiveness as a U.S. partner. The United States is likely to continue directing aid and diplomacy through bilateral and sub-regional channels, with the potential for expanded U.S.-AU engagement still uncertain."
