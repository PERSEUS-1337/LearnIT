    "content": "The Act titled \"Fair Access to Investment Research Act of 2015\" provides a safe harbor for investment fund research. The Securities and Exchange Commission will propose and adopt revisions to expand the safe harbor for covered investment fund research reports within a specified timeframe after the enactment of the Fair Access to Investment Research Act of 2015. The issuer's proposal to file, or filed, or effective, even if the broker or dealer participates in the registered offering of the covered investment fund's securities. It satisfies the conditions of section 230.139 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, for the Commission's rules and regulations under the Federal securities laws and any self-regulatory organization. The Commission will implement a safe harbor for covered investment fund research reports. The safe harbor for covered investment fund research reports conditions on the broker's initiation of research coverage, does not require registration as an investment company exceeding twelve months, and limits the minimum float provision. The self-regulatory organization cannot enforce rules that restrict a member's ability to publish research on a covered investment fund based on their participation in a registered offering or distribution of securities. They also cannot restrict a member's participation in a registered offering based on their publication of research, or require the filing of a research report with the organization. The Act allows covered investment fund research reports to be exempt from certain sections of the Investment Company Act of 1940. It also clarifies that the antifraud provisions of the Federal securities laws still apply, and self-regulatory organizations can supervise members' practices regarding these reports. (d) Interim Effectiveness of Safe Harbor.--After 120 days from enactment, if the Commission hasn't revised section 230.139 of title 17, a covered investment fund research report by a broker or dealer will be deemed compliant until the Commission revises it. The term \"covered investment fund research report\" refers to a report published by a broker about a covered investment fund or its securities. A \"covered investment fund\" includes registered investment companies or trusts with listed securities. A covered investment fund is a fund with securities listed on a national exchange, primarily consisting of commodities, currencies, or derivative instruments. Securities can be purchased or redeemed for a share of its assets. A research report excludes oral communication, and a self-regulatory organization is defined. A self-regulatory organization is defined as per the Securities Exchange Act of 1934."
