    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 30130.53 is added to the Revenue and Taxation Code, to read: 30130.53. The board will annually assess the impact of increased cigarette taxes on consumption in the state. If a decrease is directly linked to the tax, the board will evaluate the fiscal effect on various funds. The California Children and Families Trust Fund, established by Proposition 10 in 1998, and the General Fund receive revenues from specific sections. Funds from the California Tobacco Tax Act of 2015 Fund will be transferred to various funds to offset revenue decrease from additional taxes. The transfers will be made as determined by the board. The California Tobacco Tax Act of 2015 Fund is a trust fund established for specific purposes, and all revenues deposited into it shall be used only in accordance with those purposes. Funds from the Tobacco Prevention and Education Account will supplement programs at the State Department of Public Health, State Department of Education, and University of California. Funds from the Tobacco Disease Related Health Care Account will improve health care programs for families and children through the State Department of Health Care Services. Funds in the Tobacco Law Enforcement Account are available for enforcing laws regulating tobacco products, including preventing smuggling, counterfeiting, and sales to minors. Not more than 5 percent of funds from the California Tobacco Tax Act of 2015 Fund can be used for administrative costs. The Department of Justice, State Department of Public Health, State Department of Education, and State Department of Health Care Services must annually report on their websites how funds from the California Tobacco Tax Act of 2015 were spent. This act will only take effect if Senate Bill 591 is enacted by January 1, 2016, and is deemed urgent for public peace, health, or safety. The act aims to offset revenue decreases to various funds and supplement tobacco prevention programs, improve healthcare access for families and children, and enforce laws regulating tobacco products immediately."
