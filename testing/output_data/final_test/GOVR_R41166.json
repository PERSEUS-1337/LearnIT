    "content": "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) includes provisions for grandfathering existing health insurance plans, affecting most Americans' health coverage. This report describes grandfathered plans and summarizes ACA insurance reforms impacting them, such as medical loss ratios, dependent coverage, and preexisting condition coverage. It also discusses issues like possible loss of grandfathering status and analyzes the regulations' impact on existing health plans. Grandfathered health plans are existing group health plans or insurance coverage that individuals were enrolled in on the date of ACA's enactment. Current enrollees can re-enroll in these plans, and family members can also enroll if allowed by the plan's terms. New employees and their families can join grandfathered group plans. These plans are exempt from most new insurance reforms under ACA but must comply with certain requirements with different effective dates. Grandfathered health plans must comply with various reforms, including developing uniform explanation of coverage documents, reporting financial information to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, offering premium rebates if specified medical loss ratios are not met, and prohibiting lifetime limits on essential health benefits, rescissions, and extending dependent coverage to children under age 26. Grandfathered health plans must comply with reforms such as prohibiting waiting periods over 90 days, annual limits on essential health benefits, coverage exclusions for preexisting conditions, and extending dependent coverage to children under age 26. The provision of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will be effective for plan years starting on or after January 1, 2014, with an earlier effective date for children under age 19. The individual mandate requires most individuals to have health insurance coverage starting in 2014 or face a penalty. Minimum essential coverage must be maintained for oneself and dependents, including grandfathered plans. Compliance with the individual mandate is mainly relevant to plans in the individual market, as those enrolled in any employer plan will meet the mandate regardless of plan status. ACA does not specify which plan changes would result in loss of coverage. The ACA does not specify which plan changes would lead to loss of grandfathered status, including changes related to covered benefits, cost-sharing requirements, actuarial value, or insurance carrier. The only scenario specified for loss of grandfathered status is coverage provided under collective bargaining agreements. The ACA does not detail specific plan changes that would result in loss of grandfathered status, except for changes related to health insurance provided under collective bargaining agreements. Amendments made to conform with ACA requirements will not affect grandfathered status. The Departments issued rules identifying changes that would cause loss of grandfathered status, such as alterations to benefits, cost-sharing, employer contributions, and access to coverage. Continuous enrollment since enactment and termination of a collective bargaining agreement can also lead to loss of grandfathered status. The Departments issued rules identifying changes that would cause loss of grandfathered status, such as alterations to benefits, cost-sharing, employer contributions, and access to coverage. Transitional rules, federal enforcement statement, and potential impact on health plans were also included. Comments on the interim final rules were due August 16, 2010. The Departments have authority to promulgate regulations for health insurance market reforms and issue amendments. Administrative guidance may be issued to clarify rules for maintaining grandfathered health plan status. No exact timeline was specified for amendments or administrative guidance. The interim final rules did not specify a timeline for amendments or administrative guidance. Changes that could cause loss of grandfathered status include alterations to benefits, cost-sharing requirements, and employer contribution rates. The interim final rules outline changes that could lead to loss of grandfathered status, including alterations to benefits, cost-sharing requirements, and employer contribution rates. These changes involve employer contributions towards premiums, annual dollar limits, and adjustments based on specific criteria. The regulation imposed lifetime and annual limits on group health plans, with rules for loss of grandfathered status in case of certain changes like mergers or eligibility criteria adjustments. The regulation allows changes to be made to a plan or coverage after March 23, 2010 without losing grandfathered status, such as changes made through legally binding contracts, filings with State insurance departments, or written plan amendments adopted before that date. The regulation allows changes to be made to a plan or coverage after March 23, 2010 without losing grandfathered status, as long as the changes are adopted before June 14, 2010 and revoked or modified by the first day of the plan year starting on or after September 23, 2010. The Departments will consider good-faith efforts to comply with the rules and may disregard changes that only moderately exceed the allowable limits. The regulation allows changes to be made to a plan or coverage after March 23, 2010 without losing grandfathered status, as long as the changes are adopted before June 14, 2010. HHS stated it will not enforce ACA insurance reforms with respect to retiree-only coverage. The interim final rules include analysis of the potential impact of grandfathering rules on group health plans and coverage provided through the group and individual health insurance markets. Using data from an annual employer survey, the Departments analyzed changes to employer-sponsored health insurance from 2008 to 2009. The Departments estimated that half of all employer health plans would lose grandfathered status by 2013, with notable differences by firm size. For large employer plans, nearly 45% would lose status, while for small employer plans, about 66% would do so. Employers may behave differently under grandfathering rules, leading to low-range and high-range estimates for plans losing grandfathered status. The Departments estimated that a significant proportion of individual health plans would lose grandfathered status, exceeding the 40%-67% turnover rate. Over 2,000 submissions were received in response to the interim final rules, reflecting various perspectives on health plan regulations. The comments received on health plan regulations focused on issues such as prescription drug formularies, provider networks, cost-sharing, plan design, and funding. Health plans and employers sought more flexibility in plan changes while consumers generally supported the rules. State regulators offered recommendations that varied across different perspectives, all assuming the importance of maintaining grandfathered status. Plans and employers recommended changes to maintain grandfathered status. Plans and employers recommended more flexibility in changes to prescription drug formularies and provider networks to promote innovation and high-quality care, while consumers supported maintaining grandfathered status to prevent negative impacts on access to care. Regulators had differing views on the issue, with some suggesting loss of grandfathered status for significant provider network changes and others advocating for a more dynamic market approach. Additionally, plans and employers argued for changes to cost-sharing based on actuarial value rather than medical inflation. Consumers generally supported grandfathering rules for cost-sharing and plan structure, while also recommending further clarification of cost-sharing rules. State regulators had differing views, with one state suggesting more flexibility in cost-sharing rules and another recommending adding prescription drug copayments to the rules. Plans and employers advocated for greater flexibility in plan options, funding, issuer of coverage, employer contributions, and overall plan design. On November 17, 2010, an amendment was published to the interim final rules on grandfathered health plans, allowing group health plans to maintain grandfathered status by entering into a new policy, certificate, or contract of insurance. This addressed concerns and recommendations from health plans, employers, consumers, and regulators regarding the frequency and content of notices related to health plan information and insurance reforms. The amendment published on November 17, 2010, allows group health plans to maintain grandfathered status by switching insurance carriers. Retiree health benefits under the ACA depend on eligibility criteria, with options for separate retiree-only plans or inclusion in the same plan as current employees, like the FEHBP. The ACA allows group health plans to maintain grandfathered status by switching insurance carriers. Retiree health benefits can be offered through separate retiree-only plans or included in the same plan as current employees, like the FEHBP. Plans covering workers must comply with relevant ACA provisions, while retiree-only plans may not have to adhere to ACA's insurance reforms. States have the authority to enforce health insurance requirements, even post-ACA. States have the authority to enforce ACA's insurance reforms on retiree health plans offered through state-licensed insurance companies. Self-insured plans are not subject to state law but federal standards. Each state decides whether to enforce ACA reforms on retiree plans, with federal government stepping in if states do not enforce. However, HHS will not enforce ACA reforms on retiree-only coverage, leaving no federal role in enforcement. The federal government does not have a role in enforcing ACA insurance reforms on retiree-only plans, but the Administration may reconsider this stance. Retiree-only health plans have been exempt from federal requirements since 1996, and this exemption still applies according to HHS."
