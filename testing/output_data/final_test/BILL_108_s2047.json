FINDINGS.\" \"Congress finds that energy workers at former Mallinkrodt facilities were exposed to high levels of radionuclides and radioactive materials exceeding Federal standards. Workers at the St. Louis site were exposed to excessive levels of airborne uranium dust, with some exposed to 200 times the preferred levels. The chief safety officer described the facility as one of the worst plants for worker exposures.\" The Department of Energy admitted that workers at the Weldon Springs plant were exposed to highly radioactive materials, including plutonium and recycled uranium. The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health acknowledged intense processing of radionuclides at the St. Louis downtown site. The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health has limited personal monitoring data for workers prior to 1948 at sites with high levels of radionuclides. Claimants and survivors are informed that not being interviewed for dose reconstruction may lead to incomplete or inaccurate radiation dose estimates. The Department of Health and Human Services published a notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the Special. The Special Exposure Cohort rule was proposed on June 25, 2002, but has not been finalized as of January 27, 2004. Many former workers have passed away while waiting for the rule to be finalized, including some waiting for dose reconstruction. The Special Exposure Cohort rule has not been finalized as of January 27, 2004. Section 3621(14) of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 is amended to include criteria for employees who worked at specific facilities operated under contract to the Department of Energy by Mallinkrodt Incorporated or its successors for a certain number of workdays during specified calendar years. The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 is amended to include criteria for employees who were monitored for radiation exposure at specific facilities operated under contract to the Department of Energy by Mallinkrodt Incorporated or its successors. The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 is amended to include criteria for monitoring radiation exposures using dosimetry badges or bioassays at specific facilities."
