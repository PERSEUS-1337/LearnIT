The 114th Congress is considering bills that could impact the Fed's governance, oversight, and disclosure. The 114th Congress is considering bills that could impact the Federal Reserve by increasing congressional oversight, requiring more disclosure, implementing policy rules like the Taylor Rule, and changing the Fed's emergency lending powers. This report analyzes these provisions and the policy debate surrounding them. Several bills affecting the Federal Reserve have been in committee or floor action in the 114th Congress. The Fed Oversight Reform and Modernization Act (FORM Act; H.R. 3189) and the Centennial Monetary Commission Act, H.R. 2912, were reported by the House Financial Services Committee. H.R. 2912 was added to H.R. 3189 before the latter passed the House. Provisions of H.R. 3189 were included in the Financial CHOICE Act (H.R. 5983). The Financial Regulatory Improvement Act (S. 1484) was reported by the Senate Banking Committee, including provisions related to the Fed. The FY2016 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act included regulations related to the Federal Reserve. The Senate voted against debating the Federal Reserve Transparency Act. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee ordered the Federal Reserve Transparency Act to be reported. Provisions affecting the Fed were also included in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act and the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act. The Federal Reserve Act established the Fed as the central bank in 1913, with a governance structure of 12 regional banks overseen by a Board of Governors in Washington, DC. The board consists of seven governors nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, including a chair and two vice chairs. Policy is formulated by the board and implemented by the regional banks, with monetary policy decisions made by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) makes monetary policy decisions and is composed of seven governors, the president of the New York Fed, and four other regional bank presidents. The New York Fed plays a significant role in implementing FOMC decisions, supervising large banks, and conducting foreign exchange transactions. The New York Fed is responsible for conducting foreign exchange transactions and storing gold for foreign central banks. The FOMC elects the New York Fed president as its vice chair, with no formal powers. The Fed's capital consists of paid-in capital from member banks and retained earnings. Member banks are required to purchase stock equal to 3% of their capital, with an option for an additional 3%. Ownership of stock in the Fed comes with limited rights, as stockholders have no control over Fed policy. Stockholders do choose two-thirds of the board of directors at the regional Fed banks, which are composed of Class A, Class B, and Class C directors. The main difference between the classes is their role in selecting regional bank presidents. The Fed's budget is self-funded by fees and income from securities. Most of its net income is remitted to the Treasury to reduce the federal debt. H.R. 3189 and H.R. 5983 propose changes to the voting membership of the FOMC, increasing regional bank presidents' voting rights. The Fed's voting rights on the FOMC would change to every other year, while 9 of the other 11 banks would have voting rights every other year instead of every third year. H.R. 3189 and H.R. 5983 propose a media blackout period around FOMC meetings. S. 1484 / S. 1910 would require the President of the New York Fed to be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, with annual testimony before committees. Interest rate setting on reserves would shift from the Board of Governors. The Fed's interest rate setting on reserves may shift from the Board of Governors to the FOMC. Proposed bills would allow board members to hire personal staff, and create a Congressional Commission with specific voting members. The proposed bills would create a Congressional Commission to examine monetary policy, macroprudential regulation, and the restructuring of Federal Reserve districts. The commission would be funded through appropriations and tasked with making recommendations on these key areas. The 2015 law reduced the Fed's dividend on stock held by member banks with over $10 billion in assets to the lower of 6% or the yield on 10-year Treasury securities. This provision is expected to raise revenues by $6.9 billion over 10 years. Fed data shows that 47 national banks and 22 state-member banks have assets exceeding $10 billion. The provision in H.R. 22 capped the Fed's surplus at $10 billion, with excess funds remitted to the Treasury as general revenues. This is estimated to increase revenues by $53.3 billion over 10 years. H.R. 3189 aimed to permanently eliminate the Fed's surplus and transfer the balance to the Treasury. H.R. 26 (P.L. 114-1) requires the President to appoint a member with experience in community banks under $10 billion in assets to the Board of Governors. Community banks must have representation on the Board, unlike other interest groups. Class B and C directors of the Fed's regional bank boards are elected without discrimination based on race, creed, color, sex, or national origin, with consideration for various interests. H.R. 3189, passed by the House, aims to add \"traditionally underserved communities and populations\" to the considerations of the Federal Reserve. Critics call for more congressional oversight, transparency, and disclosure by the Fed, especially after the financial crisis. The Fed already reports to and testifies before House and Senate committees semiannually since 1978, with additional focused hearings on Fed topics. The Fed began publishing forecasts for its federal funds rate target and announced a 2% inflation goal for greater transparency. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) conducts regular audits of the Fed's activities since 1978. The Dodd-Frank Act required audits of the Fed's emergency activities during the financial crisis and its governance. The Fed's governance audit, released in October 2011, revealed restrictions on GAO's ability to evaluate the economic merits of Fed actions. The Fed discloses extensive information voluntarily, including annual reports, weekly balance sheet summaries, and monthly reports on lending activities. In December 2010, individual lending records for emergency facilities were released as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act requires disclosure of identities and loan terms. The Fed releases individual records for discount window and open market operations transactions with a two-year lag. Some Members of Congress seek more disclosure on regulation, salaries, and financial information of Fed officials. The Fed follows standard rule-making processes and has an ombudsman for supervisory decisions. The Dodd-Frank Act created a vice chair for supervision, but the position remains unfilled. The Federal Reserve's oversight and disclosure issues are separate concerns. Oversight involves independent evaluation, while disclosure pertains to what internal information the Fed releases. Contrary to common belief, a GAO audit would not reveal confidential borrower information. Greater oversight could compromise the Fed's political independence, which is crucial for effective policy-making according to most economists. The Fed opposes legislation for further GAO audits. The Federal Reserve opposes legislation for further GAO audits to maintain its political independence. While disclosure helps understand Fed actions, too much could hinder policy effectiveness. Congress must find a balance between oversight and political pressure. H.R. 3189 and H.R. 5983 aim to expand GAO's powers for evaluating Fed policy decisions. The House passed bills like H.R. 24 and S. 2232 for a one-time GAO audit of the Fed. S. 1484 / S. 1910 require a study on Fed's regulation of large financial institutions. Bills like H.R. 3189 and H.R. 5983 aim to increase the frequency of Fed's reports to Congress on monetary policy. The bills H.R. 3189 and H.R. 5983 aim to change the frequency of required reports on monetary policy to quarterly and require the chair to testify quarterly. S. 1484 / S. 1910 would add new economic variables to the report and allow dissenting statements from FOMC members. The Dodd-Frank Act created the position of vice chair of supervision, who is required to testify semiannually on Fed supervision. The bills H.R. 3189 and H.R. 5983 propose quarterly testimony and reports on monetary policy. The position of vice chair of supervision, created in 2010, remains vacant. S. 1484 / S. 1910 would require the Fed chair to testify when the vice chair position is vacant. H.R. 5983 would subject non-monetary policy functions to appropriations. H.R. 5983 would subject the non-monetary policy functions of the Fed's Board of Governors and regional banks to congressional appropriations. S. 1484 / S. 1910 would require a public vote by the Board on bank enforcement actions over $1 million. H.R. 3189 and H.R. 5983 would mandate the Fed to disclose stress test scenarios through a public rule-making process. H.R. 3189 and H.R. 5983 would require the Fed to disclose supervisory letters to large bank holding companies and systemically important non-banks, conduct cost-benefit analysis for rule-making, notify committees and the public before international negotiations, and disclose salaries and financial information. H.R. 3189 and H.R. 5983 would mandate public disclosure of salary and financial information for Fed governors, officers, and employees with salaries above GS-15. H.R. 3189 also requires the Fed to estimate the impact of export credit agencies on the Industrial Production Index in its monthly release. Congress has granted the Fed autonomy in conducting monetary policy. Some Members of Congress are dissatisfied with the Fed's monetary policy and are looking for alternatives. One proposed alternative is a rules-based regime, such as the Taylor rule, which relates interest rate changes to inflation and the output gap. The Fed typically sets a target for the federal funds rate to carry out monetary policy. The Taylor rule is used in economic analysis to explain the Fed's actions and can be a baseline for future decisions. It tracks policy well from the 1980s to 2007 but has limitations as it was designed for the federal funds rate. Fed's monetary policy shifted after 2008, using different tools. In 2014, the Fed used new policy tools like quantitative easing due to the federal funds rate being at the zero lower bound. The Taylor rule, designed for higher interest rates, cannot provide actionable prescriptions at the zero bound. Debate exists on whether using the Taylor rule for monetary policy decisions would improve economic outcomes. The Taylor rule is proposed to play a more formal role in Fed policymaking, either mandating policy to be based on it or requiring explanations for decisions made relative to it. Advocates argue for the predictability and transparency of rule-based policy over discretion in policymaking. Legislative changes would be necessary to enforce the adoption of these proposals by the Fed. Advocates of rules argue for predictable and transparent policy to avoid financial instability. They suggest a formal role for a Taylor rule to aid Congress in oversight. On the other hand, economists favoring discretion believe policymakers need flexibility to manage unexpected shocks. Introducing complexity to the Taylor rule could reduce transparency and predictability. Periodically modifying the Taylor rule in response to unforeseen events could reduce predictability and increase discretion. Incorporating concerns about financial stability or asset bubbles in the rule is challenging due to the lack of consensus on quantifying them. Using forecasts in the Taylor rule may be preferable to using actual data to account for monetary policy lags, but it could reintroduce policy discretion. Addressing these issues may require modifications to the rule. The Taylor rule can be modified to address various issues, but this may reduce the benefits of a rules-based regime. Practical challenges include data lags, difficulty in estimating neutral interest rates and potential output growth, increased volatility, public comprehension, and the zero bound issue. Economists originally favored rules to curb high inflation, but with low inflation since the 1990s, criticism has been directed at the Fed for excessive stimulus. Taylor rules can be adjusted to meet policymakers' goals, with parameters like inflation and output gap weights reflecting different priorities. Choosing a Taylor rule involves value judgments and political tradeoffs, as the Fed can only be compelled to adopt rules-based policy through legislation. Congress would face challenges in determining the best form of Taylor rule for the Fed. The challenge for proponents of rules-based policy is how to ensure less discretion without compromising the Fed's independence. Congress needs the Fed's cooperation to implement a rules-based policy, but the Fed has little incentive to limit its own discretion. Finding legal ways to enforce adherence to rules could potentially expose the Fed to political pressure, threatening its independence. S. 1484 / S. 1910 would require the Fed to include in its policy decisions. S. 1484 / S. 1910 and H.R. 3189 / H.R. 5983 propose requiring the Fed to disclose and adhere to mathematical rules in monetary policy decisions, such as the Taylor Rule, to ensure stable prices and maximum employment. The bills also mandate the publication of a five-year inflation projection under the rule. The bill proposes the \"Reference Policy Rule\" for the Fed to submit its rule to GAO and committees within 48 hours of a policy decision. GAO would report to Congress on compliance, triggering an audit if necessary. The Fed can use emergency lending authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act in times of crisis. In 2008, the Fed used Section 13(3) to provide credit to nonbank financial firms and created facilities to aid primary dealers and revive demand for commercial paper. Special assistance was given to firms deemed \"too big to fail\" like AIG and Citigroup. Credit outstanding peaked at $710 billion in November 2008, all of which has been repaid with interest. The Fed earned over $30 billion and did not incur any losses under Section 13(3). The Fed's use of Section 13(3) in 2008 involved providing credit to nonbank financial firms and creating facilities to aid primary dealers and revive demand for commercial paper. The Dodd-Frank Act added more restrictions to Section 13(3) in 2010, aiming to prevent future assistance to failing firms while allowing the Fed to create broadly based facilities. The Act also required public release of records for actions taken under Section 13(3) and mandated audits by the GAO for operational integrity and effectiveness. The Fed's use of Section 13(3) in the crisis raised policy issues regarding emergency lending, including the Fed's role as lender of last resort, discretion in responding to financial crises, taxpayer protection, moral hazard, and transparency in lending. A Fed governor has argued against reducing the Fed's discretion under Section 13(3) to allow flexibility in addressing future threats to financial stability. Some Members of Congress are interested in amending Section 13(3) to limit the Fed's discretion in providing emergency loans to financially struggling entities. H.R. 3189 and H.R. 5983 propose to restrict 13(3) to \"unusual and exigent circumstances\" requiring the affirmative vote of nine presidents of Federal reserve banks. The proposed amendments to Section 13(3) would impose restrictions on the Federal Reserve's ability to accept certain types of collateral, require certification of borrower solvency by regulatory bodies, limit assistance to financial institutions, and exclude government entities from receiving aid. The proposed amendments to Section 13(3) would impose restrictions on the Federal Reserve's emergency loans by establishing a minimum interest rate based on specific criteria. These proposals aim to increase the Fed's accountability to Congress and reduce its discretion, potentially impacting the Fed's independence. The Fed's independence is a topic of debate, with proponents arguing for more technocratic decision-making and opponents highlighting concerns about undemocratic processes. The Fed has historically enjoyed independence to insulate monetary policy from political pressures, but there is a tradeoff between independence and accountability. Proposed amendments may impact the Fed's independence by increasing accountability to Congress and reducing discretion in emergency loans."
