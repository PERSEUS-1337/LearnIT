    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Detectives Nemorin and Andrews Anti-Gun Trafficking Act of 2003\". The Congress finds that illegal gun traffickers are a major source of firearms for criminals, often involved in other criminal activities. Criminals obtain guns from corrupt Federal firearm licensees and straw purchasers, who buy firearms for prohibited individuals. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives identified key interstate patterns in illegal gun trafficking, with firearms moving between regions such as the Southeast and Northeast, South to Midwest, and California to other western states. About half of all gun trafficking nationally involves these interstate movements. About half of all gun trafficking investigations nationally involve interstate gun trafficking. SEC. 3. ILLEGAL GUN TRAFFICKING. Section 924 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to include penalties for illegally trafficking multiple firearms, including handguns, assault weapons, shotguns, rifles, or machineguns with altered serial numbers or stolen firearms. Anyone who sells or trades a firearm to someone prohibited from possessing one, under federal or state law, or under 18 years old, or in a school zone, or crossing state lines illegally, can face fines, imprisonment up to 20 years, or both. This does not apply to licensed dealers. Licensed dealers are exempt from facing fines or imprisonment for selling firearms to prohibited individuals or in restricted areas. SEC. 4 amends the 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act to expand Project Safe Neighborhoods by including illegal gun trafficking in its scope and changing the year from 2002 to 2004. SEC. 5 requires a report to Congress. SEC. 5 requires the Attorney General to submit a biennial report to Congress detailing traced firearms used in crimes, Federal firearms licensees with multiple traced firearms, and prosecutions under specific sections of the United States Code. SEC. 6 introduces an additional penalty for possessing a stolen firearm during a felony. Section 924 of title 18, United States Code is amended to include penalties for receiving, possessing, or selling stolen firearms or ammunition during a crime punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year. Offenders face up to 5 years in prison. This does not apply if the firearm was obtained from a licensed dealer. Additionally, a National Crime Information Center Stolen Gun File is established. The Federal Bureau of Investigation provides the National Crime Information Center Gun File to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives for crime gun traces. The ATF searches the Stolen Gun File for each firearm submitted for tracing and notifies law enforcement if a firearm is reported stolen. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives notifies law enforcement agencies about firearm information and provides details on the owner. If the ATF has a stolen firearm, they return it to the rightful owner when no longer needed for investigation. Federal Firearms Licensees enrolled in the NICS system will be allowed to use it within two years of the Act's enactment. Federal Firearms Licensees enrolled in the NICS system can search the NCIC Stolen Gun File for any firearm they acquire from unlicensed individuals. SEC. 8. Additional penalty for possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number during the commission of a felony. This section amends Section 924 of title 18, United States Code, by adding a penalty for transporting, possessing, or receiving a firearm with a removed, obliterated, or altered serial number during the commission of a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year. Offenders can be sentenced to up to 5 years in addition to the punishment for the underlying crime. SEC. 9 enhances penalties for using a stolen firearm or one with an altered serial number during a violent crime or drug trafficking offense. The minimum sentences for such offenses are increased to 7, 9, and 12 years depending on the circumstances."
