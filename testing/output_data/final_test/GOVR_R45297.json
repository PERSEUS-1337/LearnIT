    "content": "Before discussing the legal impact of the Flores Settlement on DHS's authority to detain family units at the border without valid entry documents, it is important to understand the relevant statutory framework. The INA governs the detention of aliens pending removal proceedings, with specific provisions for unaccompanied alien children. However, federal law does not specifically address the detention of family units or accompanied alien minors for immigration enforcement purposes. Aliens near the border without valid entry documents are typically subject to expedited removal under the INA, which allows for removal without a hearing. Expedited removal is a streamlined process for aliens near the border without valid entry documents. Family units and children encountered are subject to expedited removal, but UACs are not. If an alien indicates fear of persecution, they are referred to an asylum officer for further consideration in immigration court. The process of transitioning from expedited to standard removal proceedings for aliens showing credible fear of persecution allows DHS to detain them pending the outcome. Aliens referred from expedited to standard proceedings can be detained by DHS or released on bond or parole. The alien can challenge the detention decision in a custody redetermination hearing before an immigration judge, where they must demonstrate they do not pose a danger and are likely to appear. The INA grants DHS authority to release aliens on parole if they do not pose a danger and are likely to appear for future proceedings. DHS officials make individualized determinations based on factors such as flight risk and public safety. Recent evidence shows DHS deviating from this policy to detain more aliens for deterrence purposes, leading to legal challenges. Two federal judges in the District of Columbia issued injunctions ordering DHS to make individualized parole determinations for detained aliens under \u00a7 1225(b). Constitutional principles may limit DHS's ability to detain aliens for deterrence purposes, despite statutory authorization. Separate statutes address the treatment of Unaccompanied Alien Children (UACs), assigning the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) to coordinate their care and placement. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) is responsible for coordinating and implementing the case and placement of unaccompanied alien children in Federal custody due to their immigration status. Minors are under DHS custody until deemed \"unaccompanied,\" at which point they must be transferred to ORR custody within 72 hours. ORR must place the child in the least restrictive setting that is in their best interest. The Flores lawsuit, initiated in 1985 and settled in 1997, requires the prompt placement of unaccompanied alien minors in the least restrictive setting in their best interest. Before the Homeland Security Act and TVPRA, there was no national policy for the care of these minors. The Flores lawsuit, settled in 1997, challenged the release policy for alien minors detained at an INS facility. The lawsuit contested the conditions of confinement and argued that the release policy violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The INS later issued a rule allowing alien minors to be released to adult relatives other than parents or lawful guardians, which was also challenged in the lawsuit. The Flores lawsuit challenged the INS policy on releasing alien minors from custody under the Due Process Clause. The Supreme Court upheld the INS policy, stating that detained minors had no constitutional right to be released to unrelated adults. The case continued with parties disputing INS compliance with housing standards for alien minors. The Flores Settlement, established in 1997, sets nationwide standards for the detention, release, and treatment of alien minors in immigration custody. It emphasizes a general policy favoring release and requires minors to be placed in the least restrictive setting appropriate for their age and needs. Facilities must be safe and sanitary for detained minors. The Flores Settlement, established in 1997, sets standards for the detention and treatment of alien minors in immigration custody. It requires minors to be placed in safe and sanitary facilities and transferred to a qualifying adult or non-secure facility within a few days. The agreement applies to all individuals under 18 detained by immigration authorities, emphasizing release and least restrictive settings. No final regulations implementing the agreement have been promulgated yet. The Flores Settlement governs the detention of alien minors in immigration custody, favoring their release. It restricts DHS's authority to detain accompanied alien minors, as Congress has not enacted laws regulating their care and custody like they have for unaccompanied minors. The Flores Settlement requires the release of alien minors from government custody and mandates their placement in non-secure, state-licensed facilities within three to five days. Currently, there are no qualifying facilities available for housing alien minors and their parents. In cases of an influx of minors, defined as more than 130 eligible for placement, placements must be made promptly. The Flores Settlement mandates prompt placements of alien minors in non-secure facilities within three to five days. However, during influxes, DHS can detain family units for longer periods based on individual circumstances, with time extensions being minimal and not blanket extensions for specific groups. For example, in 2015, the government stated that alien families seeking asylum would need to be detained for an average of 20 days for processing. The court found the government in substantial noncompliance with the Flores Settlement due to prolonged detention of class members, rejecting a 20-day processing timeline for all families seeking asylum. The requirement for expeditious release remains in place as the court denied the government's motion to amend the settlement. Minors and parents in immigration detention cannot stay together for long due to Flores Settlement requirements for minors to be in non-secure, state-licensed facilities. DHS detention duration during influx is unclear, with a 20-day limit suggested by the court. An exception exists if a parent waives the child's rights under the settlement. The government has argued in the Flores litigation that it is not obligated to house alien minors in non-secure, state-licensed facilities due to a preliminary injunction in the Ms. L. case. In Ms. L., asylum seekers sued over family separations at the border, leading to a class action certification for alien parents detained by DHS with separated minor children. The court imposed a preliminary injunction against the government to refrain from detaining class members without their minor children and to reunite them. The government argued that alien children can remain in DHS detention with their parents due to the Flores Settlement and Ms. L. injunction. The Flores court rejected this argument. The Flores court rejected the government's argument to indefinitely detain alien minors in unlicensed facilities, stating it was a strained interpretation of the Flores Settlement. The court emphasized that the government could reconsider its family detention policy and reinstate prosecutorial discretion to comply with court orders. As children were reunited with their parents in detention, the Flores clock began ticking, requiring the government to act expeditiously. The government faced the requirement to place families in Flores-qualifying detention facilities or release them within a 20-day window. Due to a lack of bed space, families have been released. The executive branch has two options for detaining arriving family units showing credible fear of persecution: release them or separate parents and children. The district court rejected detaining family units together, leading to doubts about the option to detain parents only. The executive branch faced two options for detaining arriving family units: release them or separate parents and children. The \"zero-tolerance policy\" implemented by Attorney General Sessions in April 2018 separated families, but was ended by an executive order in June 2018 due to concerns about violating due process. The practice of criminally prosecuting parents without a plan for reunification was deemed legally unviable. The executive branch faced two options for detaining arriving family units: release them or separate parents and children. The Department of Justice may prosecute parents who enter the country illegally, but cannot use prosecution to separate families for prolonged periods due to concerns about violating due process. One way for the executive branch to pursue the second option is to keep parents in DHS civil immigration detention while releasing children to other relatives or guardians. The Ninth Circuit has held that the Flores Settlement does not require DHS to release parents along with their children. The executive branch has argued that this holding \"specifically envisioned separating parents from their children under the terms of the [ Flores ] Agreement.\" The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not pursued a general policy of releasing children without their parents from civil immigration detention. This would face practical and legal barriers, such as the need to find other relatives or licensed programs to care for the children while parents are detained. The Ms. L. court has stated that family separation without a determination of parental unfitness likely violates due process. One possible option could be to create licensed family detention centers that comply with legal standards. The executive branch does not consider creating licensed family detention centers as a feasible option due to unresolved disputes over licensing facilities for adults and children. Even if licensed facilities existed, detaining families together might still violate the Flores Settlement, which prioritizes release over detention. Additionally, detaining arriving family units for the purpose of deterrence could violate due process. The only clearly viable option under current law is releasing families in qualifying facilities. The executive branch's only viable option under current law for treating family units with credible fear of persecution is to release them pending removal proceedings. The branch can modify or terminate obligations under the Flores Settlement through agreements with plaintiffs, court motions, or regulatory changes. On June 21, 2018, the executive branch sought changes to exempt accompanied minors from the release policy. The government sought to modify the Flores Settlement to detain accompanied alien minors with their families in ICE family detention centers for longer periods. The district court rejected the motion, and the government has appealed to the Ninth Circuit, but faces limited prospects for success based on current case law standards. The Ninth Circuit ruled that the migrant crisis at the Southwest border did not warrant changing the Flores Settlement for accompanied alien minors. The court stated that the government had flexibility to respond to influxes under the existing standard. Additionally, the court held that subsequent laws did not release the government from providing bond hearings for minors in removal proceedings. The Ninth Circuit ruled that recent statutes did not warrant modifying the Flores Settlement for accompanied minors. The government's argument for a change based on increased family entries at the border was deemed a reconsideration of a previously rejected argument by the court. The government's recent motion to modify the Flores Settlement based on increased family entries at the border was rejected by the Ninth Circuit in 2016. The DHS and HHS proposed a new rule to replace the Flores Settlement for the care of alien minors and unaccompanied children. The government's best chance for success may be at the Supreme Court, which is not bound by the Ninth Circuit's previous opinion. The proposed regulations aim to replace the Flores Settlement for the care of alien minors and unaccompanied children. The agreement will terminate 45 days after final regulations are published, with potential court involvement to determine if the rules meet the settlement's requirements. The regulations define standards for DHS and HHS care of accompanied and unaccompanied children, separately defining \"minor\" and \"unaccompanied alien child.\" The proposed regulations aim to replace the Flores Settlement for the care of alien minors and unaccompanied children. The regulations define standards for DHS and HHS care of accompanied and unaccompanied children, separately defining \"minor\" and \"unaccompanied alien child.\" The rules diverge from the original agreement by conforming to two intervening statutes and seeking to create a federal alternative. The proposed rules aim to create a federal alternative to the Flores Settlement's requirement for state-licensed facilities for detaining families together. It specifies that unreleased alien minors not classified as UACs will be held in non-secure, licensed facilities. ICE family detention centers can be considered \"licensed\" if a third party ensures compliance with ICE standards. Minimal provisions include living arrangements, food, medical care, and counseling. The proposed regulations aim to establish federal standards for detaining families together as an alternative to the Flores Settlement. These standards include living accommodations, food, medical care, counseling, education, recreation, and legal services. However, there are differences between the proposed regulations and the Flores Settlement, such as the requirement for licensed programs to maintain discipline standards and client records. The proposed regulations also prioritize family unity over the release of minors, allowing for longer detention periods in family residential centers. The proposed regulations aim to establish federal standards for detaining families together as an alternative to the Flores Settlement. The regulations prioritize family unity over the release of minors, allowing for longer detention periods in family residential centers. If the proposed regulations do not implement the terms of the Flores Settlement, the agreement would likely remain in effect. The executive branch could seek to modify the Flores Settlement based on new laws like the Protect Kids and Parents Act, which would allow children to remain in custody with their parent or legal guardian during asylum proceedings. Other bills in Congress may have similar effects on the settlement. The executive branch may attempt to modify the Flores Settlement with new laws like the Protect Kids and Parents Act, allowing children to stay in custody with their parents during asylum proceedings. However, constitutional restrictions could still pose a challenge to such changes. If a district court deems new statutory provisions unconstitutional for alien minors in immigration detention, it may not conform the Flores Settlement to the new law. Any court decision on this matter would be subject to de novo review on appeal."
