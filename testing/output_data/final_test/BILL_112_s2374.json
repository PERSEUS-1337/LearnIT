    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Helium Stewardship Act of 2012\" and includes definitions for key terms. The Helium Act (50 U.S.C. 167) is amended to define the Federal Helium Reserve as helium reserves owned by the United States, including the Cliffside Field helium storage reservoir, federally owned helium pipeline system, and associated infrastructure. The Federal Helium Reserve, owned by the United States, includes storage, transportation, and management of helium. Low-Btu gas is defined as a fuel gas with a heating value of less than 250 Btu per standard cubic foot. SEC. 3. SALE OF CRUDE HELIUM. Amendment to Section 6 of the Helium Act regarding the sale of crude helium. The Secretary may offer crude helium for sale for various uses, consulting with the industry to minimize market disruption. A minimum quantity must be offered each fiscal year, not less than in 2012, and federal agencies can purchase refined helium for Federal purposes. The Secretary may offer crude helium for sale for various uses, consulting with the industry to minimize market disruption. Purchase refined helium for Federal, medical, and scientific uses from persons with contracts to buy crude helium from the Secretary. This applies from the enactment of the Helium Stewardship Act of 2012 until all amounts owed to the US are repaid. The Secretary, in consultation with the helium industry, determines necessary steps to maximize helium recovery from the Federal Helium Reserve, manage sales according to production ability, respond to market demand, prioritize Federal user demand in case of reserve disruption, and carry out this subsection. Federal agencies and holders of Federal research grants may purchase refined helium for various uses under this subsection. The Secretary may offer crude helium for sale to Federal, medical, and scientific users under this subsection, with a duration from a specified date to when the volume of recoverable crude helium at the Federal Helium Reserve reaches 3,000,000,000 standard cubic feet. The Secretary may offer crude helium for sale to Federal, medical, and scientific users in quantities and conditions deemed necessary. Federal agencies and holders of Federal research grants can purchase refined helium under this subsection from sellers with contracts to buy an equivalent amount of crude helium from the Secretary. This subsection takes effect the day after a specified date. Sales of crude helium by the Secretary are subject to prices and determinations. Sales of crude helium by the Secretary are priced to match the private market, determined through surveys of domestic helium transactions and current market prices from sales on Federal land. The Secretary determines the price of crude helium based on surveys of domestic helium transactions and market prices from sales on Federal land. The Secretary also requires parties to disclose the average price of crude helium and bulk liquid helium purchased or processed in domestic helium sourcing transactions. The Secretary establishes helium prices based on domestic transactions and market prices from Federal land sales. Qualifying transactions must involve purchasing at least 20,000,000 standard cubic feet of crude or liquid helium in a fiscal year. The Secretary uses gathered information to determine fair market prices for crude helium and protect confidentiality of data submitted by private persons. Additionally, a Helium Production Fund is established. The Helium Production Fund receives all amounts under the Act, including sales of crude helium, for necessary purposes determined by the Secretary. Funds can be used for capital investments and maintenance at the Federal Helium Reserve, including well head maintenance and facility upgrades at the Cliffside Field helium storage reservoir. The Helium Production Fund receives funds for maintenance and upgrades at the Cliffside Field helium storage reservoir, including equipment related to storage, transportation, purification, and sale of crude helium. Excess funds are paid to the Treasury. \"Amounts received from the sale of helium on Federal land are paid to the Treasury to offset amounts owed under subsection (a).\" SEC. 4. Amends the Helium Act by replacing section 15 with a new section on Helium Gas Resource Assessment. The Helium Stewardship Act of 2012 mandates the completion of a national helium gas assessment within 2 years. This assessment will identify and quantify helium reserves, including helium-3, in each reservoir. Additionally, seismic and geophysical data for the Bush Dome Reservoir will be made available. Coordination with international agencies and the global geology community is also required for a global assessment. The Helium Stewardship Act of 2012 mandates a global helium gas assessment to quantify helium reserves, including helium-3, in each reservoir. This includes assessing global demand trends, forecasting domestic demand for helium across various sectors, and inventorying its uses in the United States. Coordination with international agencies and the global geology community is required for this assessment. The Helium Stewardship Act of 2012 requires an assessment of helium reserves globally, including helium-3, and its uses in the United States. The assessment includes quantifying reserves, forecasting domestic demand, and identifying technical and commercial viability of helium recapture and recycling. A report on the results of these assessments must be submitted to the Senate and House committees. SEC. 16. Low-BTU gas separation and helium conservation research and development. The Secretary of Energy is authorized to support research programs for expanding domestic low-Btu gas and helium production, separating helium from natural gas, and reducing venting during gas exploration. A civilian research program for membrane technology development to separate low-Btu gases, including helium, is also supported. The Secretary of Energy supports research programs for developing technologies to separate, gather, and process helium in low concentrations found in natural gas production streams. Additionally, a research program is in place to recycle and reuse helium through low-cost technologies. The Secretary of Energy supports research programs to develop technologies for capturing helium from various chemical processing, including ammonia processing. The Secretary of Energy supports research programs for capturing helium from chemical processing, including ammonia processing, as outlined in SEC. 17 for helium-3 separation. The Secretary of Energy will collaborate with the Secretary on assessments and research regarding helium-3 extraction from crude helium, including gas analysis, infrastructure studies, and cooperation with private refiners. A feasibility study may be conducted to establish a facility for helium-3 separation at the Federal Helium Reserve or an existing purification facility. A report is required within one year of enactment. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress within one year of the Helium Stewardship Act of 2012 enactment, detailing the assessments conducted on helium-3 extraction and research collaboration. Section 102 of the Soda Ash Royalty Reduction Act of 2006 is amended to change the duration from 5 years to 7 years."
