The \"TRAIN Act\" aims to improve notification and training for responders to hazardous material incidents, citing the potential risks of such incidents based on past accidents like the one in Graniteville, South Carolina in 2005. The collision in Graniteville, South Carolina derailed two locomotives and 16 freight cars, including tank cars with chlorine. This led to the release of chlorine gas, resulting in 9 deaths and over 500 people with respiratory issues. Evacuations were carried out for 5,400 people within a 1-mile radius, with damages exceeding $6.9 million. The National Transportation Safety Board attributed the collision to the probable cause of the incident. The collision and derailment in Graniteville, South Carolina was caused by the crew of train 192 failing to return a main line switch to the normal position after completing work at an industry track. The absence of a reminder mechanism contributed to this failure. The National Transportation Safety Board made safety recommendations to the Federal Railroad Administration, emphasizing the importance of implementing measures to prevent improperly lined switches, which are a leading cause of human factor-caused accidents. SEC. 2. IMPLEMENTATION OF NTSB RECOMMENDATIONS. The Secretary of Transportation must issue regulations within 12 months of this Act's enactment to implement specific recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board's report on a railroad accident in South Carolina. These regulations include installing devices to improve switch operation safety on railroads in nonsignaled territory. Regulations require railroads to operate trains at safe speeds in nonsignaled territory, implement measures to reduce impact forces in accidents, and provide emergency escape breathing apparatus for crewmembers on freight trains. Regulations mandate emergency escape breathing apparatus and training for crewmembers on freight trains carrying hazardous materials. SEC. 3. EMERGENCY RESPONDER GRANTS. Amends Part B of subtitle V of title 49, United States Code, by adding a new chapter for Emergency Responder Grants. The Secretary of Transportation will provide grants to fire departments for responding to incidents involving hazardous materials by rail. The grants cover various costs including equipment for chemical detection, fire suppression, patient extraction, and personal protective gear. $20,000,000 is authorized for this purpose. The Secretary of Transportation authorized $20,000,000 for grants to fire departments to respond to hazardous materials incidents by rail. Amounts appropriated shall remain available until expended. SEC. 4 amends training standards for emergency responders to include nonprofit public sector employee organizations and emphasizes training to protect people, property, and the environment from hazardous material incidents. SEC. 5 requires information on hazardous materials shipped. SEC. 5 requires railroads to inform local communities about the types of hazardous materials frequently shipped through them to aid in emergency planning. The Inspector General of the Department of Transportation must submit a report listing unimplemented railroad safety mandates and open safety recommendations. The Secretary of Transportation must also provide reports on statutory mandates to relevant committees until all mandates are implemented. The Secretary of Transportation must provide reports on specific actions taken to implement mandates to relevant committees annually. Additionally, the Secretary must transmit NTSB and inspector general recommendations to the committees along with the Department of Transportation's response to each recommendation."
