The Act \"Capitalizing on American Methane Act of 2015\" offers incentives for innovative fuel production by including qualified methane conversion technology in gasification projects under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Act \"Capitalizing on American Methane Act of 2015\" provides incentives for qualified methane conversion technology, which involves converting methane into hydrocarbons to replace petroleum in vehicle fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Act incentivizes qualified methane conversion technology for producing transportation fuel or chemicals with low emissions and sulfur concentration, limited to facilities with a production capacity of 150,000,000 gallons per year. The Act incentivizes qualified methane conversion technology for producing transportation fuel or chemicals with low emissions and sulfur concentration, limited to facilities with a production capacity of 150,000,000 gallons per year. The credit available for methane conversion projects will increase. The technology must not be part of a facility whose construction begins after September 30, 2025. The Code is amended to provide $500,000,000 for qualifying gasification projects using methane conversion technology, with a cap of $100,000,000 per project. Certificates of eligibility must be issued before October 1, 2025. The Code amendment specifies that certificates of eligibility for qualifying gasification projects using methane conversion technology must be issued before October 1, 2025. Selection priorities for certifying projects are also outlined. The Code prioritizes projects with high carbon dioxide emissions separation and sequestration percentages. It also gives preference to applicants with research partnerships with eligible educational institutions. For chemical projects using qualified methane conversion technology, projects with significant environmental benefits in production processes are prioritized for certification. The amendment includes liquid fuel produced through qualified methane conversion technology for Alternative Fuel Credit. The construction of the facility must begin before October 1, 2025, and the effective date of the amendments is upon enactment of the Act."
