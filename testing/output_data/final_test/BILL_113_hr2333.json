    "content": "The \"Next STEP Act of 2013\" establishes the State Trade and Export Promotion Grant Program under the Small Business Act. This program aims to support state trade and export promotion activities. The \"Next STEP Act of 2013\" establishes the State Trade and Export Promotion Grant Program to support eligible small business concerns with exporting activities. Eligible businesses must have been operating profitably in the US for at least one year, understand export costs, and have a strategic export plan in place. The State Trade and Export Promotion Grant Program, established under the \"Next STEP Act of 2013,\" supports small businesses with exporting activities. Definitions include small business concerns owned by women, socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns, and the term \"State\" refers to various regions. The Associate Administrator for International Trade will establish the program. The State Trade and Export Promotion Grant Program supports small businesses with exporting activities by providing grants for various initiatives such as foreign trade missions, market sales trips, and training workshops. Grants are given to States to increase the number of eligible small business concerns participating in export programs. The State Trade and Export Promotion Grant Program prioritizes applications from States that focus on promoting exports by eligible small business concerns, especially those owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, women, and rural small business owners. The State Trade and Export Promotion Grant Program prioritizes applications from States promoting exports by small business concerns, including new-to-market opportunities in China. States are limited to one application per fiscal year, and grants are distributed based on the highest number of exporters. The State Trade and Export Promotion Grant Program requires that the 10 States with the highest number of small business exporters receive no more than 40 percent of the program's funding. States must apply for grants on a competitive basis, with the federal share of costs not exceeding 65 percent for high export volume States. The non-Federal share of the cost of an export program carried out using a grant under the program shall be comprised of not less than 50 percent cash and not more than 50 percent of indirect costs and in-kind contributions. The Associate Administrator will submit an annual report to the Senate and House Committees on Small Business detailing the number and amount of grants made under the program in the previous year. The Associate Administrator will maintain a public web site listing grants awarded under the program, grant amounts, and grantee States. Enhanced reporting requirements will include details on States receiving grants, activities performed, and the impact on exports by small businesses. The Associate Administrator will document and maintain analyses, evaluations, and rationales for grant awards, ensure recipient goals align with program purposes, review quarterly reports, and require revised plans if goals are not proposed. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorized appropriations are available for fiscal years to carry out the Act and its amendments, with additional amounts beyond regular funding, remaining available until expended. SEC. 3. REPEAL OF PILOT PROGRAM. Section 1207 of the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 is repealed."
