The Congress finds that HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the US, with types 16 and 18 causing 70% of cervical cancers. Over 6 million Americans get infected with HPV annually, leading to 9,710 new cases of cervical cancer and 3,700 deaths each year. Early detection through regular Pap tests is crucial for diagnosing and curing cervical cancer, as recommended by the FDA. The FDA emphasizes the importance of early detection through Pap tests to treat cervical cancer before it becomes serious. Gardasil, the first vaccine to prevent cervical cancer and HPV-related conditions, was approved by the FDA in 2006 for females aged 9-26. More studies are needed to determine the vaccine's long-term effectiveness. The FDA conducted four studies in 21,000 women aged 16-26 to show Gardasil's effectiveness in preventing cervical precancerous lesions, which is likely to prevent cervical cancer. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended changes to the childhood and adolescent immunization schedule in January 2007. The ACIP recommends the new HPV vaccine to be administered in a 3-dose schedule for females aged 11-12 years, with catch-up vaccination recommended for females aged 13-26 years. Judicial Watch reported close to 9,000 health complaints related to Gardasil, including wart outbreaks, paralysis, and 18 deaths. The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons opposes mandating HPV vaccine for schoolchildren, stating it serves no public health purpose. Many organizations are against mandatory HPV vaccine programs for school attendance, including the American College of Pediatricians. The American College of Pediatricians and the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons oppose legislation mandating HPV vaccination for school attendance. They argue that it infringes on parental rights and does not serve a public health purpose. Federal funds should not be used for mandatory vaccine programs that do not threaten schoolchildren's health through daily interaction. Prohibition against federal funding for mandatory HPV vaccination programs at the state or local level."
