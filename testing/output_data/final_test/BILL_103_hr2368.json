    "content": "The Act titled \"Older Americans Economic Security Act of 1993\" introduces a tax deduction for the care of certain elderly individuals under section 220 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Older Americans Economic Security Act of 1993\" introduces a tax deduction for qualified elderly care expenses paid by individuals, exceeding 5% of their adjusted gross income. Qualified expenses include in-home custodial care for individuals aged 65 and older, not covered by insurance. The term 'custodial care' refers to personal care services that do not require medical attention, such as help with daily activities like bathing, dressing, and medication supervision. The text discusses special rules related to the determination of parents and grandparents for tax purposes, as well as the denial of double benefits. Additionally, it mentions that the deduction under section 220 is not subject to the floor on miscellaneous itemized deductions. The deduction under section 220 for expenses for care of certain elderly individuals is discussed. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for part VII of subchapter B of chapter 1 of the Code. SEC. 3. Inclusion of certain goods and services donated by physicians or registered professional nurses to elderly individuals as charitable deductions.

Tax-free withdrawals from individual retirement accounts are allowed for long-term care expenses or to purchase long-term care insurance. Tax-free withdrawals from individual retirement accounts can be used to pay for long-term care expenses or purchase long-term care insurance within 30 days of receiving the payment. Individuals can use tax-free withdrawals from individual retirement accounts to pay for long-term care expenses or purchase insurance covering such expenses.
