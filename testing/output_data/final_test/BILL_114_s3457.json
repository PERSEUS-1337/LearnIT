The Act, known as the \"Reducing Medicare Costs through Innovation Act,\" defines key terms such as Administrator and Secretary. It also clarifies terms like commercialization, Phase I, Phase II, Phase III, SBIR, and STTR. Additionally, it defines eligible medical products as those that received a Medicare commercialization grant, improve quality of care while reducing costs, and are drugs. The term \"eligible small business concern\" refers to a small business focusing on diseases or conditions and includes drugs, biological products, combination products, and devices requiring approval under section 515 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Secretary shall establish a program for small businesses focusing on top cost drivers in Medicare, eligible for SBIR or STTR grants, having completed Phase I activities and funding for Phase II activities. The Secretary will establish a Medicare commercialization grant program within CMS to assist small businesses in Phase III activities for developing medical products. Grantees can choose between traditional approval process or a pilot program for parallel review of medical products. The Secretary will issue an annual solicitation of applications for a grant program focusing on the top 10 cost drivers in the Medicare program. Stakeholders will be consulted to determine these cost drivers and assess eligibility for small businesses. The Secretary will issue an annual solicitation of applications for a grant program focusing on high volume and high cost medical procedures, diseases affecting a high number of Medicare beneficiaries, and areas with potential for innovation or cost reduction. Each eligible small business must meet application requirements. Each eligible small business applying for a Medicare commercialization grant must detail their funding sources. The grant duration is between 1 to 3 years, with no limit on recipients. After three years, the Secretary will assess the program. The Secretary will assess the cost reductions and care improvements resulting from grants, including cost drivers, novel medical products developed with grant funding, and the potential cost reduction if these products were used nationwide. A report will be submitted to Congress after the third year of grant awards. The Secretary will collaborate with other divisions within the Department of Health and Human Services to carry out the grant program. Funding for the program will be sourced from the SBIR and STTR programs. Additionally, a summary report will be provided after the assessment, and reports will be posted on the Department's website. The Secretary and the Administrator will establish a pilot program for parallel review of eligible medical products, similar to the one described in a notice from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. This program will not change the criteria for approving medical products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The pilot program aims to expedite the review processes for FDA approval and Medicare coverage determination for medical products developed by grant recipients, while enhancing efficiency and communication. The pilot program aims to increase efficiency and communication between the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Eligible participants are recipients of a Medicare commercialization grant who choose to participate and for the review of eligible medical products. As part of the pilot program, the Secretary and the Administrator will notify participating grant recipients of necessary data for submission. The Administrator will allocate resources for the pilot program, which includes reviewing eligible medical products for reimbursement designation and national coverage determination under Medicare."
