    "content": "The \"Retired Pay Restoration Act\" allows certain military retirees with service-connected disabilities to receive both retired pay and veterans' disability compensation. The Retired Pay Restoration Act extends concurrent receipt authority to retirees with service-connected disabilities rated less than 50 percent and phases in concurrent receipt for retirees with disabilities rated as 40 percent or less. The Retired Pay Restoration Act extends concurrent receipt authority to retirees with service-connected disabilities rated less than 50 percent and phases in concurrent receipt for retirees with disabilities rated as 40 percent or less, allowing for concurrent payment of retired pay and disability compensation. Amendments are made to section headings and the table of sections to reflect this change. Members eligible for retired pay can now receive veterans' disability compensation concurrently. The amendments will be effective from January 1, 2010, and apply to payments starting from that date. Coordination of service eligibility for combat-related special compensation and concurrent receipt is also addressed. The amendments to section 1413a of title 10, United States Code, allow for TERA retirees entitled to retired pay, with exceptions for certain service criteria. Additionally, standardization changes are made to align similar provisions in section 1413a(b) and 1414 of the title. The amendment in section 2 defines a \"qualified retiree\" as a member or former member of the uniformed services entitled to retired pay, excluding those retired under chapter 61 of the title. In the case of a member retired under chapter 61 with less than 20 years of service creditable and less than 20 years of service computed, and entitled to veterans' disability compensation, the retired pay is subject to special rules. The amendments made by this section will be effective on January 1, 2010, applying to payments starting from that date."
