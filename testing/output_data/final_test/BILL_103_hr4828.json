    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bombing Prevention Act\". The Congress finds that the number of criminal bombing incidents in the United States has doubled since 1988, with hundreds of millions of pounds of explosives purchased without permits. One-third of bombs used in crimes contain black powder or smokeless powder. The terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pan Am Flight 103 highlight the dangers of bomb attacks. Effective regulation of interstate commerce in explosives requires changes in the regulatory framework due to the diverse nature of explosive materials. The Congress recognizes the need for stricter regulation of explosives transactions to protect the safety and property of the citizenry and vital infrastructure for interstate and foreign commerce. SEC. 101. PERMITS FOR PURCHASE OF EXPLOSIVES. Section 842 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to regulate the transportation, distribution, and receipt of explosive materials.
