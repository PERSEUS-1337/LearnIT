The United States economy is experiencing a revolution in electronic commerce, with sales expected to reach $1.3 trillion by 2003. This shift promises to boost productivity and economic growth, particularly benefiting small businesses by providing new markets and business opportunities. Many small businesses may struggle to adopt electronic commerce technologies, especially in rural areas where competition from distant businesses is increasing. The United States aims to ensure all small businesses participate in the e-commerce revolution for economic growth. Establishing an electronic commerce extension program is crucial for small businesses in the United States to fully participate in the e-commerce revolution, similar to how other programs have helped farmers and manufacturers with new technologies. The Act aims to create an electronic commerce extension program for small businesses at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, establishing regional centers for technology transfer. The Act establishes Regional Centers for the Transfer of Electronic Commerce Technology to enhance productivity and technological performance in US electronic commerce through the transfer of technology and techniques developed at the Institute to companies nationwide. The Regional Centers for the Transfer of Electronic Commerce Technology aim to enhance productivity and technological performance in US electronic commerce by transferring technology and techniques to companies nationwide. This includes involving individuals from various sectors in cooperative technology transfer activities, making electronic commerce technology usable for small US-based companies, disseminating information to small companies with a focus on rural areas, and utilizing expertise from different entities when appropriate. The Centers established under this program aim to create electronic commerce demonstration systems for technology transfer and disseminate research findings to companies, especially small businesses. The Secretary may provide financial support to these Centers but not exceeding 50% of the required funds. Nonprofit institutions can apply for financial support to create and operate a Center under the program. Applicants must assure they will contribute at least 50% of the costs for the first three years. They must also propose how legal rights for any resulting inventions will be allocated. The Secretary will review each application submitted. The Secretary will subject each application to merit review for financial support for a Center under the program, considering technology transfer, training, service quality, geographical diversity, and funding sources. Centers will be evaluated in the third year of operation by an appointed panel. An evaluation panel, consisting of private experts and federal officials, will assess the performance of each Center against specified objectives. Funding for a Center in its fourth to sixth years is contingent on a positive evaluation. Continued funding may be provided at decreasing levels until the sixth year of operation. After the sixth year of operation, a Center may receive additional financial support if it has a positive evaluation through an independent review. The funding received cannot exceed one-third of the Center's costs in a fiscal year. The promotion of technology from research by Centers is subject to the provisions of title 35, United States Code. The promotion of technology from research by Centers under this section is allowed, with exceptions for specific technology extension or transfer services. The Secretary and Director can accept funds from other Federal departments and agencies for the support of Centers. The term 'electronic commerce' is defined as the buying, selling, and delivery of goods and services through computer networks. The Secretary of Commerce will publish a proposal for a program supporting Centers for the Transfer of Electronic Commerce Technology, including program description, applicant procedures, criteria for selection, and maximum support levels. The Secretary of Commerce will publish a final version of the program supporting Centers for the Transfer of Electronic Commerce Technology after a 30-day public comment period. Appropriations are authorized for the Department of Commerce each fiscal year for activities under this program."
