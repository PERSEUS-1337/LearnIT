    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Toxic Cleanup Equity and Acceleration Act of 1993\". It addresses municipal solid waste and sewage sludge. The Toxic Cleanup Equity and Acceleration Act of 1993 defines municipal solid waste as waste generated by households, commercial, institutional, and industrial sources that is similar to household waste. The Waste Disposal Act defines municipal solid waste as waste from households, commercial, institutional, and industrial sources, including various items like food waste, paper, clothing, appliances, and hazardous household waste. Sewage sludge refers to residue from treating municipal wastewater. The term 'municipality' includes various local governmental entities and individuals acting in an official capacity. Section 113 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 is amended to address contribution actions for municipal solid waste and sewage sludge. No municipality or person can be held liable for claims of contribution or response costs under this Act. The amendment to Section 122 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 clarifies that municipalities are not liable for owning or maintaining public right-of-ways where hazardous substances are transported. This includes roads, streets, and pipelines used for sewage disposal. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 is amended to include a new subsection regarding settlements for generators and transporters of municipal solid waste or sewage sludge. Eligible persons are defined as those facing administrative or judicial actions for waste-related activities. The Toxic Cleanup Equity and Acceleration Act of 1993 allows eligible persons to settle their liability for waste-related activities with the President by offering to settle in writing. This offer initiates a moratorium on further administrative or judicial actions unless the President deems the offer not in good faith. The Toxic Cleanup Equity and Acceleration Act of 1993 allows eligible persons to settle their liability for waste-related activities with the President by offering to settle in writing within one hundred and eighty days after receiving a notice of potential liability. This offer initiates a moratorium on further administrative or judicial actions unless the President deems the offer not in good faith. The Toxic Cleanup Equity and Acceleration Act of 1993 allows eligible persons to settle their liability for waste-related activities with the President by offering to settle in writing within one hundred and eighty days after receiving a notice of potential liability. If the President notifies an eligible person of potential responsibility, no further action can be taken against that person for one hundred and twenty days. The President must make a good faith effort to reach final settlements promptly, allocating no more than 4 percent of total response costs for waste-related activities. The President can reduce the percentage of response costs for waste-related activities if municipal solid waste and sewage sludge are not significant at the facility. Eligible persons are only required to pay their equitable share of the 4 percent portion of response costs. Payments can be limited based on inability to pay, litigative risks, public interest considerations, and equitable factors. Eligible persons can provide in-kind services instead of cash contributions and receive credit at market rates. The President may offer a covenant not to sue to individuals who settle under this subsection, even if they could be liable under other sections of the Act. This covenant can be provided unless it conflicts with the settlement agreement. The President may offer a covenant not to sue to individuals who settle under this subsection, even if they could be liable under other sections of the Act. Such settlements do not discharge other potentially responsible parties unless specified, but reduce their liability by the settlement amount. De minimis settlements do not affect a person's ability to reach a settlement with the President. Future disposal practices for municipal solid waste or sewage sludge are regulated under subsection (o). Eligible persons, such as municipalities or operators of treatment works, can assert liability provisions under specific circumstances, including the operation of a qualified hazardous waste collection program. Settlements with the President under this subsection may include a covenant not to sue and reduce liability for other responsible parties. The liability provisions under subsection (o) allow eligible persons to assert liability in specific circumstances, such as the operation of a qualified household hazardous waste collection program. This program must include semiannual collections at convenient locations with a goal of 10% household participation, along with a public education component. A qualified household hazardous waste collection program includes identifying hazardous household products, collecting waste from small generators, and outlining a comprehensive plan for program implementation. Small quantity generators must transport waste in accordance with the Solid Waste Disposal Act and dispose of it at a hazardous waste facility. Municipalities can assess fees for waste accepted during household hazardous waste collections. The Solid Waste Disposal Act prohibits municipalities from refusing waste believed to be in violation. The term 'qualified publicly owned treatment works' refers to facilities complying with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. The President can determine non-qualification of hazardous waste programs. If a program is not qualified, certain provisions do not apply. The Solid Waste Disposal Act prohibits municipalities from refusing waste believed to be in violation. If a municipality or treatment works is notified of noncompliance with sewage sludge requirements and it is not remedied within twelve months, certain provisions will not apply during the period of noncompliance. Amendments are made to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980. Amendments to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 include provisions regarding solid waste and sewage sludge, without modifying the Solid Waste Disposal Act or a State's authority under the Act. Settlement procedures and restrictions on legal proceedings apply even if waste components are considered hazardous substances. The Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 applies to municipalities and individuals facing legal action before the Act's effective date, unless a final court judgment or settlement agreement has been reached. If unresolved issues remain, the amendments will apply to those issues."
