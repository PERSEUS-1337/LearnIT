    "content": "Relatively high default and foreclosure rates in the housing market have raised concerns about the clarity of mortgage disclosure forms. Transparent mortgage terms could help consumers make informed decisions and prevent predatory lending practices. The Truth in Lending Act requires lenders to disclose credit costs and repayment terms to borrowers before any transactions. The TILA Disclosure Statement provides details on credit costs and terms, including the APR, finance charges, amount financed, total payments, and loan conditions. RESPA mandates disclosures on settlement costs like loan origination fees, credit report fees, and insurance fees. The RESPA mandates disclosures on settlement costs such as flood insurance fees, recording fees, attorney fees, and escrow account deposits. It requires providers of settlement services to provide a good faith estimate (GFE) of costs and prohibits referral fees or kickbacks among service providers. The Dodd-Frank Act transferred rulemaking authority for TILA provisions. The Dodd-Frank Act transferred rulemaking authority for TILA and RESPA provisions to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in 2011. The CFPB is working on creating a single disclosure form that combines TILA and RESPA requirements. The CFPB released initial Loan Estimate prototypes in 2011 and continues to update them. This report examines efforts to regulate loan information disclosure to consumers, including actions by the CFPB. The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) was amended in 1980 to require APR disclosure forms. In 2008, HUD made changes to the RESPA component of mortgage disclosure, including a standardized good faith estimate form to help consumers understand mortgage terms. The form includes information on interest rate changes, loan balance increases, prepayment penalties, balloon payments, and escrow payments. The HUD Good Faith Estimate (GFE) form provides detailed information about loan costs, including charges that cannot increase, charges allowed to increase up to 10%, and charges that may change at settlement. Borrowers have the option to withdraw their application if specific charges exceed the 10% limit, making it difficult for lenders to justify excessive fees. Separate GFEs are required for each loan product offered to the borrower. The HUD Good Faith Estimate (GFE) form provides detailed information about loan costs for different mortgage products. Separate GFEs are required for each product to reduce confusion and help borrowers compare costs. The GFE is provided in two stages, with the first stage occurring before the official mortgage application and the second stage involving underwriting after the borrower expresses willingness to proceed. The GFE becomes binding in stage 2 after borrower confirmation and underwriting process. If borrower doesn't qualify, lender may reject or propose a new GFE. TILA Disclosure Statement also has a two-stage process. Changes in APR require corrected Disclosure Statement before finalizing the loan. After borrower confirmation and underwriting, the final loan rates stated on GFE forms are likely to remain the same for prime borrowers. However, subprime borrowers may struggle to find accurate loan rate estimates before final underwriting, as lenders typically charge higher rates to compensate for risk. This system may make it difficult for high-risk borrowers to shop for competitive loan rates. The HUD-1 settlement statement is required at all mortgage loan settlements, listing all charges paid at closing. HUD modified the form to help borrowers compare estimated costs on the GFE with actual charges. This allows borrowers to see which charges remained the same or changed from the estimation stage to closing. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) study tested 819 consumers to assess their understanding of mortgage cost disclosures and loan terms. Both prime and subprime borrowers struggled to comprehend important mortgage costs, APR, loan amounts, and differences between interest rates and APR. Borrowers also had difficulty grasping complex loan terms like optional credit insurance, interest-only payments, balloon payments, and prepayment penalties. Many were unable to identify if balloon payments, prepayment penalties, or up-front loan charges were included in the loan offer. Loan charges are a significant part of a loan offer and can make borrowers vulnerable to predatory lending. HUD's revised GFE form includes new disclosure methods to help borrowers understand the fees they are charged for their mortgage loans. These charges can be collected through points or the yield spread premium (YSP). The revised GFE form discloses the total origination costs, which can be collected through a combination of up-front fees and YSP. The GFE form helps borrowers understand the trade-off between interest rates and fees. It shows how choosing a lower interest rate results in higher up-front costs, while a higher interest rate leads to lower up-front costs. HUD's final rule only required the leftmost column of the trade-off table to be filled out, allowing loan originators the option to complete the remaining columns. The option to fill out the remaining columns on the trade-off table was related to concerns about cost burden and time to calculate loan costs. Some borrowers may request complete filling of the table to achieve transparency. The CFPB proposed a standardized Loan Estimate form combining TILA Disclosure Statement and HUD's GFE. Testing for the new form will be conducted in six different cities. The CFPB plans to conduct five rounds of testing in six cities before proposing the final rule. They have convened a Small Business Review Panel for feedback on the prototype named Tupelo, which has three pages detailing loan information and projected monthly payments. The prototype also includes estimates for property taxes, insurance, and assessments. The Tupelo prototype for loan information and projected monthly payments includes details on closing costs, cash needed to close, monthly payment information, and potential changes in mortgage interest rates. Borrowers can also compare terms of other loans on the third page. The first section of the loan document allows borrowers to compare terms of other loans, listing total payments over five years, APR, interest paid percentage, and principal payment breakdown. The next section briefly covers appraisal, insurance, late payments, and servicing. The final section includes a space for the applicant's signature to confirm receipt. The CFPB has also created a prototype settlement disclosure combining the HUD-1 Settlement Statement and TILA disclosure."
