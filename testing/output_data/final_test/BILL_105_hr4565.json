The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to increase the carryback years for farming losses from 2 to 10 years for eligible taxpayers. Definitions and rules relating to farming losses are updated in Section 172 of the Code, including a new subsection (i) that defines farming losses and sets a $200,000 limitation. The $200,000 limitation for farming losses applies to all persons treated as 1 employer under specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code. For pass-thru entities like partnerships or trusts, the limitation is applied at both the entity and owner level. The limitation is also reduced by any farming loss determined for a corporation where the taxpayer is an owner. The term 'eligible taxpayer' refers to a taxpayer deriving over 50% of gross income from qualified farming businesses in the 3-year period prior to the current taxable year. A 'qualified farming business' is defined as a farming trade or business as per section 2032A, in which the taxpayer or a member is a 50 percent owner in the taxable year of the corporation ending in the taxpayer owner's taxable year. The term 'eligible taxpayer' refers to a taxpayer who materially participates in a qualified farming business and does not exceed $7,000,000 in sales in a taxable year. Owners who are members of a single family are treated as a single owner for this purpose. The terms '20 percent owner' and '50 percent owner' are defined in relation to section 416(i)(1)(B)(i). A farming loss for a taxable year is treated as a separate net operating loss for that year for purposes of applying subsection (b)(2). The taxpayer can elect to have the carryback period and farming loss determined without regard to certain provisions. This election must be made by the due date for filing the tax return and is irrevocable for that taxable year."
