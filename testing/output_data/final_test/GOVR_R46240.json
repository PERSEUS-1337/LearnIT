    "content": "Under the U.S. Constitution, Congress holds the \"power of the purse\" through various provisions such as the power to tax and borrow. Funds can only be drawn from the Treasury with appropriations made by law. The Constitution allows Congress to direct budgetary actions, but does not specify how these powers are to be exercised or the President's role in budget matters. Multiple statutes, rules, practices, and precedents have been established over time to govern budget decisions and actions. The budget process in Congress is a complex system with multiple decisions and actions occurring with varying degrees of coordination. There is no single process for all budgetary decisions, and each year may require many measures to establish or implement federal fiscal policy. Congress can adapt and change its rules and practices to achieve new goals or overcome obstacles. Notable milestones have shaped the evolution of procedures and practices related to budgetary legislation since the early years of the Republic. The evolution of budgetary legislation practices in Congress began with the establishment of standing committees like the Committee of Ways and Means in the House and the Committee on Finance in the Senate. This categorization of legislation by content laid the groundwork for current rules and practices. The establishment of separate standing Committees on Appropriations in Congress in the mid-19th century formalized the distinction between appropriations and general policy legislation. This distinction, derived from earlier British and colonial practices, was reflected in the designation of general appropriations measures as \"supply bills\" to simply provide funds for government operations already defined in law. Supply bills were initially considered as a list of expenditure objects with blanks for dollar amounts, filled in during floor action. Including new legislative language in supply bills was seen as inappropriate to avoid delays in fund provision. The separate consideration of policy legislation and appropriations was formalized in 1835 to prevent delays in enacting appropriations due to debatable matters. In 1837, a proposal was made to separate appropriation bills from debatable matters, but it was not initially adopted. However, in the 25th Congress, a rule was added stating that appropriations must be for activities previously authorized by law, limiting the scope of funding purposes. In 1876, the House adopted rules restricting legislative language in appropriations bills, stating that no appropriation shall be reported for any expenditure not previously authorized by law. Principles were also established in the 19th century regarding agency actions in executing the budget. The First Congress enacted appropriations in 1789, but Congress later began to control how agencies spent money with more specific appropriations. In 1809, the \"purpose statute\" restricted agency actions on fund allocation. However, agencies sometimes bypassed fiscal controls by obligating funds before appropriations, leading Congress to ratify the liabilities. In 1870, Congress enacted the first \"antideficiency\" provision to prevent agencies from exceeding appropriations and incurring coercive deficiencies. This law prohibited agencies from spending more than allocated funds and required them to apportion funds throughout the fiscal year to avoid shortages. The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 established a new relationship between the President, federal agencies, and Congress by requiring agencies to submit budget requests to the President, who would then consolidate them for Congress. This act also created the Bureau of the Budget (now the Office of Management and Budget) and the General Accounting Office (now the Government Accountability Office) to oversee government budget activities. In the 20th century, direct spending laws were introduced in federal budgeting, starting with Social Security in the 1930s. These laws mandated payments to eligible recipients without the need for annual appropriations. Such programs now make up the majority of federal spending. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 changed how Congress considers budgetary measures by allowing for the adoption of a concurrent resolution on the budget. This resolution helps Congress make decisions on fiscal policy and priorities, coordinating various budget-related measures. While the budget resolution does not have statutory effect, it sets revenue and spending levels that serve as the basis for enforcement. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 established the House and Senate Budget Committees and the CBO to provide budgetary information. Budget control statutes since 1985 restrict congressional actions to reduce the deficit, limit spending, and implement budget outcomes. These statutes supplement the existing budget process and add statutory controls to require deficit reduction legislation or limit future budget actions. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 and the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 were key laws enacted to reduce deficits. The 1985 Act established deficit reduction requirements over six years, with annual deficit limits and a process for spending cancellation. The 1990 Act shifted focus to budgetary control. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 shifted focus to budgetary control by implementing pay-as-you-go procedures and statutory spending caps to limit deficit increases. These mechanisms aimed to preserve deficit reduction achieved in accompanying legislation and were initially set to be in force for five years, but were extended twice. In 1993, PAYGO was extended through 1998 and in 1997 through 2002. In 2010, PAYGO was reinstated. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set limits on discretionary spending for FY2012-FY2021. The federal budget reflects government receipts, spending, borrowing, and debt. Receipts mainly come from taxes and other sources like leases and fees. Spending includes budget authority, obligations, outlays, and collections. Budget authority is provided by Congress, allowing agencies to incur obligations for which payments will be made. Obligations occur when agencies enter into contracts, while outlays happen when obligations are paid. The provision of budget authority by Congress allows agencies to incur obligations, which are paid through outlays such as checks, transfers, or cash. Congress controls federal spending through budget authority, but does not directly control outlays for executive or judicial branch spending. Outlays in a year come from new budget authority and carryover from prior years, with the spendout rate determining the rate at which funds are obligated and disbursed. Factors can impact the spendout rate for a program, with high spendout rates resulting in most budget authority being spent during the fiscal year. The spendout rate influences when most outlays occur, varying based on program characteristics and project timelines. Budget enforcement considers projected outlays for the first year of budget authority availability. The President and Congress can indirectly control outlays by limiting budget authority or obligation periods. Federal government receipts are recorded as revenues or offsets against outlays. The budget includes revenues from taxes and receipts from market transactions, which are deducted from outlays. Income from asset sales is also considered an offset to spending. These offsets can be classified as offsetting collections or receipts, with some requiring legislative action for appropriation. The budget is divided into federal funds and trust funds. The budget consists of federal funds and trust funds. Federal funds come from taxing power and borrowing, not designated for specific programs. Trust funds are designated for specific purposes, like Social Security. Unified budget includes both federal and trust funds. Trust funds may require legislative action for appropriation. The federal budget includes federal funds and trust funds. Trust funds may accumulate surplus funds, which are held as federal debt. This surplus can offset the budget deficit, but the federal debt still increases. Federal budgeting is based on cash flow, not separating capital and operating expenses. The federal budget includes expenditures for government operations and long-life assets like buildings and roads. Proposals to separate capital and operating accounts have not been adopted, but the budget does show investment and operating outlays. The budget also includes budgeted levels for direct and guaranteed loans, with the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 changing the accounting basis for these loans. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 introduced changes in estimating subsidy costs for loans and recording loan transactions. These changes had a significant impact on budgeting for specific loan programs. Off-budget entities and government-sponsored enterprises are excluded from budget totals, with separate reporting for Social Security trust funds and the Postal Service Fund. The budget reports two deficit/surplus amounts - one excluding these entities and the other including them in the unified budget. The unified budget includes government-owned corporations and revolving funds on a net basis, showing the difference between receipts and outlays. The Federal Reserve System's financial operations are excluded from the federal budget and funded by fees and income from securities. The Federal Reserve's financial operations are funded by fees and income from securities it owns. Annual appropriations approval is not required for Federal Reserve spending plans. GSEs have historically been excluded from the budget as non-governmental entities. Their budgets were not reviewed by the President or Congress in the same manner as other programs. In 2008, the economic downturn led to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac being placed under federal conservatorship. The Treasury had to sell debt instruments to cover shortfalls when government receipts were insufficient. Federal borrowing is limited by a statutory debt ceiling. The federal government operates with a budget deficit, leading to the need to increase the public debt limit. Congress has chosen to suspend the debt limit for a set amount of time instead of raising it by a fixed dollar amount. Legislation to raise the debt limit falls under the jurisdiction of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee. In some cases, Congress combines legislative provisions with changes in the debt limit. For example, the Senate amended a House-passed bill to add the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The House added debt limit provisions to an unrelated Senate-passed measure to create the Budget Control Act of 2011. Debt limit provisions may also be included in reconciliation legislation. In the 96th Congress, the House amended its rules for automatic engrossment of a debt limit increase upon final adoption of a budget resolution, known as the Gephardt Rule. The House Rule XXVIII facilitates quick action on debt limit increases by deeming the measure as passed by the House with the same vote as the budget resolution adoption. This rule has been repealed and reinstated multiple times in different Congresses. It suspends the debt limit through the end of the budget year if the resolution sets a different level of public debt. The House Rule XXVIII allows for quick action on debt limit increases by deeming the measure as passed by the House with the same vote as the budget resolution adoption. This rule suspends the debt limit through the end of the budget year for the concurrent resolution on the budget, following the Origination Clause requiring revenue measures to originate in the House of Representatives. The Origination Clause and House Rule XXI, clause 5, do not apply to legislation concerning receipts or collections like user fees. Revenue legislation often includes provisions that establish or alter tax expenditures. Congress typically makes changes to the tax laws each year to raise or lower revenues or redistribute the tax burden. Tax expenditures are revenue forgone due to deductions, exemptions, credits, and other exceptions in the tax code. Congress uses tax expenditures to achieve public policy goals instead of traditional spending. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the revenue impact of legislation changing tax expenditures. CBO also provides revenue estimates for the President's budget proposals. The budget resolution sets revenue totals for subsequent action on revenue measures, but does not specify changes to the tax code. Revenue policy changes can be made through regular legislative procedures or the reconciliation process. Congressional budget procedures distinguish between discretionary spending and tax expenditures. The budgetary procedures distinguish between discretionary spending controlled through annual appropriations and direct spending controlled outside the appropriations process. Both types of spending are included in the President's budget and congressional budget resolution, providing statutory authority for agencies to make payments. While distinct in formulation and consideration, some procedures overlap between the two. The basic unit for appropriations legislation is the spending account. In modern practice, regular appropriations legislation provides lump-sum amounts for each appropriations account, giving budget authority for specific activities or programs. Direct spending involves making payments to eligible recipients based on established criteria and benefits. The Appropriations Committees have jurisdiction over discretionary spending for federal agencies and programs, while legislative committees have jurisdiction over direct spending programs. Appropriations legislation may be used to provide financing for benefits, but funding requirements are determined through authorizing legislation. The Appropriations Committees handle discretionary spending for federal agencies, while legislative committees oversee direct spending programs. Budget authority in appropriations bills is typically for one fiscal year, while direct spending programs are usually established in permanent law. Congressional leadership determines the scheduling for legislation changes, not tied to the fiscal year. Enforcement of spending levels in the budget resolution is done through congressional procedures. Congress enforces policies in the annual budget resolution through procedures that differ for discretionary and direct spending programs. Allocations under Section 302 of the 1974 CBA ensure new spending legislation aligns with budget parameters. However, controlling direct spending from existing laws requires new legislation to change eligibility criteria and benefit payment formulas. This can be done through the regular legislative process or expedited procedures like reconciliation. Federal budgeting involves statutory controls and discretionary spending limits set by the Budget Control Act. Direct spending is not capped but is subject to the Statutory Pay-as-You-Go Act of 2010. The budgeting process includes the formulation of the President's budget request, congressional consideration, and expenditure review over multiple years. The budget cycle involves the formulation and submission of the President's budget to Congress, congressional consideration of budgetary measures, budget execution, and audit and review. Procedures and timing can vary based on economic and political factors. The President must submit the budget request for the next fiscal year at the beginning of the calendar year. Congressional sessions and the fiscal year are key components of the budget cycle. Since the ratification of the Twentieth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1933, congressional sessions have begun on January 3. The consideration of budgetary matters by Congress for the upcoming fiscal year typically starts near the beginning of the calendar year. The federal fiscal year has been October 1 through September 30 since FY1977. Congressional focus in the budget cycle is on enacting new annual appropriations legislation before the expiration of prior appropriations. This focus is reflected in the President's budget proposal. The budget process involves setting target dates for actions in the congressional budget process, addressing legislation for the upcoming fiscal year, as well as supplemental appropriations for disaster relief. Federal agencies manage multiple fiscal years simultaneously, including auditing completed years, implementing current budgets, seeking funds for the upcoming year, and planning for future years. The federal budget process involves setting target dates for actions in Congress, managing budgets for multiple fiscal years simultaneously, and the President's role in budgeting was formalized by the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921. The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 formalized the President's role in budgeting by requiring the President to submit a consolidated budget request to Congress before the start of each fiscal year. The President's budget submission reflects policy priorities, recommendations for federal programs, and proposed changes to revenue and mandatory spending laws. The preparation for the budget typically begins at least nine or 10 months prior to the submission deadline. OMB coordinates the development of the President's budget by issuing guidance to agency heads. OMB Circular No. A-11 is issued annually to provide agencies with budgetary guidance, including laws, policies, and financial management information. Agencies face uncertainty when developing budget estimates due to unknown economic conditions, presidential policies, and congressional actions. Agency requests are typically submitted to OMB in late summer or early fall for review. The budget requests are typically submitted to OMB in late summer or early fall for review. Agencies must link their budgets with government performance through strategic plans, annual performance plans, and reports. OMB notifies agencies of decisions through a \"passback\" process, allowing for appeals to the OMB director and the President. Final decisions by OMB and the President require agencies to revise their budget requests and performance plans accordingly. The President has the authority to determine the form and detail of the budget submission. The budget documents have evolved over the years, now presented as a multi-volume set including the President's message, analysis of proposals, historical data, and budget estimates. Agencies also prepare congressional budget justifications to support appropriations requests. The President's budget documents include congressional budget justifications, providing detailed information for agency testimony during Appropriations subcommittee hearings. A supplemental summary, the Mid-Session Review, must be submitted before July 16 each year, detailing any significant changes in expenditure estimates or proposals. Congress used to consider budgetary measures separately before the 1970s. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 changed the process of budget consideration by allowing Congress to adopt a concurrent resolution on the budget. This resolution sets aggregate budget policies and priorities for the upcoming budget year and at least four additional fiscal years. It does not have statutory effect, so no money can be raised or spent based on it. The main purpose is to establish a framework for Congress to consider separate revenue, spending, and other budget-related measures. The budget resolution sets revenue and spending amounts for enforcement of congressional budget policies through points of order. It also initiates the reconciliation process to conform existing laws to budget policies. Section 301(a) of the CBA requires budget aggregates and spending levels for each functional category for each fiscal year. The aggregates include total revenues, new budget authority, outlays, surplus or deficit, and public debt. The budget resolution sets revenue and spending amounts for enforcement of congressional budget policies through points of order. It also initiates the reconciliation process to conform existing laws to budget policies. The budget resolution must indicate amounts of new budget authority and outlays for each fiscal year, which do not include Social Security trust funds or Postal Service revenues. The report accompanying the budget resolution must compare total new budget authority, outlays, revenues, and surplus/deficit with the amounts requested in the President's budget. The budget resolution includes revenue and spending amounts, economic assumptions, tax expenditure levels, and committee spending allocations. It does not allocate funds to specific programs but sets total spending levels. The budget resolution sets total spending levels and committee spending allocations, with major program assumptions discussed in accompanying reports. Reconciliation directives are a significant optional feature, and the House and Senate Budget Committees are responsible for marking up and reporting the resolution. The \"views and estimates\" reports provide Budget Committees with information on congressional committees' preferences and legislative plans regarding budgetary matters. While Budget Committees consider specific programs in the budget resolution, funding decisions are ultimately made by the Appropriations Committees and committees with spending jurisdiction. Programmatic assumptions made during this process can influence the final outcome, although they are not binding. Floor consideration of the budget resolution is guided by statutory provisions and House and Senate rules. The budget resolution process is guided by statutory provisions and House and Senate rules. In the House, a special rule is typically reported by the Rules Committee to establish terms for consideration, including amendments. The Senate has fewer constraints but limits debate on budget resolutions to 50 hours. The budget resolution process in the Senate limits debate time to 50 hours, with amendments required to be germane. A cloture process is not necessary, allowing for a final vote by a simple majority. There is no limit on the number of amendments, leading to a \"vote-a-rama\" where amendments are considered without debate. The CBA allows for accelerated voting procedures by unanimous consent. The Congressional Budget Act (CBA) sets no procedural limit on the duration of a vote-a-rama in the Senate. A motion to proceed to consideration of a conference report on a budget resolution can be made at any time, with debate limited to 10 hours. In the House, a conference report is typically considered under a special rule with limited debate. The achievement of budget resolution policies depends on subsequent legislative actions, economic performance, and approval by the President. Factors influencing budgetary goals include economic conditions, technical considerations, and Congressional approval. Economic variations can impact revenue and spending levels, while technical errors in estimates can lead to significant differences. Failure to reach a budget resolution can complicate the budget process by limiting the ability to control the budgetary impact of legislation. The budget process can be complicated by the failure to reach a budget resolution, making it difficult to control the budgetary impact of legislation. Without a budget resolution, there is no enforceable upper limit on appropriations, but alternative means can be used to establish budget levels. Congress has used legislative procedures to address enforcement issues when agreement on a budget resolution is delayed or not reached. Congress has used legislative procedures, known as \"deeming resolutions,\" to establish enforceable budget levels when agreement on a budget resolution is delayed. Deeming resolutions vary in legislative vehicle, timing, duration, and content, with simple resolutions initially used in each chamber. Deeming resolutions are used by Congress to set budget levels when a budget resolution is delayed. They can be included in appropriations bills or budget enforcement legislation. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 included provisions for budget enforcement for FY2012 and FY2013 in the Senate. These resolutions allow for enforceable spending caps and baseline projections. Adopting a deeming resolution does not prevent later approval of a budget. Deeming resolutions in Congress allow for setting budget levels when a budget resolution is delayed. They typically include enforceable budgetary levels and language making them enforceable as if included in a budget resolution. Variations exist in their content, with some mirroring everything in a budget resolution adopted in that chamber. Congress must have access to complete and up-to-date budgetary information to enforce budget parameters. A baseline projects federal spending and receipts under existing law, serving as a benchmark for proposed policy changes. Scoring legislation allows Congress to understand the budgetary impact of its actions. When a measure with spending or revenue impact is under consideration, scoring information helps Members determine if it would violate budgetary rules. Section 312(a) of the CBA designates the House and Senate Budget Committees as the principal scorekeepers for Congress, providing estimates for enforcing budgetary parameters. CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation assist by preparing cost estimates and reports for the Budget Committees. The CBA supports Congress by preparing budgetary impact estimates for revenue legislation. Congress has tools to enforce decisions made in the budget resolution, including overall spending ceiling, revenue floor, and committee allocations. Appropriations Committees must adhere to their allocation subdivisions, enforceable by points of order. Other budgetary limits and increases are also subject to points of order. Points of order are prohibitions against certain types of legislation or congressional actions breaching budget limits. They must be raised by a Member before enforcement by the presiding officer. In the Senate, most budget-related points of order can be waived by a three-fifths vote. If a waiver motion fails, the provision is ruled out of order. In the House, points of order, including budget enforcement, can be waived by special rules or unanimous consent to protect bills or amendments from being ruled out of order. Waivers may apply to specific provisions or amendments, even if not granted for the underlying bill. The House may grant a blanket waiver to protect against any point of order. Reconciliation is a legislative process that allows Congress to make policy changes related to spending or revenues through an expedited procedure. It involves stages starting with the adoption of a budget resolution and allows for privileged consideration of specific measures with limited amending opportunities. The reconciliation process in Congress involves adopting a budget resolution with reconciliation instructions to committees, allowing for the development of legislation to change laws related to spending, revenues, or the debt limit. This process limits amending opportunities and debate duration on the Senate floor. The reconciliation process in Congress involves committees being instructed to submit legislation that either reduces spending or increases revenues by specific amounts. The instructed amounts serve as minimums for savings or revenue increases, but as a maximum for revenue decreases. If a committee fails to comply with the instructions, procedures allow for reconciliation to proceed regardless. This process limits amending opportunities and debate duration on the Senate floor. During the reconciliation process in Congress, committees can add noncompliant legislation to a reconciliation bill to bring it into compliance. Policy choices are up to the committee, and instructions may include specific options but are not binding. Committees may be directed to report legislation to their chamber or submit it to the Budget Committee for inclusion in an omnibus reconciliation measure. The Budget Committee must report the omnibus measure without substantive revision. During the reconciliation process in Congress, committees can add noncompliant legislation to a reconciliation bill to bring it into compliance. The Budget Committee must report the omnibus measure without substantive revision, but there is no strict deadline for reporting reconciliation bills. Floor consideration of reconciliation legislation in the House is governed by special rules, while the Senate can use expedited procedures for consideration. The Senate can use expedited procedures to consider a reconciliation bill, allowing for immediate voting without the need for a cloture process. Section 310 of the CBA limits total debate time on a reconciliation measure to 20 hours, with equal division and control by the majority and minority. After the debate time expires, Senators can still offer amendments and make other motions or appeals. The Senate can use expedited procedures to consider a reconciliation bill, allowing for immediate voting without the need for a cloture process. Despite the limit on debate time, Senators can continue to offer amendments in a vote-a-rama. The Byrd Rule prohibits including extraneous provisions in reconciliation bills or amendments. If a Byrd Rule point of order is sustained, the provision is stricken. The Byrd Rule places limits on reconciliation bill amendments, requiring them to be germane and not increase spending levels without offsetting effects. Amendments must adhere to the provisions reported from an instructed committee. The Byrd Rule places limits on reconciliation bill amendments, requiring them to be germane and not increase spending levels without offsetting effects. Points of order related to limiting the content of reconciliation bills may be waived by a three-fifths vote. Differences in reconciliation legislation passed by both chambers must be resolved before the bill can be sent to the President. Conference reports on reconciliation bills are privileged for consideration by the Senate, with limited debate time of 10 hours. Reconciliation is a powerful legislative tool used to implement budgetary goals and policy choices. It requires bicameral agreement and has time constraints for floor debate in the Senate, allowing major legislation to be enacted by majority vote. Congress enacts annual appropriations through regular measures, limiting funding to authorized purposes. Authorizations define government authority, while appropriations allocate funds. An authorization defines government authority to establish federal agencies, programs, policies, and activities. It may also authorize subsequent congressional action for appropriations. Appropriations provide budget authority for federal agencies to incur obligations and make payments from the Treasury for specified purposes. Legislative committees handle authorizing and appropriating tasks within the committee system. Committees like the House Committee on Armed Services and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation authorize legislation for agencies and programs. Authorization statutes provide authority for agencies to administer programs or activities, with appropriations committees overseeing funding through annual bills. Authorization also implicitly allows Congress to appropriate funds for programs or activities. Authorization statutes provide authority for agencies to administer programs or activities, with appropriations committees overseeing funding through annual bills. Authorizations of appropriations may need to be renewed periodically, even if the underlying authority in an organic statute remains. Federal agencies operate under various authorizing statutes, and there is no requirement for authorizations to mirror appropriations account structures. Authorization statutes provide authority for agencies to administer programs or activities, with appropriations committees overseeing funding through annual bills. The burden of proving funding authorization falls on bill proponents. Unauthorized appropriations exceed authorization limits or fund unapproved purposes. Congress is not obligated to provide appropriations for authorized discretionary spending programs. House and Senate rules maintain the separation between authorizations and appropriations. The term unauthorized appropriations does not have a legal meaning in subsequent funding. If unauthorized appropriations are not challenged, they have the force of law. Appropriations passed by Congress give agencies the authority to spend for specific purposes. The power of appropriation comes from the Constitution, allowing the Treasury Department to make payments for designated purposes. Appropriations are a legislative power that limits the executive branch, ensuring agencies spend within their allocated amounts and for specified purposes set by Congress. Annual appropriations are a common practice, with funds needing to be used in the fiscal year provided unless stated otherwise in the law. In appropriations acts, limitations on fund use expire at the end of the fiscal year unless extended. Congress passes regular, supplemental, and continuing appropriations acts to provide budget authority to agencies. Congress typically acts on 12 regular appropriations bills in a session, sometimes merging them into \"minibus\" or \"omnibus\" legislation. The BCA established statutory and procedural limits on discretionary spending for each fiscal year from FY2012 through FY2021. The Appropriations Committee in each chamber allocates the amount to subcommittees as per Section 302(a) and 302(b) of the CBA. Appropriations measures typically originate in the House of Representatives. In the House, appropriations bills are originated by the Appropriations Committee and considered in relevant subcommittees before full committee action. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees have 12 subcommittees each, with the House holding hearings on requests after the President's budget submission. Subcommittees follow discretionary spending limits set by the full committee under Section 302(b) of the CBA. The Senate typically considers appropriations bills after House passage, but may expedite action if needed. The Senate can expedite actions on appropriations bills by considering a Senate-numbered bill up to final passage when the House is delayed. An appropriation bill consists of accounts, with each account containing provisions specific to that account only. Federal agencies often have multiple accounts for different purposes like operations and construction. Appropriation accounts encompass various activities or projects, with directives often provided in committee reports. Each appropriations act includes general provisions that apply to all accounts, with funds typically allocated for a single fiscal year and lapsing if not obligated. Congress can specify that appropriations lapse if not obligated by the end of the year, or they can designate funds as \"no-year\" funds. Continuing appropriations acts, or CRs, provide interim budget authority to prevent funding gaps or government shutdowns when regular appropriations acts are delayed. These CRs address issues such as coverage and duration until regular appropriations acts are completed. Continuing appropriations acts, or CRs, provide temporary funding for specific activities based on the prior fiscal year's appropriations acts. They specify a duration of budget authority, which can range from a single day to the entire fiscal year. CRs may be superseded by regular appropriations acts if enacted before the CR expires. Funding provided by CRs is based on a rate rather than a set amount, which can be determined by the previous year's operations rate or adjusted by a percentage. Continuing appropriations acts, or CRs, provide temporary funding based on the prior fiscal year's appropriations. They specify a duration of budget authority and are based on a rate rather than a set amount. Factors like historical spending patterns and provisions in CRs impact the rate of operations. CRs for mandatory spending maintain program levels under current law. Funds expended under a CR are considered part of the total amount provided for the fiscal year. Continuing resolutions (CRs) provide temporary funding based on the prior fiscal year's appropriations. They include language carrying forward terms and conditions on budget authority and typically prohibit \"new starts\" to limit agencies from making long-term commitments. CRs ensure that only limited actions are taken to preserve congressional prerogative in determining funding amounts. Federal agencies must interpret and apply appropriation terms to execute budgetary responsibilities. Funds can be obligated and expended based on the purpose and time period specified in appropriations statutes. Adjustments, known as \"anomalies,\" may be made to the duration and amount of funds in a continuing resolution for specific activities or programs. Federal agencies have discretion in allocating and spending appropriated funds within statutory restrictions. The Antideficiency Act outlines prohibited activities, apportionment systems, and budgetary reserves. These provisions, found in Title 31 of the United States Code, are crucial in the execution phase of the federal budget process. The Antideficiency Act, originating in 1870, prohibits government departments from exceeding appropriations made by Congress. Amendments in 1905 and 1906 expanded the law's provisions, adding restrictions on voluntary services and imposing criminal penalties for violations. These laws also introduced the concept of \"apportionment,\" requiring budget authority to be allocated in installments to prevent overspending. The Antideficiency Act, amended in 1905 and 1906, prohibits government departments from exceeding appropriations by Congress. It includes prohibitions on making expenditures in excess of the appropriation, in advance of the appropriation, accepting voluntary service, and exceeding apportionments. Concerns about a government shutdown due to a funding gap have been raised, with the \"Civiletti Letters\" providing guidance on the Act's enforcement. The \"Civiletti Letters\" provide guidance on the Antideficiency Act, stating that agencies cannot make contracts or obligate funds without appropriations from Congress. The Act does not allow agencies to employ their staff during a funding gap, except for fulfilling legal obligations for orderly termination of operations. The second letter from January 1981 discusses the interpretation of obligational authorities authorized by law but not in appropriations acts. Congress has authorized agencies to incur obligations without appropriations in some cases. When a funding gap occurs, executive agencies begin a shutdown of affected projects and activities, including furloughing non-excepted personnel. Federal agencies have discretion in determining how to spend funds provided to them, even when the purpose of appropriations is specified. They can shift funds between purposes through reprogramming and transfers without additional statutory authority. Federal agencies have the discretion to shift funds between purposes through reprogramming and transfers without additional statutory authority. Transfers involve moving budget authority from one account to another, either within the same agency or between different agencies. Transfer authority must be specifically authorized by law, and agencies must notify Congress when making transfers. Transferred funds remain subject to any limitations or conditions imposed by the original appropriations act. Transferred funds are subject to original restrictions regardless of differences in receiving accounts. Statutory restrictions may limit transfer authority with \"not-to-exceed\" caps. Appropriations set spending limits and expectations for fund usage. When an agency declines to use all or part of an appropriation, it deviates from Congress's intentions. Presidents have limited authority to reduce or withhold agency funding, as established by Supreme Court decisions and the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. Impoundments by the President or federal agencies delay or withhold the obligation or expenditure of budget authority, categorized as deferrals or rescissions. The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 limits the President's authority to withhold or reduce agency funding, categorized as deferrals or rescissions. A rescission is a presidential request to cancel an appropriation, while a deferral delays the use of funds. The Act initially allowed the President to propose deferrals, which could be prevented by either the House or Senate. However, the process was later found unconstitutional after the Supreme Court's decision in INS v. Chadha. The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit invalidated the deferral provisions in the Impoundment Control Act (ICA) in City of New Haven v. United States. This decision also eliminated the President's statutory authority to make deferrals for policy reasons. Congress amended the ICA in 1987 to specify permissible reasons for deferrals and limit their duration. Under the Impoundment Control Act (ICA), the President must submit a special rescission message to Congress when withholding funds. Funds can only be withheld for a 45-day period specified in the act. The message must detail the amount to be rescinded, accounts and programs affected, fiscal and program effects, and reasons for the rescission. Congress can pass a rescission bill that includes all, part, or none of the proposed amount. Funds must be released after the 45-day period unless Congress acts. The Impoundment Control Act (ICA) requires the President to submit a special rescission message to Congress when withholding funds for a 45-day period. Congress can pass a rescission bill within this period, which can limit committee consideration and restrict floor debate. The President can also propose cancellations of budget authority through other means, but funds requested for cancellation cannot be withheld indefinitely. The Impoundment Control Act (ICA) requires the President to submit a special rescission message to Congress when withholding funds for a 45-day period. The Trump Administration has submitted rescission requests to Congress, but past Presidents did not send rescission proposals under the ICA. Congress can initiate fund rescissions independently and may include them in appropriations bills. Sequestration was used from 1985 to 2002 to enforce budget enforcement policies. Sequestration is a method used to enforce budgetary requirements and spending limits. It involves the cancellation of non-exempt budget resources to achieve outlay savings and deficit reduction. Once triggered by a report from the OMB director, spending reductions are made automatically. To enforce statutory discretionary spending caps, OMB provides a preview report at the beginning of the year with adjustments to limits for the upcoming fiscal year. After discretionary spending is enacted, OMB evaluates it against the limits and determines if sequestration is needed. The final report is issued within 15 days after the congressional session ends. For enforcement of the Statutory PAYGO Act, OMB tracks budgetary effects of revenue and spending provisions on two scorecards for five and ten-year periods. The Statutory PAYGO Act requires OMB to issue an annual report within 14 days after Congress adjourns. If a violation is found, the President issues a sequestration order for across-the-board cuts in nonexempt direct spending programs. Some programs are exempt from cuts, and reductions are limited by statutory provisions. The Budget Act of 1974 outlines the distribution of new budget authority, entitlement authority, and outlays to House and Senate committees as agreed upon in a budget resolution. It requires the allocation of spending among committees with jurisdiction over direct or discretionary spending. The Appropriations Committees in each chamber further subdivide the allocation among their subcommittees. A point of order is established against any bill or amendment that breaches the allocated amounts for committees or subcommittees. Apportionment is the process where federal agencies, in coordination with the Office of Management and Budget, plan how budget authority from spending laws will be used throughout the fiscal year to prevent funds from being exhausted prematurely. Appropriation is legislation that grants budget authority for federal agencies to incur obligations and make payments for specific purposes. Authorization is a statutory provision that establishes or continues a federal agency's operations. Authorization is a statutory provision that establishes or continues a federal agency, activity, or program, setting policies and restrictions. It may implicitly or explicitly authorize congressional action for appropriations, specifying funding levels and periods. An authorization of appropriations does not provide budget authority, which must be included in subsequent appropriations legislation. It is seen as a ceiling on appropriations amounts, not a minimum. The Congressional Budget Office prepares baseline projections for measuring budgetary effects of proposed changes in federal revenues or spending. Budget authority is the authority provided by federal law to enter into financial obligations involving federal government funds. Budget resolution is a concurrent resolution that outlines budgetary surpluses or deficits for upcoming fiscal years. A budget resolution is a concurrent resolution under the Congressional Budget Act that guides fiscal policy decisions and priorities for Congress. It does not have the force of law and cannot be signed or vetoed by the President. Revenue and spending amounts set in the resolution serve as the basis for enforcing congressional budget policies. If annual appropriations acts are not passed by the start of the fiscal year, a continuing resolution may be enacted to provide temporary funding for programs until regular appropriations are approved. Continuing resolutions (CRs) provide temporary funding for programs until regular appropriations are approved. They allow agencies to operate at a specified rate and can be extended through subsequent CRs. Deeming resolution is an informal term for a resolution or bill that establishes budgetary enforcement actions in the absence of a budget resolution. Direct spending is defined in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Direct spending, also known as mandatory or entitlement spending, includes entitlement authority, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and other budget authority provided in laws other than appropriations acts. Examples are Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, unemployment insurance, and military and federal civilian pensions. On the other hand, discretionary spending is defined as budget authority in annual appropriation acts that Congress can choose the amounts for. Discretionary spending for FY2012-FY2021 is limited by statutory spending limits enacted in the Budget Control Act of 2011. The fiscal year for the federal government begins on October 1 and ends on September 30, designated by the calendar year in which it ends. Functional categories classify federal budgetary activities into major purposes or national needs, providing a broad statement of priorities. Functional categories in the budget resolution serve as broad statements of budget priorities, allowing for an understanding of trends in related programs. Obligations create a legal liability for the government to pay for goods and services, with outlays occurring immediately or in the future. Appropriation laws typically make funds available for obligations for one or more fiscal years, with outlays potentially happening at a later time. Offsetting receipts/collections are funds collected from the public through business-like activities, recorded as negative spending amounts. Outlays are actual payments from the Treasury resulting from obligations in appropriations and direct spending legislation. The PAYGO budgetary enforcement mechanism requires any increase in the deficit from changes in direct spending or revenues to be offset by equivalent spending cuts or revenue increases over a specified period. Established in 1990 and currently under the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010. The President must issue a sequester order to eliminate deficit increases from changes in direct spending and revenue laws. PAYGO procedures in the House and Senate enforce legislation requirements. Reconciliation allows for expedited changes to revenue or spending laws to align with budget resolutions. The Budget Act allows for expedited consideration of reconciliation bills in the Senate by limiting debate to 20 hours and amendments. Reprogramming involves shifting funds within an appropriation account, while rescission repeals previously enacted budget authority. The President can request rescissions, but if Congress does not approve within 45 days, the funds cannot be withheld. The Budget Act allows for expedited consideration of reconciliation bills in the Senate by limiting debate to 20 hours and amendments. Reprogramming involves shifting funds within an appropriation account, while rescission repeals previously enacted budget authority. Congress may rescind all, part, or none of an amount proposed by the President within 45 days of continuous session. Revenues are funds collected from the public primarily as a result of the federal government's exercise of its sovereign powers. Scorekeeping involves estimating the budgetary effects of pending legislation and comparing those effects to a baseline. The Budget Committees in the House and Senate act as official scorekeepers, providing estimates for decisions on budgetary parameters. Sequestration is a procedure where the President cancels budgetary resources to enforce budget requirements. Transfers involve shifting budget authority between appropriation accounts. Transfers of budget authority between appropriation accounts must be specifically authorized by law."
