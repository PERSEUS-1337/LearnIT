The Regional Infrastructure Accelerator Act of 2017 establishes a program to facilitate investment in economically viable infrastructure projects of regional or national significance. It aims to provide funding for these projects, including private sector financing, to accelerate the delivery of critical infrastructure facilities. Additionally, the Act encourages regional infrastructure accelerators to assist public entities with funding opportunities and promote innovative financing practices.

The Regional Infrastructure Accelerator Act of 2017 establishes a program to provide grants to regional infrastructure accelerators. The Regional Infrastructure Accelerator Act of 2017 requires an RIA to have a board of directors, including a representative of a public entity in the area served. The board is appointed by the entity that submitted the application and is responsible for developing a regional infrastructure accelerator plan. The Regional Infrastructure Accelerator Act of 2017 mandates that an RIA's board of directors, appointed by the submitting entity, develop an accelerator plan, select public entities for subgrants, and submit reports to the Secretary. The board must consider stakeholder input from project sponsors and entities capable of financing infrastructure projects.

SEC. 5. INITIAL GRANTS. An RIA seeking a grant must submit an application with a proposed plan outlining how they will promote investment in infrastructure projects by providing guidance, evaluating financing methods, connecting financing sources with public entities, and establishing measurement standards. The curr_chunk outlines standards for measuring life-cycle costs of investments in infrastructure projects, enhancing State and local governments' capacity to evaluate and structure projects involving private capital, and providing technical assistance on best practices for such projects. This includes identifying qualified advisors, incorporating resiliency risk analyses, preparing requests for proposals, and applying standardized analyses and processes. The Secretary will select 5 RIAs from diverse regions for grants to assess regional approaches for innovative infrastructure investment and develop strategies for transparency and bundling projects. The Secretary will select 5 RIAs for grants to assess regional approaches for innovative infrastructure investment, develop strategies for transparency, bundling projects, and reduce transaction costs. This includes creating a catalog of infrastructure projects, analyzing procurement methods, managing risks, and assessing completion speed and quality. The Regional Infrastructure Accelerators (RIAs) will assess contracting strategies for infrastructure projects, including design, construction, financing, and maintenance solutions to achieve performance outcomes. They will also submit a report to the Secretary within 1 year of receiving a grant, detailing the implementation of their plan, infrastructure needs of the region, and proposed projects for future grants. The Secretary will review reports from RIAs and select at least 4 for subsequent grants under section 6, within 60 days of receiving the final report. The Secretary will select at least 4 reports from RIAs for subsequent grants under section 6 within 60 days of receiving the final report. The Secretary will award subsequent grants to RIAs selected under section 4(f) to make subgrants to State, local, or regional public entities for specified purposes. Entities may apply for subgrants and use the funds as determined appropriate by the RIA. The funds from an RIA can be used by public entities for various costs related to infrastructure projects, including planning, design, financial planning, permitting, workforce assessment, and community engagement. Public outreach and community engagement for infrastructure projects funded by an RIA subgrant are limited to $300,000 or 75% of the project cost, whichever is less. Recipients must cover the remaining costs, and funds cannot be used for work already completed on the project. SEC. 7. ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS. The Secretary ensures that laborers on construction projects funded by this Act are paid prevailing wages determined by the Secretary of Labor in consultation with relevant state agencies. The Secretary of Labor determines minimum wages for laborers and mechanics on projects funded by the Act, to be included in project advertisements and bid proposals.
