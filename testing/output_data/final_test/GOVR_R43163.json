    "content": "The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 requires the President to submit a federal budget annually to Congress, containing estimates, proposals, and policy recommendations. While Congress is not obligated to adopt the President's budget, it serves as an important policy tool and initiates the congressional budget process. The President's budget submission to Congress informs recommended spending levels for agencies and programs. This report outlines the origins, content, and deadlines for the President's budget. Before the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, the executive budget process was decentralized. The budget process was decentralized until the mid-to-late 1800s, with agencies submitting requests directly to Congress. The Book of Estimates compiled agency requests but was not a consolidated federal budget. Laws in the late 19th and early 20th centuries prohibited agencies from submitting requests directly to Congress. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, laws were enacted that required agencies to submit budget requests through the Secretary of the Treasury, rather than directly to Congress. President Taft created the Commission on Economy and Efficiency in 1910 to address the lack of coordination among agencies in budget submissions. President Taft created the Commission on Economy and Efficiency in 1910 to propose reforms to the executive budget process. The commission recommended a consolidated budget submission to Congress, including a budget message, financial reports, proposed revenues and expenditures, and detailed supporting information. The President's budget contents have been modified and expanded since 1921 by statutes like the Budget and Accounting Act. The President's budget, as outlined in statutes like the Budget and Accounting Procedures Act of 1950 and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, must include estimated receipts, expenditures, and proposed appropriations for the next five fiscal years, actual financial data from the previous year, information on the public debt, and details on specific appropriations accounts and trust funds. Additionally, it may include information on the costs and performance of federal programs. The President's budget includes estimated receipts, expenditures, and proposed appropriations for the next five fiscal years, actual financial data from the previous year, information on the public debt, and details on specific appropriations accounts and trust funds. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) assists in developing the budget by issuing guidance to executive agencies and reviewing their budget requests to ensure consistency with the President's policy objectives. The President's budget submission includes estimated receipts, expenditures, and proposed appropriations for the next five fiscal years. Various agencies and government-sponsored enterprises follow specific procedures for submitting their budget proposals to Congress, some directly and others through the President or OMB. Additionally, certain reports are required to be submitted along with the President's budget. The President's budget submission includes estimated receipts, expenditures, and proposed appropriations for the next five fiscal years. The structure and format of the President's budget have varied, with recent submissions in multiple volumes like Budget of the U.S. Government, Historical Tables, Analytical Perspectives, and Appendix. Additional supplemental materials and supporting documents are provided electronically. The Budget volume presented to Congress outlines the President's policy priorities, including summary tables of budgetary aggregates and estimates of the effects on the deficit. It covers fiscal years FY2015 through FY2026 and includes detailed descriptions of proposed government activities and programs. The organization of the Budget volume shifted in FY2016 to focus on policy issues rather than specific departments, with FY2017 discussing national security challenges. The Budget volume for FY2017 discusses national security challenges and longer-term policy issues such as climate change, education, and infrastructure. President Obama's budget submission includes proposed cuts, consolidations, and savings. The Historical Tables volume provides a historical overview of federal government finances, including budget authority, government receipts, outlays, and the federal debt dating back several decades. The President's budget submission includes historical tables adjusted for consistency and comparability. The Analytical Perspectives volume provides in-depth analysis of government programs, crosscut budgets, and budget concepts. It also includes a glossary of budget terms. The Analytical Perspectives volume included in the President's budget submission provides detailed reports on various programs and budgetary effects, such as the Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The web-based version of the volume contains supplemental information and tables on budget authority and outlays organized by function, category, and agency. The Appendix volume in the President's budget submission contains detailed budget estimates and financial information for each appropriations account and selected programs. It includes proposed appropriations language, explanations of funded work, and general provisions for agencies. Additionally, supplemental materials like legislative proposals and budget guides may be included. The President may revise budget recommendations or submit supplemental requests to Congress at any time during the year under Title 31 of the U.S. Code. Changes for the current fiscal year are called \"supplementals,\" while changes for the upcoming fiscal year are called \"amendments.\" The deadline for budget submission has been changed by statute in 1950, 1985, and 1990. The Budget and Accounting Procedures Act of 1950, the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, and the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 all changed the deadline for budget submission to Congress. The deadline was extended to the first Monday in February each year starting in FY1988. This change allowed outgoing Presidents to leave the budget submission to their successors, as seen with George H. W. Bush, William J. Clinton, and George W. Bush in 1993, 2001, and 2009 respectively. In 95 years, the President has submitted the budget on or before the statutory deadline 76 times. The deadline for budget submission was changed to the first Monday in February starting in FY1988. The first budget submission of incoming Presidents in 1993, 2001, and 2009 was after the deadline. The President's budget has been submitted on or before the statutory deadline 76 times. On 54 occasions, it was submitted on the deadline, and on 22 occasions, it was submitted early. There were 19 instances when the budget was submitted after the deadline, with an average delay of 31.71 days. During transition years, the President's budget was delayed in FY1989, FY1997, and FY2014. President Reagan's FY1989 budget was delayed by 45 days due to delayed appropriations. President Clinton's FY1997 budget was delayed by 43 days due to uncertainties in appropriations and policy changes. President Obama's FY2014 budget was delayed by 65 days. The FY2014 budget was submitted 65 days after the deadline due to fiscal negotiations and uncertainty from sequestration. Transition-year budgets since FY1994 have been delayed, as shown in Figure 1."
