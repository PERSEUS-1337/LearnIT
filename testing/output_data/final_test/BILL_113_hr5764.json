    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2014\" and focuses on the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to establish a Great Lakes Restoration Initiative within the Agency to prioritize programs and projects for Great Lakes protection and restoration, including remediation of toxic substances and areas of concern. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative focuses on invasive species control, nearshore health protection, habitat restoration, and accountability activities in collaboration with federal partners. The Great Lakes Interagency Task Force selects programs and projects for Great Lakes protection based on strategic environmental outcomes, feasibility of implementation, and opportunities for improvement. The Great Lakes Interagency Task Force aims to improve coordination and collaboration to streamline efforts in implementing federal and state projects for Great Lakes protection. The Administrator may transfer up to $300,000,000 to federal departments or agencies to support the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. Interagency agreements can also be made to carry out related activities. Projects under the Initiative on multiple levels include Great Lakes-wide and Great Lakes basin-wide efforts. No funds can be used for water infrastructure activities unless it is a green infrastructure project improving habitat and ecosystem functions in the Great Lakes. The curr_chunk discusses the funding and activities related to the Great Lakes Initiative. Federal agencies are required to maintain funding levels for Great Lakes activities and identify new projects to support environmental goals. Authorized funding is available for these initiatives. The Great Lakes Initiative is authorized to receive $300,000,000 annually from 2015 to 2019 for its activities. The House of Representatives passed the bill on December 9, 2014."
