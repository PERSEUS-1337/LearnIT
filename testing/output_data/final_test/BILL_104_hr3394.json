    "content": "The \"Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1996\" is defined in this section. The \"Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1996\" defines key terms such as compact, compact region, disposal, generate, and low-level radioactive waste. Compact refers to an agreement between multiple states, compact region is the area of member states, disposal is the permanent isolation of waste, generate means to produce waste, and low-level radioactive waste is material that is not highly radioactive. The \"Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1996\" defines low-level radioactive waste as material that is not highly radioactive and excludes waste owned or generated by the Department of Energy, the United States Navy, or related to atomic weapons. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission classifies this waste as low-level radioactive waste. The \"Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1996\" defines low-level radioactive waste as material that is not highly radioactive and excludes waste owned or generated by the Department of Energy, the United States Navy, or related to atomic weapons. The Act classifies low-level radioactive waste as containing class A, B, or C radioactive waste as defined by regulations. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior, and a \"sited compact region\" is a region with disposal facilities like Barnwell in South Carolina and Richland in Washington. The term \"State\" in the context of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1996 refers to any State of the United States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The Secretary is responsible for disposing of low-level radioactive waste generated outside sited compact regions. Each compact region must handle waste generated within it. States outside compact regions can dispose of waste generated within their borders, but are not obligated to accept waste from other states unless under contract with the Secretary. A disposal facility must be established. The Secretary is responsible for establishing a disposal facility for low-level radioactive waste on federal land. The facility may accept waste from the Department of Energy's disposal facility. The Secretary must accept low-level radioactive waste from states outside a compact region by January 1, 1997. They can contract with the Department of Energy for temporary storage and disposal of the waste, or with states for disposal at licensed facilities. The Secretary will take possession of waste from generators, brokers, or state officials. Starting January 1, 1997, the Secretary of Energy will accept low-level radioactive waste from generators, brokers, or state officials, regardless of whether a contract with the Secretary has been signed. The Secretary will establish rates for low-level radioactive waste disposal to cover actual costs and administrative expenses. Rates may be based on waste volume or activity but not exceed $500 per cubic foot. The Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act is repealed, and the Secretary of the Interior's duties are amended to include commercial low-level radioactive waste disposal."
