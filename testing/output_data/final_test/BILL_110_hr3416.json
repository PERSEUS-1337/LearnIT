    "content": "The \"America's Energy Security Trust Fund Act of 2007\" imposes a tax on the carbon dioxide content of certain substances according to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This includes provisions for refunds or credits and definitions and special rules. The \"America's Energy Security Trust Fund Act of 2007\" imposes a tax on taxable carbon substances based on their carbon dioxide content. The tax amount is determined per ton of carbon dioxide, with specific applicable amounts set for different calendar years. The tax amount for a calendar year after 2008 is calculated based on the preceding year's amount multiplied by 1.1 and adjusted for the cost of living. No tax is imposed if a prior tax has already been paid for the same product. \"SEC. 4692. REFUNDS OR CREDITS.\" Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, a person using a taxable carbon substance as a feedstock to prevent carbon emissions can receive a credit or refund equal to the tax amount under section 4691(b). Additionally, carrying out a qualified offset project can also result in a credit or refund equal to the tax amount for that substance. Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, a person can receive a credit or refund for a taxable carbon substance used in a qualified offset project that reduces greenhouse gas emissions, sequesters greenhouse gases, or destroys hydrofluorocarbons. This does not apply to projects involving enhanced oil recovery. The tax paid on a taxable carbon substance used in manufacturing other taxable substances can be credited or refunded. The credit or refund amount cannot exceed the tax imposed on the other taxable fuel. No tax is imposed on the sale of taxable carbon substances for export. The tax paid on a taxable carbon substance can be credited or refunded if it was exported or used in manufacturing a taxable carbon substance that was exported. Proof of export is required, and rules similar to section 4221(b) apply. Tax paid on exported taxable carbon substance can be credited or refunded if proof of export is provided and conditions are met. The Secretary may allow a credit or refund of the tax on exported taxable carbon substance if the exporter provides required information and the person who paid the tax waives their claim. Regulations will be prescribed to implement this provision. \"Definitions and special rules are outlined in section 4693.\" The curr_chunk defines key terms related to taxable carbon substances, including coal, petroleum, natural gas, the United States, importer, and ton. The curr_chunk explains that a 'ton' of taxable carbon substance in gas form is equivalent to 2,000 pounds on a molecular weight basis. It also states that if a person uses a taxable carbon substance they manufacture, produce, or import, they are liable for tax as if it were sold. Additionally, special rules apply for inventory exchanges involving taxable carbon substances. The curr_chunk discusses the registration requirement for inventory exchanges involving taxable carbon substances. It states that both parties must be registered with the Secretary and the receiving party must notify the manufacturer of their registration number. The curr_chunk defines \"inventory exchange\" as the exchange of property described in section 1221(a)(1). Additionally, it establishes America's Energy Security Trust Fund in the tax code. \"SEC. 9511. AMERICA'S ENERGY SECURITY TRUST FUND.\" The America's Energy Security Trust Fund is established in the Treasury, funded by revenues from a specific tax. Amounts in the Trust Fund are available for a tax credit for clean energy technology research, development, or investment. The America's Energy Security Trust Fund in the Treasury is funded by revenues from a specific tax and available for a tax credit for clean energy technology research, development, or investment. Transition assistance is provided to industries negatively affected by the Act, with remaining funds allocated for payroll tax relief. For calendar years 2008 to 2015, specific percentages of funds from the America's Energy Security Trust Fund are allocated for clean energy technology research and development. For calendar years 2008 to 2015, specific percentages of funds from the America's Energy Security Trust Fund are allocated for clean energy technology research and development. In 2015, 3/10 of the amount from 2008 is allocated, in 2016 it's 1/5, in 2017 it's 1/10, and from 2018 onwards, no funds are allocated. The text introduces a tax on carbon dioxide content of certain substances and establishes a Taxable Carbon Substances Trust Fund. It also includes a carbon tax rebate of payroll tax. The effective date for these amendments is January 1, 2008. The individual is eligible for a carbon tax rebate against the tax imposed for the taxable year, based on their share determined by the Secretary on a per capita basis. The determination is made on estimates by the Secretary, with adjustments for the succeeding year. The tax credit for individuals in a taxable year is limited based on payroll taxes paid and social security benefits received. The credit amount cannot exceed the total taxes paid or 10 percent of social security benefits received by the individual for the year.
