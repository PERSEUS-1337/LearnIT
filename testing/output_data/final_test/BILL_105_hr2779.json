    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Safe Havens for Children Act of 1997\". Congress finds that family violence does not necessarily stop after legal separation, with custody disputes more common in cases of domestic violence. Violence often escalates post-separation, with abusive fathers more likely to seek sole custody and continue threats through legal actions. Children in homes where mothers are abused often witness the violence, leading to aggressive, antisocial, and fearful behaviors. Perpetrators may use children as pawns to control the abused party and escalate violence during separation or divorce. Women and children are at a heightened risk of violence in such situations. Women and children are at an elevated risk of violence during separation or divorce, with a high percentage of men who abuse their partners also abusing their children. Domestic assaults often occur after separation, and a significant number of spousal homicides involve separated couples. Battered women seek emergency medical services post-separation, highlighting the need for protection measures like visitation centers. The purpose of visitation centers is to protect children and victims of domestic violence from further trauma and abuse during parent and child visitation exchanges. They provide a safe haven for parents and children to promote continuity and stability. \"Grants to states for supervised visitation centers.\" The Attorney General may award grants to States for establishing supervised visitation centers, with at least 50% of grants used for nonprofit entities. Considerations for grants include the number of families served and the effectiveness of the centers. The Attorney General may award grants to States for supervised visitation centers, with considerations for underserved populations, collaboration with local entities, and coordination with court systems. Amounts provided under the grant must be used appropriately. Amounts provided under a grant or contract for supervised visitation centers must be used to establish centers and provide services to economically disadvantaged individuals. Grantees must target those who cannot afford visitation services and offer sliding fee options. The Attorney General will award grants to States and regulate the use of funds. The Attorney General prioritizes grants for states considering domestic violence in custody decisions. Applicants must show expertise in family violence, collaborate with local programs, and demonstrate high-quality service to victims. The Attorney General must report to Congress annually on the number of individuals served and turned away from supervised visitation services, categorized by State and underserved populations. The report should also include information on the presenting problems such as domestic violence, child abuse, and other factors underlying the need for supervised visitation. The report to Congress must include information on factors such as the number of supervised visitations ordered during custody determinations, the protection process during visitations, safety and security issues, and parental abduction cases in judicial districts using supervised visitation services. Authorization of Appropriations: $75,000,000 for fiscal year 1998, $85,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, and $95,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, with at least 95 percent to be used for awarding grants."
