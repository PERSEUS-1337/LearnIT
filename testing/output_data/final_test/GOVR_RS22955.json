    "content": "On May 18, 2015, the WTO confirmed that U.S. country-of-origin labeling for beef and pork violated WTO obligations. Canada and Mexico sought permission to impose $3 billion in retaliatory tariffs. Senator Hoeven introduced the Voluntary COOL and Trade Enhancement Act of 2015 to repeal mandatory COOL for meat products. Senator Roberts introduced an amendment to repeal mandatory COOL for beef, pork, and chicken, while Senator Hoeven proposed a voluntary program that was not included in the final Senate-passed bill. Canada and Mexico have stated that repealing COOL is the only way to resolve the WTO case. Canada's Agriculture Minister warned that a voluntary program would lead to Canadian retaliation. The WTO arbitration panel determined that Canada could request retaliation of C$1.055 billion and Mexico US$228 million due to the discriminatory nature of the COOL program. The enacted Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 repealed COOL to avoid higher tariffs on U.S. products. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 repealed COOL for beef and pork, bringing the US into compliance with WTO obligations. The repeal did not include chicken products or voluntary COOL provisions. The repeal of COOL for beef and pork in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 effectively ends the COOL case. Canada and Mexico requested authorization to retaliate, which was granted by the DSB. USDA issued a final rule to amend COOL regulations for beef, pork, and ground beef and pork to conform with the repeal amendment. The repeal of COOL for beef and pork in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 effectively ends the COOL case. Since the 1930s, U.S. tariff law has required imports to carry labels for the \"ultimate purchaser\" to determine their country of origin. Various groups have pushed to end exceptions to COOL for agricultural commodities, arguing that consumers have a right to know where their food comes from. Opponents argue there is little evidence consumers want this information. Opponents of COOL exemptions argue that consumers have a right to know the origin of their food, while opponents claim there is little evidence to support this. The 2002 farm bill made COOL mandatory for various agricultural commodities, with some arguing it was protectionist and would hinder trade efforts. The implementation of Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) for pork, lamb, seafood, and peanuts was postponed multiple times due to controversy within the food and agricultural industry. Changes were made to ease provisions of the 2002 COOL law, including modifications to record-keeping requirements, labeling criteria, and penalties for noncompliance. These amendments were incorporated into the 2008 farm bill, requiring COOL to take effect on September 30, 2008. The 2008 farm bill mandated Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) to include goat meat, chicken, macadamia nuts, pecans, and ginseng. The final rule was issued by the USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service in January 2009, with changes from the interim rule criticized for watering down the COOL statute. Secretary of Agriculture Vilsack announced the final rule would take effect on March 16, 2009, urging industries to voluntarily adopt additional changes for more specific origin information for consumers. The 2008 farm bill mandated Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) for various products. Secretary of Agriculture Vilsack urged industries to provide more specific origin information to consumers. Supporters argued that consumers want COOL and would pay extra for it. Benefits of COOL are expected to be small and mainly benefit consumers who desire origin information. Consumers may pay a premium for \"COOL meat\" from the United States if they perceive it as safer and higher quality than foreign meat. USDA estimated a 1% to 5% increase in demand for benefits to cover COOL costs, but such increases were not anticipated. Mandatory country-of-origin labeling (COOL) costs estimated at $2.6 billion for affected parties. Compliance costs may outweigh consumer benefits. Applies to various products including beef, lamb, pork, fish, shellfish, peanuts, and perishable agricultural commodities. The Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act defines covered commodities as fresh and frozen fruits, vegetables, goat meat, chicken, pecans, macadamia nuts, and ginseng. Retailers purchasing over $230,000 annually must label origin information on these items at the final point of sale. Food service establishments are exempt from these labeling requirements. The COOL law applies to restaurants, cafeterias, bars, and similar facilities selling food to the public. It addresses difficulties in designating country of origin for products like meats produced in multiple countries. The law permits the U.S. origin label on meats exclusively born, raised, and slaughtered in the U.S., with exceptions for animals present before July 15, 2008. Meat or chicken with multiple countries of origin can be labeled from all countries where the animals were born, raised, or slaughtered. Meat or chicken imported for immediate U.S. slaughter must be labeled with the country of origin. The COOL law requires labeling of products from animals not born, raised, or slaughtered in the United States with their correct country of origin. Ground meat and chicken products must list all countries of origin. The meat labeling requirements have been complex and controversial due to the steps needed to segregate and hold products. The COOL law mandates labeling of products from animals not born, raised, or slaughtered in the U.S. with their correct country of origin. Meat processors planned to use a \"catch-all\" label for multiple countries, leading to concerns about overuse. USDA clarified that mixed-origin claims are allowed for meats from both U.S. and non-U.S. animals. The final rule clarified that muscle cut products from exclusively U.S. origin and foreign-born animals can be labeled as a combined U.S. and non-U.S. label if commingled for slaughter on a single production day. The National Farmers Union viewed this as a loophole that could allow meat packers to use a multiple countries label instead of labeling U.S. products accurately. The final rule regarding labeling under NAFTA has raised concerns among Senators and industry representatives. They believe that allowing multiple country of origin labels on products could mislead consumers and defeat the purpose of providing accurate information. Secretary of Agriculture Vilsack urged industry representatives to voluntarily adopt three suggested labeling changes to address these concerns. Secretary of Agriculture Vilsack urged industry representatives to voluntarily adopt three suggested labeling changes to provide more useful information to consumers than the final rule itself might imply. These changes dealt with labeling meat products with multiple countries of origin, reducing the time allowance for labeling ground meat held in inventory, and exemptions to the rules for processed products. Vilsack emphasized the importance of including information about production steps in each country when multiple countries appear on the label, giving examples of how animals born and raised in different countries should be labeled. The Secretary of Agriculture Vilsack urged industry representatives to adopt labeling changes for meat products, including reducing the time allowance for labeling ground meat. This change aims to enhance label credibility and provide consumers with adequate information. Additionally, retailers can only claim U.S. origin for perishable agricultural commodities if exclusively produced in the United States. For nuts and perishable agricultural commodities, retailers can only claim U.S. origin if exclusively produced in the United States. U.S. state, region, or locality designation is sufficient as a U.S. identifier. For fish and shellfish, U.S.-labeled products must be derived exclusively from those hatched, raised, harvested, and processed in the United States. Wild fish and shellfish must be harvested in U.S. waters or by a U.S. flagged vessel and processed in the United States or on a U.S. vessel. Country-of-origin labels may not be found on all food due to exemptions, including restaurants and small retail grocery stores. USDA's final rule on country-of-origin labeling (COOL) exempts processed food items derived from covered commodities. Any change that alters the basic character of a covered commodity is considered processing. Only a small percentage of beef, pork, chicken, and fruit/vegetable supplies may be covered by COOL requirements at the retail level. Critics argue that the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) overstepped its authority. The final rule on country-of-origin labeling exempts minimally processed commodities from labeling requirements. Critics argue that AMS overstepped its authority, but AMS maintains that many imported items still require COOL labeling under the Tariff Act of 1930. Vilsack acknowledged that the definition of \"processed foods\" may be too broad and suggested voluntary labeling for certain processed products. The 2008 law eased requirements for maintaining verifiable record-keeping audit trails for covered commodities, allowing USDA to conduct audits instead. Livestock producers were particularly concerned about the complications and costs of tracking animals from birth to retail sale. Producers of plant-based commodities and food retailers also expressed worries about the difficulty and cost of maintaining records for highly fungible commodities. In its final rule, AMS stated that covered persons must keep records for one year to identify the source and recipient of covered commodities. Slaughter facilities can accept producer affidavits for animal origin claims. Fines for noncompliance are set at $1,000 per violation. AMS oversees COOL through a surveillance program. In 2014, USDA's AMS conducted 2,982 retail surveillance reviews and 570 follow-up reviews to ensure COOL compliance. Retailer compliance was at 91%, supplier to retailer compliance was 98%. The AMS COOL program was funded at about $5 million in FY2014. The OIG report highlighted the need for improvements in AMS controls and processes to ensure full compliance with COOL regulations by retailers and suppliers. AMS agreed with all recommendations and had incorporated 11 of them by late 2012. Meat labeling was a contentious issue, leading to challenges from Canada and Mexico through the WTO dispute settlement process. Canada and Mexico challenged COOL through the WTO dispute settlement process due to concerns about its impact on their livestock sectors. Imports of cattle and hogs from Canada and Mexico dropped in 2008 and 2009, with some attributing the decline to COOL while others cited factors like exchange rates and inventory levels. Consultations were requested with the United States in 2008 and 2009 regarding the issue. Canada and Mexico challenged COOL through the WTO dispute settlement process in response to concerns about its impact on their livestock sectors. Both countries requested consultations with the United States in 2008 and 2009, followed by a request for a WTO panel in October 2009. The U.S. Trade Representative and Secretary of Agriculture expressed regret that consultations did not resolve concerns, defending COOL as providing consumers with information consistent with WTO commitments. Canada and Mexico asserted that COOL is inconsistent with U.S. obligations under certain WTO agreements. The WTO panel was requested by Canada and Mexico due to concerns about the impact of COOL on their livestock sectors. The panel was established on November 19, 2009, to consider complaints regarding COOL's inconsistency with U.S. obligations under certain WTO agreements. These obligations include treating imports no less favorably than domestic products, ensuring product-related requirements are not overly restrictive, and preventing laws on country of origin from creating trade barriers. The Canadian beef and pork industries, represented by the Canadian Cattlemen's Association and the Canadian Pork Council, filed a WTO challenge against the U.S. over COOL requirements. They argued that the regulations discriminated against Canadian exporters, resulting in significant financial losses. The CCA estimated that COOL cost its producers millions of dollars and led to decreased demand for Canadian cattle in the U.S. market. The U.S. demand for Canadian cattle decreased, leading to lower prices and increased shipping costs to fewer U.S. plants. Canadian pork producers shared similar concerns. The USTR's request for public comment on the WTO case sparked heated debate among key players in the livestock sector. The American Meat Institute (AMI) argued that COOL violates WTO and NAFTA commitments by favoring domestic meat over imports. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA) expressed worry about potential retaliatory actions against U.S. beef due to Canada's challenge of COOL rules. The debate over COOL (Country of Origin Labeling) in the livestock sector continues, with the American Meat Institute and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association expressing concerns about its impact on trade relationships. On the other hand, the U.S. Cattlemen's Association and the National Farmers Union argue that COOL is consistent with WTO commitments and does not discriminate between domestic and imported beef. The Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund also supports COOL. The WTO dispute settlement panel ruled that certain COOL requirements violate WTO agreements on trade barriers. The COOL measure treated imported livestock less favorably than domestic livestock in labeling muscle cut meats, violating national treatment obligations. The measure failed to meet the objective of providing information to consumers on meat product origins. The WTO dispute settlement panel found that the United States violated WTO agreements by implementing COOL requirements that treated imported livestock less favorably than domestic livestock in labeling muscle cut meats. The panel concluded that the COOL measure did not effectively provide information to consumers on meat product origins, recommending the U.S. to conform these \"inconsistent measures\" with its obligations under the TBT Agreement and GATT 1994. The U.S. panel disagreed with the design of COOL requirements but affirmed commitment to provide consumers with accurate origin information on meat products. USTR may appeal and the U.S. meat sector has mixed reactions, with some groups urging for changes to make COOL WTO-compliant to avoid potential tariffs on U.S. agricultural exports. AMI and FMI, along with other groups, oppose COOL as it is deemed non-compliant with WTO regulations. They advocate for a legislative fix to avoid trade war risks with Canada and Mexico. Livestock groups like R-CALF and USCA support COOL but criticize the WTO's interference with U.S. sovereignty. FMI suggests developing an alternative system to provide consumers with useful information. R-CALF and USCA strongly oppose the WTO's interference with U.S. sovereignty regarding COOL labeling. USCA supports USTR's defense efforts and pledges to assist with the appeal process. NFU also supports COOL and vows to ensure its implementation in accordance with WTO regulations, with a willingness to appeal if necessary. Public Citizen and Food and Water Watch urge the Administration to appeal the WTO's ruling against COOL labeling for meats, stating that the WTO is prioritizing trade flows over consumer and environmental protection. Members of Congress have varied opinions on the issue, with some believing that pursuing more unwinnable WTO cases is not in the best interest of U.S. agricultural producers. Senator Pat Roberts, then ranking Member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, expressed doubts about the effectiveness of American consumers buying more American products with labels in stores. In contrast, 19 Senators urged the Obama Administration to appeal the WTO ruling on COOL labeling for meats to ensure compliance with international trade obligations while providing information to consumers. They emphasized the importance of nondiscriminatory labeling for both domestic and imported products. The final COOL rule establishes a labeling system providing important information to consumers without burdening the industry. The WTO ruling on COOL labeling was welcomed by the Canadian government as a victory for their livestock industry, recognizing the integrated nature of the North American supply chain. Removing onerous labeling measures will improve competitiveness and strengthen the prosperity of Canadian and American producers. The hope is that this ruling will lead to a negotiated settlement of the dispute. The Canadian government expressed hope that the WTO ruling on COOL labeling will lead to a negotiated settlement of the dispute. The Canadian Pork Council and Canadian Cattlemen's Association believe COOL legislation restricts market access and discriminates against Canadian livestock producers. They plan to work with like-minded groups in the U.S. to find a solution without further litigation. The Canadian Cattlemen's Association (CCA) is working with the U.S. industry to address the negative impact of COOL regulations on Canadian cattle imports. The United States appealed certain aspects of the WTO ruling on COOL to the WTO Appellate Body. The United States appealed two findings of the DS panel's report to the WTO Appellate Body regarding COOL requirements for beef and pork. USTR reaffirmed its commitment to providing consumers with accurate origin information and fighting for U.S. consumer interests at the WTO. Interest groups supported the appeal, while others expressed disappointment and concerns about trading relationships with Canada. The United States appealed the WTO's findings on COOL requirements for beef and pork, risking trading relationships with Canada and Mexico. Canada and Mexico plan to defend their interests in the appeal process. The WTO upheld that COOL treats imported livestock less favorably than domestic ones due to record-keeping requirements. The AB reversed the DS panel's finding on COOL requirements, stating that it partially met its objective to provide origin information. The DSB adopted the AB's report, making acceptance of the decision mandatory for the US, Canada, and Mexico. The WTO's Dispute Settlement Understanding outlines a process for countries to comply with adopted findings. Compliance deadlines are set, and if disagreements persist, the dispute may enter a compliance panel or retaliation phase. The United States had 30 days to inform the DSB of its plans to implement the WTO findings. Compliance and retaliation processes can delay resolution for months. The WTO's Dispute Settlement Understanding sets compliance deadlines for countries to implement findings. If disputes on deadlines arise, an arbitrator may determine a reasonable period. In a specific case, the US, Canada, and Mexico couldn't agree on a timeline, so an arbitrator decided on a 10-month compliance period for the US. The United States was given until May 23, 2013 to bring COOL into WTO compliance. Facing the deadline, the US began modifying COOL features targeted by WTO panels' findings. USDA released a proposed rule on March 12, 2013, to improve COOL program operation. The revised final rule was issued on May 23, 2013, aligning with WTO trade obligations. The USDA revised the COOL rule for meat products to comply with WTO findings. The rule requires retail labels to include the country of origin for each production step, such as where the animals were born, raised, and slaughtered. It also prohibits commingling muscle meat from different production days and the use of multi-country labels. The revised COOL rule for meat products requires labels to show the country of origin for each production stage, eliminating mixed origin labels. Meat from animals born, raised, and slaughtered in the United States must be labeled accordingly. The revised COOL rule for meat products now requires labels to show the country of origin for each production stage, eliminating mixed origin labels. Meat labels must include each production step (born, raised, and slaughtered) for processed animals. The labeling requirement for imported muscle cuts of meat remains unchanged, but labels may include production steps with supporting documentation. The definition of retailer has also been extended in the revised rule. The revised COOL rule extended the definition of retailer to include those meeting the definition in the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act of 1930, regardless of having a PACA license. The rule, effective from May 23, 2013, did not apply to muscle cuts produced before that date. USDA allowed a six-month period for industry education, use of existing labels, and clearance of old labeled meat stocks. Retailers were required to provide in-store signs notifying country of origin. The USDA estimated the cost of implementing new labeling under the revised COOL rule at $32.8 million. The final rule estimated the cost of losing commingling flexibility at $90.5 million. Total implementation costs range from $53.1 million to $192.1 million. The USDA estimated the cost of implementing new labeling under the revised COOL rule at $32.8 million to $137.8 million. Most labeling costs will be borne by packing and processing facilities. Economic benefits from adding production steps to labels are likely \"comparatively small.\" U.S. farm and ranch groups support USDA's decision to keep COOL in compliance with the WTO's ruling. The USDA's decision to bring COOL into compliance with the WTO's ruling is praised by various farm and ranch groups. The revised rule will provide consumers with more information on food origins, strengthening the program and meeting international trade obligations. USCA, NFU, and R-CALF support the rule, noting its similarity to their proposals and the importance of accurate labeling for consumers. The USDA's revised COOL rule aims to inform consumers about meat origins, allowing them to support U.S. farmers. However, livestock groups like AMI and NCBA oppose the rule, citing potential harm to American agriculture and increased burdens on meat companies. NCBA warns of possible retaliation against U.S. beef producers. In July 2013, the meat industry challenged USDA and the COOL rule in U.S. District Court. Tyson Foods, Inc. announced it would stop buying direct-to-slaughter cattle from Canada due to increased costs from the COOL rule. Canadian industry representatives believe the revised COOL rule will not bring the U.S. into compliance and will increase discrimination. The Canadian Cattlemen's Association stated the new rule will impact Canadian cattle by requiring additional segregation. The Canadian Pork Council and Canadian Cattlemen's Association are against the new COOL rule, stating it will increase discrimination and eliminate flexibility to commingle Canadian and US live swine at processing plants. Both Canada and Mexico rejected the USDA revised rule as a solution to the WTO dispute. Canada's government expressed extreme disappointment with the changes, believing they will not bring the US into compliance with its WTO obligations. Canada and Mexico are against the new COOL rule, believing it will increase discrimination and damages to the industry on both sides of the border. Canada is considering retaliatory measures, as the revised rule does not meet WTO requirements. Canada released a list of products imported from the US that could be targeted for retaliation. The tariff codes covering various commodities and products were published in the Canada Gazette for public comment. Canada plans to consult with stakeholders to resolve the COOL dispute over the next 18 to 24 months, abiding by WTO obligations. Mexico has not released a retaliation list but may target products similar to those in the U.S.-Mexico trucking dispute. Damage claims could range from $1 to $2 billion, with the Canadian hog industry suffering $500 million annually due to COOL. According to a CPC study in 2013, COOL has caused significant harm to the Canadian hog and cattle industries, with annual losses estimated at $500 million and $639 million respectively. Mexico's cattle sector has also been affected, with per-head discounts on imported cattle reaching up to $60 due to COOL. If the dispute escalates to retaliation, the WTO would need to approve the level of retaliation, with Canada and Mexico having the right to confirm their acceptance of compliance measures taken by the United States. Canada and Mexico could request a compliance panel to investigate if the United States had complied with WTO findings regarding COOL. Both countries argued that the US's revised COOL rule did not meet WTO obligations. Procedures were agreed upon to establish a compliance panel and address compensation or suspension of concessions. Canada and Mexico could request a compliance panel at any time without prior consultations with the US. Canada and Mexico informed the DSB of their request for a compliance panel regarding COOL without prior consultations with the United States. The panel found that while COOL is a legitimate objective, its implementation unfairly treats imported livestock. The panel could not determine if the COOL rule was excessively trade restrictive. The WTO DSB granted a special meeting requested by Canada and Mexico to adopt the compliance panel report on COOL regulations. The United States appealed the finding that COOL discriminates against imported livestock, leading to the Appellate Body reviewing the case. The Appellate Body released its report on May 18, 2015, upholding the findings. The Appellate Body upheld the compliance panel findings that COOL regulations violated U.S. WTO obligations. The DSB adopted the reports at a meeting on May 29, 2015. Canada and Mexico may now request WTO authorization to retaliate against the United States. Supporters and opponents of COOL have similar reactions to the compliance panel findings. Supporters of COOL view the compliance panel findings as a win, as the WTO confirmed the legitimacy of providing origin information about beef and pork to consumers. They believe that deficiencies in the COOL rule can be corrected through revised regulations. On the other hand, opponents argue that revised regulations will not help the US comply with WTO findings and advocate for the repeal of the COOL law. The Reform Coalition, consisting of over 100 business and agribusiness organizations, is urging Congress to direct USDA to rescind parts of COOL that violate WTO obligations. Congressional views on COOL are mixed, with some House members recommending rescinding the rule if the WTO rules against the US, while some Senators are asking for no action until the WTO process is completed. Canada and Mexico are calling for the repeal of the COOL law to reintegrate the North American cattle and hog market. Canada and Mexico sought authorization to retaliate against U.S. products if the COOL case was not resolved. Canada requested C$3.068 billion and Mexico requested US$653.5 million, later revised to $713 million. USTR refuted the damages claimed, estimating them at $91 million. The arbitration panel heard the case for suspension of concessions in September 2015. Canada and Mexico sought authorization to retaliate against U.S. products if the COOL case was not resolved. The arbitrator's role is to determine that the retaliation request is equivalent to the losses by Canada and Mexico. Once arbitration is requested, the WTO arbitrator has 60 days to issue a decision. Canada and Mexico will formally request authorization from the DSB for retaliatory measures. The WTO arbitration panel valued Canada's annual trade losses due to COOL at C$1.055 billion and Mexico's losses at $228 million. The approved retaliation amount was slightly over $1 billion, based on direct export losses caused by COOL. Indirect losses were not considered in the retaliation decision. The DSB granted concessions to Canada and Mexico for retaliation against US imports due to COOL effects. Calls for Congress to act on COOL have increased, with some lawmakers considering legislation to limit its impact or repeal it. Previous efforts to modify COOL were not included in the 2014 farm bill. In November 2014, Secretary of Agriculture Vilsack stated that USDA analysis showed no regulatory fix for COOL regulations to comply with the law and WTO rulings. Canada and Mexico needed to specify acceptable measures, or Congress had to provide different directions for WTO compliance. USDA delivered an economic study of COOL to Congress in May 2015, finding that while COOL information may benefit consumers, there was insufficient evidence of increased demand for beef and pork. The study found that without an increase in demand for beef and pork, implementing COOL would result in losses for producers along the supply chain. In response to the WTO arbitration panel's decision, Congress permanently repealed COOL for beef and pork in December 2015. Congress used the annual appropriations process to permanently repeal COOL for beef and pork and their ground products. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 removed references to muscle cuts of beef and pork and ground beef and pork from the COOL statute. Secretary Vilsack announced that USDA would halt COOL enforcement for beef and pork and amend regulations accordingly. The repeal did not include chicken and ground chicken, and some stakeholders wanted a voluntary COOL provision. On May 18, 2015, House Agriculture Committee Chairman Conaway introduced the Country of Origin Labeling Amendments Act of 2015 (H.R. 2393) to repeal beef, pork, and chicken from the COOL statute. The House Agriculture Committee marked up H.R. 2393 on May 20, 2015, and it was favorably reported to the full House. On June 10, 2015, the House passed H.R. 2393 by a vote of 300 to 131. Representative Massie submitted an amendment during the House Committee on Rules hearing that proposed a voluntary country-of-origin labeling law to replace the repealed mandatory law for beef, pork, and chicken. The House passed H.R. 2393 to repeal COOL for beef, pork, and chicken. An amendment for a voluntary \"Product of US\" labeling law was proposed but not considered. Senator Hoeven introduced S. 1844 to repeal mandatory COOL and establish a voluntary labeling system. The USDA is required to establish a label for beef, pork, and chicken from livestock born, raised, and slaughtered in the U.S. Senator Roberts introduced an amendment to repeal mandatory COOL for meat labeling. Senator Hoeven also introduced a bill for a voluntary labeling program. Supporters believe this program would address the WTO case, provide integrity to the U.S. label for meat, and inform consumers about the origin of the meat. Supporters believe a voluntary COOL program would provide integrity to the U.S. meat label and inform consumers about meat origin. Canada and Mexico insist on repealing COOL to resolve the WTO case, fearing retaliation if a voluntary program discriminates against imported livestock. If implemented, the U.S. could seek WTO compliance for the new program, but retaliation could still occur even if mandatory COOL is replaced. The COOL law is repealed and replaced with a voluntary program, leading to higher tariffs on U.S. products while a compliance panel reviews the new program. Congress directed USDA to submit a report on changing the COOL law to align with U.S. WTO obligations. Secretary Vilsack maintains that there is no regulatory fix for COOL and Congress needs to address the issue. The House Committee on Appropriations disapproved of USDA's COOL rule due to high costs and potential WTO retaliation. Representative DeLauro urged USDA to continue enforcing COOL regulations. Mandatory COOL for beef and pork was repealed in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. The provision removed references to beef and pork in the COOL statute. In the 113th Congress, House and Senate conferees completed work on the farm bill without major changes to COOL's language. Senator Johanns withdrew an amendment to repeal COOL for beef, lamb, and pork, citing concerns about USDA's proposed rule addressing WTO findings. The Senate-passed farm bill contains no COOL provisions, while the House-passed farm bill included a provision requiring USDA to conduct an economic analysis. The 2013 farm bill provision (Section 11105) required USDA to analyze the economic impact of the proposed COOL rule. Conferees debated potential changes to the COOL law, with discussions on a WTO-compliant solution and a \"North American\" meat label. USDA Secretary Vilsack suggested letting the WTO process resolve the COOL issue. The farm bill conference report to H.R. 2642, released on January 27, 2014, did not contain any language to repeal or modify the COOL law. The only COOL-related provision includes an economic analysis of the final rule instead of the proposed rule. Venison was added as a covered commodity. COOL opponents expressed disappointment that the WTO COOL dispute was not resolved. Under the Tariff Act of 1930, imported items must be marked in English to show their country of origin for the \"ultimate purchaser.\" This includes food products like Danish ham or Italian olive oil. If the item undergoes substantial transformation by a U.S. processor, they are considered the ultimate purchaser. The Tariff Act of 1930 requires imported items to be marked with their country of origin for the ultimate purchaser. Exceptions to labeling requirements, like the J List, exempt certain items that were not required to be marked. This includes specified agricultural products in their natural state or minimally processed for safe transportation. The Tariff Act of 1930 mandates country-of-origin labels on imported items for the end consumer. Exceptions like the J List exempt certain items from labeling requirements. The USDA ensures the safety and proper labeling of meat and poultry products, including imports, under the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry Products Inspection Act. Country of origin must be displayed in English on immediate containers of all meat and poultry products entering the United States. Plants in countries certified by USDA with equivalent inspection systems can export products to the United States. Imported meat products must carry country-of-origin labeling. Bulk products entering the US are considered domestic once processed in FSIS-inspected establishments. Country-of-origin labeling is no longer required in such cases. The FSIS does not require country-of-origin labeling for meat and poultry products that have undergone minimal processing. There may be conflicts between USDA and Customs requirements for labeling on imported products. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act does not explicitly mandate COOL for foods other than meat and poultry. After the implementation of COOL in March 2009, Canada and Mexico raised concerns about the trade legality of mandatory COOL, stating that it disrupted normal livestock trade patterns and caused financial losses to their industries. They were worried about the increased cost of handling and processing imported animals due to labeling requirements and the need to segregate imported and domestic animals for proper labeling. The increased cost of handling and processing imported animals could lead to reduced live animal imports or lower prices for imported animals in the integrated cattle and hog industries of Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Trade agreements like NAFTA and the WTO have facilitated the movement of animals and animal products across borders, but incidents like the discovery of mad cow disease in 2003 have disrupted market integration. The discovery of mad cow disease in 2003 disrupted the integrated cattle and hog industries of Canada, Mexico, and the United States. The predominance of BSE cases in Canada led to wider support for the mandatory COOL law in the United States. Both countries now have strong safeguards in place to control BSE and prevent its transmission to the human food supply. Live cattle and hog imports from Canada and Mexico to the United States have increased due to proximity, feed supplies, and established feeding operations. Factors like animal and feed prices, inventory levels, currency exchange rates, and weather conditions influence the fluctuation of imports. In 2014, the United States exported $76 million worth of cattle and hogs to Canada and Mexico, accounting for 47% of total exports. The U.S. primarily exports breeding stock to over 70 foreign markets. Russia, Turkey, and China were leading markets for breeding cattle and hogs, but shipments declined in 2014, increasing exports to Canada and Mexico. The U.S. imported over $2.9 billion worth of cattle and hogs from Canada and Mexico in 2014. In 2014, the United States imported more than $2.9 billion worth of cattle and hogs from Canada and Mexico, setting a record value for cattle and hog imports. The majority of U.S. live cattle imports come from Canada and Mexico, while almost all live hog imports come from Canada. U.S. cattle imports saw a significant drop in 2004 following the discovery of BSE in Canada, leading to a ban on Canadian cattle imports. However, imports steadily increased after the border reopened in 2005, reaching near pre-BSE levels by 2007. Cattle imports dropped in 2008 and 2009, with import growth slowing down in the second half of 2008. In the second half of 2008, cattle imports in the United States fell by 8% compared to 2007. Imports from Canada increased in 2008, with strong imports of Canadian feeder cattle in the first half of the year. However, imports from Mexico decreased by 35% in 2008, the lowest since 1998. In 2009, U.S. cattle imports continued to decline by 12%, with a decrease in imports from Canada but an increase in imports from Mexico. In 2008, U.S. cattle imports fell by 8%, with imports from Canada increasing and imports from Mexico decreasing by 35%. In 2009, imports continued to decline by 12%, with a decrease in Canadian imports and an increase in Mexican imports due to drought conditions. Some attribute the import decline to COOL regulations, while others point to currency exchange rates as a factor. The COOL law has effectively reduced cattle trade in North America, leading to a 40% decrease in imports from Mexico and Canada despite favorable currency exchange rates. The USDA's ERS suggests that Canada's reduced slaughter cattle supplies were due to earlier strong shipments of feeder cattle. U.S. cattle imports have ranged from 2.1 million to 2.4 million head since 2009, with a 16% increase in 2014. In 2014, U.S. cattle imports increased to nearly 2.4 million head, the highest level since 2007. Imports from Canada rose by 19% and from Mexico by 13%. The record high U.S. cattle prices incentivized bringing Canadian and Mexican cattle into the country. Most Canadian cattle imports are for immediate slaughter, with feeder cattle destined for U.S. feedlots. Slaughter cattle imports from Canada increased by 7% in 2014. In 2014, U.S. cattle imports increased to nearly 2.4 million head, the highest level since 2007. Increases in slaughter cattle imports have been supported by larger shipments of cows coming into the United States for immediate slaughter. Feeder cattle imports increased 38% to 493,000 head, with the share of feeder cattle imports steadily rising over the last several years. Record high U.S. feeder cattle prices supported the southern movement of Canadian feeders. Almost 100% of Mexican cattle shipped to the United States are stocker or feeder cattle usually raised in northern Mexico. Persistent drought from 2009-2012 led to an increasing number of cattle imports from Mexico. Persistent drought from 2009-2012 led to an increasing number of cattle imports from Mexico, reaching nearly 1.5 million head in 2012. Reduced cattle inventory and improved pasture conditions in Mexico in 2013 resulted in a decline of 33% in feeder cattle shipments to the United States. In 2014, imports from Mexico increased 13% as the record high feeder cattle prices encouraged Mexico's cattle producers to send more animals to the United States. U.S. hog imports from Canada started to rise sharply in the mid-1990s, reaching a record 10 million head in 2007. The composition of U.S. hog imports shifted from hogs for immediate slaughter to feeder pigs. The hog industry in Canada shifted towards vertical integration in the mid-1980s, leading to increased demand for feeder pigs for finishing operations. Canadian producers focused on providing feeder pigs for shipment to the US, where access to cheaper grain made it more economical to feed pigs to slaughter weight. The feeder pig share of hog imports from Canada peaked at 85% in 2012 and was 83% in 2014. US hog imports from Canada dropped sharply in 2008 and 2009, with a decline in both feeder pigs and hogs for immediate slaughter. The implementation of COOL in the US affected the swine industry, making finishers reluctant to import Canadian animals due to packers' unwillingness to process them. This led to empty barns for some Iowa producers who sourced feeder pigs from Canada. Lenders were hesitant to extend credit to operations finishing mixed-origin pigs, resulting in lower prices for these hogs compared to those of exclusively US origin. Despite a sharp decline in 2009, US hog imports remained stable at around 5.7-5.8 million head. In 2013, U.S. hog imports declined by 12% to about 5 million head and remained at that level in 2014. Canadian hog inventories have decreased, leading to tighter hog supplies for export to the United States. Record high hog prices in 2014 encouraged feeder pig imports. The key WTO findings on U.S. COOL regulations violating WTO obligations focused on Article 2.1 and Article 2.2 of the TBT agreement. The WTO findings on U.S. COOL regulations violating WTO obligations focused on Article 2.1 of the TBT, stating that COOL treats imported livestock less favorably than domestic livestock. The dispute settlement panel and the Appellate Body upheld this finding. The panel found that COOL regulations create a competitive advantage for domestic livestock over imported livestock, violating WTO obligations by treating them less favorably. The panel concluded that COOL regulations give a competitive edge to domestic livestock over imported livestock by requiring processors to segregate them, reducing opportunities for imported livestock. This violates WTO obligations by treating imported livestock less favorably. The panel found that COOL regulations favored domestic livestock by requiring segregation, violating WTO obligations by treating imported livestock less favorably. Compliance with COOL is least costly by using exclusively domestic livestock. The panel observed that major U.S. slaughterhouses are offering a COOL discount for imported livestock, creating an incentive to process domestic livestock. U.S. meat processors plan to use U.S. origin labels for most of their products, with a large share of meat already carrying the U.S. label at retail level. This creates a disincentive for handling imported livestock. The panel's report on COOL highlighted that U.S. plants are imposing higher segregation costs on imported livestock, leading to fewer processing plants accepting cattle and hog imports. Some suppliers are facing logistical challenges and increased costs due to longer transportation distances and timing delivery issues. The panel considered data and economic studies from Canada, Mexico, and the United States to assess COOL's actual trade effects. The panel reviewed economic studies on COOL's livestock segregation costs, noting that these costs will impact the marketing system and could lead to a decrease in imported livestock volume and price. The panel also assessed econometric analyses on COOL's impacts on prices and market shares. The panel reviewed economic studies on COOL's impacts on prices and market shares of imported livestock from Canada and the United States. The Canadian study suggested that COOL reduced competitive opportunities for Canadian livestock in the U.S. market, while the U.S. study attributed the negative impacts to the economic recession. The panel considered Canada's study to be robust, showing that COOL had a significant negative impact on Canadian import shares and prices, while the U.S. study did not adequately demonstrate that the recession, rather than COOL, caused the negative effects in the cattle sector. The United States appealed the DS panel's finding that COOL treats imported livestock less favorably than domestic livestock. The U.S. argued that market forces, not COOL itself, increased the cost of selling Canadian and Mexican livestock in the U.S. The Appellate Body found that COOL cannot be faulted for being discriminatory, but lacks even-handedness due to disproportionate burdens on upstream producers compared to benefits for consumers. The Appellate Body found that COOL's labeling requirements discriminate against imported livestock, as they are not applied in an even-handed manner. Compliance panel also found that the revised measures do not address this issue. The compliance panel determined that the revised COOL rule violated TBT regulations by treating imported livestock less favorably due to increased segregation and recordkeeping requirements, which disincentivize the use of imported livestock. This was not solely justified by the need to inform consumers about the origin of the livestock. The compliance panel found that the amended COOL measure violated TBT regulations by treating imported Canadian livestock less favorably than domestic livestock, increasing the burden on imported livestock with recordkeeping and verification requirements. The Appellate Body upheld these findings, stating that the detrimental impact on imported livestock did not stem solely from legitimate regulatory distinctions. The compliance panel found that COOL undermines legitimacy by exempting a large amount of beef and pork, disadvantaging imported livestock. Between 57.7% and 66.7% of beef and 83.5% and 84.1% of pork do not provide origin information. COOL does not meet the objective of informing consumers about meat origin. Canada and Mexico allege COOL violates TBT regulations by being more trade-restrictive than necessary. The panel accepted the U.S. position that COOL's objective is to inform consumers of the country of origin of meat products, which is considered a legitimate policy objective under TBT's Article 2.2. However, it concluded that COOL's implementation is more trade restrictive than necessary as it does not effectively inform consumers about the origins of meat products. The DS panel agreed with Canada and Mexico that COOL does not effectively inform consumers about the countries of origin of meat products. The labels identifying multiple countries of origin could confuse or mislead consumers, as they may not easily distinguish between different origins listed on Category B and Category C labels. This lack of clarity could mislead consumers and fail to achieve the objective of informing them about the origins of meat products. The United States appealed the DS panel's finding that COOL does not effectively inform consumers about the origin of meat products. It challenged the panel's two-step approach in determining COOL's consistency with TBT's Article 2.2, arguing that the focus should have been on whether COOL is more trade-restrictive than necessary. The Appellate Body found that the DS panel erred in interpreting and applying Article 2.2 regarding COOL. It disagreed with the panel's narrow view on COOL's effectiveness and reversed the finding that COOL is inconsistent with Article 2.2. The AB reversed the panel's finding that COOL is inconsistent with Article 2.2, but could not determine if COOL is more trade-restrictive than necessary. The compliance panel agreed that COOL is a legitimate objective for providing origin information to consumers, but found that the revised COOL rule still exempted large portions of beef and pork from labeling. The panel also noted that the revised rule increased trade restrictiveness compared to the original rule, but could not determine if it was more trade restrictive than necessary. The panel examined alternative labeling schemes provided by Canada and Mexico to show that the revised COOL rule was more trade restrictive than necessary. However, shortcomings were found in each alternative, and it was concluded that Canada and Mexico did not make a prima facie case that COOL violated Article 2.2 of the TBT. The Appellate Body overturned the panel's conclusion but also found insufficient undisputed facts to complete the legal analysis on COOL's compliance with Article 2.2. The DS panel determined that ground meat labels comply with Article 2.1 of the TBT due to the 60-day \"inventory allowance\" providing flexibility for listing countries of origin. This flexibility applies to all stages of meat supply and distribution, not just meat processors. The panel found that the flexibility of the ground meat labeling rule limits additional costs for compliance and does not favor domestic livestock over imported livestock. Canada and Mexico did not appeal the panel's decision. The Vilsack letter was deemed to be unreasonable administration of COOL, violating GATT 1994. The panel found the Vilsack letter to be an unreasonable act of administering COOL, lacking transparency and procedural fairness in trade regulations. The United States did not appeal this finding, while Canada appealed for certain rulings. Canada did not appeal the finding on the Vilsack letter. The United States asserted that the measure had been withdrawn. The WTO set a deadline for the US to comply with the findings on COOL regulations favoring domestic over imported livestock. Stakeholders have differing views on how the US should comply with the WTO findings. The United States must amend the COOL legislation to comply with WTO findings. Industry groups like NCBA, NPPC, AMI, and FMI oppose mandatory COOL and advocate for changes to avoid retaliation from Canada and Mexico. The meat industry argues for changes to COOL legislation to prevent harm to U.S. markets. They suggest using a \"Product of North America\" label for imported meat processed in the U.S. to eliminate extra costs and discriminatory pricing. Some propose labeling all meat processed in the U.S. as \"Product of the United States,\" requiring a legislative change. Canadian stakeholders have concerns about these proposed changes. Canadian stakeholders, including the Canadian Pork Council (CPC) and the Canadian Cattlemen Association (CCA), argue that legislative action is needed to comply with WTO rulings on COOL legislation. They believe that changes are necessary to eliminate discrimination against live animals born outside the U.S. and require all meat processed from imported livestock in a U.S. meatpacking plant to be labeled accordingly. The WTO arbitration process over the compliance timeline for COOL legislation involved Canada and Mexico arguing for quicker compliance through a legislative change, suggesting the ongoing 2012 farm bill debate as a potential vehicle for addressing the issue. The House-passed farm bill included a placeholder provision for COOL, indicating a possible legislative approach to comply with WTO obligations. The farm bill conferees addressed the outstanding issue of COOL, with no major changes made to the regulations. Some stakeholders suggested reworking the COOL regulations to comply with the WTO ruling, but this approach was not pursued. Supporters of COOL opposed changes that would allow for more flexibility in labeling, while others argued that the proposed changes were not sufficient. R-CALF supported a regulatory fix in a letter to Secretary Vilsack and U.S. Trade Representative Kirk. R-CALF proposed regulatory changes to simplify COOL recordkeeping requirements, suggesting that cattle without a foreign mark or seal at slaughter plants be considered U.S. cattle. This would reduce documentation for imported cattle. R-CALF also recommended removing the livestock exemption for hogs, requiring a country-of-origin mark. R-CALF proposed changes to simplify COOL regulations by requiring a country-of-origin mark on hogs and eliminating mixed labels. They also suggested revising ground beef labeling and expanding coverage to include minimally processed products. NFU and USCA analyzed options to bring COOL into WTO compliance by adding more information to labels. The proposal suggested changes to COOL regulations to comply with WTO obligations, including adding more information to labels about cattle origin and halting commingling of meat. It also proposed extending COOL to food service, requiring a change in law. Some Members of Congress support a regulatory fix to bring the US into WTO compliance. In response to concerns raised by the Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Trade Representative, 31 Senators requested a regulatory solution for COOL regulations to align with WTO rules. A lawsuit was filed by meat industry organizations, led by the American Meat Institute, challenging the revised COOL rule on constitutional, statutory, and administrative grounds. The USDA's final rule on Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) is being challenged in a lawsuit by meat industry organizations, claiming it is burdensome and discriminatory. The rule would require stricter segregation of livestock, particularly affecting U.S. meat processors near the border who use imported livestock. The National Farmers Union supports COOL and sees the lawsuit as a tactic to delay its implementation. R-CALF has started a petition to stop one of the plaintiffs from receiving mandated beef checkoff. R-CALF petitioned to stop NCBA from receiving beef checkoff funds while suing USDA to halt the COOL program. Plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction against the final COOL rule, arguing irreparable harm if USDA continued implementation. Supporters of COOL, led by USCA, intervened in the lawsuit, with the district court hearing arguments for the injunction. On August 20, the district court heard arguments for a preliminary injunction, which was denied on September 11, 2013. The court found the plaintiffs unlikely to succeed on their claims and did not show irreparable harm. AMI appealed the decision, leading to a hearing on January 9, 2014. The court initially denied the injunction on COOL but later ordered a rehearing en banc in May to reexamine the constitutional issue. The Court of Appeals ruled 8-3 against the meat industry plaintiffs, denying a preliminary injunction to block USDA from implementing COOL. The court found that COOL requirements did not violate free speech rights. AMI petitioned for a rehearing on the case, arguing that COOL's segregation requirements amounted to USDA dictating livestock industry operations. The court denied the plaintiffs' petition for a rehearing on free speech claims and other non-free speech claims. In June 2013, Canada released a list of products that could be targeted for retaliation if the United States fails to comply with WTO obligations regarding COOL. Mexico has indicated that its retaliation list for COOL would be similar to products targeted during the trucking dispute with the United States from 2009 to 2011."
