Discussions also included strategic approaches and defense posture towards Russia. The summit was the last led by NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, with a formal agenda centered on enhancing allied readiness and military capabilities. The 2014 NATO summit in Newport, Wales focused on strengthening collective defense and military capabilities in Central and Eastern Europe, concluding NATO's mission in Afghanistan, and enhancing support for partner countries. Discussions also addressed security implications of instability in the Middle East and North Africa, particularly the emergence of ISIL. NATO condemned ISIL but did not commit to a substantive response beyond considering future requests for assistance from the Iraqi government. Since the end of the Cold War, NATO has shifted its focus from territorial defense in Europe to global military and crisis management operations. There is ongoing disagreement within the alliance about the extent of the threat posed by Russia, leading to tensions over NATO's strategic direction. Some allies are concerned that this shift may compromise NATO's commitment to collective defense. NATO is open to future requests from the Iraqi government for assistance in training Iraqi security forces. NATO allies are divided on the focus of the alliance, with some calling for a renewed emphasis on collective defense and deterring Russia, while others caution against permanently basing NATO forces in Eastern Europe to avoid provoking Russia. Debates are ongoing amidst economic stagnation in Europe and concerns about defense spending and burden sharing within the alliance. NATO officials urge allies to increase defense spending and cooperation in response to Russian aggression, but only a few have announced spending increases since the annexation of Crimea. Despite commitments to halt defense spending cuts and reach 2% of GDP on defense, analysts warn of challenges in boosting military capabilities due to lack of public support and divergent threat perceptions. At the Wales summit, NATO allies reaffirmed commitment to the \"open door\" policy and discussed potential enlargement with Montenegro. However, there was no decision on granting Georgia a Membership Action Plan, as some European governments oppose rapid NATO enlargement. Obama Administration officials outlined key objectives for the summit, including securing additional European contributions to reassurance and military support. At the Wales summit, NATO allies focused on increasing defense spending, enhancing military capabilities, and reassuring allies in Central and Eastern Europe in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine. President Obama highlighted the proposed $925 million European Reassurance Initiative and NATO's agenda included collective defense initiatives, transitioning in Afghanistan, and supporting partner countries outside the alliance. NATO's \"Readiness Action Plan\" adopted in Wales includes reinforcement measures in Central and Eastern Europe, such as enhanced infrastructure and pre-positioning of equipment. Plans for expanding bases in Poland, the Baltic States, and Romania to accommodate rapid deployment of NATO forces are in place, although some allies are hesitant to permanently station troops in the region. The focus is on rotating troop units and military exercises to demonstrate allied resolve against potential threats from Russia. NATO's Readiness Action Plan includes new early warning procedures, updated threat assessments, defense and crisis response plans, and enhanced intelligence sharing arrangements among allies. The establishment of a Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) with 4,000 soldiers capable of deploying within days to respond to threats on NATO's periphery is also part of the plan. The VJTF will be a specialized arm of the NATO Response Force (NRF), a rapid reaction force of about 13,000 soldiers. The NATO Response Force (NRF) was created in 2003 and has never been fully deployed. Recently, NATO members have focused on revitalizing the NRF for training and interoperability exercises, especially for territorial defense. However, concerns have been raised about the NRF and the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) being ill-equipped to handle hybrid warfare tactics like those seen in Russia's intervention in Ukraine, which involve non-traditional tools such as cyber attacks and irregular forces. Many NATO members lack the necessary capabilities to counter such threats. In Wales, allies acknowledged the threat of hybrid warfare and emphasized the need for NATO to enhance strategic communications, exercise scenarios, and coordination with other organizations. Initial steps were taken in cyber security, with NATO declaring it as part of their core task of collective defense. The decision to invoke Article 5 in response to a cyber attack would be made on a case-by-case basis. Some analysts see the declaration that a cyber attack could be considered on the same level as a traditional military attack as crucial for NATO's cyber defense capabilities. NATO leaders aimed to secure pledges to increase defense spending, with only a few allies meeting the 2% GDP goal. Since 2001, the U.S. share of total allied defense spending has increased from 63% to 72%. NATO officials urge European allies to increase defense spending in response to the threat posed by Russia in Ukraine. Some allies have pledged to meet the 2% GDP target within a few years. Despite Russia's defense spending increase, allied spending has decreased by about 20% on average since 2008. In Wales, allied leaders committed to halting any decline in defense expenditure and moving towards the 2% guideline within a decade. They also aim to allocate 20% of defense expenditures to purchasing new equipment and research and development. In response to the threat posed by Russia, NATO allies committed to increasing defense spending and allocating 20% of expenditures to new equipment and research. However, these pledges were seen as insufficient by some, with concerns about inefficient spending in European countries. Only four allies met the defense spending targets in 2013. Only four NATO allies (France, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States) met the 20% defense expenditure guideline for major equipment purchases, indicating military modernization pace. Key military capabilities like air- and sealift, air-to-air refueling, and ISR face significant shortfalls. Despite criticism, key European allies like the UK and France rank among the world's most capable militaries. However, defense spending cuts in these countries raise concerns about diminished European military capability. Despite condemnation of Russian actions in Ukraine and support for NATO's Readiness Action Plan, European allies are unlikely to increase defense spending due to fiscal challenges and public skepticism of military action. NATO and U.S. leaders are calling for more progress on defense cooperation initiatives to stretch existing resources. Analysts suggest that a more cooperative consolidation of the European defense industry is needed for improved defense efforts. European defense efforts would benefit from a more cooperative consolidation of defense-industrial production and procurement. Progress on joint capabilities development has been limited, with allies announcing initiatives at a summit, including a program to boost air-to-ground precision guided munitions availability and sharing. Additionally, allies are working on joint capabilities development under a new \"Framework Nations Concept\" to encourage cooperation on shared priorities. The Wales summit marked the end of NATO's 11-year mission in Afghanistan, with European allies, Canada, and partner countries maintaining a significant military presence alongside U.S. forces. Initiatives announced included a UK-led expeditionary force, an Italy-led group focused on stabilization, and a Germany-led group developing capabilities in logistics, protection, firepower, and headquarters. Public opposition to the mission was consistent in many NATO member states. At the Wales summit, NATO ended its 11-year mission in Afghanistan with mixed perceptions about its success. Plans for a continued NATO presence in Afghanistan in 2015 with up to 4,000 military trainers were discussed, contingent on finalizing Bilateral Security Agreements with the Afghan government. NATO may need to plan for a complete withdrawal soon. NATO may need to plan for a complete withdrawal from Afghanistan if bilateral agreements are not in place. Currently, there are 41,124 NATO forces in Afghanistan, including troops from the US, UK, Germany, and Italy. The summit also aimed to strengthen relations with non-NATO members for security assistance and training in regions like Central and Eastern Europe and North Africa. NATO seeks to enhance global stability with lighter footprint through capacity building programs. At the NATO summit, Secretary General Rasmussen emphasized the Defense Capacity Building Initiative to support defense reform and military training in partner and non-partner countries. The program will assist Georgia, Jordan, and Moldova initially, drawing on NATO's past experience in defense sector reform. The allies also highlighted progress in relations with Ukraine and Georgia. At the NATO summit, allies emphasized advances in relations with Ukraine and Georgia. NATO reiterated commitment to assist Ukraine through trust funds for improving capabilities, logistics, cyber defense, and communications. They also agreed to increase military advisors in Kiev. For Georgia, capacity building and military training programs will be boosted, but no specific timetable for membership advancement was announced. Some Western European states have concerns about Georgian membership. Recent developments in NATO's relations with Libya and Ukraine highlight challenges facing the Defense Capacity Building Initiative. In Libya, NATO was unable to provide military training assistance due to the unstable security environment. In Ukraine, NATO has sent military trainers for defense planning and reform efforts but struggles to agree on more substantive assistance due to differing views on the extent of NATO's relations with Ukraine. Political and security considerations play a crucial role in these decisions. NATO's relations with Ukraine are crucial for the success of defense capacity building efforts. The U.S. Administration aimed to secure increased allied commitments to collective defense in Europe at the summit. The new Readiness Action Plan demonstrates NATO's renewed commitment, but allied pledges to increase defense spending fell short of expectations. European allies may struggle to maintain commitments to the plan without boosting defense spending. Another priority was to reassure European allies, especially in Central and Eastern Europe, of the United States' readiness to honor its collective defense obligations. At the NATO summit, President Obama sought commitments from allies to fight ISIL, with nine countries agreeing to coordinate efforts but ruling out ground troops. Allies also discussed potential NATO assistance for Iraqi security forces amid concerns over Russia's aggression in Ukraine. The crisis in Ukraine has raised questions about the U.S. commitment to European security and its military presence in Europe. Some allies in Central and Eastern Europe are concerned about the reduced U.S. force posture, while others support the shift. Currently, around 67,000 U.S. military personnel are stationed in Europe, down from a Cold War high of about 400,000. The adjusted U.S. force posture in Europe includes rotational military deployments to Central and Eastern Europe, additional troops and fighter jets for air policing activities in Poland and the Baltic states, and seeking congressional approval for $925 million for a European Reassurance Initiative to bolster security and defense capabilities in the region. The European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) aims to reassure allies in Central and Eastern Europe and enhance security and defense capabilities in the region. The U.S. plans to conduct a review of its military presence in Europe, with the ERI potentially extending measures taken in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea. While welcomed in the region, the ERI falls short of permanent basing of U.S. and NATO forces, with some European leaders calling for additional contributions from NATO members. European leaders are discussing contributions to the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) from other NATO members to enable a sustained response and demonstrate allied unity. Some European governments caution against further militarization in the region. Members of Congress express deep concern over Russian aggression in Ukraine and call for a robust NATO and U.S. military response, as well as stronger European contributions to collective defense measures. Congressional deliberations could lead to a review of U.S. force posture in Europe and highlight concerns about European contributions to NATO security. Congress could play a more active role in shaping U.S. policy towards NATO, including discussions on allied military capabilities, burden-sharing, enlargement, relations with partner countries like Ukraine and Georgia, cybersecurity, and energy security. Members of Congress are particularly interested in further NATO enlargement to the east to signal commitment to aspiring members and deter Russian opposition. In February 2014, a bipartisan group of 40 Members of the House urged support for granting NATO membership to Montenegro and Macedonia, a Membership Action Plan (MAP) to Georgia, and advancing Bosnia-Herzegovina's MAP. Despite calls for NATO expansion, analysts believe significant progress is unlikely in the near future due to Western perceptions. NATO's expansion plans face challenges due to Western European concerns about the pace of enlargement and managing relations with Russia. Ongoing territorial disputes with Russia in countries like Georgia and Ukraine could deter new membership invitations. Despite reaffirming commitment to NATO's \"open door\" policy, decisions on new members, such as Montenegro, are being carefully considered. The Wales summit, initially focused on setting new priorities, was overshadowed by Russia's annexation of Crimea in March. NATO leaders are reevaluating priorities post-Afghanistan war, shifting focus to territorial defense in Europe and deterring Russia's aggression. Despite condemning Russia's intervention in Ukraine, there is a debate among allies on the level of threat posed by Russia. The Wales summit saw the announcement of collective defense measures but no consensus was reached. NATO leaders are reevaluating priorities post-Afghanistan war, focusing on territorial defense in Europe and deterring Russian aggression. The summit highlighted tensions within NATO on managing relations with Russia and responding to instability in the Middle East and North Africa. Lack of consensus on military capabilities, defense planning, and addressing security threats could impact NATO's future. Congressional focus on NATO's future may include questions on evolving perceptions of the Russian threat and U.S. force posture in Europe. NATO's future is being reevaluated post-Afghanistan war, with key questions on adopting a new strategic concept, addressing security threats in the Euro-Atlantic region, meeting defense spending targets, U.S. force posture in Europe, and NATO's enlargement policy."
