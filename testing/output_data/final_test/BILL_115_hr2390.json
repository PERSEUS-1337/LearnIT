    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"PLO Accountability Act of 2017\". The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Mission office in Washington, DC was opened in 1994 to implement the Oslo Accords. The Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987 prohibits the establishment of PLO-related offices in the US. The executive branch has waived provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987. The Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement prohibits changes to the status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The PLO sent a declaration to the International Criminal Court in 2009. UNESCO admitted Palestine as a member in 2011. The United Nations General Assembly granted the \"State of Palestine\" nonmember observer status in 2012. The PLO joined the Geneva Conventions and other organizations in 2014. In 2015, the PLO acceded to the Rome Statute, leading to a preliminary examination by the International Criminal Court. The PLO's decision to join the International Criminal Court in 2015 aimed to change the status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip outside of direct negotiations with Israel. Despite opposition from the US, the \"State of Palestine\" officially became a member of the ICC on April 1, 2015. The PLO and PA are accused of continuing incitement. The PLO and PA engage in incitement, glorify terrorism, and reward terrorists with $300 million annually. Deputy Secretary of State Blinken submitted a report to Congress on August 30, 2016, regarding these actions. Deputy Secretary of State Blinken determined that the PLO and PA are not in compliance with commitments, leading to a downgrade in status of the PLO office in Washington, DC. Acting Secretary of State Thomas Shannon submitted a similar report to Congress in January 2017. In reports to Congress, it was determined that the PLO and PA are not in compliance with their commitments, resulting in a downgrade of the PLO office in Washington, DC. Sanctions were waived in both August 2016 and January 2017. The President can impose sanctions on the PLO and PA officials for not complying with their commitments, including visa denials, office status downgrade, terrorist organization designation, and prohibition of US assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The sense of Congress is that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) has not upheld its commitments to peace with Israel, renounced violence, accepted Israel's right to exist, honored previous agreements, and continues to pursue unilateral statehood and endorse terror. The Palestinian involvement in the International Criminal Court against Israeli nationals is seen as a deliberate diplomatic and legal effort. The sense of Congress is that the PLO's actions against Israel violate commitments, and the conflict should be resolved through direct negotiations. The Palestinians should not seek outside influence, and the US should close the PLO office in Washington, DC, using sanctions to hold them accountable. SEC. 4. PROHIBITIONS REGARDING THE PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION UNDER THE ANTI-TERRORISM ACT OF 1987. Section 1003 of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987 is amended to make it unlawful for Palestinians to obtain certain standing in the United Nations without an agreement negotiated between Israel and the Palestinians. The President may waive this provision for up to 6 months with certification to Congress. The Palestinians have officially withdrawn from the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the Rome Statute. Any investigations against Israel initiated by the Palestinians have been terminated. The PLO and Palestinian Authority no longer provide financial support to terrorists or their families. The PLO and Palestinian Authority have stopped incitement and support for terrorism. Palestinians must reach a peace agreement with Israel to end hostilities. The term 'incitement' is defined as advocating violence or terrorism."
