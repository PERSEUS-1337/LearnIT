    "content": "When amending the Clean Air Act in 1977, Congress added provisions to protect the quality of clean air areas, especially national parks and other important sites. The Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program focuses on preventing air quality deterioration in pristine areas by regulating pollution levels. Class I areas, including national parks and wilderness areas, are subject to PSD regulations for emissions of sulfur dioxide, particulates, and nitrogen oxides from new and modified sources. Congress also set a national goal to prevent and remedy impairment in these areas. The Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program and Section 169A work together to prevent and remedy impairment to visibility in mandatory class I Federal areas. PSD controls new sources of impairment, requiring preconstruction review and installation of \"best available control technology\" (BACT). Section 169A focuses on reducing emissions from existing sources, requiring installation of \"best available retrofit technology\" (BART) for certain major stationary sources of pollution. The EPA has provisions to protect visibility in class I areas, including requirements for existing sources like electric generating units. Visibility impairment can manifest as plume blight or regional haze. Regulations must be promulgated within 24 months to ensure State Implementation Plans make reasonable progress towards meeting national goals and comply with specific provisions like Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART). The EPA has regulations to protect visibility in class I areas, including requirements for existing sources like electric generating units. States with mandatory class I areas were required to revise their SIPs to ensure progress towards the national visibility goal, including implementing Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for existing sources. The regulations also involve assessing impacts from new sources and recommending remedial actions through the New Source Review (NSR) process and the PSD program. The EPA regulations aim to protect visibility in class I areas by requiring states to revise their SIPs to include measures like Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) for existing sources. This includes assessing impacts from new sources and recommending actions through the NSR process and the PSD program. In the past, there were delays in implementing regulations for plume blight, leading to lawsuits and phased-in compliance schedules until 1989. The implementation of plume blight regulations extended through 1989, with the only BART installation occurring at the Navajo Generating Station in Arizona in 1991. Congress revisited the issue in the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act, introducing new measures to control acid rain and regional haze. Section 169B was established as a triggering mechanism for EPA to address regional haze, requiring the establishment of the Grand Canyon Visibility Transport Commission and other similar commissions. The Grand Canyon Visibility Transport Commission was established in 1991 to address visibility impairment from emissions growth in the region. The commission issued recommendations in June 1996 for improving visibility in Grand Canyon National Park. The Grand Canyon Visibility Transport Commission, along with leaders of five Indian tribes, approved recommendations for improving western vistas. Nine primary recommendations included energy conservation, renewable energy use, and emission reductions from stationary sources. The Baseline Forecast projected a 13% reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions by 2000, with potential for 20%-30% reduction. Regional targets for sulfur dioxide emissions in 2000 were set due to uncertainty about current programs' effects. Ultimate targets aimed for a 50%-70% reduction by 2040, with possible interim targets for steady progress. The regional haze program, established under the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, aims to protect 156 PSD class I areas from visibility impairment caused by manmade air pollution. All 50 states are included in the program, with the possibility of regulatory measures such as a regional cap on emissions and market-based trading if targets are exceeded. The final regional haze rule was published on July 1, 1999. The final rule for the regional haze program includes special provisions for former member-states of the Grand Canyon Visibility Transport Commission to implement their recommendations. States must develop SIPs with goals for reasonable progress towards natural visibility conditions in class I areas by 2064. Baseline conditions for visibility must be determined for the most and least impaired days during 2000-2004. States must submit a long-term strategy to address regional haze for each class I area within the state or affected by emissions within the state, including compliance schedules, enforceable emission limitations, and monitoring strategies. Additionally, states must submit a Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) implementation plan for sources contributing to visibility impairment, with the option to use trading programs or alternatives for greater progress. Tracking progress through SIPs is also required. The SIP must include provisions for submitting revisions to EPA every 10 years, with progress reports due every five years. Section 309 offers an alternative program for former GCVTC members to reduce visibility impairment in class I areas in Colorado. The Western Regional Air Partnership (WRAP) focused on reducing SO2 emissions through voluntary milestones up to 2018. If milestones are not met, a mandatory emissions trading program would be activated. The 2018 milestone aimed for a 320,000-ton reduction from 1990 levels. EPA approved the plan in 2003, alongside efforts to implement a new National Ambient Air Quality Standard for PM 2.5. To implement the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS, a monitoring network had to be established and data collected before states could identify nonattainment areas. States were proposed to combine SIPs for PM 2.5 attainment and regional haze revisions to avoid revising SIPs twice. Congress codified this proposal in P.L. 105-178, extending deadlines for areas not designated nonattainment and linking the implementation schedules of regional haze and PM 2.5 rules. The regional haze and PM 2.5 rules extended actions for compliance. States have different deadlines based on their classification under the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS. Optional SIP schedules are available for states to coordinate regional haze implementation. Compliance schedules can also be adjusted based on recommendations from the GCVTC. Table 1 outlines a rough implementation schedule for the regional haze rule aligned with PM 2.5 compliance. The EPA's Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) addresses interstate transport of pollutants affecting nonattainment of NAAQS for PM 2.5 and ozone. SO2 and NOx from certain states contribute to downwind nonattainment. Regional haze, PM 2.5, and ozone programs deal with similar pollution sources, including electric generating units. CAIR aims to reduce emissions from electric generating units by implementing region-wide caps for NOx and SO2 in two phases. EPA estimates emissions under the caps by applying cost-effective pollution controls. Electric generating units are a major focus of CAIR, while the regional haze rule targets 26 different categories of sources for SO2 and NOx emissions control. The Clean Air Act requires major stationary sources emitting pollutants impacting visibility to use the best available technology for emission control. EPA guidelines for determining Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) were proposed in 2001. The interaction between CAIR and the regional haze rule focuses on whether BART for Electric Generating Units (EGUs) can be superseded by CAIR. EPA revised and re-proposed BART determination guidelines in 2004, focusing on individual source contributions for visibility improvement. BART is determined plant-by-plant by states, except for EGUs over 750 Mw where EPA makes the determination. The default 750 Mw EGU SO2 reduction requirement was proposed at 95% removal or emission. The EPA proposed setting a default 750 Mw EGU SO2 reduction requirement at 95% removal or emission limitations between 0.1 to 0.15 lb. SO2 per million Btu. For units between 250 Mw and 750 Mw, there is a rebuttable presumption that states should require the same limitations unless justified with persuasive evidence. On July 6, 2005, EPA finalized guidelines for determining BART, with BACT presumptive emissions limits for SO2 set at 95% removal or 0.15 lb. SO2/mmBtu for coal-fired EGUs over 200 Mw. NOx BACT presumptive limits are based on coal type and firing configuration. The 1999 regional haze rule set NOx limits for coal-fired EGUs based on coal type and firing configuration, ranging from 0.15 to 0.62 lb./mmBtu. It allowed for an emissions trading program as an alternative to BART if it demonstrated greater reasonable progress. The state had to show that the trading program would achieve better results than BART installation and operation. The 2001 BART guidelines require a demonstration of emission reductions through a trading program for BART-eligible sources by 2018. States must determine emission budgets for the trading program to ensure better visibility. Dispersion modeling is necessary to meet the reasonable progress requirement. The dispersion modeling of BART and the trading program is required to ensure better visibility. The analysis should show the difference in visibility conditions under both approaches for each class I area and the average difference in visibility over all affected areas. The trading program guidelines were re-proposed in 2004 but were not included in the final rule due to a court decision. EPA proposed new requirements for emissions on July 20, 2005. The EPA proposed new requirements for an emissions trading program on July 20, 2005, in response to objections raised by the court. The final rule was published on October 13, 2006, bringing the program into compliance with the American Corn Growers v. EPA decision. States can now use the same approach to develop a baseline estimate of BART in the alternative program as for source-by-source BART. This allows states to demonstrate greater emissions reductions than BART. Under the BART guidelines, CAIR assists states in meeting air quality standards by reducing interstate air pollution through a cost-effective emissions trading program. EPA determined that electric generating units were the most cost-effective source for emission reductions. The proposed CAIR model trading program allows for the substitution of BART with the trading program. EPA's final rule, published in 2006, brought the program into compliance with court decisions. The EPA proposed amending the regional haze rule to allow electric generating units to use the CAIR emission trading program to meet the BART requirement. This would exempt sources participating in the CAIR program from demonstrating greater progress through BART installation. The EPA proposed allowing generating units in the CAIR trading program to meet the BART requirement, exempting them from demonstrating greater progress through BART installation. The final CAIR decision deferred substituting CAIR for BART until BART guidelines are finalized, with EPA stating that CAIR would achieve greater progress than BART. The EPA deferred a final determination on whether CAIR makes greater progress than BART until BART guidelines are finalized. EPA finalized that CAIR achieves greater progress than BART and can be used as a substitute. States have the discretion to determine BART requirements and are not required to accept EPA's determination. EPA had hinted at declaring CAIR better than BART for electric generating units in a previous proposal. EPA supports using trading programs like CAIR as a better alternative to BART for addressing regional haze. The Bush Administration justifies exempting BART-eligible units from installing BART based on a regional analysis of visibility improvement. The analysis concludes that CAIR emissions reductions in the East produce significantly greater visibility improvements than source-specific BART. EPA states that on a nationwide basis, the average visibility improvement under the CAIR cap-and-trade program was 0.5 dv, compared to 0.2 dv under the nationwide source-specific BART approach. This linking of CAIR to the regional haze rule is based on their common characteristic of controlling sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. EPA uses a proposed methodology to assist states in determining state emission budgets to justify excluding BART. The methodology designed to assist states in determining state emission budgets for excluding units from individual BART review has sparked controversy. Critics question EPA's analysis, arguing that the focus should be on visibility impacts on individual Class I Areas, not a nationwide average. Litigation is expected due to the final BART determination guidelines allowing for such analysis. The stringency of BART versus CAIR requirements is also a point of contention. EPA's BART guidelines mandate a 95% reduction in emissions on a per-unit basis. The EPA's BART guidelines require a 95% reduction in emissions on a per-unit basis, which is more stringent than the overall 67% reduction in SO2 emissions from a future 2015 baseline envisioned in CAIR. The scope of the two scenarios is different, with BART being required nationwide on power plants over 250 million Btu operating in 1977 but not more than 15 years old, while CAIR is a regional trading program focused on EGUs greater than 25Mw within the 23 state PM 2.5 region. EPA argues that CAIR is better than BART when grafted onto an individual BART program for other categories, but opponents disagree. Opponents argue that a 7-9 deciview improvement is necessary to achieve the Clean Air Act's visibility goal, requiring BART controls on EPA's proposed default levels and additional controls on EGUs like those under CAIR. The Clean Air Act has evolved over time in response to environmental understanding and technological advancements, resulting in a complex regulatory structure. The Clean Air Act has evolved to reduce air pollutants, with the EPA introducing the Clean Air Interstate Rule to target emissions of SO2, NOx, and Hg. The EPA aims to simplify regulations by integrating CAIR into visibility protection provisions of the CAA. The Clean Air Act has evolved to integrate the Clean Air Interstate Rule into visibility protection provisions, linking Section 169A and Section 109 implementation strategies. EPA is coordinating the SIP process for PM 2.5 NAAQS and regional haze rules, proposing that certain CAIR program provisions can substitute for visibility requirements. The EPA is facing debate and potential litigation over the integration of the CAIR program into visibility requirements under Section 109 and Section 169A of the Clean Air Act. Critics argue that this move is a regulatory \"bait and switch\" as the EPA aims to shift compliance strategies towards a market-oriented cap-and-trade program. This shift is seen as a cost-effective approach to pollution control compared to direct regulation like the BART program. The Bush Administration proposed the \"Clear Skies\" multi-pollutant program in 2002 to amend the Clean Air Act, setting emission caps on SO2, NOx, and Hg from electric utility units. The program would be implemented through a tradable allowance system with caps imposed in two phases: 2008 and 2018. This proposal is similar to the Clean Air Interstate Rule and mercury rule in terms of reduction requirements but contains significant conforming language. The Clear Skies multi-pollutant program proposed by the Bush Administration in 2002 includes emission caps on SO2, NOx, and Hg from electric utility units. Unlike EPA's integrated air action, Clear Skies has conforming language to avoid conflicts with other Clean Air Act provisions. EPA's combining of CAIR and BART aims to coordinate regulatory programs under a market-oriented approach, but a statutory solution may still be necessary."
