    "content": "After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, insurance coverage for terrorism losses changed as insurers and reinsurers became hesitant to offer it due to the uncertainty and potential massive losses involved. Many argued that terrorism risk is essentially uninsurable by the private market. The lack of insurance against terrorism loss was feared to have wider economic impacts, especially on large-scale developments in urban areas. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA) was passed by Congress in response to the economic impact of the 9/11 attacks on insurance markets. TRIA created a temporary Terrorism Risk Insurance Program to provide a government backstop for terrorism losses and allow the private industry to build capacity for covering terrorism risk. While terrorism insurance became widely available under TRIA, progress on creating robust terrorism models for insurers to offer coverage without a government backstop was limited. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005 (TRIEA) was passed in response to the limited progress on a private pooling mechanism for terrorism risk coverage. It extended the program for two years, increasing private sector exposure. Despite some progress on a larger private solution, there was little concrete movement towards adoption. The industry focused on the possibility of another TRIA extension. The industry is debating the extension of the TRIA program, with some arguing that the private market cannot cover terrorism risk effectively. The U.S. Treasury Department believes that TRIA is hindering the growth of the private market by providing free reinsurance. Three bills in Congress are addressing the TRIA program's expiration, with the House bills proposing significant revisions and expansions. The House bill, introduced by Representative Michael Capuano, aimed to extend and revise the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, adding new elements and extending the program for 10 years. It would lower the program trigger to $50 million while keeping insurer deductibles and aggregate retention unchanged. The House bill introduced by Representative Michael Capuano aimed to extend and revise the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program for 10 years. It proposed including domestic terrorism, group life insurance, and coverage for NCBR terrorist events. The bill also included reset provisions for areas affected by past or future terrorist attacks exceeding $1 billion in damage. The House bill aimed to extend the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program for 10 years, including coverage for domestic terrorism and NCBR events. H.R. 2761 was marked up by the House Financial Services Committee, with substantial amendments adopted, including delaying make available provisions until 2009 and lowering the deductible to 3.5%. The House bill aimed to extend the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program for 10 years, with amendments including changes to the independent commission and certification process. Amendments rejected included reducing the extension and requiring full recoupment of funds. Chairman Barney Frank made technical and substantive changes, including altering the reset provisions. The amendment to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program bill changed reset provisions, removed retrospective reset, and applied prospective reset provisions nationwide. It also included temporary preemptions from state rate and form approval laws for NBCR coverage and established a \"terrorism buy down fund\" in the U.S. Treasury. Additional amendments were adopted, including an exemption for small insurers. The amended bill for the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program includes various changes such as exemptions for small insurers, the return of farmowners multiple peril as a covered line, and an extension of the program for 15 years. The Congressional Budget Office estimated an increase in direct spending by $3.7 billion from 2008 to 2012 and $10.4 billion from 2008 to 2017. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program bill led to increased spending of $3.7 billion from 2008 to 2012 and $10.4 billion from 2008 to 2017, offset by additional revenues. However, it failed to meet the \"pay-as-you-go\" rule, leading to a requirement for future congressional action. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program bill introduced uncertainty due to a requirement for future congressional action. H.R. 2761 was amended on the House floor, passing 426-1 with changes including the NBCR deductible, certification process, and indexing dollar amounts to CPI-U. Another amendment by Rep. Steve Pearce aimed to modify the deductible increase under the post-attack reset. The House passed H.R. 2761 with amendments, including extending the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program for 15 years, adding coverage for domestic terrorist acts, and involving the Secretary of Homeland Security in the certification process. The bill was then sent to the Senate for further consideration. The bill H.R. 2761 extended the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program for 15 years, added coverage for domestic terrorist acts, involved the Secretary of Homeland Security in the certification process, and made changes to the program including adjustments to deductibles, triggers, and coverage for nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological (NCBR) terrorist attacks. The bill H.R. 2761 extended the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program for 15 years, added coverage for domestic terrorist acts, involved the Secretary of Homeland Security in the certification process, and made changes to the program including adjustments to deductibles, triggers, and coverage for NCBR terrorist attacks. The bill also increased post-reset insurer deductibles, established a \"Terrorism Buy-Down Fund\" for insurers to cover future losses, restricted life insurers' use of foreign travel as an underwriting tool, and indexed dollar amounts to future inflation. The Administration expressed concerns over the extension length, federal role increase, and expansion of the program. The Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee marked up legislation for the extension of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, with no amendments voted on. The bill, numbered S. 2285, aimed to reauthorize the program for seven years, until 2014, and add coverage for domestic terrorist attacks. Additionally, slight modifications were proposed to the annual liability cap, and the Secretary of the Treasury would be required to promulgate regulations. The bill, S. 2285, aimed to extend the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program for seven years, with added coverage for domestic terrorist attacks. It proposed slight changes to the annual liability cap and required the Secretary of the Treasury to regulate payments exceeding $100 billion. The Government Accountability Office would report on insurance coverage for NCBR events and the availability of terrorism insurance in specific markets. The President's Working Group on Financial Markets would analyze the long-term availability and affordability of terrorism risk insurance, with reports due in 2010 and 2013. CBO estimated the bill would increase direct spending by $3.1 billion from 2008 to 2012 and $6.6 billion from 2008 to 2017, offset by increased government receipts. The amended version of S. 2285 increased the recoupment surcharge to 133% of the previous mandatory amount and set repayment deadlines for attacks before and after 2011. The new language also removed the 3% limit on mandatory recoupment amounts. CBO issued a cost estimate for the bill on November 15, 2007, finding increased direct spending offset by government receipts. The amended version of S. 2285, passed on November 15, 2007, would increase government receipts without affecting direct spending. The CBO estimated it would reduce budget deficits by less than $50 million over 5- and 10-year periods. The Senate amended H.R. 2761 with S.Amdt. 3800, incorporating language from S. 2285, and passed it by unanimous consent. No conference was requested to reconcile differences with the House version. The House Rules Committee passed two rules (H.Res. 849 and H.Res. 862) to govern further consideration of TRIA-extension legislation. H.Res. 849 allowed for the consideration of the Senate-passed version of H.R. 2761 with one amendment made in order, while H.Res. 862 allowed for the consideration of a new bill (H.R. 4299) introduced by Chairman Barney Frank. H.R. 4299 included the language of H.R. 2761 as passed by the Senate, along with the text of the amendment made in order by H.Res. 849. The House passed H.R. 4299 with changes to the Senate bill, including coverage of group life insurance, lower deductibles for insurers in terrorist attacks, restrictions on foreign travel as an underwriting tool, and a reduced program trigger to $50 million. The bill passed on a vote of 303-116 and was sent to the Senate. OMB released a Statement of Administration Policy on the new House language on December 7, 2007. The House passed H.R. 4299 with changes, including coverage of group life insurance, lower deductibles for insurers in terrorist attacks, restrictions on foreign travel, and a reduced program trigger to $50 million. The administration supported the Senate-passed bill but opposed House additions, leading to a veto recommendation. H.R. 4299 was referred to the Senate committee but no action was taken. Instead, H.R. 2761 was passed by the House and signed into law as P.L. 110-160, extending the TRIA program, covering domestic terrorist attacks, and modifying the annual liability cap. The Secretary of the Treasury must report and create regulations on determining payments if losses exceed $100 billion. The GAO will report on insurance coverage for NCBR events and terrorism insurance availability. The President's Working Group will analyze terrorism risk insurance availability and affordability. The recoupment surcharge is increased to 133% of the previous amount, with accelerated repayment criteria for attacks before 2011. The repayment criteria for attacks before 2011 require completion by September 30, 2012. For attacks during 2011, 35% of repayment must be done by September 30, 2012, and 65% by September 30, 2017. Attacks after 2011 must be repaid by September 30, 2017, with no 3% limit on recoupment amounts."
