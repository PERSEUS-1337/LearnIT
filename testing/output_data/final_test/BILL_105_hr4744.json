The \"Postresearch Chimpanzee Care Act\" mandates the establishment of a national sanctuary system for surplus chimpanzees previously used in federally funded research. The Secretary will oversee the system's operation in consultation with a nonprofit private entity's board of directors. The Act requires all surplus chimpanzees owned by the Federal Government to be accepted into the sanctuary system. Surplus chimpanzees not owned by the government can also be accepted if the owner transfers ownership to the Federal Government. The Secretary will establish standards for the sanctuary system based on recommendations from the National Research Council. The Act mandates that surplus chimpanzees owned by the Federal Government must be accepted into the sanctuary system. Standards for the sanctuary system include prohibiting research use of chimpanzees, specifying housing and behavioral well-being provisions, and ensuring care in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act. The sanctuary system for surplus chimpanzees owned by the Federal Government includes requirements such as preventing breeding, maintaining health histories, monitoring for public health threats, containing threats as per CDC recommendations, and prohibiting discharge from the system. The Secretary may accept chimpanzees not owned by the Federal Government into the sanctuary system, with additional standards as deemed appropriate.
