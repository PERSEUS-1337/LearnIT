    "content": "For awards related to personal physical injury or sickness, tax consequences are determined under section 104 of the Internal Revenue Code. Non-personal injury and personal non-physical injury claims are generally included in the recipient's income unless there is an exclusion. Damages received for personal physical injuries or sickness are excluded from gross income, including economic damages like lost wages. However, amounts attributed to already deducted medical expenses may not be excluded. The IRS does not define physical injury or sickness beyond emotional distress. Physical symptoms of emotional distress are not considered physical injury or sickness. Prior to 1996, the injury or sickness did not have to be physical for the award to be excluded under IRC \u00a7 104(a)(2). Courts looked at whether the injury or sickness was personal and if the claim was tort-like to determine exclusion. Inconsistent results arose, especially regarding discrimination claims. In the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, Congress amended the statute to add a physical requirement for excluding damages for discrimination claims from income. Emotional distress awards are generally included in income unless they stem from physical injury or sickness. Punitive damages for personal physical injury or sickness are included in gross income, with a limited exception for wrongful punitive damages. The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 added a physical requirement for excluding damages for discrimination claims from income. Emotional distress awards are usually taxable unless related to physical injury or sickness. Punitive damages for personal physical injury or sickness are taxable, with a limited exception for wrongful death punitive damages. Attorneys' fees and legal costs awarded as part of a settlement may be excluded from the recipient's income if the main award is excluded under IRC \u00a7 104(a)(2). Legal expenses incurred in a lawsuit for physical personal injury or sickness claims are not deductible. Payments received from a judgment or settlement in non-personal injury cases are included in the recipient's income unless designated as a return of capital or there is a statutory exclusion. The treatment of an award depends on the nature of the underlying claim, such as back pay in an employment suit being included in gross income. The award received in a lawsuit is included in gross income and must be characterized as ordinary income or capital gain based on the nature of the underlying claim. Punitive damages for non-personal or non-physical injury claims are taxable. In certain cases, the recipient may be allowed a deduction if the compensatory portion of the award is included in income. The recipient may be allowed a deduction under IRC \u00a7 186 if the compensatory portion of the award is included in income. The deductible amount is the lesser of the compensatory payment less the costs of securing it or the unrecovered net operating loss attributable to the injury. An award may include attorneys' fees and legal costs, which were previously required to be included in the recipient's income. In 2005, the Supreme Court ruled that recipients must include attorneys' fees in their income, even if some courts previously allowed exclusion based on various reasons. In situations involving anticipatory assignment of income, like contingency fee agreements, the assignor's control over the income-generating asset determines tax purposes. The injured party retains control over the cause of action throughout litigation, making them the recipient of the award for taxation purposes. Legal expenses for non-personal injury claims may be deductible, while business plaintiffs can generally deduct attorneys' fees and litigation costs. Plaintiffs can deduct attorneys' fees and litigation costs as business expenses under IRC \u00a7 162, unless the award is treated as capital gain. Non-business plaintiffs' deductibility of attorney fees depends on the type of claim. Certain individuals can deduct attorney fees and court costs as an above-the-line deduction for claims of unlawful discrimination, claims against the United States, and claims under the Social Security Act. The curr_chunk discusses various sections of different acts related to civil rights, labor standards, age discrimination, employee rights, and fair housing. Legal expenses related to civil rights, labor laws, and employment can be deducted as income-production expenses under IRC \u00a7 212, subject to limitations on miscellaneous itemized deductions. Taxpayers with adjusted gross income over $145,950 ($72,975 if married filing separately) face a limit on itemized deductions. Payments made for judgments or settlements can be deductible as business expenses under IRC \u00a7 162 or income-production expenses under IRC \u00a7 212, regardless of compensatory or punitive nature. Deductions are not allowed if expenses are reimbursed. Fines, penalties to government, and antitrust suit payments have special rules. IRC \u00a7 162 allows deductions for trade or business expenses, while IRC \u00a7 212 allows deductions for necessary expenses for non-business activities. A trade or business can deduct \"ordinary and necessary expenses\" related to income-producing activities. An expense is \"ordinary\" if it is not a capital expenditure, and \"necessary\" if it is appropriate for carrying on a trade or business. Payments made pursuant to a judgment or settlement are generally considered appropriate expenses. However, deductions may be limited due to restrictions on miscellaneous itemized deductions. IRC \u00a7 162(f) disallows deductions for fines or penalties. IRC \u00a7 162(f) disallows deductions for fines or penalties paid to the government for law violations, including civil and criminal penalties. This includes payments for settling potential liabilities. Compensatory damages and legal fees are not considered fines or penalties. In civil antitrust suits, damages awarded are not fully deductible under IRC \u00a7 162(g) if the taxpayer has been convicted or pled guilty in a related criminal proceeding. Legal expenses incurred in the suit may be deductible as a business expense under IRC \u00a7 162. Legal expenses incurred in a suit can be deducted as a business expense under IRC \u00a7 162 or an income-production expense under IRC \u00a7 212. However, expenses deducted under IRC \u00a7 212 may not be fully deductible due to limits on miscellaneous itemized deductions. H.R. 1985 and H.R. 2755 provide exclusions and guidelines for deducting damages, attorneys' fees, and costs in certain cases. The recipient's gross income includes awards for attorneys' fees and costs in non-physical personal injury cases. H.R. 3076 excludes medical malpractice damages awarded in binding arbitration from income. H.R. 4707 reverts the law to pre-SBJPA status. IRC \u00a7 104 exclusion applies to non-physical injury or sickness awards and punitive damages for physical injury or sickness. Various bills propose amending IRC \u00a7 162(f) to disallow deductions for fines and penalties to the government. The provision in S. 1565 and H.R. 3 disallows deductions for fines and penalties paid to governments or nongovernmental agencies, requiring reporting to the IRS and all parties involved. The Equity Act of 2005, H.R. 3, and other bills aim to allow deductions for compliance payments but prohibit deductions for punitive damages, with exceptions for wrongful death statutes. Insured parties would need to report punitive damages paid by insurance to the IRS. The Senate-passed versions of H.R. 4297 and H.R. 3 were part of the Tax Relief Act of 2005 and the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2005. H.R. 3 became law as P.L. 109-59 with the punitive damages provision removed during conference."
