    "content": "The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill includes funding for various agencies, such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Department of Energy, and Nuclear Regulatory Commission. President Trump's FY2020 budget proposal requests $38.02 billion, which is 15% lower than the FY2019 appropriation. A 12% increase is proposed for DOE nuclear weapons activities. The FY2019 Energy and Water Development appropriations bill provided $44.66 billion, 3% above FY2018 and 23% above the FY2019 request. The bill was signed into law on September 21, 2018. The FY2020 budget proposes substantial reductions for DOE energy research and development programs. The FY2020 budget proposes significant cuts for DOE energy research and development programs, including reductions in fossil fuels, nuclear energy, energy efficiency, and renewable energy R&D. Programs like energy efficiency grants, ARPA-E, and loan guarantee programs are targeted for elimination. Funding cuts are also proposed for USACE, Reclamation, and CUP. Congressional consideration of the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill is influenced by budget enforcement measures. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established limits on defense and nondefense discretionary spending, enforced through sequestration. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased limits for FY2018 and FY2019, but not for FY2020, resulting in lower limits for that year. The FY2020 limits for discretionary defense and nondefense spending are substantially lower than those for FY2019. The defense limit drops from $647 billion to $576 billion (-11%), while the nondefense limit drops from $597 billion to $542 billion (-9%). A bill to raise the limits for FY2020 and FY2021 was reported by the House Budget Committee on April 5, 2019. Several issues raised by the Administration's budget request could generate controversy during congressional consideration of Energy and Water Development appropriations for FY2020. The Trump Administration's FY2020 budget request for the Energy and Water Development bill includes significant reductions in funding for USACE and Reclamation. The request aims to limit funding for ongoing projects to those with benefits at least 2.5 times their costs and proposes transferring the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program from USACE to DOE. For Reclamation, funding would be reduced by 29% from the FY2019 level. The FY2020 budget request includes significant reductions in funding for USACE and Reclamation, with Reclamation's funding being reduced by 29% from the FY2019 level. The budget also proposes divesting the assets of the PMAs that own transmission infrastructure. The FY2020 budget request proposes divesting the assets of PMAs, including BPA, SWPA, and WAPA, to generate approximately $5.8 billion in mandatory savings over 10 years. The budget also suggests repealing borrowing authority for WAPA's Transmission Infrastructure Program and transitioning PMAs to a market-based rate-setting approach, estimated to yield $1.9 billion in new revenues over a decade. Additionally, the budget calls for repealing $3.25 billion in borrowing authority for WAPA's transmission projects. The FY2020 budget proposes divesting assets of PMAs, including BPA, SWPA, and WAPA, to save $5.8 billion over 10 years. It also suggests repealing borrowing authority for WAPA's Transmission Infrastructure Program, saving $1.9 billion in new revenues. The budget calls for terminating the DOE Weatherization Assistance Program and the State Energy Program. Opposition to these proposals has been voiced by various groups and Members of Congress. The FY2020 budget proposes terminating the DOE Weatherization Assistance Program and the State Energy Program to shift focus towards early-stage R&D, despite opposition from various groups and Members of Congress. The Weatherization Assistance Program provides grants for energy efficiency improvements in low-income housing, while the State Energy Program offers grants and technical assistance for state energy programs. These programs are under DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and received $257 million and $55 million respectively in FY2019. The Administration's FY2020 budget request proposes significant reductions in DOE R&D funding for energy efficiency, renewable energy, nuclear energy, and fossil energy. The proposed cuts include substantial decreases in bioenergy, vehicle technologies, natural gas technologies, advanced manufacturing, building technologies, wind energy, solar energy, geothermal technologies, and nuclear fuel cycle R&D. The focus is on shifting resources towards early-stage R&D and increasing reliance on the private sector for later-stage research and commercialization of energy technologies. Similar reductions proposed for FY2019 were not enacted. The Administration's FY2020 budget request includes new funding for a proposed nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, NV. DOE would receive $116 million to seek an NRC license for the repository and develop interim nuclear waste storage capacity. NRC would receive $38.5 million to consider DOE's application. The funding would come from two appropriations accounts: $90 million from Nuclear Waste Disposal and $26 million from Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal. DOE submitted a license application for the Yucca Mountain repository in 2008. The Obama Administration declared the Yucca Mountain site \"unworkable\" due to opposition from Nevada. The House voted for funding in FY2018 and FY2019, but the Senate did not include it. The FY2019 Senate bill included a pilot program for interim nuclear waste storage, but it was not enacted. The FY2020 budget request includes funding for a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain. The FY2020 budget request by Mark Holt would halt further loans and loan guarantees under DOE's Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program and the Title 17 Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program. It would also stop further loan guarantees under DOE's Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program. DOE would continue to administer its existing loan portfolio, rescinding unused prior-year authority and unspent appropriations. Additionally, $3.7 billion in Title 17 loan guarantees were provided for new reactors at the Vogtle nuclear plant after the FY2020 budget request. The FY2020 DOE budget request includes $107 million for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in France. The U.S. will contribute to components like central solenoid superconducting magnet modules. ITER aims to pave the way for fusion-based electricity production. The U.S. will cover 9% of the project's construction costs, which has faced concerns about management, schedule, and cost. The United States will pay 9% of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project's construction costs, estimated between $4.0 billion and $6.5 billion. DOE funding for the project was $122 million in FY2018 and $132 million in FY2019. The Trump Administration's FY2020 budget proposes eliminating ARPA-E and rescinding $287 million of unobligated balances. The Trump Administration's FY2020 budget proposes terminating ARPA-E and increasing funding for DOE Weapons Activities, including a 10% increase for nuclear warhead life-extension programs. ARPA-E will use unobligated balances to phase out the program by FY 2022. The FY2020 budget proposes a 10% increase in funding for nuclear warhead life-extension programs. The funding request for W80-4 LEP increases by 37%, and there is initiation of funding for the W87-1 LEP. The budget seeks $112 million for the W87-1 warhead and $10 million for the W76-2 LEP. In FY2020, the NNSA is seeking $51.5 million for surveillance efforts on the B83 gravity bomb, a 47% increase from FY2019. The Trump Administration reversed the plan to retire the bomb, which may spark controversy. Funding for Plutonium Sustainment in the NNSA budget would increase by 97%, from $361 million in FY2019 to $712 million in FY2020. The Administration is seeking a significant increase in funding for plutonium pit production for nuclear warheads at two facilities. The Department of Energy's Office of Environmental Management is requesting a decrease in funding for environmental cleanup and waste management activities in FY2020. The FY2020 budget request includes a proposal to transfer management of the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) from USACE to the Office of Legacy Management (LM). The budget for FUSRAP is reduced to $141 million from $150 million in FY2019. USACE will continue cleanup of FUSRAP sites on a reimbursable basis. No markups had been held for FY2020 Energy and Water Development appropriations as of the report publication date. Table 2 shows budget totals for energy and water development appropriations from FY2011 to FY2019, along with the FY2020 request. The appropriations bill includes four titles: Corps of Engineers\u2014Civil, Department of the Interior, Department of Energy, and Independent Agencies. Major programs are described in the bill, with previous appropriations and budget recommendations listed in accompanying tables. For more detailed information, congressional clients can contact CRS. The FY2020 budget justifications for the largest agencies funded by the annual Energy and Water Development appropriations bill can be found through the provided links for U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, Central Utah Project, Department of Energy, Appalachian Regional Commission, and Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Congressional clients can contact CRS analysts for more detailed information. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, and Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board are agencies with specific responsibilities. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is an agency under the Department of Defense that plans, builds, and operates water resources facilities. Congress typically authorizes Corps activities through Water Resources Development Acts before funding them. Recent Congresses passed omnibus water resources authorization acts in June 2014, December 2016, and October 2018. These acts authorized new projects for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and made changes to USACE policies. Unlike other infrastructure programs, federal funds for USACE projects are not distributed based on formulas or competitive grants. USACE is directly involved in planning, designing, and managing construction projects that are cost-shared with nonfederal sponsors. Since FY2010, Congress has not added funding at the project level for USACE projects due to earmark moratorium policies. Instead, Congress has included \"additional funding\" for select categories of projects and provided direction and limitations on the use of these funds. The Bureau of Reclamation, originally focused on irrigation for farming in the West, now assists in meeting water demands while protecting the environment and infrastructure. Reclamation manages numerous dams and reservoirs in 17 western states, with municipal and industrial water deliveries doubling since 1970. The Bureau of Reclamation manages over 300 storage reservoirs in 17 western states, providing water to 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people. It is the largest wholesale water supplier in the region and the second-largest hydroelectric power producer in the nation. Reclamation projects also offer flood control, recreation, and other benefits, but face controversy over their impact on wildlife and conflicts among water users during droughts. The budget consists mainly of individual project funding lines subject to earmark disclosure rules due to the current moratorium on earmarks. The Bureau of Reclamation manages numerous projects providing water to farmland and people in western states. The current moratorium on earmarks limits congressional steering of funds towards specific projects. Reclamation's main account covers traditional programs like construction, operations, dam safety, and ecosystem restoration. The Energy and Water Development bill has funded DOE programs since FY2005, including research and development activities. DOE programs since FY2005 include research on renewable energy, energy efficiency, nuclear power, fossil energy, and electricity. The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy focuses on transportation energy technology, energy efficiency, and renewable energy production. The Sustainable Transportation program area covers electric vehicles, vehicle efficiency, and alternative fuels.

The fuel cell program focuses on reducing costs and hydrogen fuel expenses. Bioenergy goals include developing \"drop-in\" fuels compatible with existing infrastructure at $3/gge. The DOE's renewable power programs aim to achieve cost goals for solar, wind, water, and geothermal energy sources. By 2030, the solar energy program targets 3 cents per kWh for utility-scale PV. Wind R&D focuses on cost reduction and performance improvement. The geothermal program aims for 20.8 cents/kWh by 2022. Energy efficiency programs include advanced manufacturing and building technologies to enhance energy efficiency. The DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) provides weatherization grants for low-income housing and state energy planning grants. The Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER) focuses on energy infrastructure resilience and security. The DOE Office of Electricity (OE) works on North American energy vulnerabilities, electricity storage, sensing technology, and policy analysis. CESER is the federal government's lead entity for energy sector-specific responses to energy security emergencies, conducting R&D on energy infrastructure security technology, providing security guidelines and training, and enhancing emergency preparedness. DOE's Multiyear Plan for Energy Sector Cybersecurity aims to strengthen energy delivery systems and develop secure, resilient, and self-defending energy systems for the future. The Department of Energy (DOE) has established three goals for energy sector cybersecurity: strengthen preparedness, coordinate incident response, and accelerate research for resilient energy systems. DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy focuses on existing nuclear fleet, advanced reactor concepts, and fuel cycle technologies to support energy independence and grid resiliency. Research includes advanced small modular reactors and enhancing sustainability of commercial light water reactors. The Reactor Concepts program focuses on advanced reactor research, including Generation IV reactors and developing a Versatile Test Reactor for testing fuels and materials in a fast neutron environment. Research is also conducted on extending the life of existing commercial light water reactors beyond 60 years. The Fuel Cycle Research and Development program includes generic research on fuel cycle technologies. The Fuel Cycle Research and Development program focuses on nuclear waste management, technology development for spent fuel, accident-tolerant fuels, fuel cycle options, and prevention of nuclear material diversion. It also works on developing high-assay low enriched uranium for advanced reactors. The DOE's Fossil Energy R&D Program focuses on carbon capture and storage for coal and natural gas power plants. Activities include Advanced Coal Energy Systems, Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS), Natural Gas Technologies, and Unconventional Fossil Energy Technologies. CCUS program includes Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage subprograms for separating CO2, converting carbon to marketable products, and storing CO2 in geologic formations. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was authorized in 1975 to provide strategic and economic security by storing crude oil in caverns within salt domes in Louisiana and Texas. It serves as an emergency stockpile to ensure U.S. oil supply stability and fulfill international energy obligations. For more information on carbon capture and storage, refer to CRS reports IF10589 and R44472 by Peter Folger. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was established in 1975 to maintain energy security by storing crude oil in salt domes in Louisiana and Texas. The SPR currently holds about 649 million barrels of oil, with capacity reaching 727 million barrels in early 2010. The federal government has not purchased oil for the SPR since 1994, and recent laws mandate sales of SPR oil. The legislation mandates the sale of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve over the period FY2017 through FY2027, totaling 266 million barrels. The DOE Office of Science conducts basic research in six program areas. The DOE's Office of Science is the largest Federal sponsor of basic research in the physical sciences and supports fundamental scientific research for the nation's energy future. The ASCR program focuses on developing computing and networking capabilities for science and research, including exascale computing. The BES program area in the Office of Science focuses on understanding and controlling matter and energy at the atomic and molecular levels. The BES program in the Office of Science focuses on understanding and controlling matter and energy at the electronic, atomic, and molecular levels. It supports research in condensed matter physics, chemistry, and geosciences, as well as funding for scientific user facilities and DOE research centers. BER seeks to understand complex biological, climate, and environmental systems, with a focus on plant and microbial systems, climate-relevant atmospheric and ecosystem modeling, and genomic research. The Department of Energy's Fusion Energy Sciences program supports research on high-temperature matter behavior and fusion energy development, including funding for the ITER project. Concerns have been raised about ITER's cost, schedule, and impact on domestic fusion research. The High Energy Physics (HEP) program researches fundamental matter and energy, including dark energy and dark matter. Nuclear Physics studies matter's basic constituents and interactions, with a focus on the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams project at Michigan State University. The Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2014Energy (ARPA-E) supports energy technology research to overcome long-term barriers. The DOE's Loan Programs Office provides loan guarantees for specified projects. Sargent Jr. DOE's Loan Programs Office offers loan guarantees for projects deploying specific energy technologies under Title 17 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The program covers up to 80% of construction costs for eligible energy projects, with successful applicants required to pay an upfront fee. The federal government would repay all covered loans in case of borrower default, reducing risk for lenders. Loan guarantees reduce lender risk, enabling financing at below-market rates. Authorized guarantee amounts include: $8.3 billion for nonnuclear technologies, $2.0 billion for unspecified projects, $18.5 billion for nuclear power plants, $4 billion for uranium enrichment plants, $1.18 billion for renewable energy projects. An additional $161 million was allocated for subsidy costs. The DOE provided $8.3 billion in loan guarantees for the Vogtle nuclear reactors in Georgia and committed an additional $3.7 billion in guarantees in 2019. NuScale Power is seeking a loan guarantee to build a small modular reactor in Idaho. The United States has a science-based program to maintain confidence in its nuclear stockpile, established by Congress in 1994. The Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (P.L. 111-84, \u00a73111) aims to ensure the safety and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile without underground testing. The program is managed by the NNSA, a semi-autonomous agency within the DOE, funded through the Weapons Activities account. NNSA conducts most of its weapons activities at the nuclear weapons complex, which includes three laboratories and four production sites. The NNSA manages the weapons complex, overseeing contractors at eight sites including the Nevada National Security Site. Radiological activities are overseen by the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. The Weapons Activities account includes Directed Stockpile Work for life extension programs, stockpile services, research, development, and dismantlement of warheads. Funding for dismantlement increased as the U.S. stockpile decreased after the Cold War. The Directed Stockpile Work program provides funding for critical components of nuclear warheads and materials like plutonium pits. Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) focuses on developing capabilities for stockpile stewardship without nuclear testing. Infrastructure and Operations funding includes material recycle, facility recapitalization, and construction. The Nuclear Weapons Activities program includes projects like the Uranium Processing Facility and Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement. It also covers programs for secure transportation, defense security, and information technology. For more details, refer to CRS Report R44442, Energy and. DOE's nonproliferation and national security programs, administered by NNSA's Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, support U.S. efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. The Materials Management and Minimization program works to eliminate weapons-useable material worldwide through activities like converting reactors to low-enriched uranium and disposing of excess nuclear materials. Global Materials Security has three major program elements: International Nuclear Security focuses on securing vulnerable stockpiles of nuclear material in other countries, Radiological Security promotes reducing and securing radioactive sources worldwide, and Nuclear Smuggling Detection and Deterrence works to prevent illicit trafficking of nuclear materials. Nonproliferation and Arms Control supports U.S. objectives to prevent proliferation, ensure peaceful nuclear uses, and enable verifiable nuclear reductions through reviews of nuclear export applications and treaty obligations implementation. The Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation program implements treaty obligations, analyzes nonproliferation policies, and advances nuclear detection technologies. Nuclear Counterterrorism and Incident Response focuses on interagency policy, contingency planning, and capacity building to counter nuclear terrorism. The DOE manages waste and contamination legacy from nuclear weapons production and environmental contamination at nondefense nuclear research sites. DOE established the Office of Environmental Management in 1989 to consolidate cleanup responsibilities for former nuclear weapons production sites. The cleanup efforts include disposal of radioactive and hazardous wastes, management of surplus nuclear materials, remediation of contamination in soil and groundwater, decontamination of buildings, and safeguarding facilities. Over 100 sites in 30 states were involved in nuclear weapons production and research. The Office of Environmental Management oversees cleanup efforts at over 100 former nuclear weapons production sites across 30 states. Cleanup remedies are in place at most sites, with long-term stewardship managed by the Office of Legacy Management and other DOE offices. Some smaller sites were transferred to the Army Corps of Engineers under the FUSRAP program in 1997. Funding for the Office of Environmental Management comes from three appropriations accounts. The Office of Environmental Management oversees cleanup at former nuclear weapons production sites across the country. Funding comes from three appropriations accounts, with the Defense Environmental Cleanup account being the largest. The Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup account funds cleanup at federal nuclear energy research sites. Title XI of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 established the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund for cleanup at three federal facilities. The Office of Environmental Management faces funding challenges to meet cleanup milestones at various sites. These milestones are enforceable measures set in compliance agreements with DOE, EPA, and states. DOE's Power Marketing Administrations sell power from dams, prioritizing publicly and cooperatively owned utilities. PMAs operate in 34 states with transmission infrastructure spanning over 33,000 miles of high voltage lines and 587 substations. PMA customers repay power program expenses and capital project interest. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) are responsible for repaying power program expenses and capital project interest. Power revenues associated with PMAs are classified as discretionary offsetting receipts, giving them a \"net-zero\" spending authority. Only WAPA and SWPA's capital expenses require appropriations from Congress. Other independent agencies funded in Title IV of the Energy and Water Development bill include the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), and the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. NRC has a budget of over $900 million, with about 90% offset by other means. The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) was established in 1965 as a regional economic development agency. It awards grants and contracts to foster economic opportunities, improve workforce skills, build critical infrastructure, and strengthen natural and cultural assets in the defined Appalachian Region. The region includes parts of several states and has a population of over 25 million people. The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) provides funding for projects in economically distressed counties, focusing on infrastructure like broadband, transportation, and water systems. They have supported the development of the Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS), with 90.5% completion. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) enforces safety standards for nuclear power plants and materials, with Nuclear Reactor Safety being its largest program. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) oversees the U.S. fleet of power reactors and nuclear waste facilities, including the proposed Yucca Mountain repository. NRC's budget is mostly funded through fees charged to license holders, with only 10% coming from appropriations. Congressional hearings have discussed the FY2020 budget request, with details on excluded items like advanced reactor regulations and international activities. Testimony and opening statements for various Department of Energy hearings are available on cited web pages, along with webcasts in some cases. Dates and links for upcoming hearings are provided for the Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, National Nuclear Security Administration, and DOE Science, Energy, and Environmental Management Programs.
