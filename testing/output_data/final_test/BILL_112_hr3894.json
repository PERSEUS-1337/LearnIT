The Historic Pullman District, established by George M. Pullman in the 1880s, was a model community for workers and families. The town won an award for being the \"World's Most Perfect Town\" in 1896. The Pullman factory site symbolizes the American struggle for fair labor practices, leading to the first industry-wide strike in the US in 1894. In 1894, factory workers in the Pullman strike protested unsafe labor conditions and pay cuts, supported by the American Railway Union. The strike led to federal intervention by President Grover Cleveland, showcasing the power of working Americans to advocate for fair practices. The Pullman Car Company's legacy includes the significant role of Pullman Porters, African American ex-slaves who faced discrimination but found paid work. The Pullman Porters, ex-slaves who found paid work after the Civil War, played a crucial role in the development of the black middle class. Their contributions in carrying information and commerce across the country helped bring education and wealth to the black community. The Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the first black union established in 1925, fought against discrimination and laid the groundwork for the Civil Rights Movement. The preservation of Pullman's legacy has been threatened. The preservation of Pullman was threatened by demolition in 1960 and a fire in 1998, damaging the clock-tower and manufacturing buildings. Restoration efforts by community organizations, foundations, and government were crucial. Pullman is designated as a National Historic Landmark, Illinois State Landmark, and City of Chicago Landmark district. SEC. 3. SPECIAL RESOURCE STUDY.
