    "content": "Recent interest in expanding School Resource Officer (SRO) programs has focused on more than just deterring active shooters. SROs have varied duties that can be categorized into three main roles: safety expert and law enforcer, problem solver and liaison to community resources, and educator. They handle calls for service, make arrests, respond to off-campus criminal activities involving students, and serve as first responders during critical incidents at schools. SROs also help solve non-criminal problems like bullying or disorderly behavior. School Resource Officers (SROs) have diverse roles beyond deterring active shooters. They serve as safety experts, problem solvers, and educators, addressing issues like bullying and gang activity. SROs also conduct crime prevention efforts, community justice initiatives, and offer courses on policing and responsible citizenship. Data from the U.S. Department of Education shows the presence of SROs in various types of schools, based on the 2016 School Survey on Crime and Safety. According to the 2016 School Survey on Crime and Safety, 42% of U.S. public schools had at least one full-time or part-time School Resource Officer (SRO) during the 2015-2016 school year. High schools and schools with enrollments of 1,000 or more reported a greater presence of SROs, with 68% of high schools having an SRO present at least once a week. According to the 2016 School Survey on Crime and Safety, 68% of high schools had an SRO present at least once a week during SY2015-2016, compared to 59% of middle schools and 30% of elementary schools. Schools with enrollments of 1,000 or more students had a higher presence of SROs, with 77% having an SRO present at least one day a week. The data did not account for schools where SROs were present less than weekly. The curr_chunk discusses the inclusion of security personnel, such as full-time and part-time SROs, in school settings. Policymakers are urged to consider various issues related to SRO programs, including the prevention of school shootings and the impact on the school environment. There is a question of whether there is a need for a widespread expansion of SRO programs. Policymakers are considering increasing the presence of SROs in schools to enhance safety, particularly regarding school shootings. Some argue that media coverage creates exaggerated fears, while others believe in the necessity of protecting children. Data on school homicides from SY1992-1993 to SY2014-2015 is analyzed to determine the need for additional prevention resources. On average, there have been 23 at-school homicides of children aged 5-18 each school year. On average, there have been 23 at-school homicides each school year from SY1992-2015. The trend shows a general downward trend in at-school homicides, with spikes often linked to multiple-victim shooting incidents. For example, the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012 accounted for a significant portion of at-school homicides that year. Not all spikes are due to shootings, indicating the complexity of factors influencing school homicides. During SY2006-2007, there were 32 at-school homicides, with the deadliest school shooting resulting in the deaths of five students at Nickel Mines school in Pennsylvania. Data from SY2014-2015 showed 1,168 homicides of children ages 5-18, with 20 occurring at schools. The debate on expanding SRO programs is driven by multiple-victim shootings at schools, not by other school-related problem behaviors. Since 1996, there have been 16 multiple-victim shootings in schools, with 8 classified as mass shootings. Fatal school shootings, including mass shootings, have decreased since the early 1990s. In SY2014-2015, approximately one per 6.7 million students was killed in fatal school shootings. In the past 15 years, the number of children killed in fatal school shootings has mostly been below one per 6.7 million students. Interest in expanding School Resource Officer (SRO) programs is driven by the belief that SRO presence could deter or respond to school shootings effectively. However, there is no available research on whether SROs are effective in preventing school shootings or reducing casualties. Research on the effectiveness of School Resource Officer (SRO) programs in preventing school shootings and reducing casualties is mixed. Some studies show a negative effect on reported serious violent crimes with SRO presence, while others indicate higher violent crime rates in schools with only security personnel. Studies have shown mixed results on the effectiveness of School Resource Officer (SRO) programs in preventing school shootings and reducing casualties. Some research suggests that SROs may help mitigate violent crime, with a positive effect on reported serious violence in schools with other grade levels. However, the presence of SROs did not have a statistically significant impact on reported serious violence in high schools. SROs were also associated with fewer reported attacks with a weapon and gun possession in lower grades, but not in high schools. The 2005-2006 SSOCS data used in studies is limited due to its cross-sectional nature, making it difficult to determine the impact of School Resource Officers (SROs) on school crime. The correlational relationships identified do not allow for definitive statements on the causal order of security personnel and school crime. It is unclear if schools with high crime rates hired SROs or private security guards to address the issue, or if the presence of SROs specifically caused changes in crime rates. The addition of School Resource Officers (SROs) or private security guards did not lead to a significant decrease in school crime rates, according to a study analyzing SSOCS data from 2003-2008. However, schools that added SROs reported a notable increase in weapon and drug offenses. The study's limitations include a non-representative sample of schools and the potential for other factors influencing crime rates. The research on the effectiveness of School Resource Officer (SRO) programs in reducing school crime is limited and draws conflicting conclusions. Studies have shown that adding SROs to schools may not lead to a significant decrease in crime rates, and there are concerns about the accuracy of reported crime data. Additionally, the effects of SROs may be influenced by other security measures and policies in place. Research on the effectiveness of School Resource Officer (SRO) programs in reducing school violence shows conflicting conclusions. Some studies suggest that SROs reduce fear of crime and increase feelings of safety among students and staff. However, other research indicates that the presence of SROs may imply that schools are unsafe. Interviews with focus groups at 14 schools revealed mixed opinions about the presence of SROs, with some seeing it as a negative signal about the school while others viewed it as desirable. The presence of School Resource Officers (SROs) in schools is generally accepted and desirable, with students' acceptance related to how the officer interacts with them. Perception of school safety can be influenced by factors like personal experiences with crime and gang presence. Research also shows that the presence of security guards can increase fear of victimization in white students but not black students. Teachers and principals tend to have a positive view of SROs. Research has found that teachers and principals generally have positive attitudes towards School Resource Officers (SROs) in schools, believing their presence deters student misconduct and reduces school crime. High school teachers, more than elementary and middle school teachers, view the presence of SROs as desirable. Teachers in schools serving impoverished communities also desire a greater police presence to assist with behavioral problems. However, limited research exists on how SROs impact the perception of crime in schools, with studies often focusing on a small number of schools in specific geographic areas, raising questions about the generalizability of the results. The perception of school safety by students and school employees is subjective and can be influenced by factors like experience with victimization or gang presence. Student perception of danger at school can impact attendance, confidence, and academic performance. Limited research exists on how School Resource Officers (SROs) address these issues, but their role as first responders to school shootings is crucial. The role of School Resource Officers (SROs) as first responders to school shootings has gained attention since the Parkland, FL, school shooting. A recent Washington Post examination identified 197 incidents of gunfire at primary or secondary schools between April 1999 and March 2018. Only one instance was found where an SRO stopped an active school shooter by returning fire. Between 1999 and 2018, there were nearly 200 incidents of gunfire in schools, with 68 schools having an SRO or security guard present. SROs intervened in school shootings in Dixon, IL, and Great Mills High School in Maryland, with outcomes varying depending on the shooter's intentions. Some students have attempted suicide by provoking armed security personnel. The Washington Post analysis found instances of students provoking armed security personnel to commit suicide. Some school shooters deliberately targeted schools without security personnel. Schools reported having part-time SROs, which may limit their deterrent effect on potential shooters. While recent interest in SRO programs has focused on preventing school shootings, it's important to note that SROs are more than just armed guards. They are sworn law enforcement officers who patrol schools, investigate crimes, and handle law violators. Assigning an SRO to a school can improve relationships with law enforcement, act as a deterrent to potential shooters, and provide a quicker response to school shootings. However, it also establishes a regular law enforcement presence in the school. The presence of School Resource Officers (SROs) in schools raises concerns about potential social costs, such as increased suspensions and expulsions for minor offenses, and the monetary cost of expanding SRO programs. Research by Fisher and Hennessy examines the association between SROs in high schools and the use of exclusionary discipline. The presence of School Resource Officers (SROs) in high schools leads to a greater use of suspensions and expulsions, according to Fisher and Hennessy's analysis. They found that SROs are associated with a significant increase in exclusionary discipline, cautioning that much of the research on this topic lacks methodological rigor. The research on school discipline and School Resource Officers (SROs) lacks methodological rigor, with studies showing higher arrest rates in schools with SROs but the relationship disappearing when controlling for school-level poverty. The study found that students in schools with School Resource Officers (SROs) were more likely to be arrested for disorderly conduct, even when controlling for school-level poverty. However, schools with SROs had lower arrest rates for assault and possessing a weapon on school grounds, suggesting that SROs may deter more serious crimes. Critics noted that the analysis did not consider data over a long enough period before SROs were assigned to schools. The study by Na and Gottfredson analyzed the impact of adding School Resource Officers (SROs) to schools. They found that schools with SROs were more likely to report non-serious violent crimes to the police, such as physical attacks or fights without a weapon. However, the addition of SROs did not affect the reporting of other types of crime or overall crime rates. The study found that adding School Resource Officers (SROs) to schools may lead to increased formal processing of minor offenses. However, students at schools with SROs were not more likely to face harsh discipline for reported offenses. Concerns about SROs potentially increasing juvenile justice system involvement for school-based offenses are valid, but the full impact of SROs remains unclear. Policymakers may consider expanding SRO programs for school safety while also being cautious about their effects on the school environment. Evaluation research on specific program models is needed. The Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Office suggests developing a comprehensive school safety plan before deciding to employ a School Resource Officer (SRO). SRO programs should have clear goals, engage in problem-solving policing activities, and collect data to assess their effectiveness. The COPS guide recommends schools and law enforcement agencies to establish clear goals and be aware of potential pitfalls before implementing a School Resource Officer (SRO) program. It emphasizes the importance of an agreed-upon operating protocol or Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to define roles and responsibilities. Selecting officers with skills in working with students, understanding child development, and providing proper training is crucial for the success of the program. Proper training for School Resource Officers (SROs) is essential for a successful program. The Police Foundation recommends training focus on child and adolescent development, trauma's impact on student behavior, subconscious bias, crisis intervention, alternatives to detention, and legal issues for students with disabilities."
