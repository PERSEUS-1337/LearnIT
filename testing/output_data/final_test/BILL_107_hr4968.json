    "content": "The Act is known as the \"Federal-Utah State Trust Lands Consolidation Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings section. The San Rafael Swell in Utah is a 900-square mile, wild and beautiful region dominated by the jagged, uplifted San Rafael Reef. It has important natural, historical, and cultural resources, including exceptional backcountry. The San Rafael Swell region in Utah contains cultural resources such as historical sites, paleontological resources, and wilderness study areas. The State of Utah owns approximately 102,871 acres of land in this region. The San Rafael Swell region in Utah contains land administered by the Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration, granted by Congress for the benefit of the state's public school system. These lands are scattered amidst federal lands and development of resources on them could impact their wilderness characteristics. The State of Utah owns land within the Manti-La Sal National Forest and Red Cliffs Desert Reserve, designated for conservation purposes. The State of Utah owns land with high density of critical habitat for the threatened Mojave desert tortoise. Federal lands surround these State trust lands, limiting their use. The United States can transfer lands to Utah in exchange for certain inholdings without compromising Federal management objectives. The Red Cliffs Desert Reserve poses challenges for land management in Utah and the US. An agreement is proposed for exchanging State trust lands in the San Rafael Swell region to simplify management and save time and expenses. The parties agreed to avoid identifying Federal assets for conveyance to the State in areas with known environmental concerns such as wilderness study areas, proposed wilderness designations, endangered species habitat, archaeological resources, and critical environmental concerns. The agreement aims to resolve environmental conflicts in spectacular wild areas by exchanging State trust lands with the Federal Government, benefiting Utah's public schools and conservation resources. The purpose of this Act is to enact an agreement between the State of Utah and the United States to consolidate State and Federal lands into manageable units while protecting lands with significant resources. The value of lands to be conveyed is found to be approximately equal. The Act ratifies the agreed exchange between the State of Utah and the United States. The State of Utah, the Department of the Interior, and the Department of Agriculture have agreed to exchange Federal lands in Utah for lands managed by the Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration. The terms of the agreement are ratified and confirmed, setting forth the obligations of the parties involved. The conveyances under the Agreement must be completed within 70 days of the Act's enactment. Maps and legal descriptions of the lands involved will be available for public inspection. Legal descriptions take precedence in case of conflicts. The Secretary of the Interior shall prepare legal descriptions for approximately 4,000 acres of Federal lands in Utah, with a reservation of the coal estate and the right to develop it. Future disposition of the coal estate is not restricted by this reservation. Federal lands subject to conveyances must be identified by the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary of the Interior will identify Federal lands with wildlife species listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act. An independent mineral assessment will be conducted to ensure fair terms for both parties before any conveyances. Exceptions to conveyances will be made as needed. The Secretary of the Interior will prepare legal descriptions for specific lands, but some lands will not be conveyed as authorized. The Secretary of the Interior will not accept conveyance of specific lands as authorized. SEC. 5. PLANT AND WILDLIFE SPECIES. The Secretary of the Interior and the State of Utah will enter into an agreement for consultation on adverse effects to species and habitats. SEC. 6. MINERAL DEVELOPMENT. Payments to the United States will be shared with Utah as per the Mineral Leasing Act. SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION. SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION. Such sums as necessary are authorized to carry out this Act, including reducing the balance owed by the United States to the Trust Lands Administration. SEC. 8. COSTS. The United States and Utah will bear their respective costs for implementing this Act."
