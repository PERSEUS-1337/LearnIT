    "content": "The Act may be cited as the Regulations Endanger Democracy Act of 2017 or the RED Tape Act of 2017. Repeal of rules required before issuing or amending rule. In this section, \"agency\" is defined as per section 551 of title 5, United States Code. A \"covered rule\" refers to a rule causing new financial or administrative burdens on businesses or people in the United States, determined by the agency head. The term \"rule\" includes any rule issued by an agency based on an Executive order or Presidential memorandum, or due to the issuance of a memorandum or guidance. The Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions defines the term \"Unified Agenda.\" An agency is prohibited from issuing a covered rule that does not amend an existing rule unless it repeals 2 or more existing covered rules and the cost of the new rule is less than or equal to the repealed rules' cost. An agency is prohibited from issuing a covered rule that does not amend an existing rule unless it repeals 2 or more existing covered rules and the cost of the new rule is less than or equal to the repealed rules' cost. This does not apply to rules related to internal policy, agency procurement, or rules being revised to be less burdensome. The covered rule is being revised to decrease burdens and compliance costs. When considering repealing a rule, the agency must assess its effectiveness, potential adverse effects, cost-benefit ratio, and obsolescence. Each agency must submit a list of covered rules they intend to issue, repeal, or amend every six months to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs for publication in the Unified Agenda. An agency must submit a list of covered rules every 6 months to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, including the cost of each rule. Agencies are prohibited from issuing covered rules without complying with these requirements."
