    "title": "SB 1420",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature of California recognizes the importance of improving occupational health and safety for child care caregivers, who face risks such as exposure to toxic chemicals, illness, stress, and physical hazards. Child care workers have musculoskeletal injury rates comparable to industrial truck and tractor operators and construction equipment operators. The federal Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 (CCDBG) was reauthorized in 2014, with changes including a requirement for caregivers to complete occupational health and safety training on various topics. This training will help caregivers meet new health and safety requirements, fulfill professional growth activities, and improve the well-being of both caregivers and the children in their care. The Child Care Caregiver Occupational Health and Safety Training Act, added to the Education Code, defines terms like caregivers and licensed caregivers who work directly with children in licensed child day care facilities. The Act aims to ensure occupational health and safety training for caregivers. The \"License-exempt caregiver\" is a person working with children under a publicly funded child care program, exempt from licensing requirements. The \"Publicly funded child care program\" is administered by various state departments to subsidize early learning and care for children. A caregiver must complete a two-hour training on occupational health and safety risks specific to child care within two years of the training being offered or within three months of starting work at a licensed child day care facility. The training covers chemical and biological hazards, infectious diseases, physical hazards, and stress management through group discussions and learning from experienced professionals. The State Department of Education, in consultation with the State Department of Public Health and child care caregivers, will develop the curriculum for occupational health and safety training for caregivers. Caregivers will be compensated for attending the training, and the department will contract with an entity to provide the required training statewide. The department will provide occupational health and safety training to caregivers, including updates on health and safety matters. Lists of caregivers who have attended the training and those who are required to attend will be provided to the training entity for follow-up. The department will provide occupational health and safety training to caregivers, complying with the Dymally-Alatorre Bilingual Services Act by offering training materials in non-English languages. This article will be effective from July 1, 2017. Each school district governing board has control over interscholastic athletic policies, programs, and activities, ensuring compliance with state and federal laws. School district governing boards can form associations with other districts for interscholastic athletic programs, allowing schools to set rules for eligibility and participation. Each board represents schools in these associations and discrimination is prohibited in any athletic program involving public schools. (e) No voluntary interscholastic athletic association can exclude a school based on its religious beliefs. Interscholastic athletics involve policies and activities related to athletic contests between schools, whether public or private."
