    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fair Competition in Foreign Commerce Act of 1999\". It includes findings and a statement of purpose. Congress finds that the United States contributes significantly to international development projects through various multilateral lending institutions, which are often plagued by fraud, corruption, waste, inefficiency, and misuse of funding. These issues hinder competition in foreign commerce globally. Detection of impediments before they occur is crucial to ensure the proper use of valuable United States resources in international development projects. Independent third-party procurement monitoring plays a key role in detecting and preventing such impediments by evaluating each stage of the procurement process, promoting transparency, minimizing fraud, corruption, waste, and inefficiency, and enhancing competition in international trade and foreign commerce. The Act aims to enhance international trade and foreign commerce by requiring independent third-party procurement monitoring in multilateral development banks and other lending institutions for the disbursement of nonhumanitarian foreign assistance funds. The Act aims to enhance international trade and foreign commerce by requiring independent third-party procurement monitoring in multilateral development banks and other lending institutions for the disbursement of nonhumanitarian foreign assistance funds. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act requires independent third-party procurement monitoring in multilateral development banks and lending institutions for nonhumanitarian foreign assistance funds. Independent third-party procurement monitoring aims to eliminate bias, promote transparency, and minimize fraud in international procurement. The term \"each stage of procurement\" includes technical specifications, bidding documents, evaluation reports, contract preparation, and delivery of goods and services. \"Multilateral development banks and other lending institutions\" refer to specific organizations like the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund. The curr_chunk mentions various development banks such as the Asian Development Bank, Inter-American Investment Corporation, North American Development Bank, and African Development Fund. SEC. 4. REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR COMPETITION IN FOREIGN COMMERCE. The Secretary of the Treasury must provide a strategic plan for independent third-party procurement monitoring and international procurement reforms within 180 days of this Act. The plan includes instructions to oppose the use of US funds for non-humanitarian assistance until recipient institutions adopt anticorruption plans. The Secretary of the Treasury must report annually to Congress on the progress of implementing procurement reforms by multilateral development banks and recipient countries. No funds for non-humanitarian foreign assistance programs can be used until recipient countries adopt anticorruption plans and ensure transparency in government procurement. Nonhumanitarian foreign assistance programs, like those of the Agency for International Development, require recipient countries to demonstrate open, transparent, and corruption-free procurement practices, along with the use of independent third-party monitoring. Exceptions to the rules for foreign assistance include national security interests and assistance for urgent humanitarian needs, democratic reform, independent organizations, and free market development."
