    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that family, juvenile, and domestic relations courts lack qualified attorneys to represent individuals, as guaranteed by the Constitution for those charged with a crime. The Supreme Court's 1967 decision in In re Gault established that juveniles have certain constitutional rights, including legal counsel and protection against self-incrimination. Studies have shown that many juveniles do not receive due process protections or effective legal counsel, as lawyers representing them often have high caseloads and lack specialized training. Public defenders handling juvenile cases have an average of over 500 cases per year, with limited support and training resources. Due to low wages, there is a shortage of family law attorneys willing to represent juveniles, resulting in a negative impact on children, impoverished parents, and victims of domestic violence. Children in family court cases lack representation, leading to delays in foster care placements and victims of domestic violence remaining in abusive situations. In 1995, 3,100,000 children were reported to child protection agencies as abused or neglected, with 996,000 confirmed cases. The number of seriously injured children nearly quadrupled from 1986 to 1993. By the end of 1995, about 494,000 children were in foster care, mostly due to abuse or neglect. Children in foster care due to abuse, neglect, or abandonment by parents may also witness domestic violence, leading to long-term effects such as posttraumatic stress disorder, low self-esteem, and destructive behavior. Early intervention and education are crucial in preventing further harm to these children. Between 1984 and 1994, there was a significant increase in domestic relations and juvenile cases. The caseload for child abuse in New York State alone saw a more than 300 percent increase between 1984 and 1988. Judges in Chicago handle an average of 1,700 delinquency cases per month, while in Los Angeles, judges for juvenile cases only have about 10 minutes per case. The Act aims to encourage attorneys to specialize in family law, juvenile law, or domestic relations law, especially those willing to represent low-income families. It also seeks to retain highly trained attorneys in these fields by offering loan forgiveness for those working in defense of low-income families, individuals, or children. In this section, \"eligible loan\" refers to a loan for law school attendance. A \"family law or domestic relations attorney\" works in areas like juvenile justice, child abuse, and adoption. A \"highly qualified attorney\" has at least 2 years of experience in family law. The Secretary may carry out a demonstration program for new borrowers who obtain a Juris Doctorate (JD) and take a law school class in family law. They must work full-time as a family law or domestic relations attorney for a government or nonprofit entity to be eligible for loan repayment. The loan repayment program for family law attorneys prioritizes low-income individuals and operates on a first-come, first-served basis. The Secretary assumes the obligation to repay loans for eligible individuals selected for the program. The Secretary will repay a percentage of eligible loans after the third, fourth, and fifth consecutive years of employment. No refunding of repayments is allowed, and interest is adjusted accordingly. The Secretary repays a portion of interest on loans under this section annually. Student borrowers cannot receive benefits from both this section and the National and Community Service Act. The Secretary pays eligible lenders the total amount of eligible loans subject to repayment each fiscal year. Eligible individuals must submit a complete application for loan repayment. The Secretary requires accurate application for loan repayment, with conditions for eligible individuals to apply after each year of qualifying employment. An independent national evaluation of the program's impact on family and domestic relations law will be conducted on a competitive basis. The evaluation will assess if the loan forgiveness program has increased highly qualified attorneys and contributed to longer tenure in family law or domestic relations field. The loan forgiveness program aims to increase the experience and quality of family law attorneys, leading to better family outcomes. The Secretary will provide interim and final evaluation reports to the President and Congress by September 30, 2010. Regulations will be prescribed by the Secretary. The Secretary is authorized to prescribe regulations for the loan forgiveness program. $20,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2006, with additional funding for the following years."
