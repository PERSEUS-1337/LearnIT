    "content": "The \"Terrorism Insurance Act\" includes provisions such as submission of premium information, individual company retention, federal cost-sharing for insurers, terrorism loss repayment surcharge, and state preemption. Congressional findings are outlined in Section 2. The Congress acknowledges the significant impact of the September 11 terrorist attacks, including loss of life, property damage, and business disruption. Insurers and reinsurers have faced unprecedented losses, leading to market uncertainties and potential threats to commercial property casualty insurance availability for terrorism risk. The unavailability of affordable commercial property and casualty insurance for terrorist acts threatens the US economy by impeding financial services providers. Private insurance markets have shown resiliency in adapting to changed circumstances and will develop risk spreading mechanisms. Federal assistance and a temporary industry risk sharing program are necessary to ensure continued availability of terrorism insurance. Federal involvement in providing commercial terrorism insurance should be short-term, with incentives for insurance companies to continue offering coverage while minimizing risk and protecting taxpayers. The Secretary may require insurers to submit aggregate premium information for commercial property and casualty insurance sold in the US. Individual company retention is also addressed. Individual company retention is defined as a triggering determination by the Secretary based on a commercial insurer's annual insured losses from acts of terrorism in 2002 or 2003. The Secretary has the authority to determine if an act of terrorism occurred during those years. Federal cost-sharing for commercial insurers is also addressed. The Secretary provides financial assistance to commercial insurers for insured losses from acts of terrorism, repaid accordingly. The amount of assistance is 80% of covered losses, capped at $100 billion. Limitations are in place to ensure payments go to eligible insurers. Financial assistance provided to commercial insurers for acts of terrorism must be repaid through surcharges collected by insurers. The total repayment amount is capped at $100 billion, with specific limits for acts occurring in 2002 and 2003. Congress designates the budget authority resulting from this section as an emergency requirement. The budget authority resulting from this section is designated as an emergency requirement by Congress, available upon request from the President to Congress. SEC. 6. TERRORISM LOSS REPAYMENT SURCHARGE. The Secretary shall impose a policyholder premium surcharge on commercial insurers' covered lines of insurance to repay financial assistance provided under the Act. The surcharge amount and duration will be determined by the Secretary to recover the aggregate amount of financial assistance. The surcharge imposed on policyholders cannot exceed 6 percent of their annual premium for covered insurance lines and applies to all lines written during a specific period. SEC. 7. ADMINISTRATION OF ASSESSMENTS AND SURCHARGES. The Secretary determines the method of imposing, collecting, and refunding surcharges under section 6, considering the economic impact on urban commercial centers and small businesses. The Secretary may adjust the timing of coverages and assessments under this Act for commercial insurers and policies not based on a calendar year. The provisions of this Act may also apply to self-insurance arrangements by municipalities and other entities. The provisions of this Act may apply to self-insurance arrangements by municipalities and other public entities, if determined before a triggering event and applied uniformly. SEC. 8. STATE PREEMPTION. (a) A commercial insurer complies with State laws on terrorism insurance by following regulations issued by the Secretary. \n(b) State laws requiring additional actions for terrorism insurance coverage, beyond filing rates and policies with the State insurance regulator, are preempted. State laws on terrorism insurance coverage may require additional actions beyond filing rates and policies with the State insurance regulator, but this subsection clarifies that such laws are not preempted solely for allowing subsequent review and actions by the regulator. State laws on terrorism insurance coverage may require additional actions beyond filing rates and policies with the State insurance regulator, but this subsection clarifies that such laws are not preempted solely for allowing subsequent review and actions by the regulator. SEC. 9. CONSISTENT STATE GUIDELINES FOR COVERAGE FOR ACTS OF TERRORISM. Sense of Congress is that NAIC, with Secretary, should define terrorism acts and standards for determining them. States should adopt NAIC's definitions for insurance regulation. Secretary should advocate for appropriate definitions and standards. Secretary, after consulting NAIC, should adopt suitable definitions and standards for the Act. The Congress recommends that States mandate separate disclosure of pricing for terrorism coverage in commercial property and casualty insurance. If States do not comply, the Secretary will establish national guidelines in consultation with NAIC.
