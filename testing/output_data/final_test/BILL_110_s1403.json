    "content": "The \"Farm-to-Fuel Investment Act of 2007\" may be cited as the short title. It includes provisions for bioenergy transition assistance. The \"Farm-to-Fuel Investment Act of 2007\" includes definitions for bioenergy crops, specifying perennial and annual plants suitable for bioenergy production. Bioenergy crops must be grown in a resource-conserving crop rotation. The \"Farm-to-Fuel Investment Act of 2007\" defines bioenergy crops as perennial and annual plants suitable for bioenergy production, excluding crops eligible for payments under title I and invasive or noxious plants. Bioenergy cropshed and bioenergy producer are also defined in the Act. The \"Farm-to-Fuel Investment Act of 2007\" defines bioenergy crops as plants for bioenergy production within designated bioenergy cropsheds, as determined by the Secretary. Bioenergy Transition Assistance includes the designation of bioenergy cropsheds within a 50-mile radius of existing facilities. The \"Farm-to-Fuel Investment Act of 2007\" defines bioenergy crops as plants for bioenergy production within designated bioenergy cropsheds, as determined by the Secretary. Each bioenergy cropshed shall have specific conservation objectives for local resources like water quality, wildlife habitat, soil quality, and air quality. The Secretary will prioritize designating bioenergy cropsheds within a 50-mile radius of existing facilities. The Secretary prioritizes locations for bioenergy cropsheds based on geographic diversity, feedstock diversity, net environmental benefit, and minimal environmental harm. Priority is also given to areas where biorefineries are owned primarily by residents of rural areas. The Secretary, through the Natural Resources Conservation Service, offers contracts to producers in bioenergy cropsheds for bioenergy crop transition assistance. Contracts are for a 3-year term, and producers must demonstrate production of contracted bioenergy crops to be eligible. The Secretary offers contracts to producers in bioenergy cropsheds for bioenergy crop transition assistance. Producers must meet quality criteria and provide information to promote bioenergy crop production and biorefinery technology development. The Secretary provides bioenergy crop transition assistance to producers by evaluating best practices and determining payment amounts based on crop establishment costs and incentives for production. The Secretary offers bioenergy crop transition assistance to producers by assessing costs and incentives for crop production, including factors like crop establishment costs and potential earnings from producing other crops. Funding of $350,000,000 from the Commodity Credit Corporation is allocated for this purpose from 2008 to 2012. Conforming amendments are made to the Food Security Act of 1985 to accommodate these changes.

Amendments are made to the Food Security Act of 1985 to accommodate these changes, including adding section 9003(g) of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002. The Conservation Security Program is outlined in Section 3. The Conservation Security Program, outlined in Section 3, includes definitions for bioenergy crops and producers as per the Food Security Act of 1985. The amendments clarify terms related to bioenergy crops and producers. The amendments to the Conservation Security Program define bioenergy producers who maintain a conservation system with native perennial bioenergy crops or participate in bioenergy crop system research and demonstration projects."
