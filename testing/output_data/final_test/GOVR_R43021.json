The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) faced reductions in air traffic operations funding, estimating a $636 million decrease in total funding compared to FY2012. The FAA faced a $636 million funding cut in FY2013, leading to cost-cutting measures including furloughs, eliminating late-night shifts, and closing control towers at airports with low flight operations. 149 towers under the Federal Contract Tower program were closed starting April 7, 2013. FAA decided to close 149 FCT program towers over four weeks starting April 7, 2013, but delayed the closures to address legal challenges. Several airports sued FAA, questioning safety evaluations. The Reducing Flight Delays Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-9) allowed the FAA to transfer $253 million to prevent air traffic controller furloughs. A bipartisan group of Senators urged the FAA to use the funds to prevent the closure of 149 contract towers. Secretary LaHood announced on May 10, 2013, that the funds transfer was enough to end FAA employee furloughs. The funds transfer under P.L. 113-9 ended FAA employee furloughs and kept 149 towers open for FY2013. Future debates may revisit tower closures or cutbacks in operating hours. Financing and operating low-activity towers are significant issues for future FAA budgets. Tower operations in the U.S. fall into categories funded by FAA or through contract towers. The FAA oversees civil air traffic control towers in the United States, including contract towers funded partially by the FAA and partially by local or state governments. Contract towers and controllers must be FAA certified and follow FAA directives. FAA funds for tower operations come from the Airport and Airways Trust Fund. The FAA oversees civil air traffic control towers in the United States, including contract towers funded partially by the FAA and partially by local or state governments. Of U.S. airports with control towers, 251 are operated by private firms and staffed with contract employees under the FCT program. Sixteen of these contract towers are funded by local entities. The cost-share program allows communities to retain control towers if the benefits outweigh the costs to the federal government. The FCT program has an annual budget of around $140 million, mostly funded by the FAA. The FCT program, with an annual budget of about $140 million, was established in 1982 to provide air traffic services at low-activity towers. Initially a pilot program at five airports, it grew to 27 towers by 1993. Endorsed by Vice President Gore's National Performance Review in 1993, the program expanded to 160 contract towers by FY1997. Congress funded the cost-sharing program in FY1999, allowing airports that would not otherwise have met the criteria to participate. Congress first funded the cost-sharing program for contract towers in 1999, allowing airports to maintain operations with non-federal funds. Currently, 16 towers are funded through this program at a cost of roughly $10 million annually. While federal funding for these towers is secure for now, FAA plans to increase the local share from 20% to 50% in FY2014, potentially leading to closures in communities unable to contribute additional funding. In a 2012 audit, the Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General found that contract towers provided air traffic services to low-activity airports at lower costs than FAA-staffed towers. Contract towers required fewer controllers and cost almost $1.5 million less annually than FAA-staffed towers. Savings were achieved through lower staffing levels and controller pay. Contract towers had a lower rate of safety incidents and aircraft operators reported similar levels of satisfaction with services compared to FAA towers. The FAA operates 262 airport air traffic control towers, with 43 identified for potential closure due to low operations. Some FAA-staffed towers at mid-sized airports may have late-night shifts eliminated in FY2013. These towers mainly handle all-cargo operations and occasional general aviation traffic. The FAA operates 262 airport air traffic control towers, with 43 identified for potential closure due to low operations. Some towers, like those in Little Rock, Manchester, Oklahoma City, Harrisburg, Reno, El Paso, and Norfolk, may close overnight. When a tower closes, the airport remains open as an uncontrolled airport, where pilots are responsible for traffic procedures. In some cases, uncontrolled airports may close at night for noise or safety reasons, but remain functional for emergency landings. The FAA relies on a benefit-to-cost assessment process to determine whether to establish or discontinue air traffic control tower operations. If the benefit-to-cost ratio is greater than or equal to one, a tower may be established, while a ratio below one may lead to closure, continuation under a cost-share program, or conversion to a non-federal control tower. Currently, all airport towers in the contract tower program have benefit-to-cost ratios greater than or equal to one. The FAA uses a benefit-to-cost assessment process to determine air traffic control tower operations. Local communities fund 16 cost-share towers where costs outweigh benefits. The U.S. Contract Tower Association criticizes FAA's methodology for not considering intangible benefits like local economic advantages. Despite criticisms, FAA's methodology remains the basis for decision-making. The FAA's methodology for quantifying a tower's value in aviation safety and efficiency is based on econometric valuations. Benefits of tower operation are compared against costs over a 15-year period, including preventing collisions and accidents, and reducing flight time. The analysis projects the average number of accidents prevented by a tower based on annual flight operations. The risk of collisions at airports increases exponentially with the number of flight operations, as shown by specific equations. Closing 100 control towers with 150,000 annual operations each could lead to roughly 13 more collisions over a 15-year span. Midair collisions are more likely to result in fatalities and destruction compared to other types of accidents. Midair collisions are more likely to result in fatalities and destruction of aircraft, with a greater than 50% chance of fatality. It is estimated that about 18% of aircraft occupants will be fatally injured in accidents that could be prevented by the operation of a control tower. Other preventable accidents include wheels-up landings, collisions with objects, misaligned approaches, and runway overshoots. Towered airports have a lower accident rate compared to non-towered airports, with 1.398 accidents per million operations at towered airports and 2.583 accidents per million operations at non-towered airports from 1983 to 1986. The presence of an operational control tower reduces total accident risk. The presence of an operational control tower reduces total accident risk by roughly one mishap for every 2.14 million operations. Towers provide efficiency gains by reducing flight time and fuel burn, with a minimal impact on commercial aircraft compared to general aviation aircraft. Tower closures have a negative cumulative impact on energy and the environment, increasing aircraft fuel burn, emissions, and noise. Airlines may be affected in terms of receiving required information and making decisions on service to airports. Private and business aircraft operators may also be influenced in their decisions on where to base and operate their aircraft. The potential closure of smaller airfield towers could divert general aviation traffic to busier commercial airports, leading to increased delays. The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association warns that this could impact the entire metroplex. Technologies like in-cockpit situation awareness and remote air traffic services may help mitigate safety concerns. Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) technology allows general aviation aircraft to receive in-cockpit moving maps with traffic overlays by broadcasting signals from other aircraft. FAA mandates ADS-B Out capability by 2020, but there is no requirement for ADS-B In to receive and display traffic information. Some general aviation operators may benefit from ADS-B In capability to improve situation awareness and traffic avoidance. Greater participation is needed for comparable level of awareness as manned air traffic control towers. Remote air traffic services could provide cost savings by centralizing operations, but initial start-up costs may be high. Remote or virtual towers are a potential next step in air traffic facility consolidation, utilizing data like ADS-B and surface radar. Cameras and sensors could be installed at airports without towers to provide information to consolidated air traffic facilities for controllers to provide services similar to manned towers.Pooling resources at these facilities could allow for cost savings. European researchers are developing remote air traffic service capabilities in Norway and Sweden, while Australia's AirServices is testing remote tower facilities in Alice Springs from Adelaide. In the US, NASA and the John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center are researching virtual towers and remote sensing capabilities for air traffic control. Field tests at US airports are being considered. Tests at U.S. airports are under consideration, but remote or virtual air traffic control tower facilities are unlikely to be operational soon. An amendment was proposed to limit FAA tower closures in response to budget cuts by funding the contract tower program for FY2013 at $130.5 million. This funding would be offset by rescinding unobligated prior-year funds for FAA facilities and research. The measure does not protect contract towers beyond FY2013. The Senate passed an amended version of H.R. 933 on March 20, 2013, which did not include funding for the contract tower program. S. 687 was introduced on April 9, 2013, to prohibit the suspension or termination of FAA air traffic control towers operational before March 1, 2013, in FY2013 or FY2014. Legislation was also proposed to increase tower staffing, such as the Minimum Staffing of Air Traffic Controllers Act of 2013 (H.R. 66). The Minimum Staffing of Air Traffic Controllers Act of 2013 (H.R. 66) would require a tower to be staffed with a minimum of two air traffic controllers at all times for airports with regular air carrier operations. This legislation aims to address concerns about fatigue and workload among controllers during late-night shifts, not related to budget cuts. However, budget limitations could lead to the closure of more towers if additional staffing is required."
