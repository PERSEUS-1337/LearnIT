    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Small Business Lawsuit Abuse Protection Act of 1997\". It includes findings related to the Act. Congress finds that the US civil justice system is inefficient, unfair, and costly, impacting interstate commerce. There is a need to restore rationality and fairness, as litigation costs and punitive damage awards have been escalating for the past 30 years. The Supreme Court has acknowledged the potential unconstitutionality of excessive punitive damage awards. The award can be grossly excessive in relation to the government's interest in punishment and deterrence. Joint and several liability can also lead to unjust costs for parties not at fault. Small businesses are often unfairly brought into litigation, facing disproportionate damage awards. Small businesses face high liability costs and unwarranted litigation expenses, leading to increased insurance expenses. Liability reform for small businesses can reduce burdens on interstate commerce and promote the free flow of goods and services. Legislation addressing these concerns falls within Congress' constitutional powers. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions are provided for terms such as \"act of international terrorism,\" \"crime of violence,\" \"drug,\" and \"economic loss.\" These definitions align with specific sections of the United States Code. The curr_chunk defines terms related to losses in various contexts, including harm, hate crime, and noneconomic losses. It outlines the types of losses that can be compensated under applicable State law. The curr_chunk defines the term \"small business\" as an entity with less than 25 full-time employees, including subsidiaries of a wholly-owned corporation. The term \"State\" refers to individual states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The curr_chunk specifies the locations covered under the term \"State\" as individual states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other territories or possessions of the United States. SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON PUNITIVE DAMAGES FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. In civil actions against small businesses, punitive damages can only be awarded if clear evidence of willful misconduct or conscious indifference is proven, with a cap of two times the total amount awarded for losses or $250,000. This limitation is applied by the court and not disclosed to the jury. SEC. 5. LIMITATION ON SEVERAL LIABILITY FOR NONECONOMIC LOSS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. In civil actions against small businesses, liability for noneconomic loss is determined based on the percentage of responsibility of each defendant. Each defendant is only liable for the portion of noneconomic loss allocated to them. Separate judgments are rendered against each defendant. The amount of noneconomic loss allocated to each defendant in civil actions is determined based on their percentage of responsibility, regardless of whether they are a party to the action. Each defendant is only liable for the portion of noneconomic loss allocated to them. Exceptions to limitations on liability include misconduct that constitutes a crime of violence, international terrorism, hate crime, sexual offense, violation of civil rights laws, or if the defendant was under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the misconduct. SEC. 7. PREEMPTION AND ELECTION OF STATE NONAPPLICABILITY. This Act preempts State laws inconsistent with it, except for laws providing extra liability protections for small businesses. States can choose not to apply this Act to actions in State courts involving small businesses if they meet specific criteria. SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE. SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act will take effect 90 days after enactment and applies to any claim for harm caused by a small business, regardless of when the harm occurred, if the claim is filed after the effective date."
