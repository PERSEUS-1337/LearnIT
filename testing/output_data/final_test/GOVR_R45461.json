    "content": "The IDFC is a government corporation under the foreign policy guidance of the Secretary of State, aimed at mobilizing private sector capital for economic development in developing countries. It was established by the BUILD Act of 2018 and is set to promote private investment in line with U.S. global development goals and economic interests. The BUILD Act established the IDFC as a successor agency to OPIC, consolidating and expanding development finance functions previously carried out by OPIC and USAID. The IDFC's authorities include making loans, guarantees, issuing insurance, and taking minority equity positions in investments. Unlike OPIC, the IDFC has broader authorities for promoting private sector capital in developing countries. The IDFC, established as a successor agency to OPIC under the BUILD Act, has expanded development finance functions with broader authorities for promoting private sector capital in developing countries. The IDFC can issue loans in local currency and will transfer various USAID functions, with details to be outlined in a reorganization plan to be submitted to Congress within 120 days of enactment. The IDFC, established as a successor agency to OPIC under the BUILD Act, has expanded development finance functions with broader authorities for promoting private sector capital in developing countries. The plan is expected to be submitted by early February 2019, giving the IDFC the authority to conduct feasibility studies on proposed investment projects and provide technical assistance. Development finance supports private sector capital investments in developing and emerging economies, aiming to increase private sector activity and public-private partnerships. Development finance supports private sector investments in developing countries, aiming to promote public-private partnerships and infrastructure funding. DFIs provide tools such as equity, loans, guarantees, insurance, and technical assistance to bridge the investment gap in sectors like transportation and power. In the United States, OPIC has been the primary DFI since the 1970s, authorizing $3.8 billion in new commitments for 112 projects in FY2017. Its exposure reached a record high of $23.2 billion, mobilizing $6.8 billion in capital and supporting 13,000 new jobs in host countries. Sub-Saharan Africa represents the largest share of OPIC's portfolio, with $2.4 billion committed for Power Africa. OPIC has $5 billion invested in the Indo-Pacific for projects in energy, education, financial services, and support for local farmers. On July 30, 2018, OPIC, JBIC, and the Australian government announced a trilateral partnership to mobilize investments in infrastructure projects in the Indo-Pacific region. The IDFC is set to become the DFI for the United States under the BUILD Act. Bilateral DFIs are typically government-owned entities. The United Kingdom established the first DFI in 1948, with many countries following suit. OPIC has been the primary DFI in the United States since the 1970s, with a focus on projects in energy, education, financial services, and support for local farmers. Bilateral DFIs are government-owned institutions that can operate independently or as part of larger development banks. They can also operate multilaterally through international financial institutions or regionally through regional development banks. Examples include the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction & Development, and the Inter-American Development Bank. DFIs have specific objectives and are not subject to renewals by their countries' legislatures. Development finance institutions (DFIs) like the African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction & Development (EBRD), and Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) have varying objectives and activities. Official development assistance (ODA) has historically supported infrastructure projects in developing countries, but private investment now plays a larger role. Private investors in developing countries face challenges like political and exchange rate risks, requiring government support through equity, financing, or political risk insurance to encourage investment. The BUILD Act aims to promote private sector development and economic growth in less developed countries as an alternative to state-directed investments like China's Belt and Road Initiative. The Act emphasizes transparency, environmental and social safeguards, and debt sustainability in partner countries. The International Development Finance Corporation (IDFC) is seen as a key part of the U.S. response to China's economic influence in developing countries. The BUILD Act aims to counter China's investments in developing countries with the International Development Finance Corporation (IDFC) providing up to $8 trillion for infrastructure projects. Critics highlight China's lack of transparency and questionable lending practices, while supporters argue for a private sector-driven development model to compete effectively. The BUILD Act introduced two proposed versions in February 2018 to create the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (IDFC), consolidating OPIC's functions and elements of USAID. One concern is that the IDFC's scope may not be narrowed enough to focus on countering China's influence, potentially supporting projects of limited U.S. foreign policy and strategic interest. The BUILD Act introduced in February 2018 aimed to create the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (IDFC) by consolidating OPIC's functions and elements of USAID. The House and Senate versions of the bill differed in the duration of authorization, with the final version authorizing the IDFC for seven years. The Act was passed as part of the FAA Reauthorization Act in October 2018, despite initial concerns about the IDFC's scope and focus. The Trump Administration pursued development finance reform through OPIC to counter China's economic influence in developing countries. They supported the BUILD Act bills in Congress, which aimed to align U.S. development finance with foreign policy goals. Amendments to the BUILD Act fulfilled the Administration's objectives. The BUILD Act is part of a long-standing debate on government financing of private-sector activity. Supporters argue that OPIC fills gaps in private-sector support, while opponents believe it diverts capital from efficient uses. Various stakeholders propose consolidating development finance functions to boost OPIC's competitiveness. The BUILD Act has garnered overall support, but specific aspects have been subject to debate. Some are concerned about the transfer of DCA and other credit program authority from USAID to the IDFC, potentially affecting the effectiveness of funding mechanisms. Provisions in the BUILD Act aim to promote coordination between USAID and the IDFC to maintain a development focus. Some in the development community questioned the new DFI's development mandate, transparency, and standards compared to OPIC. Critics suggested strengthening the IDFC to counter China's influence in developing countries. Policy alternatives include enhancing coordination among agencies or supporting development goals through multilateral DFIs. The BUILD Act provisions detail how the IDFC should function once established. The BUILD Act provisions establish the new IDFC to mobilize private-sector capital for the economic benefit of less-developed countries and countries transitioning to market economies. Congressional committees overseeing the IDFC include the Senate Foreign Relations and Appropriations committees and the House Foreign Affairs and Appropriations committees. The IDFC's mission is similar to that of OPIC, focusing on U.S. development assistance and foreign policy objectives. The BUILD Act directs the IDFC to prioritize support for low-income and lower-middle-income countries, establishes a Chief Development Officer position on the board, and requires the development performance of the corporation's portfolio to be measured. The annual report must include an analysis of development outcomes for IDFC-supported projects and the corporation's progress towards development goals. The IDFC is managed by a nine-member Board of Directors, including a Deputy CEO, Chief Risk Officer, Chief Development Officer, and other officers as determined by the Board. The Board consists of a Chief Executive Officer, four U.S. government officials, and four non-government members appointed by the President with relevant experience. Members serve three-year terms and can be reappointed for one additional term. The Chairperson of the Board is the Secretary. The IDFC is managed by a nine-member Board of Directors, with the Chairperson being the Secretary of State. The Board includes a Chief Executive Officer, four U.S. government officials, and four non-government members appointed by the President. The Board is required to hold at least two public hearings each year for stakeholder input. The BUILD Act establishes four officers for IDFC management: Chief Executive Officer, Deputy Chief Executive Officer, Chief Risk Officer, and Chief Development Officer. The CEO and Deputy CEO are appointed by the President with Senate approval, while the other officers are appointed by the CEO with Board approval. The Chief Risk Officer and Chief Development Officer report directly to the Board and can only be removed by a majority Board vote. The Chief Risk Officer, in coordination with the Audit Committee, is responsible for managing risks to the IDFC. The Chief Development Officer coordinates development policies with USAID and other U.S. government entities. The BUILD Act does not include specific roles for these officers in OPIC's enabling legislation. The BUILD Act establishes a Development Advisory Council to advise the Board on the IDFC's development objectives. The council is composed of no more than nine members broadly representative of NGOs and other international development-related institutions. It also mandates the IDFC to have its own Inspector General to conduct reviews, investigations, and inspections of its operations. Additionally, the act requires the Board to establish a transparent and independent accountability mechanism for annual evaluation and reporting to Congress. The BUILD Act mandates the IDFC to establish an accountability mechanism to evaluate and report on compliance with various standards, provide a forum for resolving concerns, and advise on projects. It also requires the establishment of a Risk Committee and Audit Committee for monitoring investment strategies and finances. The IDFC's Committee oversees financial performance, internal controls, audits, and compliance. Its authorities include carrying out U.S. policy, mitigating risks, and mobilizing private capital. The emphasis on additionality reflects current policy. Policymakers debate whether IDFC supports or crowds out private-sector activity under the BUILD Act. Under the BUILD Act, the IDFC's authorities would expand to include making loans, guarantees, issuing insurance, taking equity positions, providing technical assistance, establishing enterprise funds, and conducting feasibility studies on investment projects. Loan and guarantee terms are determined by the IDFC, subject to the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. The BUILD Act authorizes the IDFC to provide financing in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies, with a substantive policy rationale required for the latter. The IDFC can also make equity investments in private projects as a minority investor, with terms determined by the Board. Guidelines and criteria will be developed to ensure appropriate use of funds. The BUILD Act authorizes the IDFC to make equity investments in private projects with specific limitations. The total support for a project cannot exceed 30% of all equity investments, and equity support is capped at 35% of the IDFC's total exposure. The IDFC must sell its equity investment as soon as commercially feasible, considering national security interests. This addition of equity authority is significant as OPIC can only provide debt financing. OPIC can only provide debt financing, not equity investments. Foreign DFIs have been hesitant to partner with OPIC due to a preference for equal footing. Resistance to expanding OPIC's equity authority has been seen in Congress. The IDFC can issue insurance or reinsurance for political risk protection. The IDFC is authorized to support feasibility studies for development projects and administer special programs for financial and advisory support. This includes promoting private investment opportunities and managing transactions with cost-sharing requirements. The BUILD Act authorizes the transfer of existing USAID enterprise funds to the IDFC, which may impact the effectiveness of development instruments. The IDFC also has the authority to establish new enterprise funds, but concerns have been raised about its ability to conduct equity investment effectively. The IDFC's authority to conduct equity investment may make enterprise funds unnecessary, as all its authorities are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The IDFC's maximum contingent liability is $60 billion, more than double OPIC's current exposure limit. Supporters believe the IDFC could attract private investment to developing countries. The IDFC, funded through a Corporate Capital Account, will catalyze private investment in developing countries. It is expected to be self-sustaining, with funds designated for operating expenses. Transfers of funds from USAID and the State Department are authorized to support DCA activities. The BUILD Act does not authorize annual appropriations levels for administrative and program expenses for the new IDFC. In FY2018, appropriators made funds available for OPIC's administrative expenses and loans. DCA was appropriated funds for administrative expenses and authorized to use transferred funds from USAID for loan guarantees. If a loan guaranteed by the IDFC results in a loss, the IDFC will pay a percentage of the loss to the holder. The BUILD Act requires the IDFC to pay a percentage of losses on loans after collection efforts. It also limits payments to the value of project contributions plus interest. The Attorney General enforces rights related to loans. The IDFC's authorities end seven years after the act's enactment. The BUILD Act authorizes the IDFC to provide support for infrastructure projects with longer-term authorization, different from annual extensions for OPIC. The IDFC can set terms and conditions for support, focusing on alleviating credit market imperfections or achieving U.S. development goals efficiently. The final maturity of a loan or guarantee cannot exceed a certain limit. The IDFC sets terms for infrastructure project support, with a maximum loan maturity of 25 years or based on project debt capacity. Risk-sharing is required, with 20% guaranteed support by IDFC. Borrower/lender responsibility and U.S. financial interest protection are key. Interest rates are benchmarked to Treasury securities. The IDFC sets minimum interest rates for loan guarantees and adjusts them periodically based on benchmark financial interest rates. Fees and premiums are set to minimize government costs while supporting objectives. The IDFC reviews fees for loan guarantees to ensure they cover costs. The IDFC must have budget authority for loans, set explicit standards for assessing credit risk and project value, prioritize support for less-developed countries, and ensure loans are senior or pari passu with other debt. The IDFC must prioritize support for low-income and lower-middle-income countries, with a focus on projects that benefit the poorest populations. It must also give preference to projects sponsored by U.S. citizens or entities owned or controlled by U.S. citizens. The IDFC prioritizes support for low-income and lower-middle-income countries, focusing on projects benefiting the poorest populations. It gives preference to projects sponsored by U.S. citizens or entities owned or controlled by U.S. citizens. U.S. persons are defined as U.S. citizens or entities owned or controlled by U.S. citizens, easing requirements for projects to have a \"U.S. connection.\" The IDFC must consult annually with the U.S. Trade Representative on countries' eligibility for support and compliance with international trade obligations, giving preferential consideration to compliant countries. The IDFC prioritizes support for low-income and lower-middle-income countries, focusing on projects benefiting the poorest populations and sponsored by U.S. citizens or entities. The USTR is a member of OPIC's Board of Directors, while the IDFC supports projects in countries adopting laws for worker rights and environmental impact. The IDFC requires environmental and social impact assessments before Board votes, notification to the public and NGOs, and mitigation provisions in project contracts. It also considers women's economic empowerment and supports countries embracing private enterprise. The IDFC is directed to give preferential consideration to projects in countries supporting private enterprise and market-based economic policies. It must also prioritize small business projects, ensuring they make up at least 50% of all projects. The IDFC is required to prioritize small business projects, with a minimum of 50% of all projects supporting small businesses. There is a limitation on support for a single entity, capped at 5% of the IDFC's maximum contingent liability. Additionally, the IDFC must consider any affiliations with individuals involved in boycotting friendly countries when approving projects. The IDFC must ensure support goes to countries friendly with the U.S. and not boycotted under U.S. law. It cannot support entities linked to terrorism or human rights violations. Additionally, it is prohibited from dealing with projects under U.S. sanctions laws. The IDFC must comply with U.S. sanctions laws and regulations, including restrictions on dealings with designated persons. Commercial banks can provide financing for foreign investment, and the BUILD Act requires private-sector support for projects before IDFC involvement. IDFC must develop safeguards to ensure its support complements private-sector efforts and adheres to international standards. The BUILD Act requires the IDFC to develop a performance measurement system to evaluate and monitor its projects, using OPIC's system as a starting point. The IDFC must also develop standards for measuring the development impact of projects and make this information available to the public. The IDFC is required to develop a performance measurement system to evaluate and monitor its projects, including standards for measuring development impact. Comparing development impacts across DFIs is challenging due to lack of harmonized indicators. Rigorous adherence to development objectives through a measurement system will be crucial for gauging effectiveness. Congress may consider U.S. contributions to regional and multilateral DFIs in assessing development impact. IDFC must submit an annual report to Congress assessing economic and social development impact, project compatibility with U.S. assistance programs, and project compliance with statutory requirements. The IDFC is required to maintain a publicly available database with project information and cooperate with USAID to engage with investors for strategic relationships. The CEO must submit reports to congressional committees before financial commitments and notify them after entering into new agreements. The IDFC is developing a strategic relationship with investors focused on blending finance models. The BUILD Act requires a reorganization plan to be submitted to Congress within 120 days, detailing the transfer of agencies, personnel, assets, and obligations to the IDFC. The plan is expected to be submitted by early February 2019, with consultation required with Congress before any modifications. The reorganization plan becomes effective for the IDFC on the specified date in the plan. The reorganization plan for the IDFC becomes effective on a specified date, not earlier than 90 days after submission to Congress. The transfer of functions can only occur after a report on coordination is submitted. The IDFC could be operational by summer 2019, with OPIC expected to be terminated by October 1, 2019. The IDFC is set to replace OPIC and other federal entities in promoting U.S. trade and investment. The Ex-Im Bank supports U.S. exports to create jobs, while the TDA connects U.S. businesses to overseas opportunities for economic growth. Questions have been raised about overlap between IDFC and TDA functions, but supporters of the BUILD Act argue that they serve different purposes. The BUILD Act supporters argue that the IDFC and TDA serve different purposes, with potential overlap in functions. The 116th Congress will oversee the implementation of the BUILD Act, including the reorganization plan and its impact on U.S. foreign policy objectives. The 116th Congress will oversee the implementation of the BUILD Act, evaluating if the Administration is meeting requirements and if the reorganization plan aligns with congressional intent. Key policy issues include balancing support for U.S. businesses with development goals, assessing capacity limits and policy parameters set by Congress, and identifying areas for potential legislative changes. Congress considered strategic foreign policy concerns when creating the BUILD Act. Development finance, such as the BUILD Act, is crucial for U.S. foreign policy and commercial opportunities. It can shape global connections and promote U.S. values. Congress should assess if the current framework addresses strategic concerns, especially regarding China's BRI. Consideration should be given to creating international rules for development finance to ensure alignment with U.S. interests. The need for international rules in development finance is crucial to ensure a level playing field for the International Development Finance Corporation (IDFC) and align with U.S. strategic interests. China's lack of adherence to existing rules raises questions on engaging them in new rule development. Congress should consider pressing the Administration on pursuing international rules for development finance."
