    "content": "El Salvador, a small Central American country with historical ties to the United States, has transitioned from authoritarian rule to a multiparty democracy after a civil war. The leftist FMLN guerrilla movement is now a political party, with the current president being a former FMLN commander. Governance, security, and economic challenges persist, reflecting deep scars and political polarization in the country. El Salvador continues to struggle with deep scars and political polarization stemming from a civil war that led to human rights violations, deaths, and emigration. Tension between political parties hinders efforts to address fiscal and security challenges, while corruption scandals have tainted both major parties. The leading presidential candidate is Nayib Bukele, running for the GANA party. This report examines political, economic, security, and human rights conditions in El Salvador, as well as issues in U.S.-Salvadoran relations. After the signing of peace accords in 1992, successive ARENA governments sought to rebuild democracy and implement economic reforms. ARENA was a reliable U.S. ally but failed to address inequality, violence, and corruption. Development indicators improved, but natural disasters hindered progress. Economic growth averaged 2.4% under ARENA's governance. The attorney general's office brought cases against two former ARENA presidents, including Francisco Flores who passed away while awaiting trial for embezzlement. Former president Tony Saca of El Salvador pled guilty to money laundering and embezzlement charges, serving a 10-year prison sentence. Former president Mauricio Funes faced allegations of embezzling over $350 million in state funds and received political asylum in Nicaragua in 2016. Critics pointed out Funes's lavish spending, unfair awarding of contracts, and conflicts with the private sector. Former president Mauricio Funes of El Salvador faced allegations of embezzling over $350 million in state funds and received political asylum in Nicaragua in 2016. Salvadoran officials seek to extradite him for involvement in a corruption scheme. President S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n, who took office in 2014, pledged to boost growth, invest in education and health care, combat crime, and promote trade, but has not fully implemented these promises. President S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n of El Salvador has struggled to fulfill his inaugural pledges due to fiscal constraints and lack of congressional support. Despite facing health challenges, he has not shown strong leadership and has low popularity. The country continues to face security issues, economic growth, and political polarization. A survey showed that 67.5% of people believe he has governed poorly. Opposition from the ARENA party has hindered his legislative agenda, except for public security and pension reform measures. In El Salvador, the ARENA party and its allies control a majority in the legislature, opposing tax hikes and new debt. Legislators are working to appoint new Supreme Court justices, impacting the constitutional chamber's decisions. The Attorney General's term is ending soon, requiring a decision on re-election. The S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n government in El Salvador has strengthened ties with Cuba and Venezuela, abandoned relations with Taiwan for China, and joined PetroCaribe for subsidized oil. Concerns have been raised about illicit ties between Venezuela's state oil company, its Salvadoran subsidiary, and FMLN politicians. In a surprising move, El Salvador established relations with China in August 2018. President S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n has traveled to Cuba for medical treatment and consultations, including a trip in October 2018 where a revised trade accord was announced. President S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n of El Salvador visited China in November 2018 to seek investment and trade. Nayib Bukele, a former mayor of San Salvador, leads in the polls for the upcoming presidential elections in February 2019. Despite joining the GANA party, Bukele maintains strong support, utilizing social media effectively. The upcoming presidential elections in El Salvador feature three main candidates: Nayib Bukele, Carlos Calleja, and Hugo M\u00e1rtinez. Both ARENA and the FMLN have lost support due to corruption scandals involving former presidents. El Salvador faces economic challenges with low growth rates and reliance on remittances. Natural disasters, such as flooding and drought, have impacted agricultural output in El Salvador. The country's low growth rates are attributed to a lack of public and private investment. Despite a stable economy, foreign direct investment in El Salvador has been below average due to political polarization, security challenges, and ineffective regulations. The Salvadoran government and legislature have clashed over responding to social and infrastructure needs and financing gaps. The government swaps short-term debt for longer-term debt instead of implementing fiscal reforms. The legislature is hesitant to approve multilateral financing requests for social programs. Long-standing government practices exacerbate fiscal issues. The IMF has credited El Salvador for taking steps to improve its fiscal situation since 2017, including a pension reform to ease financial burdens. The IMF urges raising the retirement age and targeting pension benefits to those in need. El Salvador implemented four economic reforms, moving up 22 spots in the World Bank's Doing Business report. Despite progress, the State Department highlights burdensome regulations. The State Department highlighted burdensome regulations, a \"contentious\" public-private sector relationship, insecurity, and lack of competitiveness as ongoing obstacles in El Salvador's business environment. Crime and violence are significant barriers to growth, with costs estimated at 5.9% of GDP. El Salvador ranks poorly in business costs due to crime and violence, particularly affecting small and medium-sized businesses. Extortion is a common crime reported, with 42% of such businesses being victims in the past year. Despite some progress in infrastructure and trade facilitation, challenges persist. El Salvador faces barriers to growth due to lack of competitiveness in export sectors, inadequate education and vocational training for the labor force, emigration of young Salvadorans, and logistical infrastructure deficiencies. The country's small size and high informality levels also contribute to reduced competitiveness. In August 2018, El Salvador joined a customs union with Guatemala. El Salvador's economic trajectory is influenced by joining a customs union with Guatemala and Honduras, launching a ferry to Costa Rica, and seeking trade with China. The decision to abandon relations with Taiwan has led to Chinese investment, but internal political opposition may hinder proposed economic legislation. Social development indicators in El Salvador are relatively better than in neighboring countries, with challenges in rural areas and a poverty rate of 33%. According to the U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (CEPAL), 33% of people in El Salvador live in poverty. A government report from 2015 showed that 35.2% of all households and 58.5% of rural households experience poverty-related deprivations. Key indicators of poverty include low education levels, lack of social security access, precarious employment, and lifestyle restrictions due to insecurity. Income inequality decreased by 5% from 2007 to 2016, with the poorest 20% benefiting from remittances. According to CEPAL, El Salvador reduced inequality by 1% annually from 2014 to 2016. Social development indicators improved from 2010 to 2017, but some health and education indicators worsened. Child mortality rate decreased, skilled health professionals attended most births, and underweight children decreased to 5%. However, immunization rates and primary school completion declined. USAID reports 300,000 youth aged 15 to 24 in El Salvador are not in school or employed due to gang-related intimidation. In El Salvador, many youth aged 15 to 24 neither work nor attend school due to gang-related intimidation and insecurity. Food insecurity, caused by natural disasters, drives emigration. Families left behind face debts to smugglers, increased work burden, and emotional trauma. The government reported $37 million in crop damage and 77,000 affected families due to drought in 2018. Homicides and crime by gangs and drug traffickers have been escalating for over a decade. El Salvador has been plagued by high homicide rates, with 104 per 100,000 in 2015, decreasing to 60 per 100,000 in 2017. The country also faces issues like targeted killings of security forces by gangs, femicides, and a high number of disappeared persons. Gangs are a significant factor in the high homicide rates, with El Salvador having the highest concentration of gang members per capita in Central America. Gangs in El Salvador, including MS-13 and 18th Street gang, are responsible for a high percentage of homicides. The government-facilitated truce that unraveled in 2014 strengthened the gangs. They are involved in various criminal activities like extortion and money laundering. Gang-related violence has led to internal displacement and irregular emigration, with deportees being targeted for extortion and violence. Gangs do not play a major role in transnational drug trafficking or human smuggling. In 2017, El Salvador saw 296,000 new internally displaced persons due to gang activity, the highest in Latin America. The government struggles to address the needs of those fleeing violence. Drug-trafficking organizations, including the Sinaloa criminal organization, have increased illicit activities in the country. Governance issues have made the criminal justice system vulnerable to criminal influence, hindering citizen security in many areas. Resource constraints in the security sector have hindered anti-crime efforts in El Salvador, leading to a lack of confidence in the underfunded police. Many companies and citizens have turned to private security firms, and the government has deployed soldiers for public security functions. Corruption concerns have been raised in various institutions, including the police, prisons, and judicial system. Despite efforts by the attorney general's office and the Supreme Court, El Salvador's ranking in Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index fell in 2017. The PNC in El Salvador faces challenges with deficient wages, training, and infrastructure, as well as a lack of merit-based promotion system. Corruption and weak investigatory capacity hinder police performance, leading to a criminal conviction rate of less than 5%. Despite government efforts to dismiss and prosecute officials for abuses, impunity persists due to inefficiency and corruption in the judiciary. International observers have praised the Probity Section of the Supreme Court for identifying officials involved in illicit enrichment. Attorney General Mel\u00e9ndez has pursued cases against politicians, security forces, and gang affiliates, securing convictions for aggravated homicides and corruption. Despite setbacks in some cases, Mel\u00e9ndez continues to make progress in prosecuting individuals involved in criminal activities. Attorney General Mel\u00e9ndez faces criticism and death threats for pursuing corruption cases against high-profile figures. President S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n vetoed a reform granting independence to the attorney general's office. The Salvadoran legislature may appoint a replacement in January 2019. Prison reform is needed due to severe overcrowding from past anti-gang sweeps. Efforts to address severe prison overcrowding in El Salvador have led to increased capacity but prisons still operate at over 300% above capacity. The government has taken steps such as ordering regular health ministry visits to prisons and implementing rehabilitation programs with U.S. support. However, human rights groups argue that conditions have worsened, especially for gang inmates, since the adoption of more restrictive measures in 2016. The government of El Salvador implemented the Secure El Salvador plan with support from the U.S. and the United Nations, costing $2 billion over five years. The plan focuses on violence prevention, job creation, increased state presence in violent municipalities, improved prison infrastructure, and services for crime victims. Despite reported reductions in homicide rates and extortions, citizens and analysts remain skeptical. Despite reported reductions in homicide rates and extortions in El Salvador, citizens and analysts remain wary of the government's security measures. Many doubt the reliability of official figures and question the focus on security forces over economic activities and education. The government's \"extraordinary measures\" to combat gangs have faced criticism, with concerns about human rights abuses and corruption in the judicial system. In 2017 and 2018, Salvadorans doubted the effectiveness of extraordinary measures on crime levels, despite political support. The National Assembly made these measures permanent in August 2018, claiming they reduced communication between inmates and outside, but concerns were raised about inmates' rights and health. El Salvador has deployed military troops for public security, with the Supreme Court upholding these measures in April 2014. In April 2014, the Salvadoran Supreme Court upheld former president Funes's decree authorizing the military to carry out police functions. Military and police forces were deployed to control gang violence, including the creation of the El Salvador Special Reaction Force in 2016. A tri-national anti-gang force was launched in November 2016. Approximately 8,000 of El Salvador's armed forces personnel are involved in public security. Violence and human rights abuses have been prevalent in El Salvador's history, including mass atrocities during the civil war. Mass atrocities during El Salvador's civil war (1980-1992) are now being investigated after the 1993 amnesty law was overturned in July 2016. Current human rights abuses in El Salvador include gender violence, gang activity, police brutality, and corruption. The government faces challenges due to limited resources, political divisions, and corruption. Journalists and NGOs reporting on corruption, police misconduct, and criminal activities face harassment. Human rights defenders, like transgender advocate Karla Avelar, also face extortion and attacks. In El Salvador, indigenous rights and land conflicts are not as common as in neighboring countries due to the small Amerindian population. Despite a 2014 constitutional amendment recognizing indigenous rights, there are no laws ensuring their benefits from natural resource development on their historical land. However, El Salvador has banned all metal mining to protect communities' water sources. Women, children, and LGBTI individuals are often targets of gang violence, with different initiations for men and women. Female gang members are often forced to have sex with multiple members. In El Salvador, gang-related violence targets women and children, leading to femicides and other forms of abuse. Gang members enforce loyalty through violence, including murder for infidelity. Non-gang-affiliated individuals are also at risk, especially those who refuse to cooperate with gangs or have ties to law enforcement. The impact of gang harassment has led to thousands of youth dropping out of school. In 2017, charges were filed against gang members for murdering transgender individuals. This violence is part of a broader issue of violence in El Salvador, with high rates of femicide and other forms of abuse. In El Salvador, femicide rates are the highest in the world, with 551 women killed in 2017. The country has a total ban on abortion, leading to women being imprisoned for miscarriages deemed illegal abortions. Human rights groups warn of abuses by security forces due to aggressive anti-gang policies. Authorities have arrested police and soldiers for involvement in murders, with evidence of death squads within the police. Salvadoran officials downplayed these developments in 2017. In 2018, El Salvador's attorney general convicted four police officers for aggravated homicide and six others for participating in a death squad. Amnesty International lamented the lack of justice for crimes from the war in El Salvador. President Funes created a program for reparations in 2013, but its funding and reach remain unclear. President S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n launched a commission in 2017 to help find missing family members. A commission has been established to help families find out what happened to their missing relatives, modeled after a national search commission. To be successful, the commission will need access to Salvadoran military records and classified U.S. documents to corroborate information from survivor testimonies. After the Supreme Court overturned the 1993 Amnesty Law, Attorney General Mel\u00e9ndez formed a group of prosecutors to investigate past crimes with technical assistance funded by USAID. This group is also supporting civil society organizations in investigating historic crimes. In 2017, a Salvadoran judge reopened the case of Archbishop Oscar Romero's assassination and issued a warrant for the arrest of a former military officer suspected of the killing. The case against the intellectual authors of the 1989 murders of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper, and her daughter has also been reopened. Private human rights attorneys are pursuing a case against 18 military officers involved in the El Mozote massacre in 1981, but face challenges with the military withholding historical records. The military in El Salvador is withholding historical records on its operations, hindering the progress of cases related to human rights abuses during the war. Despite a judge's commitment to hearing survivors' testimonies, skepticism remains about the resolution of emblematic cases. Political actors may prefer to avoid scrutiny of past crimes, as seen in a case filed against President S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n for alleged kidnappings. U.S. relations with El Salvador have remained friendly, but recent changes in immigration policies have raised concerns. The U.S. immigration policies, including the termination of Temporary Protected Status for Salvadorans and threats to cut foreign assistance, have strained relations with El Salvador. Issues such as combating gangs, addressing migration and security concerns, and the Salvadoran government's diplomatic relations with China are key topics on the bilateral agenda. Congress plays a crucial role in overseeing aid to El Salvador and monitoring progress on investment climate, gang violence, emigration prevention, and corruption. The United States has provided significant foreign assistance to El Salvador, focusing on regional security, economic development, and trade agreements. Assistance is guided by the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America, aimed at addressing issues such as combating gangs, preventing emigration, and combating corruption. The U.S. has allocated over $2.1 billion for the Strategy for Engagement in Central America since FY2016, with $341.7 million designated for El Salvador. Aid is contingent on the Salvadoran government meeting legislative conditions related to border security, corruption, and human rights abuses. Certification for meeting these conditions varied in FY2016, FY2017, and FY2018. El Salvador has received regional security assistance through the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI), with over $2.1 billion allocated from FY2008 to FY2018. The Trump Administration aims to focus on combating transnational crime, drug trafficking, deterring illegal immigration, and encouraging private investment in the region. The FY2019 foreign aid budget request includes $45.7 million in bilateral assistance for El Salvador. The FY2019 foreign aid budget request includes $45.7 million in bilateral assistance for El Salvador, with funding for small businesses, education, and out-of-school youth. The Administration also proposed $263.2 million for CARSI, but it is unclear how much would be allocated to El Salvador. The Senate and House Appropriations Committees reported their respective FY2019 Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs appropriations measures. The Senate and House Appropriations Committees reported their respective FY2019 Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs appropriations measures. The Senate committee bill would provide $47.7 million for El Salvador and $254.7 million for CARSI, while the House bill would provide up to $595 million for the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America. A continuing resolution signed by President Trump on September 28, 2018, continues to provide assistance at the FY2018 level until December 7, 2018. El Salvador signed a second $277 million compact in 2014 for transportation infrastructure, employment opportunities, and the investment climate. The Salvadoran government committed to match a $277 million contribution with $88 million in complementary investments for key compact projects. These projects include the Investment Climate Project, Human Capital Project, and Logistical Infrastructure Project aimed at regulatory improvements, education reforms, and infrastructure development. The Salvadoran government designed a Priority Action Plan to address concerns before signing the compact, including appointing officials to a financial crimes unit, approving asset forfeiture and anti-money-laundering laws, reforming public-private partnership laws, and revising seed procurement regulations. The compact came into force in September 2015. Migration is a major issue in U.S. relations with El Salvador. As of 2016, 1.4 million Salvadorans resided in the United States, with 50% being unauthorized. Remittances from Salvadorans abroad contributed close to 20% of El Salvador's GDP in 2017. Unauthorized migration from El Salvador is driven by poverty, natural disasters, poor security, and a desire for family reunification. Migration from El Salvador to the United States is driven by poverty, natural disasters, poor security, and a desire for family reunification. The profile of migrants apprehended on the southwest border has changed, with increasing arrivals of unaccompanied minors and family units from El Salvador and neighboring Guatemala and Honduras. Record apprehensions of families seeking asylum have occurred during a period of historic low overall apprehensions at the border. Salvadoran officials attribute the decline in illegal emigration to recent successes in reducing crime rates. In FY2016, U.S. apprehensions of unauthorized family units and unaccompanied child migrants from El Salvador peaked before declining in FY2017 and FY2018. The number of apprehensions from El Salvador decreased while trends for Guatemala and Honduras differed. El Salvador has been acknowledged for its efforts to combat human trafficking, with a tier two ranking since 2008. In 2017, El Salvador investigated cases of trafficking, convicted traffickers, and provided services for victims. In August 2018, the State Department certified that El Salvador had met conditions related to combating human trafficking. The Salvadoran government has tried 43 cases related to human trafficking or alien smuggling in 2018, with 28 individuals convicted. 18,830 Salvadorans were deported from the United States in FY2017, making El Salvador the fourth-largest recipient of deportees. Officials have concerns about the country's ability to absorb deportees due to difficulties in finding employment. El Salvador struggles with reintegrating deportees, facing limited services at the municipal level. Concerns arose after the termination of TPS for Salvadorans in 2018. The government hopes for U.S. legislation to protect its 200,000 nationals at risk. The Salvadoran government is preparing to assist its nationals with the end of TPS protection, including reintegration assistance and consular services for U.S. citizen children of TPS beneficiaries. They are also concerned about the future of young Salvadorans protected from deportation. The DACA initiative, which protects Salvadoran beneficiaries from deportation, is facing uncertainty as lawsuits are ongoing to preserve or terminate it. Additionally, a zero-tolerance policy towards illegal border crossing led to the separation of up to 3,000 children from their parents, including those from El Salvador. The Trump Administration's changes to U.S. asylum programs have impacted Salvadorans, including the termination of the Central American Minors program. Attorney General Sessions' decision in June 2018 further restricts asylum eligibility for victims of gang violence or domestic abuse. President Trump's proclamation restricts Central American migrants from seeking asylum between ports of entry on the U.S. southwest border. El Salvador is included in the list of major drug-producing or drug-transit countries, despite not being a producer of illicit drugs. In 2016, Salvadoran officials seized 12.3 metric tons of cocaine, four times more than in 2015, denying $203.4 million in illicit revenue to crime groups. Drug seizures decreased in 2017 due to anti-gang efforts, but successful maritime operations pushed drug smugglers out of Salvadoran waters. El Salvador needs to maintain funding for security forces and combat corruption for successful antidrug efforts. Members of Congress asked the Treasury Department to consider sanctions against Jos\u00e9 Luis Merino, a high-ranking FMLN party official. Merino, a high-ranking FMLN party official and deputy minister of foreign affairs, is under U.S. sanctions for alleged ties to drug traffickers and guerrillas. Members of Congress have requested investigations into his possible involvement in corruption. U.S. agencies have been collaborating with El Salvador and other Central American governments on gang issues for over a decade. The U.S. Strategy to Combat Criminal Gangs from Central America and Mexico focuses on diplomacy, repatriation, law enforcement, capacity enhancement, and prevention. Congress allocated nearly $50 million between FY2008 and FY2016 for anti-gang efforts in northern triangle countries. U.S. funds support vetted police units targeting transnational gang cases, resulting in criminal charges against thousands of MS-13 members. Efforts include an electronic monitoring center in San Salvador and targeting MS-13 financing. The State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) has sponsored programs to prevent kids from joining gangs and improve police-community relations through model police precincts and police-run athletic leagues. These initiatives have been integrated with USAID prevention programs in municipalities targeted by the Salvadoran government's Plan Secure El Salvador. The U.S. supports anti-gang efforts in El Salvador by providing equipment to the police internal affairs unit investigating abuses. Some officers are facing homicide charges. However, U.S. police training programs lack consistent human rights objectives. USAID uses funds for crime prevention programs, including creating safe spaces for families in communities. The U.S. supports anti-gang efforts in El Salvador by providing equipment to the police internal affairs unit investigating abuses. USAID funds crime prevention programs, including creating safe spaces for families and young people, identifying at-risk youth for behavior-change counseling, and reintegrating juvenile offenders into society. USAID programs have complemented the government's Plan Secure El Salvador efforts in reducing violence by 61% in the 50 most violent municipalities. In December 2004, El Salvador signed the CAFTA-DR trade agreement and implemented it on March 1, 2006. The United States is El Salvador's main trading partner, with Salvadoran exports to the U.S. totaling $2.6 billion in 2017, including apparel, electrical equipment, sugar, and coffee. Violence has decreased by 61% in municipalities where USAID works, compared to 42% nationally. In 2017, El Salvador exported $2.6 billion worth of goods to the United States, including apparel, electrical equipment, sugar, and coffee. The United States imported $3.9 billion worth of goods from El Salvador, such as fuel oil, electrical machinery, nuclear reactors, plastics, and vehicles. The United States had a $1.3 billion trade surplus with El Salvador in 2017. The Trump Administration sought to modernize trade agreements with Latin American countries, including CAFTA-DR. Former Salvadoran military leaders residing in the United States have faced judicial challenges due to an amnesty law in El Salvador. In recent years, former Salvadoran military leaders in the United States have faced judicial proceedings over their immigration statuses. The Human Rights Violators and War Crimes Unit of ICE has investigated past human rights violations in El Salvador. Former Defense Minister Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova was deported in 2015 for ordering torture and killings. Colonel Inocente Orlando Montano pleaded guilty in 2012 for his role in the Jesuit murders. In recent years, former Salvadoran military leaders in the United States have faced judicial proceedings over their immigration statuses. Orlando Montano, responsible for Jesuit murders, pled guilty to immigration fraud and was extradited to Spain. General Jos\u00e9 Guillermo Garc\u00eda was deported for his role in human rights violations. In 2016, a civil lawsuit was filed against Arnoldo Antonio Vasquez for misrepresenting his past to obtain U.S. citizenship. He failed to disclose his involvement in the killing of 10 civilians in El Salvador in 1988. The judge has not yet ruled on the case."
