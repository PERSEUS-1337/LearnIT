The theory behind generative models is catching up with their practical success. It has been shown that neural networks can approximate any data manifold well, with the ability to map the latent space onto a specified distance from the desired data manifold. Similar theorems have been proven for multiclass and cycle generative models. Generative models, such as GANs, are used for tasks like image synthesis and domain adaptation. The theory behind these models is not well understood, with open questions remaining. A geometric approach is adopted to analyze how generator networks map the latent space to the data manifold. The Manifold Hypothesis assumes data comes from a specific data manifold, and the goal is for the generator to reproduce this manifold as closely as possible. The text discusses using feedforward neural networks to generate data manifolds closely resembling a target data manifold, with a focus on the Hausdorff distance metric. The goal is to approximate any compact manifold using neural networks, combining Riemannian geometry with neural network properties to achieve this. In this work, neural networks are used to approximate data manifolds, including multiclass datasets and cycle generative models. The focus is on theoretical analysis and practical applications, showing that smoothness is not necessary for the results to hold. The approach can map one manifold onto another using approximately invertible mappings. Neural networks, including GANs, are studied for their generative capabilities and convergence properties. Various types of neural networks, such as deep wide networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks, are proven to be universal approximators. Research also focuses on the relationship between dataset characteristics and GAN behavior for better convergence. In (Lucic et al., 2018) and (Khayatkhoei et al., 2018), synthetic datasets and disconnected data manifolds were analyzed. A metric for GAN quality based on geometric properties of datasets was proposed in (Khrulkov & Oseledets, 2018). Data manifolds are assumed to be smooth, orientable, compact, and connected in this work. The text discusses smooth manifolds embedded in a Euclidean space with a Riemannian metric tensor. It introduces the C-norm for functions and the 2-norm for vectors, as well as a geometric measure on manifolds. The exponential map is highlighted as an important construction in the proof. The exponential map is a key construction in the proof for Riemannian manifolds. Geodesics are locally length minimizing curves, with the length of the velocity vector preserved along the curve. The exponential map defines the point reached by following a geodesic from a given point with a tangent vector. It is globally defined for geodesically complete manifolds. Theorem 4.1 (Hopf-Rinow) states that a connected Riemannian manifold is complete, compact, and geodesically complete. This implies that any compact connected manifold is geodesically complete. The Hausdorff distance between sets in R^n is used, and neural networks are relied upon for function approximation. Theorem 4.2 discusses universal approximation by neural networks. Theorem 4.2 and Theorem 4.3 discuss the universal approximation by neural networks, including fully connected networks with different activation functions and depths. Piecewise linear functions can be represented by ReLU DNNs with limited depth, allowing for the approximation of continuous functions. In this section, it is shown that a neural network can map the cube I d approximately onto an arbitrary manifold M \u2282 R n, which is a compact connected d-dimensional manifold. This result is based on Lemma 5.1 and provides insight into generative mappings. The analysis extends to non-compact latent space R d and can be generalized further in subsequent sections. Lemma 5.1 states that for a compact connected d-dimensional manifold M \u2282 R^n, there exists a smooth map that is surjective. The proof involves constructing this map explicitly by considering geodesically complete properties of M and applying the Hopf-Rinow theorem. By choosing a compact subset of T_qM, the map can be shown to be surjective. The manifold's finite diameter ensures the existence of minimizing geodesics connecting points within a certain distance, supporting the surjectivity of the map. The proof of Lemma 5.1 involves constructing a smooth surjective map for a compact connected d-dimensional manifold M. By considering geodesically complete properties and the Hopf-Rinow theorem, a compact subset of T_qM is chosen to show surjectivity. The manifold's finite diameter ensures the existence of minimizing geodesics, supporting the map's surjectivity. Theorem 5.1 states the geometric universality of generative models on a compact connected d-dimensional manifold M with universal nonlinearities like ReLU. The proof involves constructing a neural network f \u03b8 (z) that satisfies f \u2212 f \u03b8 I d < \u03b5. Brown's mapping theorem extends Theorem 5.1 to include topological data manifolds, with Corollary 5.1 stating its applicability to any compact connected topological manifold. Spaces of natural images of shape H \u00d7 W \u00d7 C are closed subsets of I HW C, making them compact. Manifolds representing single-class datasets are hypothesized to be connected, while multiclass manifolds may require small \"tunnels\" in latent space to connect disjoint data manifolds. Theorem 5.2 discusses geometric universality for multiclass data manifolds, stating that neural networks can approximate any given manifold with certain properties. The focus is on practical networks with fully connected and convolutional layers, aiming to show the structure of the set M\u03b8 for these networks. The text discusses the structure of neural networks with fully connected and convolutional layers, showing that under certain conditions, the generated set M\u03b8 will be diffeomorphic to the open unit cube. It also explores smooth embeddings and their properties in relation to manifold transformations. The text analyzes neural networks with fully connected and convolutional layers, demonstrating that they are smooth embeddings. It assumes circular padding for convolutions on a two-dimensional torus. The nonlinearity function is smooth and monotonous. The latent space is considered to be Euclidean space. The text discusses smooth embeddings in neural networks with fully connected and convolutional layers. It assumes the latent space is the Euclidean space and analyzes the properties of these layers. The text discusses expanding convolutional layers in neural networks, focusing on the injectivity of the layer for all cases except for a set of measure zero. It analyzes the matrix representing the linear map in Conv operations and the importance of full rank matrices for these layers. The text discusses the importance of full rank matrices in convolutional layers of neural networks, showing that the set of singular matrices is algebraic. It concludes that either the set has Lebesgue measure zero or it equals the space of all matrices, providing a concrete example to demonstrate the former. The text discusses the structure of weight matrices in convolutional layers of neural networks, showing that matrices are of full rank. It extends the results to arbitrary latent spaces sampled from manifolds in R^d. The text discusses the structure of weight matrices in convolutional layers of neural networks, showing that matrices are of full rank. It extends the results to arbitrary latent spaces sampled from manifolds in R^d. An arbitrary smooth embedding f : M \u2192 N preserves smoothness when applied to a smooth embedded submanifold S \u2282 M. Theorem 6.1 states that for expanding neural network architectures, most parameter values result in smooth embedded manifolds M\u03b8, making it challenging to approximate complex data manifolds with simple topological properties using only expanding architectures. Expanding architectures are successful in practice, but it is challenging to approximate arbitrary data manifolds with latent space being R^d. It is hypothesized that it may be possible to approximate compact data manifolds using expanding networks. Models for unsupervised image to image translation learn mappings between data manifolds M and N using neural networks f\u03b8(x) and g\u03c6(y) as diffeomorphisms. Based on the hypothesis that expanding networks can approximate compact data manifolds, neural networks f and g are used as diffeomorphisms to map between manifolds M and N. Lemmas ensure the existence of functions that approximately map M to N and N to M for smooth data manifolds. Theorems suggest that while exact mappings may not exist for manifolds with different topological properties, desired properties can be approximated. The main result on cycle generative models states that for compact connected manifolds M and N of the same dimension, there exist compact subsets M\u03b4 \u2282 M and N\u03b4 \u2282 N such that M\u03b4 is diffeomorphic to N\u03b4. This result is achieved using universal nonlinearities and feedforward neural networks with activation functions. The Whitney extension theorem allows for the smooth extension of neural networks f and g to the entire cube I^n. By constructing feedforward neural networks f\u03b8(x) and g\u03c6(y) on the unit cube I^n, the theorem is proven. These networks translate data from M\u03b4 to approximately N\u03b4, explaining the success of cyclic models. In this work, the success of cyclic models is discussed, with a hypothesis that modeling visually similar images may be easier than arbitrary manifolds. Results show neural networks can approximate arbitrary manifolds, but do not specify network size estimation. There is a suggestion of a connection between geometrical properties of a manifold and neural network success. The connection between geometrical properties of a manifold and the width/depth of a neural network required is explored. Theorem 5.2 discusses geometric universality for multiclass manifolds, showing that fully connected neural networks can approximate these manifolds with specific properties. Future research may analyze this relation using popular datasets in computer vision. The proof involves constructing a global continuous map by applying the universal approximation theorem to a function created using Lemma 5.2. Additionally, Lemma 6.3 states that a smooth embedding remains smooth when restricted to a submanifold. The proof involves constructing a global continuous map by applying the universal approximation theorem to a function created using Lemma 5.2. Additionally, Lemma 6.3 states that a smooth embedding remains smooth when restricted to a submanifold. In this section, we discuss generalizing results to the case of the latent variable z sampled from R d instead of I d, dealing with approximating functions on a noncompact space. Theorem B.1 provides formulas for activation functions for which the results hold."
