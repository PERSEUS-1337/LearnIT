    "content": "The Federal Milk Marketing Order (FMMO) system was established in the 1930s to help farmers facing low milk prices by setting minimum prices for producers. Before FMMOs, milk dealers controlled prices, leading to unfair practices due to their market power. Producer cooperatives formed to develop alternative pricing methods. FMMOs aimed to level the playing field by giving some market power back to milk producers. Federal milk marketing policy aims to return market power to milk producers by addressing unique market conditions such as perishability, continuous production, limited storage capacity, and seasonality patterns. This puts producers at a disadvantage in bargaining with buyers. The dairy industry experiences seasonal fluctuations in milk production and demand. Milk demand peaks in the fall and winter months but declines in the spring and summer. Excess milk is processed into products like butter, cheese, and yogurt. Dairy farms have high fixed costs due to investments in infrastructure and cattle. It takes nearly two years for a calf to mature and start generating revenue. Milk producers face challenges in the market due to high costs and price volatility. Fluctuations in milk prices can lead to market instability, driving producers out and compromising supply for consumers. Federal Milk Marketing Orders (FMMOs) aim to stabilize market conditions by ensuring fair prices for producers and consistent supply for consumers. Federal Milk Marketing Orders (FMMOs) were established in the 1930s to set minimum prices for milk and ensure a stable supply for consumers. FMMOs are not subject to periodic reauthorization and were most recently revised in 1996 under the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act. The Federal Milk Marketing Orders (FMMOs) were reformed by the USDA to reduce the number of orders from 31 to 10-14 by April 4, 1999. A proposed rule was published in January 1998 for public comment on changes to the order system, including pricing and classification of milk. The final rule was issued on December 17, 1999, and took effect on January 1, 2000. FMMOs are established and amended through a public hearing process overseen by the USDA's Dairy Program. The Federal Milk Marketing Orders (FMMOs) are overseen by the USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) to promote orderly marketing conditions in fluid milk markets, improve dairy farmers' income, supervise trade terms between producers and processors, and ensure consumers have access to quality milk at reasonable prices. FMMOs also provide comprehensive statistics on milk markets for evaluation by USDA and dairy economists. Minimum prices are formula-based and determined to achieve these objectives. The Federal Milk Marketing Orders (FMMOs) regulate milk pricing based on milk components and market conditions. There are federal and state orders, with 10 FMMOs currently in operation. Some states have their own separate orders, with California having the largest. Price regulation of milk varies by state, with some covered by federal orders, some by state orders, and some with no regulation. State orders regulate milk prices received by producers for fluid milk, with some states also regulating wholesale and/or retail prices. In states with both federal and state orders, unique marketing conditions may lead to additional pricing premiums. Handlers, such as distributing plants, supply plants, and dairy cooperatives, purchase milk from producers for processing or manufacturing dairy products. Dairy cooperatives process fluid milk or dairy products and may pay their members as determined by the cooperative. They are not required to pay FMMO minimum prices but their milk is classified and pooled like other handlers. Handlers qualify for full or partial regulation based on sales volume and other criteria. Fully regulated plants distribute most of their milk in a marketing area, while partially regulated plants do not meet certain criteria. Producer-handlers may be exempt from marketing order pool obligations. Federal orders play a critical role in regulating milk prices. Federal orders regulate the price paid to milk producers by handlers of Grade A milk, which makes up 99% of total U.S. milk production. In 2015, 61% of U.S. milk production was pooled under FMMOs, with the remaining regulated by state marketing orders. Grade B milk, accounting for 1% of production, is not regulated by FMMOs. Milk handlers must pay minimum prices for Grade A milk from producers within the FMMO, but are free to purchase milk from any producer. Handlers in the FMMO system can buy milk from any producer and sell it at any price in any market. They report milk receipts and usage, maintaining records for USDA audits. The system ensures fair treatment for all handlers, without regulating producers or setting prices. Milk marketing orders require handlers to pay minimum prices for Grade A fluid milk, but do not dictate whom to buy from, whom to sell to, how much to buy or sell, or at what price to sell. The FMMO system requires handlers to pay minimum prices for Grade A fluid milk using classified end-use pricing and milk pooling mechanisms. All milk producers within an order receive a \"uniform\" price based on the weighted share of all end uses of milk. The pricing system, implemented in January 2000, classifies milk into four classes based on end use, with handlers paying producers based on pounds of milk marketed. Classified pricing in the Federal Milk Marketing Order system categorizes milk into four classes based on end use: Class I for fluid milk, Class II for soft products, Class III for hard cheeses, and Class IV for butter and dry products. Class I milk receives the highest minimum price to ensure sufficient supply and encourage movement from surplus to deficit areas. This system aims to protect milk producers from price reductions and prevent surplus milk from depressing prices for dairy farmers. The USDA determines minimum prices for milk classes based on milk components like butterfat and protein to protect milk producers from price reductions during surplus episodes. Prices fluctuate based on market conditions and include processing costs. Milk classes are priced per hundredweight basis and consist of skim milk and butterfat components. The USDA determines minimum milk prices based on components like butterfat and protein to protect producers. Milk classes are priced per hundredweight and consist of skim milk and butterfat. Appendix A contains USDA formulas for computing milk components and class prices. Class I and II prices are calculated differently than Class III and IV prices. AMS announces pricing factors for Class III and IV skim milk and butterfat used to compute the base Class I price. The advanced pricing factors are based on wholesale prices and a two-week weighted average. The Class I pricing factors determine the actual Class I price in each FMMO, with variations in different regions. Class II milk is priced using the advanced Class IV skim milk pricing factor, with an additional $0.70 per cwt to encourage milk movement. The Class II milk price is determined using the full month butterfat price, with an additional $0.70 per cwt to incentivize milk movement. Class III and Class IV milk prices are based on market wholesale prices of four dairy products surveyed by the USDA weekly. AMS calculates monthly prices from the weighted average of these surveyed sales. At the end of each month, AMS calculates Class III and Class IV prices by deducting a fixed make allowance and applying a yield factor to wholesale product prices. These prices are used by all FMMOs to determine the prices paid to milk producers. The process of determining monthly milk prices for producers spans over three months, including the months before and after the pricing month. In August 2017, AMS announced advanced prices and pricing factors for Class I and II milk on July 19. The announcement included base Class I price and Class II skim milk price. Class II, Class III, and Class IV prices were announced on August 30. Each FMMO calculated the uniform price for August based on milk receipts and end-use data. The USDA FMMO milk market administrator released the uniform price for the order by the fifth of the following month. The FMMO regulations require handlers to pay milk producers a partial payment during the specific price month and a final payment after uniform prices are computed. Milk producers received partial payments in the third week of August and the final payment in September. Milk handlers are obligated to report milk receipts and end use by class to the FMMO market administrator for pooling of milk. Total value of pooled milk receipts is the producer-settlement fund. The marketing order's producer-settlement fund is funded by handlers each month, with some paying in and others withdrawing. Each market administrator announces a uniform price for the month, with handlers paying milk producers based on a weighted average of class prices. However, the uniform price paid to milk producers varies across the 10 FMMOs. Four of the marketing orders pay based on skim and butterfat values, calculated through classified formulas. Milk producers are paid based on the pounds of skim milk and butterfat delivered to the marketing pool. For example, in the Southeast Order in August 2017, the uniform skim milk price was $9.83 per cwt, and the uniform butterfat price was $3.0111 per pound. In the component system, milk producers are paid a uniform price equal to the Class III price plus a producer price differential (PPD). The PPD is calculated by subtracting the value of cheese components from the value of all pooled milk, then dividing by the volume of pooled milk to get a per cwt PPD. This PPD is added to the Class III price to determine the uniform price paid to producers. Adjustments may also affect the final uniform price received by producers. Adjustments such as somatic cell count (SCC) and producer location affect the uniform price received by milk producers. Handlers in Federal Milk Marketing Orders (FMMOs) adjust the Class I differential based on their location. Transportation adjustments may be made for milk shipped between supply and distribution plants. Milk handlers contribute or withdraw money from the producer-settlement fund based on the class of milk they handle. The producer-settlement fund in the Federal Milk Marketing Orders (FMMOs) allows handlers to adjust the uniform price paid to milk producers. Handlers pay a blend price of $17.00 per cwt, equalizing the price for different classes of milk. The USDA administers the FMMOs, with milk market administrators overseeing each order. Federal costs are covered by assessments on handlers, not exceeding $0.05 per cwt. The USDA administers the Federal Milk Marketing Orders (FMMOs) with assessment rates not exceeding $0.05 per cwt on handlers. Milk market administrators are responsible for testing milk components, establishing market-wide values, auditing handler records, and publishing dairy market information. The dairy industry also plays a significant role in the rule development process for FMMOs. The USDA administers Federal Milk Marketing Orders (FMMOs) with assessment rates not exceeding $0.05 per cwt on handlers. Rules for FMMOs must be approved by milk producers through a referendum or bloc voting of dairy farmer cooperatives. Congress can address FMMO issues through legislation. AMS establishes and amends FMMOs through a public hearing process where interested parties present evidence on marketing and economic conditions. Dairy producers initiate or amend orders by petitioning the Secretary of Agriculture, with at least two-thirds of affected producers needing to approve the proposed order through a referendum. Once established, an order regulates all handlers or processors of fluid milk products in the specified marketing area. Some dairy stakeholders have concerns about how AMS prices milk under federal orders and the ability of fluid milk processors to manage risk. California producers are in the process of joining the FMMO system, which could increase milk production under federal orders. Organic dairy producers are worried about how FMMO pooling applies to organic milk handlers. Dairy producers raised concerns about FMMO pooling for organic milk. Congress authorized the Dairy Forward Contract Pilot Program in 1999 for risk management. The program allowed non-cooperative producers to forward contract with handlers exempt from FMMO prices. Class II, III, and IV milk could be included, but not Class I. The program expired in 2004, and the Dairy Forward Pricing Program was established in 2008. The Dairy Forward Contract Pilot Program (DFPP) was established in 1999 for risk management, allowing non-cooperative producers to forward contract with handlers exempt from FMMO prices. It was reauthorized multiple times, with the latest extension through September 30, 2018. A USDA report found that the pilot program effectively reduced price volatility but did not result in higher average payment prices for milk. About 4% of eligible producers participated in the program, pricing 5.3% of eligible milk under forward contracts. During the study period, an average of 25 plants received forward contracted milk monthly, with low participation rates in the Dairy Forward Contract Pilot Program (DFPP). Only approximately 2% to 3% of producers not in cooperatives used forward contracts, according to testimony from the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) in March 2017. The Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) urged Congress to make the DFPP permanent in the next farm bill to eliminate uncertainty for forward contract users. They also recommended expanding the program to include Class I milk. The National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF) supported extending the DFPP but was hesitant about including Class I milk due to concerns about its impact on milk price computations. Opponents of forward contracting for Class I milk argue that it could undermine FMMO minimum pricing. Some Class I milk processors use cross-hedging with Class III and Class IV futures contracts to manage price risk in fluid milk. Analysts believe that advanced pricing factors in FMMO compromise the effectiveness of cross-hedging due to the two-week gap between setting Class I prices and CME settlement of Class III and IV contracts, leading to basis risk. The NMPF and IDFA have proposed changing the way USDA calculates the Class I advanced price to reduce basis risk in cross-hedging with Class III and Class IV futures contracts. The proposal suggests using the average of the advanced Class III and Class IV pricing factors, plus an additional $0.74 per cwt, to align Class I prices better with futures contracts. This change could significantly reduce basis risk on CME contracts to about $0.02 per cwt. Supporters of the proposed change argue that it would create opportunities for milk processors and food companies to manage price risk more effectively. Opponents are concerned that the change would bypass the FMMO hearing process, potentially impacting the Class I milk price. Dairy producers in California petitioned USDA in 2015 for a federal milk marketing order due to concerns about the state order's administration by CDFA. The Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) administers the state order causing disorderly marketing in California. Congress authorized a California FMMO in the 1996 farm bill, allowing California to maintain the state order milk quota. The 2014 farm bill amended the provision on California orders to require regular rulemaking. California's state order and FMMOs differ in milk classes, pricing, and quota systems. USDA may need to address these differences if California joins the federal order system. Dairy producers petitioned USDA in 2015 for a federal milk marketing order. The petitioning California dairy producers argue that the California milk pricing system undervalues whey, resulting in lower minimum prices for producers compared to the national values. They claim that this discrepancy has cost dairy farmers $1.5 billion from 2010 to 2014. The producers are requesting California to enter the Federal Milk Marketing Order system while preserving the state's milk quota system. The milk quota system in California was established in 1969 to pay producers of higher-valued fluid milk. The quota was valued at about $1.2 billion in 2015. USDA held public hearings on the California order in 2015 and published a proposed rule in 2017. The proposed decision would allow California to maintain its quota system separate from the Federal Milk Marketing Order (FMMO). Payments for the quota milk would be managed by CDFA. USDA is currently evaluating public comments before releasing a final decision. If a milk marketing order is established in California, milk producers will vote on it. Handlers of certified organic milk in FMMO areas must participate in the FMMO pool for fluid products. Organic milk handlers pay prices above the FMMO Class I price. AMS treats certified organic and conventional milk equally for pricing and pooling. OTA requested a USDA hearing in September 2015 to amend how FMMOs treat certified organic milk, arguing that the system disfavors organic milk handlers and producers. Organic milk is pooled in FMMOs, with handlers paying the FMMO Class I price. However, organic fluid bottlers cannot rely on conventional milk handlers in the FMMO to supply organic milk. Organic milk accounted for 5.5% of total fluid milk products in 2016. OTA proposed changes for organic milk handlers. OTA proposed changes to how organic milk handlers are treated under FMMOs in 2016. They suggested that handlers could receive a producer-settlement fund credit if they pay producers a price above the FMMO Class I price, plus a $2.90 per cwt threshold. This threshold is based on the premium for organic milk over conventional milk, as calculated by the Central Milk Producers Cooperative. The OTA proposed changes to how organic milk handlers are treated under FMMOs in 2016. They suggested that handlers could receive a producer-settlement fund credit if they pay producers a price above the FMMO Class I price, plus a $2.90 per cwt threshold. NMPF and 10 milk cooperatives opposed the OTA proposal, arguing that it would exempt organic milk from FMMO revenue sharing and could harm organic milk producers. The OTA proposed changes to how organic milk handlers are treated under FMMOs in 2016, suggesting a producer-settlement fund credit for paying producers above the FMMO Class I price. Opponents feared it could harm conventionally produced milk by affecting the balance between fluid and manufactured products. OTA withdrew its request for a hearing, citing a lack of explanation for the delay in scheduling. They noted the possibility of resubmitting the proposal in the future. The pricing of different classes of milk is based on the components derived from wholesale prices of various dairy products. Prices are calculated on a standardized hundredweight basis assuming a certain percentage of skim milk and butterfat. Skim milk prices are reported per hundredweight, while butterfat prices are per pound. The formulas for each class are adjusted to reflect the weight reporting basis. The advanced pricing factors for Class I, II, III, and IV milk are calculated based on skim milk and butterfat prices, with adjustments for specific pricing months. Class II milk pricing includes factors for skim milk, butterfat, and nonfat solids, with announcements made by the 23rd of the month prior to pricing month. The pricing of milk is based on monthly butterfat prices, with a premium added to attract milk to Class II use. Formulas are used to calculate Class III and Class IV milk prices based on skim milk, protein, other solids, and butterfat prices. The formulas include weighted averages of wholesale prices for cheese, dry whey, and butter, with deductions for make allowance. The pricing of milk is determined by formulas based on butterfat prices and other components. Class IV milk price is calculated using the skim milk price and butterfat price formulas. The amendment process for federal orders involves six steps, including a preliminary investigation by USDA and a petition for change in the federal order system. The USDA investigates proposals for changes in the federal order system, with a public hearing where producers, handlers, and consumers present evidence on the impact of proposed changes. The hearing is presided over by a USDA administrative law judge, and the public hearing record is the main source of information for evaluating the issues. After a public hearing presided over by a judge, witnesses can file briefs within a set time period. The USDA Dairy Program then prepares a recommendation on the issues, with a proposed decision made public for comments. A final decision is issued after reexamining findings and receiving feedback, becoming the final regulations presented to producers for approval. Before USDA can issue an amended order, affected producers and cooperatives must approve it by referendum. Approval requires a favorable vote by two-thirds of eligible producers or those supplying two-thirds of the milk in the marketing area. Dairy cooperatives can bloc vote, with all members considered to have voted as the cooperative did. If approved, USDA will publish the final order in the Federal Register. Producers must vote on the order as amended, not just the amendment, following a long-standing USDA approach. The USDA's approach in amending federal milk marketing orders requires approval by affected producers and cooperatives through a referendum. Producers may have to choose between an unsatisfactory order and no order at all."
