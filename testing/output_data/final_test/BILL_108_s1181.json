    "content": "PART D--PROMOTING YOUTH FINANCIAL LITERACY: Amends Title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to include a section promoting youth financial literacy. The `Youth Financial Education Act' aims to promote financial literacy among young people by providing them with the necessary skills and knowledge to manage their personal finances. Despite the importance of financial literacy, many high school graduates lack basic financial management skills, as shown by a nationwide survey conducted in 2002. The survey in 2002 found that only 50 percent of respondents answered questions correctly, down from previous years. State educational leaders have recognized the importance of financial education in K-12, but only 4 states had integrated it into their standards by 2002. A study showed that 10 hours of classroom instruction can significantly impact how teens manage their money. By 2002, only 4 states required high school students to complete a personal finance course. Teacher training is crucial for youth financial literacy, as many economics teachers lack personal finance education. Personal financial education helps students develop individual responsibility, life skills, and consumer economics understanding for financial independence. Financial education in schools integrates valuable life skills with economics, including income, taxes, money management, investment, spending, and personal savings. Teaching personal finance should be encouraged at all levels of the educational system, from kindergarten through grade 12, to benefit future consumers and investors. The State Grant Program (SEC. 4402) is aimed at promoting financial education in schools to teach valuable life skills related to economics, income, taxes, money management, investment, spending, and personal savings. The Secretary is authorized to provide grants to State educational agencies for youth financial education programs in elementary and secondary schools. State educational agencies must submit an approved State plan to receive a grant, detailing how funds will be used and how programs will be coordinated with other relevant programs. The Secretary allocates funds to State educational agencies based on student populations in kindergarten through grade 12. States with approved plans are guaranteed a minimum allocation of $500,000 per fiscal year. The Secretary allocates funds to State educational agencies based on student populations in kindergarten through grade 12. States with approved plans are guaranteed a minimum allocation of $500,000 per fiscal year. Reallocation of funds occurs for States without approved plans, and grant funds must be used for financial education programs for students. The grade 12 financial literacy program aims to teach personal financial management skills, prepare educators, and evaluate program effectiveness. State educational agencies receiving grants can use up to 4% for administrative costs. Each agency must report to the Secretary. Each State educational agency receiving a grant must report to the Secretary on the programs supported and their monitoring and evaluation results. \"SEC. 4403. CLEARINGHOUSE.\" The Secretary will provide a grant to an eligible entity to establish a national clearinghouse for financial education materials and programs. The eligible entity must have experience in financial education and support services for promoting youth financial literacy. The Clearinghouse, established through a grant from the Secretary, will maintain instructional materials for financial education programs in schools and disseminate them to States and the public. The Clearinghouse, established through a grant from the Secretary, will disseminate instructional materials and provide technical assistance for financial education programs in schools. The chief executive officer of the eligible entity will consult with the Department of the Treasury and the Securities Exchange Commission on its activities. Each Federal agency will submit to the Clearinghouse. Each Federal agency or department developing financial education programs must submit information and materials to the Clearinghouse. The Clearinghouse will comply with copyright laws in its operations. \"SEC. 4404. EVALUATION AND REPORT.\" The Secretary will develop performance measures to evaluate programs under sections 4402 and 4403. Using these measures, programs will be evaluated for performance, effectiveness, best practices, and potential replication. A report will be submitted to Congress annually on the implementation status. The report to Congress will detail the implementation status of the programs supported under section 4402, including evaluation results and program descriptions. In this part, financial education involves educational activities supervised by qualified teachers to help students understand economic and consumer principles, manage finances, and become responsible consumers. A qualified teacher is defined as someone with a valid teaching certification or recognized by the State educational agency. SEC. 4406 prohibits Federal Government officers from controlling a State or school's instructional content for funding eligibility. SEC. 4407 authorizes appropriations. Authorization of appropriations for carrying out this part is set at $100,000,000 annually from 2004 to 2008. The Secretary can allocate 2-5% for clearinghouse activities and up to $200,000 for evaluation purposes. Administrative costs are limited to subsections (a) and (b) of section 4404."
