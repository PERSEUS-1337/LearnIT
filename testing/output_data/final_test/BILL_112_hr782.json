    "content": "The \"State Health Care Flexibility Act of 2011\" allows states to opt out of certain provisions of the PPACA if deemed unconstitutional, without affecting the rest of the Act. A qualifying State may opt out of certain provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act related to health insurance coverage within the State. This includes sections of the Act concerning health insurance market reforms and immediate reforms, with some exceptions. A qualifying State can opt out of certain provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act related to health insurance coverage, excluding sections 1253 and 1254. Groupings of provisions include parts I, II, III, and V of subtitle D, part I of subtitle E, subtitle F of title I, and requirements from section 3021(c)(2) of the Public Health Service Act. A qualifying State can opt out of certain provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act by enacting a state law expressing intent to do so. This includes excluding sections 1253 and 1254, parts I, II, III, and V of subtitle D, part I of subtitle E, subtitle F of title I, and requirements from section 3021(c)(2) of the Public Health Service Act. A qualifying State can opt out of certain provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act by enacting a state law expressing intent to do so. The state law must contain a list of provisions to be excluded and express the State's intent to continue administering health coverage-related laws as of March 22, 2010. If the State repeals the law, the provisions of the Affordable Care Act listed in the repealed law will apply. The Affordable Care Act provisions will apply to a State upon repeal, preserving existing State opt-out laws. Regulations for implementation must be promulgated within 90 days of enactment, and the effective date is immediate regardless of regulatory status."
