    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Welfare-to-Work Microloan Pilot Program Act of 1997\". Congress acknowledges the success of the Small Business Administration's microloan program in assisting women, low-income, and minority entrepreneurs by providing small-scale loans and technical assistance. Some welfare recipients have been able to transition off welfare and run successful businesses through this program. The microloan demonstration program requires intensive management, marketing, and technical assistance. Lack of affordable childcare and transportation can be barriers for individuals trying to start a small business and move away from welfare. SEC. 103. WELFARE-TO-WORK MICROLOAN PILOT PROGRAM. Establishment of a welfare-to-work microloan pilot program under the Small Business Act to test increasing technical assistance grants for individuals. The curr_chunk discusses providing assistance to individuals in low-income programs to help them establish small businesses and become independent from that assistance. The curr_chunk discusses using technical assistance grants to support microborrowers in subsidizing child care and transportation costs, removing barriers for microborrowers in starting child care businesses, and evaluating the effectiveness of the assistance provided to help individuals become independent from financial aid. The curr_chunk discusses supplemental grants for providing additional technical assistance to borrowers or prospective entrepreneurs. The curr_chunk provides grants to borrowers or potential borrowers under the welfare-to-work microloan pilot program, allowing them to use the funds for childcare and transportation costs. The contribution requirements of certain subparagraphs do not apply to these grants.

It also specifies the allocation of funds for the welfare-to-work microloan pilot program. The Administration may allocate up to 5 percent of funds for technical assistance to welfare-to-work microloan pilot program grantees to ensure their success. Additionally, the Administration is required to submit evaluations of the welfare-to-work microloan pilot program annually to the Committees on Small Business. The Administration must submit an annual report to the Committees on Small Business regarding the welfare-to-work microloan pilot program, including data on grantee locations, grant amounts, and the number of individuals assisted. The annual report on the welfare-to-work microloan pilot program must include data on transportation and childcare assistance recipients, loan and grant details, businesses started with program assistance, jobs created, and individuals trained under the program who are now employed in their own businesses. The welfare-to-work microloan pilot program annual report must include data on recipients' employment status, grant usage for transportation and childcare costs, and recommendations for legislative changes. $10,000,000 is authorized for the program for each fiscal year 1998, 1999, and 2000."
