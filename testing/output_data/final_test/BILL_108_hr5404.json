    "content": "The \"Fair Vaccine Price Act of 2004\" prohibits price gouging during a shortage of covered vaccines. The \"Fair Vaccine Price Act of 2004\" prohibits introducing covered vaccines into interstate commerce at prices violating the set regulations. This includes pricing above 150 percent of the baseline price per dose during declared shortages. The \"Fair Vaccine Price Act of 2004\" allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to declare a vaccine shortage. The baseline price of a covered vaccine per dose is determined based on the average price of the brand offered for sale 60 days before the shortage declaration. The Fair Vaccine Price Act of 2004 allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to determine the baseline price of a covered vaccine in case of a shortage, based on factors unrelated to the shortage. The Secretary determines baseline price of vaccine during shortage. Penalties for violating pricing regulations include imprisonment, fines, or both. Fines are triple the difference between actual price and baseline price. Citizen suits allowed. Citizen suits can be filed to compel compliance with pricing regulations, with jurisdiction granted to United States district courts. Notice of alleged violation must be given 30 days prior to initiating action. Notice of alleged violation must be given to the Secretary and each alleged violator. The Secretary or Attorney General may prosecute violators in court, allowing intervention by any person. The court may award costs in issuing a final order. In civil actions for purchasing vaccines at a price violation, the court may award costs of litigation and damages. States retain authority to regulate vaccine distribution and sale. The Act defines \"covered vaccine\" as a vaccine for influenza or biological terrorist agents, and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Health and Human Services. It prohibits restrictions on vaccine distribution and sale enforcement."
