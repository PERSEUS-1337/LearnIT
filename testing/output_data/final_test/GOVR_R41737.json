    "content": "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has designated eight of its 11 operating divisions as components of the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS), including agencies like CDC, FDA, and NIH. These agencies are mostly authorized under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). The FDA's regulatory activities are largely authorized under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), while IHS programs are authorized by the Indian Health Care Improvement Act and ATSDR was created by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). PHS agencies have varying missions and functions, with NIH and AHRQ primarily focused on research, and IHS, HRSA, and SAMHSA providing health care services. IHS supports health care delivery for American Indians and Alaska Natives through contracted and operated programs. Health services are provided through tribally contracted and operated health programs, and through services purchased from private providers. HRSA funds programs to improve access to health care among low-income populations, pregnant women, children, persons living with HIV/AIDS, rural populations, and others who are medically underserved. SAMHSA funds mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment services. CDC and ATSDR develop public health prevention programs for a range of diseases and injuries, including public health emergencies and bioterrorism. FDA is largely regulatory, ensuring the safety of foods and drugs. The PHS agencies, including AHRQ, CDC, HRSA, NIH, SAMHSA, ATSDR, IHS, and FDA, receive funding through various appropriations acts. This report provides an overview of their statutory authority, activities, and funding for FY2010, FY2011, and the FY2012 budget request. Funding sources vary for each agency, with FDA receiving funding through the Agriculture appropriations act. The FY2010 and FY2011 funding amounts were based on appropriations acts, with FY2011 funding from a full-year continuing resolution. FY2012 funding levels were from the President's budget request. The tables show discretionary budget authority and program levels for each fiscal year. The funding provided in annual appropriations acts represents the total amount available to the agency, including discretionary budget authority and additional funding from other sources such as user fees, PHS evaluation set-aside funds, and funding from laws like the health reform law. The funding tables display amounts for major budget items, which are summed to show the agency's total program level. Non-discretionary funds are subtracted from the program level to determine the agency's discretionary budget authority. Some tables include non-add entries to highlight funding for specific programs within the budget. The curr_chunk discusses the allocation of user fees and PPACA funds in agency budgets for FY2011 and FY2012. It mentions the House passing the FY2012 Agriculture appropriations act, including funding for FDA. The report will be updated once the House completes work on other PHS agencies' funding. The PHS Program Evaluation Set-Aside (set-aside) redistributes funds among CDC, HRSA, NIH, and SAMHSA for program evaluation. The set-aside is limited to 1% of program appropriations but recent acts have increased it to 2.5% and proposed 3.2% for FY2012. The HHS Budget Office calculates set-aside funds after annual appropriations. Allocations are made to recipient agencies and programs, not included in discretionary budget authority. AHRQ is mainly funded by evaluation set-aside funds. PHS agency budget tables show received set-aside funds only. PPACA includes mandatory appropriations for grant programs. The PPACA provisions allocated billions of dollars to support grant programs and activities within HHS, including establishing multi-billion dollar trust funds. The Community Health Center Fund provided $11 billion over five years for health centers and the National Health Service Corps. Additionally, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund supported comparative effectiveness research over a 10-year period. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) will fund comparative effectiveness research over a 10-year period from FY2010 to FY2019 using appropriations and transfers from Medicare trust funds. A portion of the funding goes to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) supports public health programs and activities authorized under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). Transfers from PPACA trust funds are detailed in funding tables. AHRQ focuses on improving healthcare quality and delivery efficiency. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) aims to improve healthcare quality, delivery efficiency, and access to essential services through research. It evolved from previous agencies focused on health services research and technology assessment, with key legislative changes in 1989 and 1999. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), formerly known as AHCPR, was reauthorized through FY2005. Funding levels for AHRQ programs from FY2010 to FY2012 are presented in Table 1. The AHRQ budget is organized into program areas including Healthcare Costs, Quality and Outcomes (HCQO) Research, Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys (MEPS), and program support. HCQO research focuses on six priority areas. AHRQ receives its budget from the PHS evaluation set-aside, with additional funds from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) and the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF). The FY2011 full-year CR reduces AHRQ's funding by $25 million, with cuts to the General Patient Safety Research program. However, there is a partial offset with increases in PPHF funds for Prevention/Care Management research and a transfer of funds to boost Patient-Centered Health Research. Overall, AHRQ's FY2011 program level is $11 million below FY2010. The President's FY2012 budget request would further reduce AHRQ's total program level by $13 million. The President's FY2012 budget request would reduce AHRQ's total program level by $13 million to $390 million. Funding for Patient-Centered Health Research would increase by $25 million, while funding for General Patient Safety Research would decrease by $26 million. $25 million of the reduction in General Patient Safety Research funding is attributed to a one-time investment in medical malpractice liability reform projects. The CDC promotes health and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease, injury, and disability. It is the nation's principal public health agency, coordinating various disease and injury control activities. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) is administered by the CDC Director. CDC's activities are based on broad, permanent authorities in the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). Four CDC operating divisions are explicitly authorized, including the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). The National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities (NCBDDD), National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and ATSDR were established under various acts. CDC provides financial and technical assistance to various entities, with most funding used for extramural purposes. CDC has few regulatory responsibilities and is primarily funded through the Labor-HHS-ED appropriations act. ATSDR is funded separately through the Interior/Environment annual appropriations. Funding levels for CDC programs for FY2010 are presented in Table 2. The CDC receives annual appropriations for various programs, including mandatory appropriations for the Vaccines for Children program and activities supporting the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program. Funding levels for CDC programs for FY2010 through FY2012 are detailed in Table 2. The FY2011 full-year CR provided $5.649 billion in discretionary budget authority for CDC, a decrease from the FY2010 amount. However, the CDC/ATSDR program level for FY2011 only decreased by $6 million from the previous year, largely offset by increases in mandatory funds and transfers. The CDC received $611 million in transfers from the PPHF for FY2011, $419 million more than for FY2010. Annual growth in transfers for the VFC program and a $225 million transfer from the Emergency Fund helped offset the decrease in the FY2011 program level. Many CDC programs funded in FY2010 were not funded for FY2011, including earmarks eliminated by the FY2011 full-year CR. CDC did not request funding for buildings and facilities for FY2011 but did for FY2012. The Communities Putting Prevention to Work program, initially funded through... The CDC plans to use $145 million in FY2011 funds from the PPHF for Community Transformation Grants (CTG) to support objectives similar to the Communities Putting Prevention to Work program. The Administration requested $5.818 billion in CDC budget authority for FY2012 and $76 million for ATSDR. Additionally, the Administration proposed to transfer $753 million in FY2012 PPHF funds for various CDC activities. The Administration proposed to eliminate the Preventive Health and Health Services block grant and use $705 million of chronic disease funds to establish the Coordinated Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Grant Program. This program would address risk factors for heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, and arthritis. Tobacco programs would continue to be funded separately. The Administration proposed using $221 million from the PPHF for Community Transformation Grants. FDA regulates the safety of foods, human drugs, biological products, medical devices, and tobacco products. Seven centers within FDA represent different program areas. The FDA consists of several centers responsible for regulating various products such as foods, drugs, and tobacco. Its statutory authority comes from the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) and it also administers provisions in other laws like the PHSA. FDA's budget falls under the jurisdiction of the appropriations subcommittees on Agriculture, Rural Development, FDA, and Related Agencies. The FDA's budget is overseen by the Agriculture, Rural Development, FDA, and Related Agencies. It consists of direct appropriations and industry user fees, with user fees contributing 33% of the total FY2011 program level. Major user fee programs support FDA's regulatory activities for prescription drugs, medical devices, and animal drugs. Smaller amounts come from mammography quality standards, export, and color certification fees. Tobacco regulatory activities are fully funded by user fees. The FDA's tobacco regulatory activities are funded by user fees paid by manufacturers and importers. In FY2011, FDA had a total program level of $3.690 billion, with $2.457 billion in direct appropriations and $1.233 billion in user fees. The President requested $4.360 billion for FDA in FY2012, with $2.744 billion in budget authority and $1.616 billion in user fees. This represents a 33% increase from FY2010 and an 18% increase from FY2011. The FDA's FY2012 budget request includes $2.744 billion in budget authority and $1.616 billion in user fees. The requested user fees for FY2012 are 75% more than FY2010 and 31% more than FY2011. The budget includes funding for ongoing user fee programs and new fee categories authorized in the Food Safety Modernization Act. Additionally, there is an increase in funding for the Transforming Food Safety and Nutrition Initiative. The FDA's FY2012 budget request includes $2.744 billion in budget authority and $1.616 billion in user fees, with additional funding allocated for various initiatives such as the Transforming Food Safety and Nutrition Initiative, Advancing Medical Countermeasures Initiative, Protecting Patients Initiative, and FDA Regulatory Science and Facilities Initiative. The House passed H.R. 2112, the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2012, which includes funding for these initiatives. For FY2012, the Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act would provide FDA with a total program level of $3.693 billion, with $2.172 billion in direct appropriations and $1.520 billion in user fees. The budget authority would be 12% below FY2011 and 21% below the President's FY2012 request. HRSA is responsible for increasing access to healthcare for the uninsured, underserved, and vulnerable populations by funding various health services projects through more than 3,000 grantees. HRSA administers health centers program, grants to non-profit entities for primary care services. Majority of programs authorized in PHSA, including Health Centers Program, National Health Service Corps, Telehealth Program, and Ryan White HIV/AIDS programs. Other programs authorized under Social Security Act. The HRSA administers various health programs authorized under the Social Security Act, including the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant, the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, and the Rural Health Policy Development programs. The Black Lung Program, authorized under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Amendments Act, supports clinics for retired coal miners. Funding levels for HRSA's programs from FY2010 to FY2012 are shown in Table 4, with a decrease in discretionary budget authority in FY2011 offset by an increase in PPACA funds. Total funding for HRSA's programs increased significantly from $575 million in FY2010 to $3.394 billion in FY2011, with a $1.598 billion increase in program level. Discretionary funding for health centers and NHSC was reduced in FY2011 but offset by transfers from the CHCF, resulting in overall funding increases. Funding for most other health workforce programs either remained flat or decreased. In FY2011, funding for HRSA's programs increased significantly, with a $1.598 billion increase in program level. The Children's Hospital GME program had a $48 million reduction, while the Primary Care Training and Enhancement and Nursing Workforce Development programs lost their FY2010 PPHF funding. Maternal and Child Health programs saw a $144 million increase, mainly due to mandatory funding for the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program. Rural health programs faced a $47 million funding cut, largely due to the elimination of earmark spending. In FY2011, funding for HRSA's programs increased significantly, with a $1.598 billion increase in program level. Funding for the Denali Project and the Delta Health Initiative was eliminated, while Rural and Community Access to Emergency Devices funding was reduced by $2 million. State Health Access Program funding was not provided. $2.337 billion will be spent on the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program, with a $21 million increase over FY2010. $885 million is allocated for the AIDS Drug Assistance Program. Funding for Congressional Projects was eliminated. The President's FY2012 budget request for HRSA includes $6.808 billion in budget authority, a decrease of $684 million from FY2010. The budget proposes to eliminate funding for various HRSA programs, including Congressional Projects, the Denali Commission, and the Delta Health Initiative. Additionally, funding for certain rural health projects and the Children's Hospital GME program would be eliminated. The budget requests $1.252 billion for health workforce programs to expand primary care workforce capacity and geriatric education. The FY2012 budget request for health workforce programs includes funding for Teaching Health Centers and GME payments. There is a proposed increase in funding for Maternal and Child Health programs, Ryan White HIV/AIDS program, and IHS services for American Indians/Alaska Natives. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides services in 35 states through self-determination contracts and compacts negotiated with tribes. The Snyder Act of 1921 and the Indian Sanitation Facilities Act of 1959 authorize IHS programs, including urban health and substance abuse treatment. IHS can receive reimbursements from Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and third-party insurers. Unlike other PHS agencies, IHS receives appropriations through the Interior/Environment appropriations act. The Indian Health Service (IHS) receives appropriations through the Interior/Environment appropriations act, not the Labor-HHS-ED appropriations act. Table 5 shows IHS funding for FY2010 through the FY2012 request, including discretionary budget authority and mandatory appropriations. For FY2011, IHS received an appropriation of $4.069 billion, an increase of $17 million (0.4%) from FY2010, providing additional funding for hospitals, health clinic services, and construction. Funding for most IHS programs in FY2011 remained constant or was slightly reduced due to a 0.2% across-the-board rescission. The Indian Health Service (IHS) received a $17 million increase in collections compared to FY2010, resulting in a 0.7% higher program level. The President's FY2012 budget proposes a 12% increase in IHS's discretionary budget authority. PPACA mandates reflecting changes in healthcare costs and service population in the budget request. Additional funding is requested for most IHS programs in FY2012, except for sanitation facility construction which would receive $16 million less than FY2010. The NIH is the primary agency for biomedical research and health information dissemination. It derives authority from the PHSA and conducts research through 27 institutes and centers. Annual appropriations provide funding for the ICs and the Office of the Director. The NIH receives funding from various sources, including separate appropriations to 24 of the ICs, the Office of the Director, and the Buildings and Facilities account. Funding for NIH in FY2011 was reduced compared to FY2010, with a total of $30.926 billion allocated, $317 million lower than the previous year. Most institutes and centers saw a 1% decrease in funding, while the Buildings and Facilities account was reduced by 50%. The Obama Administration requested $31.987 billion for NIH in FY2012, an increase of $745 million. In FY2012, the Obama Administration requested $31.987 billion for NIH, an increase of $745 million (2.4%) over the FY2010 program level. NIH plans to establish the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) to focus on new diagnostics and therapeutics. The agency will abolish the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) and transfer its programs to NCATS or other ICs. NCATS will also include the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) program and may incorporate the Cures Acceleration Network (CAN) with a $100 million request in FY2012. The purpose of CAN is to support the development of high-need cures for rare diseases and facilitate their FDA review. If funded, NIH would determine which medical products qualify as high-need cures and make awards to research entities or companies to accelerate their development. NIH will also focus on advanced technologies, comparative effectiveness research, and support for young investigators in FY2012. SAMHSA leads efforts to increase access to behavioral health services through grants to states and territories. SAMHSA provides funding for substance abuse services to states, territories, tribal organizations, and private entities. Religious organizations can receive funding without altering their religious character. The agency also collects data on mental illness and substance abuse at national and state levels. SAMHSA is authorized under PHSA Title V and organized into three centers: the Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) block grant, and the Community Mental Health Services (CMHS) block grant. SAMHSA is organized into three centers: the Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT), and the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP). Each center has authority to establish grant programs for states and communities to address substance abuse and mental health needs. PRNS authorizes funding for projects to translate research findings, provide training, and increase service capacity. PHSA Title V authorizes specific grant programs, and SAMHSA conducts data collection and analysis activities related to mental health and substance abuse. SAMHSA programs are administered by three centers focusing on mental health and substance abuse. Cross-cutting programs like the National Registry of Evidence-based Programs and Practices receive separate support. Connections between centers have been created to address issues with both mental health and substance abuse components. Funding authority for SAMHSA's grant programs was last reauthorized in 2000 as part of the Children's Health Act. Funding authority for SAMHSA's grant programs expired in FY2003, but many programs continue to receive annual appropriations. Congress has not reauthorized legislation since 2000, but has expanded the agency's programs. Table 7 shows SAMHSA's funding for FY2010 and FY2011, with examples of non-add programs included. PHS evaluation set-aside funds and PPHF transfers are subtracted from the SAMHSA program level to give the agency's total discretionary budget authority. SAMHSA's FY2012 budget request proposes a restructuring of its programs and activities. The agency's discretionary budget authority for FY2011 is $3.380 billion, which is $52 million less than FY2010. However, there was a $68 million increase in PPHF transfers, resulting in a total program level for FY2011 of $3.599 billion, $16 million above FY2010. The FY2012 budget request for SAMHSA includes a total program level of $3.649 billion, representing a $66 million increase from FY2010. The budget reflects a restructuring of programs to focus on prevention of substance abuse and mental illness, assisting Indian tribes in addressing these issues. SAMHSA's FY2012 budget request includes funding for three new prevention programs: a substance abuse prevention state grant program for high-risk communities and youth, an expansion of a mental health prevention program for young children to support comprehensive strategies for children, youth, and young adults, and a grant program to promote behavioral health in Indian tribes by reducing substance abuse and preventing suicide. SAMHSA's FY2012 budget includes programmatic changes such as combining grant programs into one account for Innovation and Emerging Issues, consolidating funding for data collection systems, and grouping various programs into single budget lines. Additionally, the Community Health Center Fund was established to provide supplemental funding for health center operations and the National Health Service Corps. The CHCF received $11 billion from FY2011 to FY2015 under PPACA, with a provision requiring maintenance of regular appropriations for health centers and NHSC at FY2008 levels. P.L. 112-10 waived this requirement for FY2011. An additional $1.5 billion was allocated for health center construction and renovation. PPACA Section 4002 established the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) to support prevention and public health programs. The fund was appropriated $500 million for FY2010, increasing each year thereafter. The Secretary is required to maintain at least the FY2008 funding level when using PPHF funds. Transfers from PPHF to specific HHS activities have been carried out by the Secretary. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) was established to support prevention and public health programs, with appropriations increasing each year. FY2011 funds became available on October 1, 2010, and are used to maintain funding levels. PPHF funds may replace regular appropriations, and Congress can direct the Secretary on fund allocation and use."
