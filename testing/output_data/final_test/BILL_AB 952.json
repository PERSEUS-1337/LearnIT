    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 36512 of the Government Code in California states that vacancies in appointive offices must be filled by appointment, while vacancies in elective offices must be filled within 60 days by either appointment or special election. If a special election is called, it must be held within 114 days. If a vacancy occurs in a term of office, the appointed person holds office until the next general municipal election, and the elected person serves the unexpired term. Cities may enact ordinances regarding filling vacancies in office. The ordinance requires a special election to fill city council vacancies and the office of mayor, either immediately or when a specified number of verified signatures are filed. The special election must be held on the next established election date at least 114 days from the call or filing of the petition. A person appointed to fill a city council vacancy holds office until a special election is called, which must be held at least 114 days from the call. The council cannot appoint a majority of its members, and the vacancy must be filled through an election on the next established election date. If the city council does not call an election for a vacancy, it will be filled at the next election date. A resigning council member can vote on their successor's appointment if the resignation is contingent on the appointment. The member cannot vote for a family member or someone with a potential conflict of interest. After voting, the member is restricted from certain actions for two years. City council members are prohibited from advocating on issues where they have a personal benefit, entering contracts with the city or vendors, accepting city employment, or applying for permits requiring council approval. Exceptions include members resigning due to corruption charges or criminal behavior."
