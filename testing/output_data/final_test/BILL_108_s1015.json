    "content": "The Act titled \"Mosquito Abatement for Safety and Health Act\" amends the Public Health Service Act to provide grants for the prevention of mosquito-borne diseases. This includes coordination grants to states and assessment and control grants to political subdivisions. The Act provides coordination grants to states for mosquito control programs and assessment grants to political subdivisions to determine immediate needs and develop plans for control programs. The Secretary gives preference to states with high mosquito-borne disease risk. Grants require states to develop a plan for coordinating control programs and consult with political subdivisions. The State must agree to monitor and coordinate control programs in political subdivisions, make grants not exceeding $10,000, and ensure that the grant supplements existing funds without replacing them. The State must agree to submit a report describing grant activities and evaluating coordination of control programs in political subdivisions. States are limited to one grant under this program. Grants may also be made to political subdivisions of States or consortia. The Secretary shall give preference in making grants to political subdivisions with a history of mosquito-borne disease or increased risk, demonstrating effective control programs. The political subdivision or consortium must effectively coordinate control programs in areas with significant need and be located in a state that has received a grant. A grant can only be made if an assessment has been conducted to determine the need for control programs. The political subdivision or consortium must assess immediate needs for a control program, including an entomological survey, and develop a plan. Matching funds are required, with the subdivision or consortium contributing at least one-third of the costs. The political subdivision or consortium must contribute at least one-third of the costs for a control program, with non-Federal contributions in cash or in kind. The Secretary may waive this requirement under extraordinary economic conditions. A grant may only be made if immediate needs are assessed and a plan is developed. The political subdivision or consortium must agree to submit a report to the Secretary and State after the fiscal year. Grants awarded to single political subdivisions cannot exceed $100,000, while grants to consortia of political subdivisions cannot exceed $110,000 per subdivision. The maximum grant amount for single political subdivisions is $100,000, while consortia of political subdivisions cannot exceed $110,000 per subdivision. Grants may exceed these limits if the Secretary determines extreme need based on geographical size or density. The grant amount for political subdivisions is capped at $100,000 for single entities and $110,000 for consortia. Grants may exceed these limits based on extreme need determined by geographical size or density, affecting human or mosquito populations in the area. The grant amount for political subdivisions is capped at $100,000 for single entities and $110,000 for consortia. Only one grant can be received by a political subdivision or consortium. Applications for grants must be submitted to the Secretary in the required form. Technical assistance can be provided for planning, development, and operation of assessments and control programs. The section defines political subdivisions as local jurisdictions below the state level. $100 million is authorized for fiscal year 2003, with additional funding for 2004-2007. In response to mosquito-borne diseases during public health emergencies, additional funds are authorized apart from existing appropriations. For fiscal year 2004, over 50% of funds will be allocated for grants to political subdivisions. Additionally, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences will establish a research program. The Director of the Institute will conduct research to develop methods for controlling insect and vermin populations that transmit diseases to humans. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will submit a report on the development of protocols for ensuring the safety of the blood supply regarding West Nile Virus, including screening mechanisms, donor screening protocols, and surveillance systems for virus transmission. Recommendations for improving blood supply safety will also be included. The report will cover the development of protocols for blood supply safety regarding West Nile Virus, including screening mechanisms and donor screening protocols. It will also address the benefits and risks of insecticide spraying for public health intervention and the role of public health pesticides compared to agricultural use. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
