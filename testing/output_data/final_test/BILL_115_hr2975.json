    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Securing America's Facilities, Equipment and Rail: Taking Responsibility for American National Security In Transit Act\" or the \"SAFER TRANSIT Act\". Congress finds that public transportation systems are crucial for Americans, with 6,800 systems and 35,000,000 daily trips. However, these systems are increasingly targeted by terrorists, as seen in attacks in Madrid, London, and threats near Amtrak tracks in 2011. In 2011, there were threats of explosives near Amtrak tracks. In 2016, a terrorist attack in Brussels targeted the airport and a metro station, resulting in 32 deaths and nearly 300 injuries. From 2006 to 2014, there were 57 terror attacks on transportation. The Federal Government must balance security and accessibility in public transportation, as mandated by the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. Homeland Security oversees public transportation security, with limited oversight of Amtrak's passenger security. Recommendations include allocating resources based on risk assessments and providing necessary resources to combat terrorism. Congress must continue to conduct oversight of resource use. The Secretary of Homeland Security must submit a report to Congress within 90 days outlining plans to expedite rail security measures, including assigning carriers to high-risk tiers and establishing a rail security training program. Additionally, there is a provision for Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response Teams. SEC. 4 amends the authorization of appropriations for Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response Teams until fiscal year 2020. SEC. 5 focuses on public transportation security research and development. SEC. 5 amends the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 to allocate necessary funds for public transportation security research and development from 2016 to 2020. SEC. 6 addresses railroad security funding for the same fiscal years. SEC. 7 pertains to over-the-road bus security assistance. SEC. 7 amends the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 to authorize appropriations for over-the-road bus security assistance from 2016 to 2020. The Secretary of Homeland Security will develop the \"Local Transit Security Instructor Training Program\" at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers. The program will provide intensive training on tactical subjects related to public transit security, instill necessary knowledge and skills, and emphasize leadership and adult learning. The program will be made available to trainee officers. The Secretary will make the program available to eligible law enforcement agencies with jurisdiction over areas where public transit operates. The Federal Air Marshal Program's effectiveness will be evaluated. The Secretary of Homeland Security will ensure that the Federal Air Marshal Service focuses on high-risk flights by considering risk in resource allocation, conducting risk assessments, and evaluating threat environments for different modes of transportation. The Federal Air Marshal Service will analyze different transportation modes to inform resource allocation decisions, select international destinations for air marshal deployment based on risk, define the TSA coverage score accurately, and report performance results to leadership. The Secretary of Homeland Security will prioritize research on technology to detect chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive threats on public transportation, with continuous real-time sensing and alert capabilities for passengers and personnel."
