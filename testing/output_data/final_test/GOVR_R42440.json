The FY2013 budget request for Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies is $61.762 billion, with allocations for the Department of Commerce, Department of Justice, science agencies, and related agencies. The Senate committee-reported amount is 1.4% greater than the FY2012 appropriation. The House passed a bill providing $60.879 billion for CJS, slightly less than the FY2012 appropriation. The bill allocates $60.879 billion for Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, which is slightly less than the FY2012 appropriation. President Obama signed the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 into law, providing a total of $60.638 billion for CJS. In FY2013, discretionary non-security and security accounts faced rescissions of 1.877% and 0.1% respectively in the CJS appropriations act. The Foreign Claims Settlement Commission and International Trade Commission accounts were subject to a 0.1% rescission. Rescissions were applied proportionately to each discretionary account, item of budget authority, and program, project, or activity. Additionally, OMB ordered another rescission under section 3004 of the act. Section 3004 of the act aims to reduce new budget authority to comply with FY2013 discretionary spending limits. It includes across-the-board rescissions for non-security and security budget authority, with percentages to be increased if needed. OMB calculated additional rescissions of 0.032% for security and 0.2% for non-security budget authority after the enactment of P.L. 113-6. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act for CJS accounts does not reflect reductions from sequestration ordered by President Obama in 2013. The report only includes new appropriations and does not account for rescissions or scorekeeping adjustments. Tables show enacted appropriations for various departments and agencies. Congress debated FY2013 funding for the Department of Commerce, considering issues such as increasing funding for the International Trade Administration to challenge unfair trade practices globally, promoting U.S. exports to high-growth markets, and overseeing the President's Export Control Reform Initiative. The oversight of the President's Export Control Reform Initiative under the Bureau of Industry and Security, funding for the National Telecommunications and Information Administration to support a First Responder Network Authority, resources for the Census Bureau for the 2012 economic census, and the proposal to decrease funding for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Ocean Service were key considerations for Congress in FY2013 funding for the Department of Commerce.

This amount was lower than the Senate Committee on Appropriations's recommendation. The House recommended $601.4 million for periodic censuses and programs in FY2013, which was lower than the FY2012-enacted amount and the Senate committee's recommendation. The House-approved amount would have canceled the 2012 economic census and included amendments to prohibit funds for enforcing penalties for nonresponse to the American Community Survey and conducting the ACS. P.L. 113-6 provided $887.4 million for the Census Bureau, including funds for salaries and expenses. The explanatory statement for P.L. 113-6 allocated $887.4 million for the Census Bureau, with specific amounts for salaries and expenses, and periodic censuses and programs.

Both the Senate Committee and the House accepted the proposal to consolidate the OFDT with the U.S. Marshals Service. The House recommended $1.647 billion for the Federal Prisoner Detention account, 1.2% below the Administration's request and the Senate committee-reported amount. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act included $2.794 billion for the USMS, consolidating the OFDT and the USMS. Congress accepted the Administration's proposal. The USMS received funding for Salaries and Expenses, Construction, and Federal Prisoner Detention accounts. One issue before Congress was whether to consolidate the OFDT and the USMS, established due to concerns about detention space management in DOJ. The Administration proposed merging the OFDT and USMS to save $5.6 million and improve operational efficiency. Advantages include the USMS managing the detention budget, eliminating bureaucratic layers, and allowing OFDT staff to find efficiencies under USMS command. This would consolidate responsibilities under the USMS for better coordination. The USMS would coordinate procurement of detention space for federal detainees, with an expected increase in population. Congress might consider investing in more permanent detention space. The Administration anticipates increased law enforcement initiatives on the southwest border to address drug and firearms trafficking, leading to longer detention times. The number of arrests for immigration-related offenses has risen, but policies by U.S. Attorneys, DHS, and the federal judiciary have expedited these cases. Detention bedspace for federal detainees is acquired through federal facilities, Intergovernmental Agreements with state and local jurisdictions, and private jail facilities. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has faced challenges in meeting the increase in detention population due to the lack of reliance on Intergovernmental Agreements (IGAs) and federal detention facilities. State and local governments are using their own facilities for detention needs, leading to an increased reliance on private jail facilities for detention space. The National Security Division (NSD) coordinates DOJ's efforts in national security and terrorism. The National Security Division (NSD) was established in response to the recommendations of the WMD Commission and authorized by Congress in 2006.

This was slightly lower than the previous year's appropriation. The Senate Committee on Appropriations and the Administration recommended the same amount, while the House-passed amount was slightly lower at $521.8 million. The final budget allocation under the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act was nearly $511.0 million. The FBI received $511.0 million for FY2013 to focus on preventing terrorism and enforcing federal laws. Since 9/11, their budget has more than doubled, with $8.095 billion allocated for salaries, expenses, and construction. The FBI received $8.232 billion for FY2013, with $8.151 billion for salaries and expenses and $81.0 million for construction. The Senate and House bills both allocated the same total amount for the FBI, with slight differences in salaries and expenses funding. The enacted FY2013 CJS appropriation allocated $8.031 billion for FBI salaries and expenses, with specific amounts for Intelligence, Counterterrorism/Counterintelligence, Criminal Enterprises/Federal Crime, and Criminal Justice Services. The FY2013 request proposed slightly higher allocations in these categories, resulting in a net increase of $114.0 million compared to the FY2012-enacted amount. In FY2013, the FBI received $162.1 million in base adjustments, $15.0 million for financial and mortgage fraud investigations, and $63.0 million in offsets and savings. The offsets included administrative efficiencies, contractor reductions, training and equipment reduction, facilities reduction, information technology savings, NGIC closing, and employee relocation support funding reduction. The closure of the National Gang Intelligence Center was controversial due to its support for law enforcement agencies. The National Gang Intelligence Center (NGIC) provides strategic analysis of gang activity in the United States, staffed by various law enforcement agencies. The FBI stated that closing the NGIC would not impact national gang threat assessment as intelligence sharing would continue at the field level. The Senate and House had differing views on the funding for the National Gang Intelligence Center (NGIC) in FY2013. The House bill provided $9.0 million above the request to sustain the NGIC, while the Senate supported eliminating it. However, the enacted FY2013 appropriation included $9.0 million to maintain the NGIC. The FBI and other federal law enforcement agencies were expected to launch a coordinated anti-gang initiative in FY2013, with a focus on financial fraud. The $15.0 million budget increase requested by the financial community focuses on high loss corporate, securities, and commodities fraud, as well as mortgage fraud. Mortgage fraud includes loan origination schemes, illegal property flipping, and bailout schemes. All financial crime cases fall under the FBI White Collar Crime program. The WCC program focuses on addressing international financial crime through the internet. The Senate bill proposed $15.0 million to combat financial fraud, while the House bill offered a smaller increase of $6.6 million. The House report also addressed fraud related to stimulus funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The FY2013 appropriation provides funding to combat corporate fraud, securities fraud, mortgage fraud, and other financial crimes. Traditional crime programs include public corruption, civil rights, gang violence, organized crime, and violent crime. Both Senate and House reports emphasize the importance of intellectual property crime enforcement and prosecuting foreign nationals suspected of human rights crimes. The Senate report mentions the Innocent Images National Initiative with a funding of $66.8 million, while the House report highlights the FBI's increased resources for investigating severe forms of human trafficking. The FBI increased resources for investigating human trafficking by 17% in FY2012. The FY2013 appropriation requires the FBI to report on agent utilization rates for human trafficking investigations. Cyber crime is a national security threat addressed by the FBI through counterterrorism, counterintelligence, and criminal expertise. The House bill proposed $23.1 million to increase FBI resources for addressing cyber security. The House bill proposed $23.1 million above the request to increase FBI resources for addressing cyber threats and improving physical surveillance capabilities. Both Senate and House reports mentioned support for the Domestic Communications Assistance Center and efforts to enhance law enforcement wireless communications interoperability. The enacted FY2013 appropriations provided funding for national security activities, including counterterrorism and cyber crime. The FBI's intelligence function falls under both traditional crime and national security activities. The Senate and House reports supported FBI efforts to address national security threats, such as international terrorism and surveillance. The House report also addressed issues like domestic radicalization and the Chinese government's use of front organizations. The FBI was directed to report on Chinese front organizations suspected to be controlled by military or intelligence entities. The FBI was also tasked with assessing the threat of economic warfare using state-directed financial tools. Additionally, $500,000 was allocated for a review of the FBI's implementation of 9/11 Commission recommendations in the FY2013 appropriation. The FBI receives significant resources from offsetting fee receipts, reimbursements, and intergovernmental transfers, totaling about $1.471 billion for FY2013. Examples of appropriated resources include funding for FBI participation in National Counter Terrorism Center activities and the Terrorist Explosives Device Analytical Center. The Senate report language proposed $640.7 million for the FBI Criminal Justice Information Services Division, with $278.1 million from direct appropriations for FBI salaries and expenses. The House report language addressed the Next Generation Identification (NGI) initiative at the FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services Division, focusing on enhancing interoperability and real-time data sharing among biometric identity management systems. It also urged the FBI to develop a fee strategy for providing \"rap back\" services, which involve updating criminal history information for individuals subject to previous record checks. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is the only federal agency dedicated to enforcing drug laws. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is the sole federal agency responsible for enforcing drug laws to reduce drug availability and abuse. DEA focuses on disrupting drug trafficking and money laundering organizations, particularly along the Southwest border with Mexico. DEA plays a crucial role in combating drug-related border violence and terrorism, as well as in the Administration's Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention Plan. The DEA plays a key role in the Administration's Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention Plan, targeting improper prescribing practices and promoting proper disposal of unused prescription drugs. The FY2013 budget request for the DEA was $2.051 billion, with proposals to eliminate the NDIC and transfer its responsibilities to the DEA. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended the same amount, while the House recommended slightly less at $2.044 billion. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act provided $2.008 billion for the DEA. The ATF enforces federal criminal laws related to alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives. The ATF works independently and with partners to investigate and reduce crime involving firearms, explosives, arson, and illegal trafficking of alcohol and tobacco products. Congress has increased ATF's budget from $771.0 million in FY2001 to $1.152 billion in FY2012. The FY2013 budget request for the DEA was $2.051 billion, with proposals to eliminate the NDIC and transfer its responsibilities to the DEA. The Administration requested $1.153 billion for ATF, with no new budget enhancements and anticipated savings of over $26.9 million. The largest portion of the request ($876.5 million) would have been allocated to firearms, followed by arson and explosives ($253.7 million) and alcohol and tobacco diversion ($23.1 million). Both Senate and House committee-approved bills would have provided the same funding. The Administration's request for ATF funding included proposals to remove futurity language from two appropriations riders, making them permanent law. One rider prevents ATF from consolidating gun dealer records, while another prohibits electronic searches of out-of-business records. These records are maintained in microform for evidentiary purposes and digitally for retrieval and storage. The Administration requested the removal of futurity language from ATF appropriations riders, making them permanent law. The House bill included futurity language in three additional prohibitions related to ATF salaries and expenses. The enacted FY2013 appropriation included provisions requiring physical inventories by gun dealers and prohibiting ATF from issuing certain regulations. Representative Rehberg's amendment to prohibit multiple long gun sales reports was not included in the appropriation. Since March 2011, congressional attention has been focused on allegations of mishandling in a gun trafficking investigation known as \"Operation Fast and Furious.\" ATF whistleblowers raised concerns about suspects not being arrested promptly, leading to a large number of firearms potentially ending up in the hands of criminals. Over 600 firearms linked to the investigation have been recovered at crime scenes, while over 1,300 remain unaccounted for. In response to Operation Fast and Furious, Congress passed a provision in the DOJ FY2012 appropriation to prevent federal law enforcement officers from facilitating the transfer of firearms to individuals connected to drug cartels without continuous monitoring. The Administration proposed dropping this language in the FY2013 budget, but it was included in the enacted appropriation. Over 1,300 suspect firearms remain unaccounted for. In response to Operation Fast and Furious, fallout included the resignation of U.S. Attorney Dennis K. Burke and reassignment of ATF Acting Director Kenneth Melson. B. Todd Jones was appointed interim ATF Director, nominated by President Obama. Concerns were raised about the appointment of an acting ATF director who also served as U.S. Attorney for the District of Minnesota. Representative Lamar Smith expressed ongoing concerns about Operation Fast and Furious and the residency requirement for U.S. Attorneys. The Omnibus Appropriations Act (P.L. 111-117) raised concerns about B. Todd Jones serving as both U.S. Attorney in Minnesota and acting director of ATF in Washington. The national gun control debate was reignited by mass shootings in Newtown, Aurora, and Tucson, leading President Obama to propose legislative measures for background checks on intrastate firearms transfers. The curr_chunk discusses proposals for universal background checks, increased penalties for gun trafficking, and reinstating a federal ban on certain firearms and ammunition magazines. The Bureau of Prisons was established in 1930 to house federal inmates and ensure centralized administration of the federal prison system. The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) operates federal correctional facilities and contracts with Residential Re-entry Centers to assist inmates nearing release. Congress funds BOP operations through two accounts: Salaries and Expenses (S&E) and Buildings and Facilities (B&F). The S&E account covers the custody and care of federal inmates, maintenance of correctional facilities, and funding for inmate incarceration. The B&F account funds construction, modernization, and repair of facilities. Congress sets a cap on revenue from Federal Prison Industries for administrative expenses. The Administration requested $6.922 billion for FY2013. The Administration requested $6.922 billion for the BOP in FY2013, with $6.82 billion for the S&E account and $99.2 million for the B&F account. The Senate committee-reported amount matched the Administration's request. The House recommended $6.913 billion for the BOP in FY2013, which was 4.0% more than the FY2012 appropriation. The recommendation included $6.820 billion for the S&E account and $90.0 million for the B&F account. The BOP ultimately received $6.77 billion under the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act. Congress may have considered whether the BOP has enough resources to manage the growing federal prison population. The BOP is struggling to manage the increasing federal prison population, leading to overcrowding and strained resources. The staff-to-inmate ratio has also worsened over the years. The five states with the highest prison populations have an average inmate-to-staff ratio of 3.1 to 1. The federal prison population growth has led to the need for more resources for inmate care and programming. The Second Chance Act of 2007 mandated comprehensive reentry planning for federal inmates. The Office on Violence Against Women administers programs under the Violence Against Women Act to improve criminal justice responses to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. The Office on Violence Against Women manages programs under the Violence Against Women Act, with a budget of $412.5 million requested for FY2013. The Office of Justice Programs oversees various agencies and grant programs, with a proposed budget of $1.461 billion for FY2013. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $1.541 billion for the Office of Justice Programs (OJP), which was 4.6% below the FY2012 appropriation but 5.5% greater than the Administration's request. The House-passed amount for OJP was $1.427 billion, 11.7% below the FY2012 appropriation and 2.4% below the Administration's request. Both the Senate Committee and the House rejected the Administration's proposal to transfer funds from the Crime Victims Fund. The proposal to use Crime Victims Fund receipts for OJP discretionary grant programs was not accepted by Congress. There was debate on whether to reduce funding for DOJ grant programs, with opponents arguing that the assistance is crucial for state and local crime-fighting efforts, while proponents advocate for cuts, stating that states should take more responsibility. Proponents argue for cuts to DOJ grant programs, stating states should handle criminal justice independently. The Administration's proposal to use Crime Victims Fund receipts for grant programs was not accepted by Congress. The Research, Evaluation, and Statistics account funds the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The Administration requested $136.0 million for the Research, Evaluation, and Statistics account for FY2013, an increase of 20.4% from the previous year. The Senate recommended $126.0 million, 11.5% more than the previous year but 7.4% less than the Administration's request. The House passed $130.0 million, 15.0% more than the previous year but 4.4% less than the Administration's request. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act allocated $124.4 million for this account. The Administration requested $1.002 billion for FY2013 for the State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance account, which would have been 13.8% below the FY2012-enacted appropriation of $1.163 billion. They proposed to use $220.5 million from the Crime Victims Fund to supplement a $781.5 million direct appropriation for the account, with funds allocated for victims of trafficking, reducing DNA backlogs, and children exposed to violence. The Senate committee-reported amount for the State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance account was $1.059 billion, 8.9% below the FY2012 appropriation, but 5.7% above the Administration's request. The House recommended $1.009 billion for the account, 13.2% below the FY2012 appropriation, 0.7% above the Administration's request, and 4.7% less than the amount approved by the Senate Committee on Appropriations. Both the Senate Committee on Appropriations and the House did not approve the Administration's proposal to transfer funding from the Crime Victims Fund to the State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance account. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations did not accept the Administration's proposal to use receipts from the Crime Victims Fund for discretionary grant programs in the State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance account. Congress provided $1.117 billion for State and Local Law Enforcement under the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, rejecting the proposal to supplement funding with a transfer from the Crime Victims Fund. The Juvenile Justice Programs account includes funding for grant programs to reduce juvenile delinquency and improve juvenile justice systems at the state, local, and tribal levels. The Administration requested $245.0 million for juvenile justice funding in FY2013, which was $17.5 million below the FY2012-enacted appropriation. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $278.0 million for FY2013 juvenile justice funding, 5.9% more than FY2012. The House recommended $209.5 million, 20.2% less than FY2012. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act provides $273.7 million for FY2013 juvenile justice programs. The Public Safety Officers Benefits (PSOB) program offers benefits to public safety officers and their survivors. The Public Safety Officers Benefits (PSOB) program provides benefits to law enforcement officers, firefighters, and first responders. The FY2013 budget requested $78.3 million for PSOB, with the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act providing $78.0 million. The Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Office awards grants to law enforcement agencies for hiring, training, and new technologies. The Administration's FY2013 request for the COPS account was $289.6 million, a 45.9% increase from FY2012. The Senate committee-reported amount was $247.5 million, 24.7% more than FY2012 but 14.5% less than the Administration's request. The House-passed amount was $198.5 million, equal to FY2012 and 31.5% less than the Administration's request. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act provides $217.9 million for the COPS program, which is $71.7 million less than the Administration's request. The Act also allocates $161.6 million for the COPS hiring program, addressing the budget challenges faced by local governments during the recession. The COPS Office received numerous applications requesting funding to hire or retain police officers, with a total of $8.3 billion requested for 39,000 positions. Despite receiving $298.0 million for hiring programs in FY2010 and $246.8 million in FY2011, the demand for funding continued to exceed available resources. The COPS Office received 2,700 applications requesting $2 billion for nearly 9,000 positions. There is debate about funding for nonsecurity discretionary spending, with opponents arguing that state and local governments should pay for police salaries. Proponents believe Congress should help hire new police officers for national safety and security. The Crime Victims Fund (CVF) provides funding to states and territories for victims of crime. The Crime Victims Fund (CVF) is funded by criminal fines, forfeited bail bonds, penalties, and special assessments collected by U.S. Attorneys' Offices, U.S. courts, and the BOP. Congress determines the CVF cap each year as part of DOJ appropriations. In FY2012, the cap was $705.0 million, with a remaining balance of $6.099 billion. The Administration proposed raising the CVF cap by $365.0 million to $1.07 billion for FY2013. The Administration proposed increasing the Crime Victims Fund (CVF) cap by $365.0 million to $1.07 billion for FY2013. However, both the Senate and House Committees on Appropriations rejected this proposal, recommending lower caps of $775.0 million and $720.0 million respectively. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act ultimately set the CVF cap at $730.0 million. The FY2012-enacted appropriation for science agencies was $24.838 billion. For FY2013, the Administration requested $25.090 billion, with the Senate Committee on Appropriations-reported bill proposing $26.679 billion and the House-passed bill suggesting $24.786 billion. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act provided $24.737 billion in post-rescission FY2013 funding for the Science. The Appropriations Act allocates $24.737 billion in FY2013 funding for Science Agencies, without factoring in sequestration reductions. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) was established by Congress in 1976 to advise the President on scientific, engineering, and technological issues. The OSTP director, also known as the President's science advisor, oversees the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) and co-chairs the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) advises the President on science and technology issues. In FY2011, Congress restricted OSTP from engaging in activities with China, leading to a dispute over constitutional authority. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that OSTP violated the Antideficiency Act. Congress restricted OSTP from engaging in activities with China in FY2011, leading to a dispute over constitutional authority. The Government Accountability Office found that OSTP violated the Antideficiency Act. For FY2012 and FY2013, Congress enacted similar restrictions with additional requirements for certification of activities. The Administration requested $5.9 million for FY2013, $1.4 million above its FY2012 level. The FY2013 budget request for OSTP was $1.4 million above the FY2012 level to support national security emergency preparedness communications responsibilities. The Senate Committee on Appropriations proposed $5.9 million for FY2013, the same as the Administration's request. This funding also included support for the Science and Technology Policy Institute (STPI). The House recommended $5.8 million for FY2013 for OSTP and federal agency actions to streamline STEM education programs. The report lists programs for elimination or consolidation and outlines steps for evaluating program effectiveness. The House bill also addresses activities with China, allowing them if OSTP certifies no security risks. The committee remains interested in promoting effective STEM education practices. The House report expressed support for transferring administrative support of PCAST from OSTP to the Department of Energy and encouraged OSTP to ensure sufficient investments in National Nanotechnology. It also directed OSTP to inform the committee of the development of a dissemination strategy for STEM education practices and to report semiannually on progress in coordinating agencies' policies on public access to federally funded research publications. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act provides $5.7 million for OSTP, directing them to provide a completed STEM education research plan and establish an interagency working group on neuroscience. NASA, created in 1958, conducts civilian space and aeronautics activities from headquarters in Washington, DC with nine major field centers. NASA, managed from Washington, DC, has nine field centers and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The FY2013 budget request was $17.711 billion, slightly lower than the previous year.
