Over half have broadband access, 55% have a college degree, 60% are male, and 71% are under 30 years old. The Internet has challenged government control and brought international attention to issues like censorship. The Internet in China has seen significant growth, with up to 134 million users in 2005. Despite government censorship, the Internet has transformed daily life for many Chinese citizens, providing access to communication, entertainment, commerce, government services, and information. The Chinese government censors online content, including political expressions disguised as non-political comments. Despite the majority of Internet users in China using it for entertainment, analysts and policymakers criticize the strict control of news and political content. The hope for increased political expression and democracy through the Internet has not been fully realized, as the government intensifies monitoring and control efforts. In recent years, the Chinese government has intensified efforts to monitor and control Internet and wireless technologies. A study by the OpenNet Initiative found that China has the most sophisticated content-filtering Internet regime globally, targeting various types of harmful information. Critics are concerned about the pervasive filtering of politically objectionable content by the Communist Party of China. Informational websites like BBC, Voice of America, Radio Free Asia, and Wikipedia are regularly blocked in China. News sources like New York Times, Washington Post, South China Morning Post, and CNN are intermittently blocked. Chinese language news sites face more censorship. The Internet is used to influence public opinion, especially in support of nationalistic sentiments. People's Daily has an online forum for discussions on making China stronger, hosting anti-Japanese posts in 2005. The Chinese government employs strategies to suppress politically sensitive content online, including regulations, surveillance, and punitive actions to promote self-censorship among the public. This is evident in the handling of sensitive topics like the Tiananmen Square protests and the death of former Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang. The Chinese government enforces strict regulations on Internet usage, involving surveillance and punitive measures to promote self-censorship. The legal infrastructure is complex, with multiple government agencies overseeing Internet service providers, content providers, and cyber-caf\u00e9s. ISPs are required to obtain licenses and record customer information, while ICPs must adhere to publishing guidelines. The Chinese government enforces strict regulations on Internet usage, involving surveillance and punitive measures to promote self-censorship. Internet content providers must record all content made available and the date it was issued. Internet cafes are required to install software that blocks certain content and keep detailed logs of user activity. Unlicensed cafes were closed in 2004, and monitoring software was installed in others. The Chinese government enforces strict regulations on Internet usage, extending to Internet users themselves. The Ministry of Public Security issued regulations in 1997 prohibiting users from engaging in activities that harm national security, disclose state secrets, or promote content that goes against the government or society. On September 25, 2005, Chinese authorities announced new rules regarding Internet administration, tightening control over online news services and requiring registration for individuals or groups engaged in \"Internet information services.\" This followed the shutdown of unregistered websites by the government on July 1, 2005. The new rules in China require individuals or groups to register as \"news organizations\" to operate websites or distribute news. Approval is difficult due to strict requirements. Popular websites like Sina.com must only publish news without commentary. Electronic bulletin boards and text messages containing news are also regulated. Additionally, there are bans on inciting illegal assemblies to address government concerns about civil unrest. The legal infrastructure in China includes bans on inciting illegal assemblies and activity on behalf of illegal civil groups. Penalties for violating regulations include closure of websites and fines. Internet censorship is enforced through website blocking and keyword filtering at the router level. Some websites delay compliance with censorship directives to maintain market share. In China, routers are programmed to filter politically sensitive words and URLs through proxy servers. The OpenNet Initiative found that China tolerates over-blocking to prevent access to prohibited sites. China's Ministry of Public Security employs 30,000 cyber-police to monitor Internet content, investigate online crimes, and remove objectionable material. The government also encourages citizens to report illegal or harmful information through online reporting centers with rewards. China's Ministry of Public Security employs 30,000 cyber-police to monitor Internet content, investigate online crimes, and remove objectionable material. Xinhua News Agency disclosed that citizens were rewarded for reporting pornography and illegal online gambling. China reportedly holds cyber dissidents in prison for posting subversive content online, with some receiving lengthy prison sentences. Amnesty International stated that cyber dissidents were charged with revealing state secrets or endangering state security. The Chinese government detains Internet political writers as part of its repression of free media. In 2005, 32 journalists were imprisoned in China. Many individuals practice self-censorship to avoid repercussions. There is debate in the US about the involvement of American companies in Chinese Internet censorship. Some analysts argue that U.S. investment in China's Internet industry has increased the flow of global information in the country, despite censorship issues. U.S. companies like Cisco Systems and Juniper Networks have played a significant role in China's Internet infrastructure development, with Cisco facing allegations of assisting in censorship capabilities. Cisco recently secured a contract to provide China with routers equipped with filtering technology that can be used for Internet attacks prevention and potentially for censorship by Chinese authorities. Cisco denies allegations of altering products for Chinese cyber-policing and claims products sold in China are the same as in other countries. U.S. companies like Cisco, Yahoo, and Microsoft have been accused of complying with censorship in China. In 2002, Yahoo and Microsoft were criticized for complying with censorship in China. Microsoft's blog-hosting service, MSN Spaces, censored words like \"democracy\" and \"human rights\" in Chinese blog titles. In December 2005, Microsoft removed the blog of a Chinese journalist at the government's request. In January 2006, Microsoft announced a new policy for closing personal Web logs in foreign countries. Google announced plans to launch a search engine in China in January 2006, despite occasional blocking by the Chinese government. They will not offer email or blog services to avoid disclosing user information. Google will comply with censorship laws but disclose when information is removed. Reporters without Borders criticized the move as a threat to freedom of expression. Other U.S. companies like Secure Computing, Fortinet, and Websense have been accused of aiding China's Internet filtering capabilities, but evidence does not show direct involvement in the government's censorship system. Secure Computing sold authentication systems to China's major telecommunications companies, Fortinet sells anti-virus firewall technology to various institutions in China, and Websense provides Web filtering software to Chinese companies. Websense denies licensing its technology for government censorship. Yahoo has faced criticism for providing the personal email address of Chinese journalist Shi Tao to the PRC government, resulting in his imprisonment for 10 years. Shi had sent notes about media restrictions before the Tiananmen Square anniversary via his Yahoo account to a US organization. Yahoo's cooperation with authorities led to Shi's identification and conviction. Jerry Yang, co-founder of Yahoo, confirmed providing information to Chinese authorities for Shi Tao's conviction. U.S. officials believe technology can promote democratization abroad. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld emphasized the importance of political freedoms in China. The State Department criticized China's media and Internet controls. The US has criticized China for its media and Internet controls, with actions including funding for anti-censorship software and introducing bills like the Global Internet Freedom Act. Congressional hearings have been held to address human rights issues related to Internet freedom in China. The Congressional Human Rights Caucus and House International Relations Committee held hearings on Internet censorship in China. The US Broadcasting Board of Governors promoted Internet freedom in China through Voice of America and Radio Free Asia websites. Safeweb Inc. received funding to set up proxy servers for Chinese Internet users. Since 2003, the BBG has funded DynaWeb and UltraReach to help Chinese Internet users access VOA and RFA websites. DynaWeb's technology regularly changes its IP address to avoid blocking, but previous efforts through email subscriptions failed due to censorship. Bill Xia, DynaWeb's president, emphasized the need for continuous evolution. According to Xia, DynaWeb must evolve to bypass China's Internet censorship. China purchases advanced censorship technology from Western companies, giving them an advantage over counter-censorship efforts in the US. Visits to DynaWeb and UltraReach sites increase during times of tighter censorship, such as the SARS outbreak in 2003. During times of increased censorship in China, the BBG disseminates critical Chinese-language news summaries to recipients in China via email, using techniques to bypass censorship. Some U.S. companies are developing software to help Chinese Internet users circumvent government censorship, with Anonymizer Inc. developing anti-censorship software in 2006. Peacefire is also mentioned as a player in this space. Peacefire, a free speech advocacy organization, has developed protocols for circumventing Internet blocking programs used by Chinese web users. Recommendations for expanding Internet freedom in China include legal prohibitions on U.S. companies aiding PRC government censorship, creating institutions for promoting global Internet freedom, funding counter-censorship technologies, applying pressure at the government level, and establishing codes of conduct for U.S. Internet companies in China to promote free expression within PRC political and business realities. Some analysts suggest laws to prevent U.S. companies from aiding repressive regimes like China. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission proposes an office to monitor global Internet censorship and develop anti-censorship technology. Congressional-Executive Commission on China recommends funding for technologies to help Chinese citizens access censored information. U.S. Internet companies in China seek U.S. government pressure to resist PRC censorship demands. U.S. Internet companies in China are considering responses to censorship, such as informing users of restricted content and demanding legal justifications from Chinese authorities. Observers believe that increased demand for uncensored information from within China could lead to loosening of government controls. When Google was blocked in China in 2002, the government lifted the block after 10 days due to pressure from Chinese researchers and Internet users."
