The Highlands region, spanning over 2,000,000 acres across several states, is vital for clean drinking water, wildlife habitat, and historical significance. The Highlands region, spanning over 2,000,000 acres, is significant for its historical importance, recreational resources, and ecological benefits. It is home to over 1,000,000 residents and forms a greenbelt near major urban areas. The Philadelphia-New York City-Hartford urban corridor aims to preserve natural and agricultural resources, open spaces, and historic sites while promoting sustainable economic growth. Continued population growth and land use patterns in the Highlands region threaten water quality, air quality, forests, migration corridors, and recreational opportunities. The region's natural, agricultural, and cultural resources are at risk due to proximity to major urban areas. The Highlands region's national significance is supported by various studies and reports conducted by the Forest Service and state agencies in the 1990s and early 2000s. The Highlands region, spanning from FY 2001-2006, includes federal lands like the Wallkill River National Wildlife Refuge and the Delaware River Basin.

The Highlands region includes federal lands such as the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, the Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River, the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, and the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. It is important to protect, conserve, restore, promote, and interpret the region's resources for residents and visitors. States and local entities have the primary responsibility for safeguarding the Highlands region. The Federal Government should partner with the Highlands States, regional entities, and local governments to protect, restore, promote, preserve, and interpret the natural, agricultural, historical, cultural, and economic resources of the Highlands region. The purpose of partnering with the Highlands States, regional entities, and local governments is to protect, restore, promote, preserve, and interpret the natural, agricultural, historical, cultural, and economic resources of the Highlands region.
