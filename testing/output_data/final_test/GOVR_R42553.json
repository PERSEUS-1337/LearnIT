    "content": "The Obama Administration released its domestic counter-radicalization strategy in August 2011, known as \"countering violent extremism\" (CVE), to impede the radicalization of violent jihadists in the United States. The strategy focuses on preventing individuals from acquiring and holding radical or extremist beliefs that lead to terrorism. This report examines the implementation of the CVE strategy and offers policy considerations for Congress. The strategy involves various elements within the executive branch and raises issues regarding constitutionally protected activity and effectiveness. Government efforts to prevent terrorist activity in the United States involve two main contexts: clandestine illegal activity and the open marketplace of ideas. Law enforcement focuses on rooting out terrorists and stopping their plots, while private citizens are free to weigh competing ideas. In the open marketplace of ideas, private citizens can freely engage in speech and expression, with some individuals adopting radical ideologies that may lead to terrorism. The federal government's CVE strategy aims to prevent terrorism by helping communities and individuals build resilience against radicalization efforts. The operational realm and marketplace of ideas are interconnected, with actions in one impacting the other. The operational realm and marketplace of ideas are interconnected, with actions in one impacting the other significantly. For example, successful terrorist plots may spur radicalization and generate public fear, while effective investigations may discourage radicalization. Policing within the secretive realm relies on community trust in the marketplace of ideas, and radicalization can expand the pool of terrorist recruits. Effective government strategies to counter radicalization can help prevent terrorist recruitment. A national strategy to counter radicalization can help prevent terrorist recruitment by understanding the process of radicalization and stopping it from turning into terrorist plotting. The NYPD released a study in 2007 outlining a four-step process of radicalization leading to terrorist activities. The NYPD study outlines a four-step process of radicalization towards terrorist activities, starting with exposure to Salafi Islam and ending with individuals identifying as violent jihadists and planning attacks. The FBI's model closely follows this process, but caution is advised when interpreting it. The radicalization process towards terrorism is complex and not easily defined. Experts caution against viewing it as a linear progression, as individuals may not follow all stages or steps in order. Transition from radical to terrorist can depend on chance encounters and timing in one's life. Not all radicals become terrorists, and the process should not be seen as a conveyor belt leading inevitably to violence. Studies by the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Intelligence and Analysis show that radicalization varies across different spectrums, regions, and conditions. Radicalization expert Peter Neumann identifies three core elements in the process: grievance, ideology/narrative, and mobilization. Grievances can be personal or related to broader perceptions, with individuals adopting extremist ideologies to explain their grievances. Counter-radicalization efforts involve engaging with communities affected by terrorism to prevent individuals from acting on grievances based on extremist ideologies or narratives. Scholars have found that when authorities are seen as more legitimate, Muslim-Americans are more likely to cooperate with anti-terror policing efforts. Community engagement aims to increase acceptance of law enforcement authority within localities as part of the Administration's CVE strategy to counter radicalization. The CVE strategy focuses on countering radicalization, particularly of violent jihadists. The Strategic Implementation Plan aims to empower local partners in preventing violent extremism through three core areas of activity. There is no single lead agency for the objectives or managing future activities. The CVE strategy aims to prevent violent extremism through law enforcement expertise and countering extremist propaganda. Future activities include building trust through community policing and engaging with American Muslim, Arab, and Sikh communities for cooperation in preventing terrorist attacks. Professor Deborah Ramirez highlights the importance of linguistic skills, information, and cultural insights within communities to assist law enforcement in identifying suspicious behavior. Law enforcement recognizes the need to establish effective communication with Muslim, Arab, and Sikh Americans to prevent terrorist attacks. Community policing has been successful in cities like New York, Chicago, Boston, and San Diego, and is widely adopted throughout the United States. Governor Martin O'Malley's HSAC working group emphasizes the significance of Community-Oriented Policing. The group chaired by Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley emphasized the importance of public-private partnerships in Community-Oriented Policing to prevent and respond to violent criminal activity, including that motivated by ideological objectives. The federal government's CVE strategy relies on cooperation with local groups to expand engagement efforts and foster preventative programming. A national task force led by DOJ and DHS has been working on this since November 2010. The national task force, led by DOJ and DHS since November 2010, coordinates CVE-related community engagement at a national level. U.S. Attorneys, along with other agencies, play a key role in community outreach efforts, particularly with Muslim, Sikh, and Arab American communities. Attorney General Eric Holder has encouraged U.S. Attorneys to enhance their outreach efforts, leading to a pilot program in December 2010 focused on community engagement. The U.S. Attorneys have been involved in community outreach efforts, including radicalization-related outreach. Examples include meetings with Arab and Muslim community representatives in Portland and Miami, as well as the establishment of the Young Somali-American Advisory Council in Minnesota to address al-Shabaab recruitment. The council includes young members who are educated on civics issues. In February 2011, U.S. Attorneys met with Muslim and Arab leaders in Miami. In November 2010, an alleged jihadist terrorist plotter was arrested for trying to bomb a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland, OR. The U.S. Attorney in Oregon engaged with local Muslim leaders following the plot. Various U.S. government agencies, including DHS, DOJ, and FBI, partner with Muslim American communities for outreach and engagement activities. DHS's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties focuses on counterterrorism and CVE-related matters, advising on civil rights and civil liberties. The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) advises DHS on civil rights and civil liberties issues, communicates with affected individuals and communities, and investigates complaints. Recent domestic CVE-related outreach events have been coordinated by CRCL. DOJ's Civil Rights Division prioritizes prosecution of bias crimes and discrimination against Muslims, Sikhs, and others since 9/11. The Civil Rights Division prioritizes prosecution of bias crimes and discrimination against Muslims, Sikhs, and individuals of Arab and South-Asian descent since 9/11. They have also educated these communities about their rights and government services. The FBI is working on strengthening its relationship with these communities in the United States. The FBI's outreach program aims to enhance public trust and confidence by fostering positive relationships with U.S. organizations against terrorism. Field offices interact with local groups, including Muslim communities, and headquarters engages with advocacy groups. The FBI is part of a team managed by DHS CRCL. Despite support for community engagement, some experts caution about potential challenges. Some experts warn of challenges in developing community engagement programs that go beyond token discussions or events. A study on policing in Arab American communities identified distrust, lack of cultural awareness, language barriers, and immigration concerns as obstacles. Terrorism expert Marc Sageman cautions against government focus on Muslim communities, emphasizing that Muslims are Americans. Engagement with U.S. Muslim communities should be led by local authorities to build trust and counter extremist messages. Challenges include perceptions of unfair targeting and infringement on rights. Government counterterrorism work can impact community engagement if seen as overly aggressive, hindering cooperation in programs. Counter-radicalization is not solely about intelligence or policing. Tension can arise between law enforcement investigations and local partnerships to combat violent crime, impeding community policing efforts. Public discussions on surveillance and recruitment can highlight conflicts with community partnership goals. The NYPD's surveillance of mosques, Muslim businesses, and college students in New Jersey in 2006 and 2007 raised concerns among community groups and civil libertarians. While some defended the legality of these activities, others criticized the lack of coordination with New Jersey officials. A fact-finding review by New Jersey's Office of the Attorney General found no evidence of violations of state laws by the NYPD. The NYPD's surveillance in New Jersey did not violate state laws. The use of informants, especially those with criminal records, in post-9/11 cases raises concerns among Muslim Americans. Informants can manipulate situations and pose risks in investigations. Informants can manipulate situations and pose risks in investigations, causing confusion and dissatisfaction among groups. Their actions can discredit leaders, foster factionalism, and create terrorist threats that would not otherwise exist. This can lead to informants transitioning from passive observers to aggressive actors, impacting constitutionally protected free speech. Additionally, the government may lose legitimacy and support in targeted communities if they feel manipulated. In 2009, the FBI emphasized the importance of building trust with Muslim communities through outreach efforts, denying claims of blanket surveillance or infiltration of mosques. Former FBI agents and prosecutors defend the use of informants as a crucial tool in thwarting terrorism, despite minimal legal constraints on their use. The FBI takes sending informants into mosques seriously to prevent potential attacks. Former FBI officials defend informant use as crucial for thwarting terrorism. However, the Muslim community argues that people cannot be both suspects and partners. The HSAC's CVE Working Group advises law enforcement to be sensitive to perceptions regarding enforcement actions and intelligence. Policy makers must consider the impact of investigative tactics on community-oriented policing goals. The DOJ is encouraging U.S. Attorneys to engage in community outreach, raising questions about their role in CVE efforts. Can terrorism prosecutors effectively build trust with communities wary of law enforcement? Maintaining the integrity of the U.S. Attorney role is crucial in balancing counterterrorism efforts with community relations. The U.S. Attorney role in counterterrorism efforts involves engaging with local groups, particularly American Muslims who lack consensus on national advocacy organizations. The selection of community partners by U.S. Attorneys can impact their legitimacy, but it remains unclear how these groups will be chosen for federal outreach. The U.S. government may establish litmus tests for federal interaction with community groups, considering law enforcement factors in selecting partners. The DOJ's decision to limit ties with CAIR due to terrorism case implications exemplifies how law enforcement influences community engagement. The Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development and its leaders were convicted of supporting Hamas, but CAIR, a Muslim advocacy group, maintains relationships with law enforcement. Fusion centers report terrorism-related activity, potentially causing tension between communities and law enforcement. The Building Communities of Trust Initiative fosters relationships among different groups. The Building Communities of Trust Initiative (BCOT) aims to foster relationships between fusion centers, law enforcement, and local communities. It focuses on training analysts in cultural sensitivity, promoting community policing, and encouraging information sharing for crime prevention and counterterrorism efforts. The U.S. government aims to improve understanding of radicalization through research, analysis, and partnerships. Greater information sharing among state, local, and federal agencies on terrorist recruitment is necessary. Federal agencies need to enhance radicalization-related training for better CVE efforts, including studying the radicalization process and identifying radicalizing individuals. Funding opportunities for research on domestic radicalization have been included, and agencies like DHS, FBI, and NCTC have collaborated on studying homegrown terrorists. The FBI, NCTC, and law enforcement officials discussed a study on homegrown terrorists at the White House in 2012. Another study by NCTC identified four mobilizing patterns among extremists, emphasizing behavioral indicators for radicalization assessment. The study calls for improved information sharing between federal, state, and local law enforcement. In late 2011, efforts were made to disseminate information to state and local officials through the development of case studies on known and suspected terrorists, as recommended by the HSAC in 2010. DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano emphasized the importance of these unclassified case studies in helping law enforcement and communities recognize warning signs of potential terrorist attacks. The studies focus on behaviors and indicators of violent extremism to increase situational awareness and provide information on tactics of terrorists. Napolitano also mentioned conducting \"deep dive sessions\" on CVE issues with local police. In response to concerns about poor counterterrorism training, DHS conducted \"deep dive sessions\" with local police intelligence experts to provide accurate information. The federal government plans to enhance radicalization-related training for federal, state, and local agencies due to instances of offensive and inaccurate information in previous training sessions. News reports revealed that state and local law enforcement officials received inadequate training from unqualified instructors, leading to concerns from public officials and advocacy groups. In August 2011, concerns arose about biased training materials used by the FBI for Joint Terrorism Task Force officers. As a result, the bureau announced a review of all training materials related to religion or culture, consulting with outside experts to ensure quality and adherence to core values. The Department of Justice also initiated a similar review in September 2011, finding less than 1% of materials to be inaccurate or inappropriate. In October 2011, the White House ordered a broader examination of CVE instructional efforts within the federal government. DHS released guidance and best practices for CVE training, emphasizing expert trainers, sensitivity to constitutional values, promoting dialog and learning, adherence to government standards, and tailored objectives. CVE training focuses on trust-building, community resiliency, prevention, intervention, and protecting civil rights. The DOJ and FBI released their own training principles in March 2012, aligning with DHS's goals of enhancing community resiliency, prevention, intervention, and protecting civil rights and civil liberties. However, the focus on training law enforcement in the second SIP objective may lean more towards preventative policing rather than countering radicalization at the grassroots level. It is unclear how much of this training aligns with the Administration's community-based CVE approach. There is a need for training law enforcement on constitutionally protected aspects of radicalization to identify when suspects transition from law-abiding radicals to terrorists. The SIP aims to enhance law enforcement training to identify radicalization and prevent terrorism, but lacks mechanisms for community intervention. This may improve police ability to investigate terrorists but does not address intervention with radicalizing individuals. The SIP focuses on enhancing law enforcement training to identify radicalization and prevent terrorism, but lacks mechanisms for community intervention. Concerns arise about the over-classification of radicalization-related research and training material by security agencies. Excessive secretiveness in government efforts to understand radicalization may hinder public awareness of constitutionally-protected activities. Excessive secretiveness in government efforts to understand radicalization may hinder public awareness of constitutionally-protected activities. A study on radicalization among homegrown violent extremists was not widely released, raising concerns about building trust within local communities. The United States government's secretiveness in understanding radicalization may hinder public awareness of constitutionally-protected activities. This could potentially shake community trust in law enforcement and make community groups less willing to share information. Transparency in this area could allow outside experts to scrutinize government conceptualizations of radicalization and federal training materials. The impact of partnerships with non-government experts on the government's objectives is uncertain. The role of ideology in radicalization is crucial, and it is unclear how the DHS's CVE Training Guidance addresses this issue. The DHS's CVE Training Guidance is unclear on addressing radical ideologies in instructional environments. The SIP highlights the challenges of countering extremist propaganda and legal issues related to the First Amendment. NCTC's efforts include developing a \"Community Awareness Briefing\" to address these issues. The NCTC has led the development of a Community Awareness Briefing to educate and empower parents and community leaders in combating terrorist recruitment. They have also organized seminars to maximize the use of technology in countering violent extremism online. Additionally, the Department of State has facilitated exchanges between foreign CVE experts and U.S. communities. No new activities were reported in late 2011 to counter extremist propaganda. In late 2011, no new activities were reported to counter extremist propaganda. However, in February 2013, the White House announced the creation of an Interagency Working Group to Counter Online Radicalization to Violence, chaired by the National Security Staff. This group includes specialists in countering violent extremism, Internet safety experts, and civil liberties practitioners from various government agencies. Their focus is on developing plans to address online violent extremism and coordinating federal activities in this area. The White House has established an Interagency Working Group to Counter Online Radicalization to Violence, tasked with using federal programs to raise awareness and disseminate tools for staying safe from online extremism. Efforts should affirm American unity and bolster community capacities to contest extremist ideas, while also considering the legitimacy of the agencies leading these efforts. The SIP aims to foster a counter-narrative among American Muslims and questions their willingness to partner with federal agencies like FBI, DOJ, NCTC, and DHS. Figures 2, 3, and 4 outline future activities and efforts under three objectives, with lead federal agencies identified. Partner agencies are not depicted in secondary roles. The language in the figures closely mirrors that of the SIP, and not all component agencies of executive departments are included. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is identified as a lead agency in 43 out of 62 future activities and efforts discussed in the Strategic Implementation Plan (SIP) for countering violent extremism (CVE). This suggests that DHS may become the de facto lead agency for U.S. CVE activities. There is a concern about whether DHS will have a matching level of influence in the further evolution of the CVE strategy, beyond its current implementation responsibilities. The Obama Administration has announced a CVE strategy to address the threat of violent extremism, which may face increased oversight from Congress. Federal CVE efforts focus on engaging with Muslim communities, training, and counter messaging. However, there is a lack of specific initiatives to combat radicalization at the grass-roots level, raising questions about representation within diverse Muslim communities in America. The challenge of representing diverse Muslim communities in America is highlighted by the difficulty in selecting organizations that accurately represent their interests. With 2.75 million Muslims in the US coming from various backgrounds and holding different viewpoints, it is hard to speak of a single Muslim \"constituency.\" Questions arise about the criteria for selecting partners and the transparency of the process, as well as the rules governing continued cooperation once approved. The government may need to provide public guidelines for Muslim community groups involved in CVE outreach to prevent arbitrary decision-making. There is a lack of federally driven guidance on how to intervene with individuals vulnerable to radicalization, similar to the UK's Channel Program. The Channel program focuses on preventing radicalization and terrorism through collaboration with police and stakeholders, providing tailored support. The U.S. may not adopt the program entirely, but the CVE strategy mentions local initiatives like the OJJDP Comprehensive Gang Model as a multidisciplinary approach to addressing community challenges. The preventative model for addressing gangs involves a multidisciplinary approach on various levels, focusing on community mobilization, opportunities provision, and social intervention for young adult and teen gang members. It aims to organize local counter-gang efforts without solely relying on law enforcement-driven outcomes. The preventative model for addressing gangs involves a multidisciplinary approach, including street outreach workers, grassroots groups, faith-based organizations, and law enforcement agencies acting as links between gang-involved youth and needed services. It also includes suppression measures and organizational change and development to effectively address the gang problem by focusing on youth active in gangs or at risk of gang involvement. The model suggests interventions like job training, family counseling, and academic tutoring for at-risk youth. It urges law enforcement to move beyond traditional roles in gang suppression and consider intervention-oriented activities. The CVE strategy lacks details on applying the Comprehensive Gang Model to prevent radicalization. Congress may explore developing a CVE intervention model for the US, with key questions on agency leadership. The Administration's CVE strategy emphasizes the importance of well-informed local communities in countering violent extremist ideologies. However, there is a lack of clarity on how local entities should collaborate with federal partners to implement CVE programs. Congress may need to assess the feasibility and value of utilizing existing federal grant programs for CVE activities, as a comprehensive list of such programs is currently unavailable. Congress may need to consider the feasibility of creating a list or clearinghouse for CVE programs to provide better information and access to local entities. The United Kingdom emphasizes the role of extremist ideologies in radicalization, while the US focuses on pushing back against violent ideologies with a positive narrative. Belief in radical notions is not necessarily illegal in the US, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. The American Civil Liberties Union is concerned about government censorship of Internet content based on countering violent extremist propaganda. The implementation of the CVE strategy raises questions about empowering communities to challenge extremist narratives rather than federal government intervention in determining dangerous ideologies. The CVE strategy raises concerns about government involvement in determining safe beliefs and empowering local communities to counter extremist narratives. The government's role in sifting between dangerous and safe ideas and partnering with state and local governments for framing counter-narratives is questioned. The federal government's partnership with state and local governments and civilian counterparts in developing a counter-narrative is crucial. Oversight is important to prevent the counter-narrative from being seen as propaganda or fueling terrorist conspiracy theories. Congress may need to clarify the definition of \"violent extremist narratives.\" It may be beneficial to have a single federal agency managing the government's efforts in countering violent extremism. The lack of a lead agency in the federal government for counter-radicalization efforts raises concerns about monitoring funding, personnel allocation, and tracking expenditure. Multiple federal bodies issuing similar training guidelines for CVE highlight the need for a single overseeing body to streamline the program. Congress may need to address these issues to enhance the effectiveness of countering violent extremism. The absence of a lead agency in federal counter-radicalization efforts raises concerns about monitoring funding and tracking expenditure. Congress may need to consider designating a lead agency to streamline the program and evaluate its effectiveness. The lack of a lead agency with budgetary control over CVE efforts and clear responsibility for implementation makes it difficult to prioritize spending, evaluate outcomes, and standardize measures of success across federal departments. Without transparency, it is challenging to assess the impact of engagement events and ensure effective monitoring of funding. The lack of transparency in engagement strategies by federal agencies for counter-radicalization efforts may lead to communities feeling coerced into providing information. Some argue that having the same agencies responsible for counterterrorism also lead CVE efforts may not be effective. The strategy for counter-radicalization efforts relies on agencies like DHS, DOJ, and the FBI, which may hinder community engagement due to their enforcement and intelligence missions. Community groups may struggle to see them as full partners, especially if there is already shaky confidence in these agencies. In a 2011 study, American Muslims have less confidence in the FBI compared to other faith groups, with 60% of Muslim Americans expressing confidence in the FBI, while 75% or more of Americans from other faiths do. This disparity may lead Congress to consider the need for greater transparency in the Administration's CVE efforts."
