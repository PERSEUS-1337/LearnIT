MENA countries are major oil and gas producers, accounting for a significant portion of international trade. The region's instability has disrupted energy production and raised concerns about future supply. The MENA region's unrest has disrupted energy production, causing concerns about future supply. This has impacted global energy markets, leading to higher oil prices. Natural gas markets have also been affected, with the greatest impact currently felt in Europe. Oil is traded globally, affecting prices everywhere, while natural gas is traded mostly under long-term contracts. The Brent crude oil price increased by nearly $20 per barrel from December 17, 2010, to $113 per barrel on March 8, 2011, due to unrest in MENA region. This unrest has caused supply reductions and concerns about future supply, impacting global energy markets. MENA region produces 29.1 million barrels per day, a third of global oil production. The MENA region produces 29.1 million barrels per day, a third of global oil supply, with oil exports equaling roughly 40% of the world's oil trade. Unrest in Egypt and Libya, as well as turmoil in Bahrain, raised concerns about disruptions to oil and natural gas transit. Estimates varied on the amount of oil production shut down in Libya, ranging from 0.8 Mb/d to 1.2 Mb/d. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait offered to make up any shortfall in oil production. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have offered to make up for the shortfall in Libyan oil production. Saudi Arabia has increased production by 400,000 barrels per day, but the quality of the additional Saudi crude may not be a perfect substitute for Libyan crudes. European refineries may need to source oil from Nigeria and Azerbaijan, while some Asian refineries may be better equipped to handle the heavier, higher sulfur crude. This redistribution of global supply may lead to price increases, especially for light, low sulfur crude. The redistribution of global oil supply may lead to price increases, especially for light, low sulfur crude. Concerns arise over potential unrest spreading to larger producing countries like Saudi Arabia, the world's second-largest oil producer with significant spare production capacity. Any disruption in Saudi oil production could drive prices considerably higher. The security of the Strait of Hormuz is a major concern due to a third of the world's oil trade passing through it. The United States imported 9.4 Mb/d of oil in 2010, with 2.3 Mb/d coming from MENA countries. Disruption of Libyan exports to Europe has affected global oil prices, impacting household budgets and national economic growth. According to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, rising oil prices can reduce consumer spending and confidence, but the recent increase is not a significant risk for economic recovery or inflation. Analysts estimate a $10 increase in oil price could lower U.S. economic growth by 0.2%. Even if the U.S. produced as much oil as it consumes, international events would still impact oil prices due to global trade. In the scenario where trade is permitted, the drag on economic growth from the trade deficit would be reduced. Wealth would be redistributed domestically from energy consumers to producers to a greater extent. The United States faces less risk from disruptions in natural gas supply from the Middle East and imports only a small percentage of natural gas from the region. U.S. natural gas prices have actually decreased since the unrest began, as the global natural gas market is more regionally segmented than the oil market. Only about 30% of natural gas is traded internationally, compared to 60% for oil. Natural gas is traded internationally, with most exports from MENA going to Europe or Asia under long-term contracts. Unrest has had minimal influence on natural gas markets, with some companies scrambling for LNG cargoes to limit supply disruption risks. Europe is most vulnerable to a natural gas shutdown from MENA, particularly from North African countries like Libya. The complete cut off of natural gas exports from Libya to Italy has led to a 12% increase in European spot prices. Since major protests began, European spot prices have increased by 12%, with Russia increasing pipeline exports to Italy to compensate. However, prices have dropped by almost 7% since a market vendor in Tunisia set himself on fire in December. Europe heavily relies on natural gas supply from Algeria, the third-largest supplier after Russia and Norway. Asian prices have remained stable amidst the unrest in Libya. MENA countries heavily depend on energy exports to fund their economies. MENA countries, with their significant oil and gas reserves, play a crucial role in global energy markets. Changes in government policies affecting resource development can have long-term impacts. Unrest in the region may alter market expectations and increase geopolitical risks associated with energy exports. Countries undergoing regime change may reassess their energy policies, impacting energy development, production, and exports. This uncertainty could lead to a persistent risk premium in the market. While regime change in countries like Libya or Iran may historically cause oil market instability, the impact may differ in Saudi Arabia. Despite potential changes, regional producers may prioritize energy policy continuity for revenue stability. The current crisis in the MENA region could also drive energy policy shifts, even without regime change. The current crisis in the MENA region may lead to changes in energy policy, with some governments increasing public expenditures to dampen unrest. This could result in a need for greater revenues from oil and gas exports. Policy options for Members of Congress include short-term and long-term energy policies, as well as addressing political unrest. The global oil market is not controlled by any one country. The oil market is global, with policies of larger producer and consumer nations influencing it. Policy measures focus on increasing oil supply and reducing demand, but the energy industry has long lead times. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was established as a short-term policy tool to reduce vulnerability to energy supply interruptions. Debates continue on the appropriateness of using the SPR and defining \"severe\" interruptions. The United States focuses on oil in energy policy responses to MENA unrest. Natural gas consumption is mainly domestic, with limited imports. Increasing natural gas production will not significantly impact U.S. oil consumption. Proposals to use more natural gas in transportation are long-term. The U.S. uses little oil in electricity generation. Global LNG exports from the U.S. are limited and unlikely to change the global natural gas market. The U.S. holds 726.5 million barrels of crude oil in the SPR. The government holds 726.5 million barrels of crude oil in the SPR, equivalent to 75 days of imports, to respond to supply interruptions. Oil from the SPR could reach markets within 13 days of the President authorizing its release at a maximum rate of 4.4 Mb/d. An SPR release can be coordinated with other members of the International Energy Agency. Using the SPR may leave less oil in storage to deal with subsequent disruptions. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) authorizes the drawdown of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in case of a severe energy supply interruption. The Department of Energy (DOE) proposed a sale of 6 million barrels of oil from the SPR due to operational issues. One of the caverns at the Choctaw Bayou site in Louisiana may only be able to hold 3.2 million barrels instead of the original 7.5 million barrels. The Department of Energy is concerned about overfilling caverns at the Choctaw Bayou site in Louisiana, proposing to sell excess crude oil to avoid leaks. Congressional views on using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve vary, with some supporting the sale for operational reasons and others calling for a release to lower prices. Critics question the motive behind selling crude for operational reasons and suggest preserving the reserve for more severe disruptions. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) is being considered for potential sale to avoid overfilling caverns at the Choctaw Bayou site in Louisiana. Industry analysts are divided on whether selling crude from the SPR will significantly impact the market. The Administration is monitoring the situation and considering drawing down the SPR as an option. The SPR was established due to limited short-term options to mitigate severe oil market disruptions. Previous responses to oil supply disruptions, such as price controls in the 1970s and a proposed gas tax holiday in 2008, were ultimately rejected. The proposal to reduce the federal gas tax and diesel tax to zero during the summer driving season faced opposition due to concerns about increased oil import dependence and potential impacts on programs funded by the Highway Trust Fund. Policy debates following unrest in MENA have focused on long-term solutions, such as supporting domestic oil and gas production, renewable energy, and mandating greater efficiency. These measures may lower import dependence over time but take months or years to have a significant impact on liquid fuels supply and demand. While reducing the federal gas and diesel tax to zero during the summer driving season could alleviate economic drag from rising oil prices, American consumers may still face higher gasoline prices due to global oil supply disruptions. Congress may use its powers to monitor and influence the executive branch's response to political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Algeria is a significant oil exporter, sending 1.2 Mb/d worldwide, primarily to Europe. Algeria is a major exporter of oil and naphtha to Europe, with natural gas exports primarily to Italy. The country's natural gas exports come from the Hassi R'Mel field, with pipelines to Italy and Spain, and LNG terminals in Arzew and Skikda. Additional pipelines are in development, including Medgaz and Galsi to Europe, and the Trans-Sahara pipeline to bring Nigerian gas via Algeria. Egypt is a minor exporter of oil and the 12th largest exporter of natural gas. Bahrain shares the Abu Safah field with Saudi Arabia and is a minor oil exporter, while not exporting natural gas. Bahrain's proximity to Saudi Arabia's oil production hub and hosting of the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet raise concerns about potential supply risks. Egypt is the 12th largest exporter of natural gas, with regional exports to Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. Concerns arise over Egypt's control of the Suez Canal and the SUMED oil pipeline during unrest, potentially leading to alternative routes and increased costs. Plans are in place to extend the Arab Gas Pipeline to Turkey for further natural gas exports. Iran is a major oil exporter, with plans to extend the Arab Gas Pipeline to Turkey for natural gas exports to Europe. Iran also faces challenges with importing refined products and shortages of gasoline. They cooperate with Qatar in the South Pars/North Field, the world's largest natural gas field. Iran is a net importer of natural gas, exporting small amounts to Turkey but importing from Turkmenistan. Iran, along with Oman, controls the Strait of Hormuz, a critical passage for global oil trade. Iran is a major oil exporter with a belligerent relationship with Israel, adding instability to the marketplace. Iraq has the potential for significant growth in oil production, with exports reaching 1.8 Mb/d in 2009. Iraq does not currently export natural gas but has substantial reserves. The Basrah oil terminal is Iraq's main export terminal, with a capacity of 1.3 Mb/d. Iraq has the potential for significant oil supply growth as it holds the world's fourth-largest proven reserves. Israel is not an oil or natural gas exporter but recent discoveries could make it self-sufficient in natural gas. Jordan serves as a transit point on the Arab Gas Pipeline from Egypt. Energy Concerns: Jordan is a transit point on the Arab Gas Pipeline from Egypt, supplying natural gas to Lebanon and Syria. Rising energy prices pose fiscal challenges for Jordan's government. Kuwait, the 11th largest oil exporter, may face market impact due to its proximity to Saudi Arabia. Despite having abundant natural gas reserves, Kuwait imports natural gas and plans to increase production. Kuwait shares the Partitioned Neutral Zone with Saudi Arabia for resource development. Lebanon is not an exporter of oil or natural gas but serves as a transit point on the Arab Gas Pipeline from Egypt. Libya, prior to the ongoing crisis, exported over 1.2 Mb/d of oil, accounting for approximately 3% of global exports. Libya historically played a significant role in the oil industry and exports natural gas almost exclusively to Italy. The Greenstream natural gas pipeline to Italy has stopped flows, and Libya also exports a small amount of LNG. No supplemental energy concerns are reported for Libya. Oman is a top 20 oil exporter, accounting for about 1% of global exports, and a net exporter of natural gas. Most of Oman's LNG goes to Asia. Oman, along with Iran, is a key player in the oil trade through the Strait of Hormuz. Qatar accounted for 2% of the world's oil exports and is a major exporter of natural gas. Qatar is the fourth-largest exporter of natural gas and the world's leading exporter of LNG. It has two LNG complexes and owns interests in LNG import terminals in Europe and the United States. Qatar also exports natural gas by pipeline to the UAE and hosts the Gas Exporting Country Forum's headquarters. Saudi Arabia is the largest oil exporter globally and a key player in the oil industry. Saudi Arabia, as the largest oil exporter globally, holds most of the world's spare production capacity. Key infrastructure includes the Abqaiq Oil Processing Center and Ras Tanura Oil Exporting Terminal, essential for oil exports. Abqaiq processes oil for export with a 7 Mb/d capacity, while Ras Tanura has a 6 Mb/d export capacity. Any shutdown of these facilities would significantly impact oil markets, potentially leading to price spikes. Saudi Arabia does not export natural gas, using it domestically for industry and power generation. The UAE accounted for 5% of global oil traded in 2009 and had the second-largest spare capacity of OPEC members. UAE is a net importer of natural gas. The UAE has the second-largest spare capacity of OPEC members and is a net importer of natural gas. Yemen is a minor exporter of oil and natural gas, with concerns over terrorist activity affecting LNG exports. Yemen's Bab el-Mandab is a critical shipping chokepoint for oil traffic."
