The committee structure established by Congress assigns a significant role to the Appropriations Committees of the House and Senate, with subcommittees created to aid in their tasks. The number and jurisdictions of these subcommittees have evolved over time to meet changing needs, such as the reorganization in response to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security during the 108th Congress. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees underwent significant reorganizations in response to changes in congressional priorities. This included the elimination of several subcommittees and the shifting of jurisdictions within the committees. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees underwent reorganizations to establish parallel subcommittees in the 110th Congress. The evolution of the committee structure from the 1920s to present is detailed, highlighting the shift towards a more centralized budgetary process. Congressional rules changed to require all appropriations to be considered by the Appropriations Committee, moving jurisdiction from other committees. The appropriations bills for various departments were considered by their respective legislative committees. Prior to the Budget and Accounting Act, appropriations bills were organized along topical lines. Military activities were handled by the Military Affairs Committee, while civilian administration expenses were in the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial bill under the Appropriations Committee's jurisdiction. The appropriations bills were reorganized along administrative lines by the newly established Bureau of the Budget, recommending that salaries and expenses be funded in the same bill as programs and activities administered by a department. This change was concurrent with the congressional consolidation of jurisdiction over appropriations. The House Appropriations Committee adopted the Bureau of the Budget's concept to reorganize general appropriations bills and subcommittees. The committee now comprised subcommittees for various departments and agencies, including Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, Interior, Navy, Post Office, State, Justice, Treasury, and War. The House Appropriations Committee reorganized general appropriations bills and subcommittees, creating a jurisdictional problem for the Senate. In 1922, the Senate reorganized its appropriations jurisdiction and subcommittees to align with the House's new structure. Information on congressional subcommittees was limited before the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946. The subcommittee structure of the Appropriations Committees was relatively stable between 1922 and 1946, with each subcommittee responsible for drafting one of the regular appropriations bills. The main changes during this period were limited to combining certain department bills, such as the Treasury and Post Office Departments bill. The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 aimed to modernize Congress's committee system, including its subcommittees. This led to the separation of various departments from larger bills, such as the Labor Department from the Departments of State, Justice, Commerce, and Labor bill in the 76th Congress (1939). The Judiciary was included in the Legislative Branch bill during the 78th Congress (1943-1944). Subcommittee structure information has been more readily available since 1946. The subcommittee structure in the 80th Congress (1947-1948) included 12 subcommittees covering various departments like Agriculture, Government Corporations, and War Department. The modernization of congressional committees and operations through the Legislative Reorganization Act was accompanied by efforts to update the federal administrative apparatus. These changes in the executive branch had an impact on appropriations bills organized along administrative lines. The changes in the executive branch impacted appropriations subcommittee structure, with fluctuations in the number of subcommittees between 10 and 15. Despite this, each subcommittee continued to draft regular appropriations bills. Various Appropriations Subcommittees were created, abolished, or reorganized from the 80th to the 91st Congress (1947-1970), including one for government corporations and the transfer of Army civil functions to the Deficiencies Subcommittees. Jurisdiction over Army civil functions was transferred to the Deficiencies Subcommittees in both the House and Senate for the 81st Congress (1949-1950). The Senate established a separate subcommittee for Army civil functions in the 82nd Congress, while the House combined Army civil functions with military construction in the 83rd Congress. A Public Works Subcommittee was then established by both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees in the 84th Congress, including Army civil functions. The Senate and House Appropriations Committees established separate subunits within the Public Works Subcommittee in the 84th Congress to handle various matters related to different agencies. A single bill was reported for each fiscal year during this period, with a separate subcommittee for deficiencies being discontinued in both chambers. The House Appropriations Committee reestablished a Deficiencies Subcommittee for the 86th through 88th Congresses. The House Appropriations Committee established separate subunits within the Public Works Subcommittee in the 84th Congress. The Senate Subcommittee on Deficiencies was reestablished for the 87th Congress and met through the 91st Congress. The War and Navy Departments were consolidated to create the Department of Defense during the 80th Congress. The Armed Services Subcommittee was created in the 81st Congress and renamed the Department of Defense Subcommittee in the 84th Congress. During the 91st to 94th Congresses (1968-1976), the Senate had a separate subunit for intelligence activities. Military construction was part of the Defense Appropriations bill before the 83rd Congress. A separate Military Construction Subcommittee was created by the House Appropriations Committee in the 85th Congress (1958). During the 83rd Congress (1953-1954), a separate bill for military construction matters was considered for the first time. The Senate Appropriations Committee established a separate subunit for military construction within the Defense Subcommittee in the 86th Congress (1959-1960) and then a separate subcommittee in the 87th Congress (1961). The House and Senate Appropriations Committees established a subcommittee to consider legislative and judiciary matters in the 83rd Congress (1953-1954). During the 83rd Congress (1953), jurisdiction over foreign operations and Commerce Department appropriations was established by separate subcommittees. In the 84th Congress (1955), a subcommittee for foreign operations was created by the House Appropriations Committee. The jurisdiction over Commerce Department appropriations was later combined with the General Government Subcommittee in the 87th Congress (1961). In the Senate, jurisdiction over foreign operations was transferred to a subcommittee in the 91st Congress (1969). In the House and Senate, jurisdiction over general government matters was initially handled separately but later combined with other subcommittees in subsequent Congresses. In the 87th Congress (1962), a subcommittee was established to handle appropriations for the newly created Transportation Department. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees began considering these appropriations in the 90th Congress (1967). The House Appropriations Committee created the Transportation Subcommittee in 1967, bringing the total number of House appropriations subcommittees to 13. The Senate added the Foreign Operations Subcommittee in 1969, making a total of 14 subcommittees. The structures of both chambers' appropriations subcommittees remained stable at 13 after the Subcommittee on Deficiencies in the Senate was eliminated in the 91st Congress (1970). Between 1971 and 2002, there were minimal changes to the subcommittee structures of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Between 1971 and 2002, there were minimal changes in appropriations subcommittee jurisdictions. The titles of some subcommittees evolved to reflect changes in agency and departmental status, but overall, the structures remained stable with 13 subcommittees in both the House and Senate. The House Appropriations Committee established a new appropriations subcommittee in response to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security in January 2003. This new subcommittee consolidated appropriations jurisdiction from eight existing subcommittees over the various entities comprising the DHS. The House Appropriations Committee reorganized its subcommittee structure in response to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2003. This included merging subcommittees and reducing the total number from 13 to 10 in the 109th Congress. The House Appropriations Committee reorganized its subcommittee structure in response to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2003. This included merging subcommittees and reducing the total number from 13 to 10 in the 109th Congress. The jurisdiction over the Legislative Branch appropriations bill was retained by the full committee, and a new subcommittee on Military Quality of Life and Veterans Affairs was created by combining previous jurisdictions. The House Appropriations Committee reorganized its subcommittee structure in response to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2003. This included transferring jurisdiction over various agencies and programs to different subcommittees, such as NASA, the National Science Foundation, and the Office of Science and Technology Policy to the Subcommittee on Science, State, Justice and Commerce. Other agencies were transferred to the Interior Subcommittee and Labor-HHS Subcommittee. The House Appropriations Committee reorganized its subcommittee structure in response to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2003. This included transferring jurisdiction over various agencies and programs to different subcommittees. The Interior Subcommittee was transferred to the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee, leaving the House with 10 subcommittees. The Senate Appropriations Committee adopted a reorganization plan, transferring jurisdiction over various agencies and programs to different subcommittees. Notably, Veterans Affairs was moved to the Subcommittee on Military Construction, Housing and Urban Development to the Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury and General Government, NASA and other agencies to the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary, AmeriCorps to the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and the EPA to the Subcommittee on Interior. The Senate Appropriations Committee reorganized subcommittees, transferring jurisdiction over various agencies. The EPA was moved to the Subcommittee on Interior, Energy accounts to the Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, and the State Department to the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations. This left the Senate with 12 subcommittees. At the beginning of the 110th Congress, major changes were made to the Senate Appropriations Committee's subcommittees. Jurisdiction over various departments was divided to create new subcommittees, including Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Financial Services, and General Government. The House and Senate made significant changes to their subcommittees at the beginning of the 110th Congress. This included transferring jurisdiction over defense health programs, military facilities sustainment, and housing accounts. The House also reorganized subcommittees, leaving each chamber with 12 subcommittees covering various departments and agencies. The House and Senate reorganized their subcommittees at the start of the 110th Congress. There are now 12 subcommittees in each chamber, covering different departments and agencies. The subcommittees have remained the same since 2007, with parallel jurisdictions for the most part. The only exception is the funding for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which is included in the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug subcommittee in the House. Since 2007, the House and Senate have alternated including funding for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in different appropriations bills. In the 110th Congress, the House created the Select Intelligence Oversight Panel to oversee federal intelligence spending based on 9/11 Commission recommendations. The Select Intelligence Oversight Panel was eliminated at the beginning of the 112th Congress in 2011, containing budgetary and oversight observations for the Department of Defense appropriations bill."
