The \"Overtime Reform and Review Act\" includes incremental increases to the salary threshold for exempt employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. The Secretary must ensure that exempt employees are compensated at a rate not less than the applicable salary threshold established. The \"Overtime Reform and Review Act\" mandates incremental increases to the salary threshold for exempt employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, starting from $35,984 per year or $692 per week on December 1, 2016. Subsequent increases are set at $39,780 per year or $765 per week in 2018, $43,628 per year or $839 per week in 2019, $47,476 per year or $913 per week in 2020, and any rate provided by the Secretary in 2021. The rate of compensation provided by the Secretary for nonprofit organizations, Medicare or Medicaid dependent healthcare providers, and State and local governments is subject to increases based on a study by the Comptroller General and coordination with the Secretary and Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business. The Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration certifies that the increase in the salary threshold has not led to an increased rate of part-time employment or negatively impacted workplace flexibility, benefit structures, career advancement opportunities, or job growth. The Secretary may issue a rule to change the rate of compensation for the salary threshold after December 1, 2021. The section amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to define 'Medicare or Medicaid dependent health care provider' and sets an effective date of December 1, 2016 for the changes. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 is amended to define 'Medicare or Medicaid dependent health care provider' with an effective date of December 1, 2016. GAO will conduct a study. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on the impact of the salary threshold increase under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. The study will analyze the number of small entities affected, regional differences, and the percentile of full-time salaried workers impacted. The study will analyze the impact of the salary threshold increase under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, including disaggregation by State, industry subsector, small organizations, small government jurisdictions, nonprofit organizations, institutions of higher education, Medicare or Medicaid dependent health care providers, and small businesses. It will also assess management and human resource costs, the impact on lower-wage industries by geographic area, and all nonfinancial costs associated with the increase.

It will also assess management and human resource costs, the impact on lower-wage industries by geographic area, and all nonfinancial costs associated with the increase, such as employment impact, workplace flexibility, employee benefits, career advancement opportunities, new business formation, termination, and loss of market share to foreign competition. Additionally, it will examine the impact on individuals in the United States who are marginally attached or discouraged according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The study's findings will be submitted to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives. SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT OF DEPARTMENT OF LABOR RULE. Beginning on the date of enactment of this Act or December 1, 2016, the Department of Labor's rule on exemptions for certain employees will cease to have any effect. The Secretary of Labor will not enforce this rule, and employees will not have the right to take action against employers for non-compliance. Any regulations affected by this rule will be restored as if the rule never existed. Notwithstanding subsection (a), this Act does not create a right of action for an employer to recoup payments made to an employee before the date of enactment or December 1, 2016, if they were compliant with the rule described in subsection (a)(1). SEC. 5. CLARIFICATION OF FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT OF 1938. Sense of the Senate is that the Fair Labor Standards Act requires the Secretary of Labor to issue new rules for changes to the salary threshold through notice and comment rulemaking. Any rule changing the salary threshold must have a specific rate of compensation proposed and cannot be automatically updated. The Fair Labor Standards Act requires the Secretary of Labor to propose specific compensation rates for exempt employees through notice and comment rulemaking. Any changes to the salary threshold must go through this process. The Secretary of Labor is prohibited from issuing any rule that would automatically update the salary threshold without following the required procedures outlined in the Fair Labor Standards Act."
