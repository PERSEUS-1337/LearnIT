    "content": "The Act titled \"Consumer Product Risk Reporting Act of 2001\" allows for repair, replacement, or refund of consumer products. The Consumer Product Safety Act is amended to allow the Commission to order manufacturers, distributors, or retailers to take specific actions if their chosen action is not in the public interest. The Consumer Product Safety Act allows the Commission to order manufacturers, distributors, or retailers to take specific actions if their chosen action is not in the public interest. If the Commission determines the elected action is not in the public interest, they shall order a different action to be taken. The Commission can order manufacturers, distributors, or dealers to take specific actions if their chosen action is not in the public interest. If the Commission deems the elected action as not in the public interest, they will order a different action to be taken. If the Commission determines that the chosen action is not in the public interest, they can order the manufacturer, distributor, or dealer to take a different specified action. SEC. 3. CIVIL PENALTIES. Section 20(a) of the Consumer Product Safety Act is amended to set a civil penalty of up to $7,000 for each violation of section 19. Violations of specific sections within section 19 will be treated as separate offenses. The second sentence of paragraph (1) does not apply to violations of certain sections within section 19. The penalty amount for violations of section 19 of the Consumer Product Safety Act can be adjusted for inflation by increasing it based on the cost-of-living adjustment for the preceding 5 years. The penalty amount for violations of section 19 of the Consumer Product Safety Act can be adjusted for inflation every 5 years based on the Consumer Price Index. The Commission will round up the penalty amount to the nearest multiple of $1,000 for amounts less than or equal to $10,000, and to the nearest multiple of $5,000 for amounts greater than $10,000. The authorized penalty amount will be published in the Federal Register by December 1 of every 5th calendar year. The Federal Hazardous Substances Act allows for civil penalties up to $7,000 for violations of section 4, with adjustments based on the Consumer Price Index every 5 years. A violation of subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), (f), (g), (i), (j), or (k) of section 4 constitutes a separate offense for each substance involved. Violations of section 4(e) are separate for each failure to comply, with each day of violation being a separate offense, except for violations of subsections (a) or (c) if the violator is not the manufacturer, importer, or distributor of the substance. When assessing penalties for violations of section 4, the Commission considers the substance's nature, risk of injury, occurrence of injury, amount distributed, and the business size of the violator. Civil penalties may be imposed for violations without prior knowledge or notice from the Commission. The Commission may compromise civil penalties for violations of section 4 by considering factors such as business size, substance nature, risk of injury, occurrence of injury, and amount distributed. The penalty amount can be deducted from any sums owed by the United States to the violator. The term 'knowingly' in paragraph (1) refers to having actual knowledge or presumed knowledge. The penalty amount authorized in paragraph (1) shall be adjusted for inflation by increasing the amount referred to in paragraph (1) by the cost-of-living adjustment for the preceding 5 years. Any increase determined under the preceding sentence shall be rounded up based on specific criteria. The Commission shall prescribe and publish the authorized penalty amount for violations every 5 years based on the Consumer Price Index. The penalty amount is adjusted for inflation by increasing it with the cost-of-living adjustment for the preceding 5 years. The authorized penalty amount is adjusted every 5 years based on the Consumer Price Index for the month of June preceding the adjustment. SEC. 4. CRIMINAL PENALTIES. Section 21 of the Consumer Product Safety Act is amended to impose fines or imprisonment for individuals or organizations knowingly violating section 19. Individual directors, officers, or agents of a corporation involved in such violations may also face penalties. Section 5(a) of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act is amended to impose criminal penalties for violations of section 4, with fines or imprisonment for individuals and organizations. Repeat offenses or willful violations may result in increased penalties, including imprisonment for up to 3 years. The penalty for violations of section 4 of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act can result in imprisonment for up to 3 years or a fine under title 18, United States Code, for individuals or organizations."
