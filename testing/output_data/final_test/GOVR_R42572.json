    "content": "The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, creating the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection within the Federal Reserve System. This gives the Bureau authority over consumer financial products and services, including nondepository financial institutions, with powers for rulemaking, enforcement, and supervision. The act aims to enhance federal consumer protection regulations and standards for these entities. The Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 transferred consumer compliance authority to the Bureau from banking regulators. The Bureau now has primary rulemaking authority over federal consumer protection laws, including the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. The CFP Act has been controversial, with the 113th Congress overseeing its implementation and considering changes to the Bureau's structure and funding. The report provides an overview of the regulatory structure of consumer finance under existing federal law before the Dodd-Frank Act and analyzes how the CFP Act changes that legal structure, focusing on the Bureau's organization, supervisory authorities, rulemaking powers, and funding. The CFP Act, effective on July 21, 2011, consolidated the authority to write rules and enforce federal consumer financial protection laws previously held by five banking regulators, the FTC, and HUD. Regulators' jurisdiction varied based on institution type and financial activities, with the OCC supervising national banks and the FRB overseeing domestic operations of foreign banks. The Federal Reserve System supervised domestic operations of foreign and state-chartered banks, while the FDIC oversaw state-chartered banks not part of the FRS. The NCUA supervised federally insured credit unions, and the OTS supervised federal savings and loan associations. The five banking regulators were responsible for regulating safety, soundness, and consumer compliance. The banking regulators have broad authority to ensure compliance with consumer protection and fair lending laws, including setting regulatory standards and conducting on-site examinations of depository institutions. They have supervisory and enforcement powers to address issues before they harm consumers, counterparties, or the institutions themselves. Consumer compliance issues were informally handled by the FTC for nondepository financial institutions, lacking upfront supervisory authority. State regulators primarily supervised nondepository institutions, as the FTC's powers were limited to ex post enforcement without safety and soundness authority. State regulators had varying levels of supervision over financial institutions, with federal laws regulating specific consumer products and activities. Laws like TILA, ECOA, RESPA, TISA, and FDCPA impose disclosure requirements and restrictions on consumer credit, lending, home loans, deposit accounts, and debt collection practices. Before the Dodd-Frank Act, the FRB had the rulemaking authority for federal consumer financial protection laws, while enforcement was divided among banking regulators, the FTC, and HUD. Banking regulators had both prudential and consumer compliance powers over depository institutions, focusing more on regulation and supervision than enforcement. The FTC regulated nondepository financial institutions. Before the Dodd-Frank Act, the FTC was the primary regulator of nondepository financial institutions with limited authority for ex post enforcement. Depositories and nondepositories had to comply with federal consumer financial laws, regulated by the FRB. The complex regulatory system was criticized for failing to protect consumers and creating market inefficiencies. The pre-Dodd-Frank Act regulatory system faced criticisms for inefficiencies and a lack of consumer protection. Proponents suggested consolidating federal consumer financial regulatory powers to address issues like regulatory arbitrage and a focus on safety over consumer compliance. Regulatory arbitrage allowed financial institutions to exploit loopholes, driven by competition between depositories and nondepositories. Competition between depositories and nondepositories, different types of depository charters, and financial regulators fueled competitive pressures due to overlap in consumer products and services. Some believed that costly supervisory burdens on depositories gave nondepositories a competitive advantage in certain markets, leading banking regulators to potentially lower supervisory standards to help depositories compete. Banking regulators may have relaxed scrutiny to help depositories compete with nondepositories by changing their charters. Statutory changes have reduced differences between depository charters, making it easier for institutions to switch without altering business practices. The primary regulator associated with a charter could influence an institution's decision to switch charters for lighter regulatory oversight. Some argued for consolidating consumer compliance regulatory authority in a single agency to prevent a \"race-to-the-bottom\" among banking regulators competing to attract institutions with lighter regulatory oversight. This would level the playing field for depositories and nondepository financial institutions. The federal consumer financial protection regulatory system faced criticism for lacking a federal agency with both the mission and legal authority to effectively regulate consumer markets. Banking regulators prioritized safety and soundness over consumer protection, potentially overlooking practices harmful to consumers if profitable for banks. The FTC had a consumer focus but lacked authority to regulate depositories. Some argued that these constraints hindered consumer protection and market efficiency. Warren and Bar-Gill highlighted the need for regulators with both authority and motivation for effective regulation. The CFP Act consolidates consumer financial protection powers under the CFPB, empowering it with rulemaking, supervisory, and enforcement authority. This shift aims to address the lack of both authority and motivation for effective regulation in consumer credit markets. The CFP Act consolidates consumer financial protection powers under the CFPB, but other agencies still hold some consumer protection powers at the federal level. The Act imposes limitations on the Bureau's authority, and policy questions arose during legislative debates regarding the balance between safety and soundness regulation of financial institutions. The question is how to balance safety and soundness regulation of depositories with consumer compliance. There is overlap between prudential and consumer compliance regulation, but conflicts can arise. Safety and soundness regulators may favor profitable banking activities to meet capital requirements, while consumer protection regulators may view them less favorably if profits are gained unfairly or deceptively. During legislative debates, the question arose about treating large and small financial institutions differently in the regulatory structure. Smaller depositories may find examinations more disruptive and compliance costs more burdensome compared to larger institutions. Many attribute more blame for the recent financial crisis to large financial institutions than smaller ones, suggesting that larger institutions should face more stringent and costly regulations. The Dodd-Frank Act aims to prevent future financial crises by regulating both large and small institutions. The challenge lies in defining the regulatory role over businesses that rely on financial services, like clothing stores that accept credit cards and offer store rewards. The Dodd-Frank Act regulates financial institutions to prevent future crises, including clothing stores offering credit cards and store rewards. The Bureau's authority varies based on institution size and type, with some instances using rigid rules and others subjective standards. Regulatory authority allocation is based on policy considerations and the potential for overreach. The regulatory authority of prudential regulators and the CFPB varies based on institution size and type. Compliance costs and the impact on credit availability will depend on the type of institution providing financial products and services, as well as how aggressively regulators enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB's broad supervisory, enforcement, and rulemaking powers are similar to banking regulators, but with less historical certainty. Concerns exist that the CFPB's consumer-focused approach may lead to overreach, restricting consumer credit and increasing regulatory costs. The Bureau aims to enforce federal consumer financial laws consistently to ensure consumer access to financial products and services. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) ensures fair, transparent, and competitive markets for consumer financial products. It operates independently within the Federal Reserve System, with the Director appointed by the President. The Bureau's authorities are centralized in the Director, who cannot be influenced or removed by the Federal Reserve Board. The Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is appointed by the President for a five-year term and can only be removed for specific reasons. The Director has the authority to hire employees, delegate powers, and steer the course of the CFPB independently. The Bureau's structure is similar to the OCC, with units focusing on consumer financial research, providing guidance to underserved areas, and monitoring consumer complaints. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has established various offices to address consumer complaints and promote financial literacy. These offices include Fair Lending, Financial Education, Service Member Affairs, Financial Protection for Older Americans, and Private Education Loan Ombudsman. The Bureau's authorities include supervision, enforcement of consumer protection laws, and rulemaking powers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, established by the Dodd-Frank Act, has various powers including supervision of nondepository financial institutions and rulemaking. It has authority over consumer financial products and services such as deposit taking, mortgages, credit cards, loan servicing, debt collection, and more. The Bureau also oversees \"service providers\" who offer services related to consumer financial products. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, established by the Dodd-Frank Act, has broad jurisdiction over consumer financial products and services. The CFP Act imposes exceptions and limitations on the Bureau's powers, with some institutions clearly defined for regulation while others are subject to the Bureau's discretion. Interpretation of these standards can impact the Bureau's powers, regulatory burden on entities, and consumer financial markets. The CFP Act transfers consumer compliance supervisory authority from banking regulators to the CFPB for depository institutions with over $10 billion in assets. The Bureau has the power to examine these institutions for compliance, but safety and soundness oversight remains with their banking regulators. Coordination with prudential regulators is required, and a conflict resolution procedure is established. The CFPB has the authority to resolve conflicts with prudential regulators and may require reports directly from larger depositories. It safeguards sensitive information of financial institutions but faces challenges in sharing this information with third parties. The CFPB regulates confidential bank information to maintain a competitive marketplace. Access to this information is usually through litigation due to restrictions on public disclosure. The CFPB has rules on handling and sharing confidential information, similar to banking regulators. The CFPB's handling of confidential bank information is similar to banking regulators' rules, but concerns exist about potential sharing with state attorneys general for investigations. The Bureau's focus on consumer protection may overlook the impact on institutions' safety and soundness. Collaboration with state attorneys general is a key strategy for enhancing consumer protection. The CFPB and state attorneys general agreed to share information and collaborate on enforcement priorities to protect consumers of financial products. They will support each other in investigations and pursue legal remedies for transparency and fairness in the markets. The CFPB has limited supervisory authority over smaller depository institutions, with the primary consumer protection powers remaining with prudential banking regulators. Time will reveal how the Bureau handles confidential information and whether it shares it with third parties. The CFPB has limited supervisory authority over smaller depository institutions, with prudential regulators providing access to examination documents. The Bureau may require reports directly from depositories and can refer potential enforcement actions against smaller institutions to their regulators. Nondepository financial institutions are also regulated by the CFPB. The CFPB has regulatory authority over nondepository financial institutions, including providers of private student loans, payday loans, and entities involved in mortgage-related activities. It can also regulate larger participants in consumer financial markets and entities engaging in conduct that poses risks to consumers. This discretion allows the Bureau to adapt to market changes and regulate entities offering consumer financial products. The CFPB has regulatory authority over nondepository financial institutions, including private student loan providers, payday loan companies, and entities involved in mortgage-related activities. It can also regulate larger participants in consumer financial markets and entities engaging in conduct that poses risks to consumers. This discretion allows the Bureau to adapt to market changes and regulate entities offering consumer financial products, potentially creating uncertainty for nondepository financial institutions not clearly falling within regulated categories. The CFPB may alleviate concerns by providing advance notice of its intent to exercise authority over specific institutions. The CFPB has regulatory authority over nondepository financial institutions, including private student loan providers, payday loan companies, and entities involved in mortgage-related activities. It can also regulate larger participants in consumer financial markets and entities engaging in conduct that poses risks to consumers. The Bureau requires covered nondepository institutions to register, undergo examinations and background checks, and comply with consumer protection measures. The CFPB serves as the primary enforcer of federal consumer financial laws for covered nondepositories and has rulemaking authority over them. This marks a significant shift from past federal regulation, which focused on ex post enforcement. The CFPB has the potential to regulate covered nondepositories similarly to banks, thrifts, and credit unions, potentially increasing regulatory costs for these institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act exempts certain entities from CFPB jurisdiction, but the statutory language defining exemptions is complex and subject to Bureau interpretation. The CFPB has the authority to regulate merchants, retailers, and sellers of non-financial goods and services if they regularly extend credit with a finance charge and are significantly engaged in offering consumer financial products or services. This regulatory authority also applies if they assign or sell consumer debt or extend credit that significantly exceeds the market value of their goods. The CFPB has authority over merchants, retailers, and sellers of non-financial goods and services who regularly extend credit with a finance charge or assign consumer debt. The Bureau's jurisdiction is limited over certain small businesses under the Small Business Act. The CFPB has authority over merchants, retailers, and sellers of non-financial goods who extend credit with a finance charge. Small businesses may fall outside the Bureau's regulatory authority due to exceptions in the CFP Act. Compliance with TILA and regulations is required for all furniture stores extending consumer loans. The Bureau's supervision of nonfinancial goods sellers is limited but not insignificant, based on subjective standards. The CFPB may regulate financial activities of automobile dealers beyond normal business, such as direct consumer credit extension. Jurisdiction applies to dealers offering consumer financial services. The CFPB has jurisdiction over automobile dealers offering consumer financial products or services unrelated to vehicle sales or services. The CFP Act streamlines the rulemaking process for the FTC to issue unfair or deceptive trade practice rules against dealers. The CFP Act authorizes the FTC to issue rules for automobile dealers through informal rulemaking procedures. Real estate brokers, agents, tax preparers, and accountants are generally not under the Bureau's authority unless they extend credit or offer consumer financial products. Attorneys are exempt from the Bureau's supervision and enforcement authority. The CFP Act exempts attorneys from the Bureau's supervision and enforcement authority, except when they sell consumer financial products unrelated to legal services. Attorneys providing credit based on legal awards to clients may not be regulated, but those regularly offering similar loans to non-clients may not be exempt. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes procedures for the Bureau to follow when proposing and prescribing rules, including specific procedures for certain types of rulemaking. The Act exempts attorneys from the Bureau's supervision and enforcement authority, except when they sell consumer financial products unrelated to legal services. Attorneys providing credit based on legal awards to clients may not be regulated, but those regularly offering similar loans to non-clients may not be exempt. Other entities and activities outside of the Bureau's jurisdiction include insurance companies, employee benefit plans, entities regulated by state securities commissions, SEC or CFTC, Farm Credit Administration, and donations to tax-exempt charities. The CFP Act authorizes the Bureau to prescribe rules and issue orders to prevent unfair practices in consumer financial laws. The Bureau must consult with financial regulators before proposing a rule and consider the impact on consumers, smaller depositories, and rural areas. The CFP Act requires the Bureau to evaluate the impact of proposed regulations on small businesses, including any projected increase in credit costs and alternatives to minimize the impact. The Bureau may convene a small business advocacy review panel before proposing regulations with significant economic effects. The Flexibility Act requires the Bureau to evaluate the impact of proposed regulations on small businesses by convening small business advocacy review panels. The panels issue reports on the potential impact of the regulations and provide recommendations on how to simplify the rules or reduce compliance costs. The CFP Act also transfers rulemaking authority to the CFPB under consumer laws. The CFPB shares rulemaking authority with other financial regulators under consumer laws. The FSOC can set aside a regulation if it poses a risk to the banking or financial system. The FSOC has the power to veto regulations that pose a risk to the financial system. The CFPB can declare acts or practices as unlawful if they are unfair, deceptive, or abusive, giving them discretion in enforcement. The CFPB's authority to regulate unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices is similar to the FTC's mandate. While the statutes defining \"unfairness\" are almost identical, the scope of the CFPB's authority is limited to consumer financial products and services. The FTC's authority covers a broader range of acts or practices in commerce compared to the CFPB. The procedural requirements for rulemaking differ between the two agencies, with the FTC following more onerous procedures. Additionally, the term \"abusive\" is not explicitly addressed in the FTC Act, leading to a lack of long-standing guidance on its meaning. The CFP Act provides statutory guidance on the term \"abusive,\" allowing the Bureau flexibility to regulate emerging business practices. The CFP Act allows the Bureau flexibility to regulate emerging business practices for consumer benefit, imposing disclosure requirements to help consumers understand financial products and services. If a majority of states request a new regulation, the Bureau must issue a notice of proposed rulemaking. The Bureau must issue a notice of proposed rulemaking on the subject to assess consumer protection, benefits, discrimination, and safety risks. If a rule is not finalized, an explanation must be published in the Federal Register. The CFPB has authority to regulate various consumer activities under federal laws predating the Dodd-Frank Act. The CFPB has rulemaking authority over various consumer financial protection laws, but not all federal laws. Funding for the Bureau primarily comes from a transfer of funds, unlike most executive agencies. The CFPB is funded primarily by a transfer of non-appropriated funds from the Federal Reserve System's earnings, with caps set at 10% for FY2011, 11% for FY2012, and 12% going forward. The Bureau's estimated budget is $541 million for FY2013 and $497 million for FY2014, with additional appropriations authorized if necessary. The CFPB is authorized to receive $200 million per year for FY2010-FY2014 if its funding from the Federal Reserve is deemed insufficient. The Bureau has not requested these funds yet. Additionally, a Consumer Financial Civil Penalty Fund is established for penalties collected by the Bureau, which can be used for victim compensation and consumer education programs. The Bureau has less flexibility in fund transfers compared to other banking regulators. The CFPB has less flexibility in fund transfers compared to other banking regulators, but it is insulated from uncertainties in the congressional appropriations process. Congress can influence the Bureau's budget through semi-annual reports and Director appearances before relevant committees. The CFPB has the authority to write rules for federal consumer financial protection laws and has supervisory powers over larger depositories. It does not have primary supervisory powers over smaller depositories and has new powers to regulate nondepository financial services. The CFPB has new federal consumer financial protection powers to regulate nondepository financial institutions, but certain institutions are exempt. There is uncertainty about how the agency will use its broad authorities, leading to concerns about excessive restrictions on consumer credit and increased regulatory costs. The CFPB has new federal consumer financial protection powers to regulate nondepository financial institutions, with concerns about excessive restrictions on consumer credit and increased regulatory costs. Policy makers will evaluate the CFP Act's performance to determine if amendments can improve consumer protections, access to credit markets, and reduce compliance costs."
