    "content": "The treatment of political prisoners in Burma has influenced U.S. policy for over 25 years, with sanctions imposed due to the imprisonment of figures like Aung San Suu Kyi. The release of political prisoners was a condition for sanction waivers by the Obama Administration. William J. Mozdzierz discussed human rights in Burma at the U.N. Human Rights Council in 2017. The U.S. government expressed concern over new political arrests in Burma and called for the immediate release of political prisoners. The issue of political prisoners in Burma may impact U.S. policy towards the country. Burma's ruling military junta transferred power to a new Parliament and President Thein Sein in 2011. Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy took control of the Union Parliament in 2016. The National League for Democracy (NLD) took control of the Union Parliament after winning the 2015 elections. Despite periodic pardons, authorities in Burma continue to arrest and imprison individuals for expressing political views. The lack of agreement on the definition of \"political prisoner\" and the presence of numerous laws contribute to the ongoing issue of political imprisonment in Burma. The issue of political imprisonment in Burma persists due to outdated laws restricting freedom of speech, assembly, and press. Despite some legal reforms under the Thein Sein government, new laws have been passed that limit political expression. The NLD government has made little progress in repealing these laws, contributing to ongoing political imprisonment in Burma. The persistence of political imprisonment in Burma is attributed to the authority held by the Tatmadaw's Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing over security forces. President Win Myint has control over criminal prosecution and amnesty powers. To address political imprisonment, options like reimposing sanctions or providing assistance in repealing laws can be considered by the 116th Congress and the Administration. The number of political prisoners in Burma fluctuates over time, depending on various factors such as the termination of prison sentences, pending trials, and new arrests by security forces. The options to address political imprisonment include reimposing sanctions, revising laws, and considering the impact on other priorities in U.S. relations with Burma. The Assistance Association of Political Prisoners (Burma), or AAPP(B), provides monthly reports on the number of political prisoners in Burma, based on its definition and network of researchers monitoring arrests, detentions, trials, and incarceration. The monthly reports from AAPP(B) detail the number of political prisoners in Burma, including those serving sentences, in detention awaiting trial, and awaiting trial outside of prison. The number of political prisoners has been gradually increasing since June 2017, despite a previous decline after the NLD-led government took power in April 2016. The success of Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD in Burma's 2015 elections raised hopes for the release of political prisoners. Former President Thein Sein's promise to free all \"prisoners of conscience\" was not fully realized. The NLD government vowed not to arrest political prisoners and to define the term officially. After the NLD's victory in the 2015 elections, former President Htin Kyaw and State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi worked to release political prisoners. By April 2016, they had secured the release of nearly 235 individuals involved in peaceful political activities. Orders were issued to drop charges and grant amnesty to promote national reconciliation. Between April 2016 and April 2019, the NLD-led government in Myanmar released a total of 8,541 prisoners, including 36 political prisoners. President Win Myint granted amnesty to 9,551 prisoners in April 2019, with 2 of them being political prisoners. Despite these actions, the AAPP(B) criticized the government for continuing to persecute journalists and individuals for speaking out, highlighting the broken promise made by the NLD in 2016 to release all political prisoners. In 2019, President Win Myint granted amnesty to a total of 23,019 prisoners, including 20 political prisoners. Among those released were journalists Kyaw Soe Oo and Wa Lone, as well as individuals imprisoned under various restrictive laws in Myanmar. According to a spokesperson from the State Counsellor's Office, 27 people affiliated with three EAOs were released as part of peace efforts. The NLD-led government continues to arrest individuals for political reasons using outdated laws. AAPP(B) reported that 25 political prisoners were convicted under the Unlawful Association Act of 1908, while 4 were imprisoned under Section 505(b) of the Penal Code. Several individuals in Myanmar have been imprisoned for causing fear or alarm to the public, with some convicted under the Telecommunications Act of 2013. Notable cases include a former child soldier, two Reuters reporters, and individuals accused of defaming the Burmese military during protests. Aung Ko Htwe was convicted and sentenced to two years imprisonment with hard labor for his alleged defamation of the Burmese military during peaceful protests in Mytkyina in April 2018. He claimed he was kidnapped and enlisted in the Burmese Army at the age of 10, deserted in 2008, and was charged with murder. His sentence was commuted to 10 years, and he was later arrested for violating Section 505(b) of the Penal Code. Kyaw Soe Oo and Wa Lone, reporters for Reuters, were arrested in December 2017 for allegedly violating the Official Secrets Act of 1923. They were accused of possessing secret government documents related to Rakhine State and security forces. After an eight-month trial, they were acquitted of subsequent charges but remain in prison serving out their term. The trial of Kyaw Soe Oo and Wa Lone lasted over eight months with conflicting testimony. A police lieutenant admitted burning his notes on the case. Captain Moe Yan Naing testified that police officers were ordered to entrap the reporters with secret documents. After his testimony, he was arrested. The journalists were convicted of violating the Official Secrets Act and sentenced to seven years in prison. The U.S. Embassy expressed concern over the conviction. The conviction of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo in Myanmar raises serious concerns about rule of law and judicial independence. The reporters' imprisonment is seen as a setback to democratic freedoms in the country. The U.S. government and then-Ambassador Nikki Haley have called for their immediate release, highlighting the importance of a free press in holding leaders accountable. The conviction of two journalists in Myanmar is a stain on the government, with calls for their immediate release from various governments and human rights organizations. The Supreme Court upheld their convictions, drawing criticism for the negative signal it sends about freedom of expression and journalist protection in Burma. The State Department urged Burma to protect freedoms and reunite the journalists with their families. Kyaw Soe Oo and Wa Lone were among the 6,520 prisoners granted a pardon on May 7, 2019. Lum Zawng, Nang Pu, and Zau Jet were arrested for defamation of the Burmese military and sentenced to six months in jail on December 7, 2018. Several embassies and human rights organizations called for their release. Several embassies and human rights organizations criticized the convictions of three activists in Burma, calling for their immediate release. Nang Pu was released for health reasons, while Lum Zawng and Zau Jet were granted pardons. The definition of a political prisoner lacks consensus, with no single international standard. The State Department considers someone a political prisoner if incarcerated for political reasons under certain laws. A political prisoner is defined as someone incarcerated under illegitimate laws restricting human rights or based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or group membership. It also includes those imprisoned on false charges with underlying discriminatory motivations or receiving disproportionate punishment due to their identity. This definition excludes individuals who have moved beyond advocacy and dissent. The State Department's definition of a political prisoner excludes those who have committed acts of violence. They emphasize the need for consensus definitions and consider individual circumstances when determining political prisoner status, especially in cases involving ethnic-based militias in Burma. Some analysts exclude detainees associated with Burma's ethnic-based militias from estimates of political prisoners due to armed conflicts with the Burmese military. Ex-President Thein Sein and Aung San Suu Kyi define political prisoners as \"prisoners of conscience,\" excluding those who have committed criminal acts. International groups like Amnesty International also focus on \"prisoners of conscience.\" The AAPP(B) and HRW have a broader definition of political prisoner than Ex-President Thein Sein and Aung San Suu Kyi, including those involved in armed resistance against the government in Naypyidaw due to state violence against ethnic minorities. The AAPP(B) rejects limiting political prisoners to \"prisoners of conscience\" as it may exclude many detainees falsely accused of nonpolitical crimes. The AAPP(B) views armed struggle as a valid form of political opposition due to the severity of violence by the Burmese military. The Political Prisoners Review Committee attempted to define political prisoners, but the government did not adopt the definition. A workshop was held to discuss a common definition with various organizations and political parties. Various Burmese organizations, political parties, and the International Committee of the Red Cross attended a workshop where they agreed on a definition of political prisoner. The definition includes anyone arrested, detained, or imprisoned for political reasons or wrongfully under criminal charges related to promoting freedom, justice, and human rights. The workshop attendees agreed on a definition of political prisoner, which includes individuals arrested for political reasons or unjustly under criminal charges related to advocating for freedom, justice, and human rights. The NLD planned to propose this definition to the Union Parliament following the workshop. Calls have been made for a legal definition of political prisoners since the NLD took power. In May 2016, the AAPP(B) and FPPS recommended that the NLD-led government adopt an internationally recognized definition of political prisoners. Pe Than of the ANP supported legal definitions of \"political prisoners\" and \"political offenses\" to protect activists, but Deputy Minister of Home Affairs General Aung Soe opposed it, citing discrimination concerns. Allegations of corruption among Burmese officials and human rights abuses have been associated with the issue of political prisoners. Officials in Burma have been accused of using their power to detain people on false charges to confiscate property or seek revenge. This has led to the creation of a group of \"political prisoners.\" The Rohingya minority has faced extensive political repression, including restrictions on movement, employment, education, and marriage. The NLD-led government has not done much to address discrimination against the Rohingya. Burma's 2008 Constitution allows for the continuation of repressive laws from colonial times, which are used by security forces to suppress political opposition. The AAPP(B) reports on violations of these laws, with the most frequently cited ones being used to detain individuals on false charges and confiscate property. The Unlawful Associations Act of 1908 allows for imprisonment for association with illegal organizations, frequently used against ethnic armed groups. The Telecommunications Law of 2013 criminalizes extortion and defamation on telecommunications networks. These laws are used to suppress political opposition in Burma. The Telecommunications Law of 2013 in Burma criminalizes defamation on telecommunications networks, leading to arrests of political commentators and journalists criticizing the government on social media. The Right to Peaceful Assembly and Peaceful Procession Act of 2011 restricts freedom of assembly and expression, with violators facing up to two years in prison and/or a fine for protesting against government actions. The United States expressed concern over arrests and excessive prison terms for peaceful protesters in Burma under Article 18 of the Peace Assembly and Processions Act. Sections 505(a) and 505(b) of the Penal Code criminalize statements that could incite mutiny or public fear, often used against journalists who question official accounts. In April 2016, Burma's Legal Affairs and Special Cases Assessment Commission recommended repealing or amending 142 laws, including the Emergency Provisions Act of 1950 and Section 505(b) of the Penal Code, which have been used to suppress political opposition and expression. The commission also suggested amending Article 18 of the Peace Assembly and Processions Act. In January 2016, the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) urged the Union Parliament to repeal or amend laws including the Right to Peaceful Assembly and Peaceful Procession Act of 2011, Telecommunications Act of 2013, Printing and Publications Act of 2014, Media Act of 2014, and the \"Race and Religion Protection Laws\" of 2015. These laws were criticized for discriminating against Burma's Muslim population and were seen as tools of political oppression. The NLD-led Union Parliament has made efforts to repeal or amend problematic laws, including the State Protection Act of 1975 and the Emergency Provisions Act of 1950. Proposals to amend Section 66(d) of the Telecommunications Act of 2013 have not been approved. The President has limited authority over the arrest and detention of people under Burma's 2008 constitution. The President has limited authority over arrest and detention in Burma under the 2008 constitution, while the Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services controls security forces. People in Burma are still being arrested for political activities, but the President can drop pending cases and grant pardons. The constitution states that all armed forces are under the Defence Services' command, with the Commander-in-Chief appointed by the President. The Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Services in Burma is the Supreme Commander of all armed forces, including the Myanmar Armed Forces, Border Guard Forces, and Myanmar Police Force. The Commander-in-Chief has authority over the selection of Ministers of Defence, Home Affairs, and Border Affairs, giving them control over security forces and the arrest and detention of individuals. The president in Burma has authority over the arrest and detention of individuals who have violated the law. The attorney general, appointed by the president, oversees criminal cases and public prosecutors are responsible for prosecuting them. The president can direct the attorney general and public prosecutors to drop charges deemed political. State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi used this authority to release over 100 people detained for peaceful protests in 2016. The president can also grant pardons and amnesties with the recommendation of the National Defence and Security Council. The President of Burma has the authority to suspend or remit sentences for individuals convicted of offenses. Former Presidents Thein Sein and Htin Kyaw, as well as current President Win Myint, have used this authority. The Burma Political Prisoners Assistance Act was introduced to call for the release of certain individuals. The Burma Political Prisoners Assistance Act calls for the unconditional release of all prisoners of conscience and political prisoners in Burma. It also urges the government to repeal or amend laws that violate freedom of expression and assembly. The Act requires the Secretary of State to provide assistance to civil society organizations working for prisoner release and support for documenting human rights violations. The Burma Political Prisoners Assistance Act aims to support awareness and advocacy for political prisoners in Burma, provide post-incarceration assistance, and establish an independent prisoner review mechanism. It includes definitions for prisoners of conscience and political prisoners, similar to those used by Amnesty International. The options Congress may consider to address political imprisonment in Burma include providing assistance to revise laws used for political arrests, pressuring the government to reconsider laws declaring ethnic armed organizations illegal, and supporting the review of political prisoners. The Unlawful Associations Act of 1908 supports the reestablishment of a Political Prisoners Review Committee to identify alleged political prisoners and develop an official definition. It also suggests imposing restrictions on relations with Burma until all political prisoners are released and conditioning assistance on the release of political prisoners and reforms in Burma's security forces. The presence of political prisoners in Burma is just one factor Congress considers when evaluating U.S. policy towards the country. Another key issue is the ongoing low-grade civil war between the Tatmadaw and ethnic armed groups, despite efforts by Aung San Suu Kyi's government to promote peace through peace conferences. In eastern Burma, a unilateral ceasefire was announced for the first half of 2019, but sporadic fighting between the Tatmadaw and EAOs persists. The Rohingya Refugee Crisis began in August 2017 when ARSA attacked security outposts, leading to the flight of over 700,000 Rohingya into Bangladesh. The UN has recommended investigating Tatmadaw senior officers for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. In December 2018, the Arakan Army initiated a campaign in northern Rakhine State, prompting a heavy deployment of Tatmadaw troops. In 2012, violent unrest in Rakhine State resulted in deaths and displacement of Rohingya and Rakhine people. The Tatmadaw's \"clearance operation\" in 2016 further complicated relations between the Arakan Army and the Rohingya, hindering their safe return. The NLD pledged to implement constitutional and legal reforms to establish a more democratic government and protect human rights in Burma. However, little progress has been made on these promises since taking office in April 2016."
