    "content": "The \"Small Business Growth Act of 2009\" allows for expensing certain real property under section 179F. The taxpayer can elect to treat the cost of qualified real property as an expense not chargeable to capital account, allowing for a deduction in the year the property is placed in service. The aggregate cost for any taxable year under this provision is limited to $125,000, with adjustments for inflation after 2009. The taxpayer can elect to treat the cost of qualified real property as an expense not chargeable to capital account, allowing for a deduction in the year the property is placed in service. The cost-of-living adjustment for the taxable year is determined by substituting 'calendar year 2008' for 'calendar year 1992'. If the adjusted amount is not a multiple of $1,000, it will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $1,000. The election for this provision must be made on the taxpayer's return of the tax imposed for the taxable year. The taxpayer can elect to treat qualified real property as an expense not chargeable to capital account, with the election being irrevocable without the Secretary's consent.

The $5,000,000 gross receipts test determines if a taxpayer qualifies for certain provisions. It involves averaging annual gross receipts over a 3-year period, with aggregation rules applying to related entities. If the taxpayer wasn't in existence for the entire 3-year period, adjustments are made.

Conforming amendments are made to section 263(a)(1) to include additional subparagraphs. The text introduces a new subparagraph (M) allowing deductions under section 179F.
