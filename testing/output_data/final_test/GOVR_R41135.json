    "content": "The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA; P.L. 105-220) is a federal program supporting workforce development through five titles: job training for unemployed individuals, adult education and literacy services, integration of employment services into the One-Stop system, vocational rehabilitation for individuals with disabilities, and state incentive grants. Workforce development programs under the Workforce Investment Act provide education and training services to prepare individuals for work and improve their prospects in the labor market. This includes job search assistance, career counseling, and various training programs aimed at increasing employment and earnings. The focus is on Title I of WIA, which authorizes job search, education, and training programs. Title I of WIA authorizes job search, education, and training programs to improve employment prospects. Title II provides funding for adult education and literacy activities. Title III amends the Wagner-Peyser Act to integrate the Employment Service into the One-Stop system. Title IV authorizes funding for vocational rehabilitation services for individuals with disabilities. The curr_chunk discusses the provisions and characteristics of WIA Title I programs and services, the One-Stop delivery system, Workforce Investment Boards, state formula grant programs, national programs, funding, and performance accountability. It also covers the services, funding, and performance accountability provisions of WIA Titles II and IV, with appendices providing a glossary of key terms and appropriations history. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) was reauthorized by Congress in the 113th Congress and signed into law on July 22, 2014. It authorizes appropriations for WIOA programs from FY2015 through FY2020, providing job training and related services to unemployed and underemployed individuals. Title I of WIA is administered by the U.S. Department of Labor. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) authorizes funding for job training programs through the U.S. Department of Labor. In FY2014, Title I programs received $4.8 billion in funding, including grants for youth, adult, and dislocated worker training. Federal workforce development programs have evolved since the Manpower Development Training Act (MDTA) in 1962. The MDTA, enacted in 1962, provided federal funding for retraining workers displaced by technological change. Funding was later focused on classroom and on-the-job training for low-income individuals and welfare recipients. CETA, enacted in 1973, shifted decision-making authority to local governments and provided funding to \"prime sponsors\" for workforce development programs. CETA, enacted in 1973, allowed \"prime sponsors\" to administer job training activities for low-income populations, welfare recipients, and disadvantaged youth. The program included on-the-job training, classroom training, and public service employment. In 1978, the PSE component of CETA supported 755,000 jobs. CETA was amended in 1978 to create private industry councils (PIC) to involve the private sector in program development. Under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), major changes were made to provide training to low-income and dislocated workers through 640 service delivery areas. Funding was allocated to state governors and then to Private Industry Councils (PICs) in each area, with a focus on targeted job training and reemployment. JTPA emphasized training over public service employment, requiring at least 70% of funding to be used for training. This percentage was later reduced to 50% in 1992. Title I of JTPA established state and national programs for employment and training services, including the One-Stop system for coordinating workforce development activities. WIA Title I programs are administered by the U.S. Department of Labor through various programs like Youth Activities, Adult Activities, and Dislocated Worker Activities. There are also national programs such as Job Corps and the Veterans' Workforce Investment Program. Additionally, there are demonstration and pilot projects like the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program and the Green Jobs Innovation Fund program. These programs are provided through a system of \"One-Stop\" centers for training and employment activities. The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) establishes centers for state and local training and employment activities, overseen by Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs). WIA offers universal access to services, with an accountability system based on negotiated performance levels. The program operates on a July 1-June 30 program year and emphasizes local discretion in service design. This report details WIA Title I state formula program structure, services, allocation formulas, and performance accountability, highlighting its workforce development system characteristics. The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) is a demand-driven workforce development system that provides employment and training services responsive to local area employers. WIA emphasizes local control through Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs) and One-Stop centers, which serve as central points of service provision. Local WIBs are authorized to allocate funds and make decisions on service provision, eligible providers, and training programs. The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) establishes One-Stop centers to provide efficient employment and training services. WIA offers universal access to services, unlike the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), and focuses on a work-first approach to workforce development. The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) provides consumer choice to participants through Individual Training Accounts (ITAs) for training services. WIA established One-Stop centers for participants to access a sequence of services, including core and intensive services before training is considered. The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) established One-Stop centers to provide access to employment and training services, including core, intensive, and training services. Each state is required to have a One-Stop delivery system that offers various programs and activities, labor market information, job search, placement, and recruitment services. One-Stop centers can be physical locations or affiliated sites linked electronically. The WIA One-Stop system establishes a central point of service for employment, training, and related services. Partner programs are required to provide core services in the One-Stop system, with additional programs allowed to operate. One-Stop centers may incorporate other partner programs, including those for TANF recipients and SNAP participants. The WIA One-Stop system requires partner programs to offer core services, including programs for able-bodied adults without dependents and AmeriCorps. A memorandum of understanding must be established with all One-Stop partners to outline services, costs, referral methods, and duration. The Employment Service, authorized by the Wagner-Peyser Act, is a central component of One-Stop delivery systems. The Employment Service (ES) is a crucial partner in the One-Stop delivery system under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA). It facilitates the connection between job seekers and employers, mandated by Title III of WIA. ES administers State Grants and National Activities, including labor exchange services and job placement assistance. Additionally, Section 15 of the Wagner-Peyser Act requires the Secretary of Labor to oversee the development of a nationwide employment statistics system. The Employment Service (ES) provides core employment services, job search assistance, and labor market information under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA). ES is a central part of the workforce development system and delivers key services at One-Stop centers. States offer labor exchange services through three tiers of service delivery, including Self-Service electronic job databases. Delivery of employment services can be through Self-Service, Facilitated Self-Help, or Staff-Assisted Service. Self-Service allows access to electronic job databases without staff assistance, while Facilitated Self-Help provides resources in One-Stop offices with staff assistance. Staff-Assisted Service offers one-on-one and group services including assessment, career counseling, and job search assistance. Staff-assisted services in workforce programs include individual service plans, job search assistance, and workshops for job seekers and employers. These services must be provided in physical locations and have performance accountability requirements. The ES uses three performance measures: entered employment, employment retention, and average earnings. 97% of funds are allocated to states based on civilian labor force and total unemployment. 3% is distributed to states with smaller labor forces or needing additional resources. Key features of state formula allocation for Wagner-Peyser Act include reservations for Guam and the Virgin Islands, provisions for minimum allotments. In FY1983, states are guaranteed a minimum allotment of 0.28% of the total allocation. \"Hold harmless\" provisions ensure states receive at least 90% of prior year funding. 90% of funds can be used for labor exchange services, while the remaining 10% (Governor's Reserve) can be used for special needs groups. WIA establishes state and local workforce investment boards (WIBs) for governance. The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) establishes state and local Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs) for governance. WIA specifies the composition of board members, with the majority being representatives of business. State WIBs consist of various required members including the governor, state legislature members, business representatives, labor organizations, and others with relevant experience. The state WIB, appointed by the governor, is responsible for developing a state plan, coordinating workforce activities, designating local workforce areas, distributing funds, and reporting performance measures to the DOL. Local WIBs, appointed by local officials, are authorized under WIA Section 117. The local Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs), appointed by local elected officials, consist of representatives from various organizations. They perform functions such as developing a local plan, selecting service providers, overseeing programs, and coordinating workforce activities with local economic development. Local Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs) are responsible for coordinating workforce development activities with economic development, promoting private sector participation, and governing policies such as developing MOUs among One-Stop partners and designating One-Stop operators. They also establish limits on Individual Training Accounts. The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) replaced JTPA in 1998 and authorizes job training for unemployed individuals. Funds are allocated for workforce development activities to increase employment, retention, and earnings of participants. Formula grant programs in WIA provide funding for youth, adults, and dislocated workers for employment and training. Title I of the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) authorizes funding for employment and training activities for youth, adults, and dislocated workers through One-Stop centers. Funding is provided through state formula grants, with adult and dislocated worker programs offering training and services for individuals aged 18 and older. Eligibility criteria and allocation formulas differ between the two programs. Under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA), individuals can receive services funded by the adult activities allocation if they are eligible as dislocated workers. Eligibility includes being terminated or laid off, attached to the workforce, and unlikely to return to previous industry. The definition of a dislocated worker is broad, including anticipated facility closings and self-employed workers. The core eligibility requirement is displacement due to termination or facility closing, with no requirement related to the cause of dislocation. The classification of \"adult\" or \"dislocated\" does not affect the services received under WIA. After funds are allocated from DOLETA to individual states by formula, governors can reserve up to 15% of Adult Activities, 15% of Dislocated Worker Activities, and 15% of Youth Activities for statewide activities. Additionally, governors must reserve up to 25% of Dislocated Worker Activities for rapid response activities. Overall, a maximum of 15% of Adult Activities, 15% of Youth Activities, and 40% of Dislocated Worker Activities are reserved at the state level for statewide activities. Statewide employment and training activities are funded by the 15% reserve funds from each of the youth, adult, and dislocated worker state allocations. These activities include dissemination of the state list of eligible providers, evaluations of state workforce investment programs, distribution of incentive grants to local areas, and technical assistance. The statewide employment and training activities funded by reserve funds include technical assistance, establishment of One-Stop delivery systems, operation of fiscal and management accountability system, administration of state activities, capacity building assistance, research projects, innovative training programs, and identification of eligible training providers. States are required to carry out rapid response from the dislocated worker state allocation reserve. States are required to carry out rapid response activities to assist dislocated workers in obtaining reemployment quickly after a closure or mass layoffs. Services funded may include onsite contact with employers, access to employment and training programs, labor-management agreements, emergency assistance, and community development aid. The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) allocates funds at the state level for adult and dislocated worker programs, with the remaining funds going to local areas for training and employment activities. Local areas must establish a One-Stop delivery system and provide core, intensive, and training services. WIA's program for adult and dislocated worker participants includes three levels of services: core, intensive, and training, with each level building upon the previous one. To be eligible for training under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA), an individual must have received core and intensive services but still be unable to secure self-sufficient employment. They must also have the necessary skills, choose a training service linked to a local occupation, and not be able to obtain other grant assistance. The WIA regulations provide guidance on the sequence of services but do not specify a required amount of time or attempts to gain employment before moving to the next level. The WIA regulations outline the sequence of services for individuals seeking training, emphasizing the importance of core, intensive, and training services in that order. There is no set time requirement for each service level. Consumer choice is a key concept in training implementation, with eligible providers and Individual Training Accounts playing a crucial role. Local Workforce Investment Boards oversee eligible training providers in the area. The purpose of having a list of eligible providers in the local workforce investment area is to provide choice to customers accessing WIA services. There are two types of provider eligibility: initial and subsequent. Postsecondary educational institutions eligible for federal funds under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 and entities offering apprenticeship programs registered under the National Apprenticeship Act can apply directly to the local WIB for initial eligibility. Other entities must apply to the local WIB according to the state governor's procedure for review. Training providers must submit performance and cost information to the local WIB annually to maintain eligibility. This includes program completion rates, employment placement rates, wages, retention rates, and other specified data. After completing the program, WIA participants' rates of employment and wages after six months are tracked, along with licensure, certification, or degree attainment rates for all graduates. Program cost information for WIA participants is also collected. Some training providers may be hesitant to participate in the ITA system due to the requirement to collect data for all students, not just those funded by WIA. Many states have received waivers to extend the time limit for initial eligibility for training providers to alleviate this burden. Under WIA, individuals deemed eligible for training services can choose from a list of eligible providers to establish an Individual Training Account (ITA) for payment. Unlike the previous JTPA approach, WIA allows participants to purchase training from the list of eligible trainers, with local WIBs having the authority to set limits on training type, duration, and ITA amounts based on individual circumstances. Formula grants for Adult Activities are also available. The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) authorizes formula grant programs for Adult Activities, Dislocated Worker Activities, and Youth Activities. The Youth Activities program aims to assist individuals aged 14-21 in achieving academic and employment success through various activities, including mentoring, training, leadership, citizenship, and community service opportunities. Eligibility criteria include being a low-income individual. The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) provides funding to states based on unemployment and poverty factors to assist individuals aged 14-21 who are low-income and face barriers like basic literacy skills deficiency, homelessness, or being a school dropout. States distribute 85% of funds to local workforce areas designated by the governor, while retaining 15% for statewide activities. Local Workforce Investment Boards award funds to organizations for employment and job training services for youth. Local programs under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) must provide 10 activities to youth, including tutoring, study skills training, summer employment opportunities, work experiences, occupational skill training, leadership development, supportive services, adult mentoring, guidance and counseling, and follow-up services for at least 12 months after completion. The Job Corps program, operated by the Office of Job Corps within the DOL Secretary's Office, aims to equip disadvantaged youth with job skills, military enlistment readiness, or further education. Youth receive academic, employment training, and social services. Local WIBs must offer 10 program elements to youth, but individual participation in all elements is not required. Other services can be coordinated with local programs if already accessible to eligible youth in the area. Job Corps centers offer academic, employment training, and social services to promote youth well-being. There are 125 centers nationwide, with 28 being Civilian Conservation Corps Centers. These centers focus on conserving public natural resources. Job Corps centers can be operated by federal, state, or local agencies, vocational schools, or private organizations. New centers require authorization in appropriations law and are selected through a competitive process by the DOL based on their ability to coordinate workforce activities for youth. Job Corps centers offer academic, vocational, and social services to youth. Students can participate for up to two years, receiving various support services including training, counseling, and residential support. Centers rely on outreach contractors to recruit students. Job Corps centers rely on outreach contractors and placement agencies to recruit students, provide vocational training, and offer employment and training services to special populations through competitive grant programs. The competitive grant program under WIA Section 166 provides workforce investment activities to assist special populations like Indians, Native Hawaiians, and youth on or near Indian reservations in entering or retaining unsubsidized employment. Funding is provided through a biennial competitive grant process to Native American tribes and nonprofit organizations, with 178 current grantees. The program, also known as the National Farmworker Jobs Program, offers training, housing services, and technical assistance to disadvantaged migrant and seasonal agricultural workers and their dependents. Grants are awarded to various types of organizations. The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) Section 167 program provides competitive grants to organizations assisting migrant and seasonal farmworkers for economic stability. It also offers workforce investment activities to veterans through competitive grants to states and nonprofit organizations. Administered by DOL's Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS), the program aims to enhance job training opportunities. The Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program combines the Prisoner Reentry Initiative and Responsible Reintegration of Youthful Offenders to provide employment and training services for recently released prisoners and youth at risk of juvenile justice involvement. It is funded under Section 171 and aims to support faith-based and community organizations in helping individuals find work upon reentry into their communities. Section 132(a)(2)(A) of the Dislocated Workers Activities program allocates 20% for a National Reserve account, which funds National Emergency Grants (NEG) for dislocated workers. These grants provide job search assistance, training, direct employment, and health insurance coverage for eligible individuals. YouthBuild program transferred to DOL under WIA in 2007. Aim is to help disadvantaged youth gain skills for economic self-sufficiency, provide meaningful work opportunities, develop leadership skills, and increase affordable housing supply. The YouthBuild program aims to empower disadvantaged youth by offering education, workforce training, and housing rehabilitation opportunities. Participants aged 16-24 from low-income families, foster care, youth offenders, individuals with disabilities, children of incarcerated parents, or migrant youth are eligible. The program focuses on skill-building, career pathway training, and providing housing for homeless individuals or low-income families. The YouthBuild program targets disadvantaged youth aged 16-24 from various backgrounds, including low-income families, foster care, youth offenders, individuals with disabilities, children of incarcerated parents, or migrant youth. Eligibility criteria also include basic-skills deficiency despite having a high school diploma or GED. Funding for workforce investment activities is allocated to states based on a three-factor formula. The state formula allocation for WIA Adult funds is based on factors like total unemployment, excess unemployment, and economically disadvantaged adults. Within-state allocations can be adjusted by local WIBs. The state formula allocation for WIA Adult Activities includes a reservation for outlying areas, a minimum grant amount, and \"hold harmless\" provisions to prevent large funding fluctuations between years. In PY2014, the state minimum allotment was $1,905,148, with eight states receiving this amount. Individual states will not receive less than 90% or more than 130% of their relative share of prior year funding. After DOLETA allocates funds to states, governors can reserve up to 15% of Adult Activities funding for statewide employment and training activities. The remaining funds are suballocated to local areas based on specific formulas, including a hold harmless provision to prevent large funding fluctuations. The Dislocated Worker program in WIA consists of two parts: the National Reserve and state formula grants. 20% of funding is allocated to the National Reserve for National Emergency Grants, while state formula grants are allocated based on factors like total unemployment rates. The Dislocated Worker program in WIA consists of two parts: the National Reserve and state formula grants. State formula grants are allocated based on factors like total unemployment rates, excess unemployment, and long-term unemployment. The formula does not have provisions for minimum and maximum allotments, leading to large funding swings for individual states. Governors must reserve up to 15% of the Dislocated Worker Activity state allocation for statewide employment and training activities. Activity state allocation for statewide \"employment and training activities\" and dislocated worker activities must reserve up to 25% for rapid response activities. A maximum of 40% of dislocated worker state allocations are reserved for statewide activities, with the rest reallocated to local areas based on factors like insured unemployment, plant closings, and long-term unemployment. Youth employment and training funds are allocated based on factors like total unemployed in areas of substantial unemployment. The state formula allocation for WIA Youth Activities includes a reservation for outlying areas, a minimum grant amount, and \"hold harmless\" provisions to prevent large funding swings between years. In PY2014, six states received the minimum allotment of $2,009,628. After funds are allocated from DOLETA to individual states by formula, each state must reserve up to 15% of the Youth Activities allocation for statewide activities. The remaining funding is distributed to local areas based on a formula that considers poverty and unemployment rates within the state. The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) allocates funds to states based on poverty and unemployment rates, with a \"hold harmless\" provision ensuring local areas receive at least 90% of their average allocation percentage. WIA includes state and local performance measures to assess the effectiveness of workforce investment activities. The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) includes 17 core indicators for performance assessment, covering employment and training activities for adults, dislocated workers, and youth. These indicators include entry into employment, retention, earnings, credential attainment, basic skills, diploma attainment, and postsecondary education or employment placement. Customer satisfaction indicators for employers and participants are also included. Standards are established for one program year from July 1 to June 30. Standards for performance assessment under the Workforce Investment Act are set for each program year by the governor of each state. These standards are typically numerical percentages or dollar amounts and can be adjusted based on economic and demographic factors. States and localities may face sanctions for not meeting the standards, which include 17 core indicators of performance. Additional indicators can be identified in the state plan required under Section 112. The Workforce Investment Act requires states to establish performance indicators and levels through negotiation with the Secretary of Labor. States must identify expected performance levels for each indicator for the first three program years of the Plan. Agreement on performance levels for all 17 indicators is necessary to optimize federal funds in workforce investment activities. The Workforce Investment Act requires states to negotiate and agree on performance levels for 17 indicators, which become the \"state adjusted levels of performance\" in the Plan. These levels must be objective, quantifiable, and measurable, showing progress towards continuous improvement. Factors considered in the negotiation include customer satisfaction, comparative performance levels in other states, and the impact on promoting continuous improvement. The Workforce Investment Act requires states to negotiate performance level goals within the context of integrated service delivery, priority of service, economic conditions, customers served, and workforce solutions. States are encouraged to serve at-risk populations and account for their impact on performance outcomes, but the choice of populations to serve and adjustments made are at the state's discretion. The Workforce Investment Act allows states to choose the populations they serve and make adjustments based on those served. DOLETA provides states with data to propose adjusted performance levels, including past results, GPRA goals, national WIA performance outcomes, average earnings, BLS estimates, and economic/demographic effects. Attachment VII of TEGL 9-08 offers estimated effects of unemployment and participant characteristics on performance outcomes. The DOLETA policy outlines a negotiation process for states to propose and agree upon performance levels. States analyze factors affecting performance, submit proposed levels to DOLETA, and then work with regional offices to set mutually agreed-upon levels. The deadline for submission of proposed levels for PY2009 was April 15, 2009. DOLETA implemented a \"common measures\" policy in July 2005 for workforce programs, introducing adult and youth performance measures. States negotiate and agree on performance levels, with DOLETA confirming modifications to the state's Plan. The common measures aim to enhance the assessment of workforce investment programs. The Department of Labor (DOL) implemented a \"common measures\" policy for workforce programs in July 2005. Despite existing statutory reporting requirements, DOL granted waivers to 49 states, territories, and the District of Columbia to implement and report on common measures instead of the current array of measures in the Workforce Investment Act (WIA). Title II of WIA, the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA), aims to assist adults in becoming literate, obtaining employment skills, and completing secondary education. The Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) programs are administered by the U.S. Department of Education through its Office of Vocational and Adult Education. AEFLA's authorization of appropriations expired in 2003, but programs continue to be funded through annual appropriations. Approximately 95% of funds are allotted to states via formula grants, with states required to match a portion of their federal grants. Actual educational services are provided by local entities using a mix of full-time, part-time, and volunteer personnel. Adult education activities are typically divided into three categories: Adult Basic Education (ABE), which includes instruction for adults with literacy and numeracy skills below high school level. The Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) programs are divided into three categories: Adult Basic Education (ABE) for adults with low literacy and numeracy skills, Adult Secondary Education (ASE) for those at a high school level, and English Literacy (EL) for non-proficient English speakers. Performance data is tracked through the National Reporting System (NRS), with states required to report enrollment and progress. AEFLA sets aside funds for national activities and incentive grants. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, amended by Title IV of WIA, authorizes appropriations for programs related to employment and independent living for individuals with disabilities. Vocational Rehabilitation state grants receive the majority of funds under this act, accounting for 85-90% each year. The Vocational Rehabilitation state grants receive between 85% and 90% of the funds appropriated under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 each year. Eligibility for VR services is based on having a disability that hinders employment and benefiting from the services. Preference is given to individuals with severe disabilities if not all eligible individuals can be served. An individualized plan for employment (IPE) is developed with a VR counselor, outlining necessary services such as case management, counseling, and job training. States receive grants via formula and must match funds to not exceed 78.7% from federal sources. The Vocational Rehabilitation state grants program receives a majority of its funds from federal sources, with states required to match funds up to 78.7%. If a state cannot match its entire grant, the unmatched funds are redistributed to other states. The program operates under automatic authorization provisions if Congress does not reauthorize it, and supports employment and independent living for individuals with disabilities. The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) authorizes agencies to support employment and independent living for individuals with disabilities. It also defines Areas of Substantial Unemployment (ASU) as areas with at least 6.5% unemployment rate for the past 12 months. States submit ASU designations for approval by the Department of Labor (DOL) annually. An ASU is defined as an area with a population of at least 10,000 and an unemployment rate of 6.5% for 12 months. If a state's overall unemployment rate is 6.5% or higher, the entire state is designated as an ASU. The concept of economically disadvantaged is used in the Title I state grant formulas for Youth and Adult Activities, where disadvantaged youth and adults are defined based on income levels. For Youth and Adult Activities formulas, DOLETA uses poverty calculations from the 1990 Census (PY2001-PY2003) and the 2000 Census (PY2004-present). Excess Unemployment is a factor in Title I state grant formulas for Youth, Adult, and Dislocated Worker Activities, defined as the number of unemployed individuals exceeding 4.5% of the civilian labor force in the state or areas of substantial unemployment. Excess Unemployment is a factor in Title I state grant formulas for Youth, Adult, and Dislocated Worker Activities, defined as the number of unemployed individuals exceeding 4.5% of the civilian labor force in the state. Local Workforce Investment Areas (LWIA) are designated geographic areas within states that function as administrative units within the One-Stop delivery system. WIA requires each LWIA to have a local WIB and a One-Stop center. The governor designates LWIAs considering various factors. Automatic designation is allowed under specific conditions. Long-Term Unemployment is a factor in Title I state grant formulas for Dislocated Worker Activities. Long-term unemployment is a factor in the Title I state grant formulas for Dislocated Worker Activities. The state formula grants for Dislocated Worker Activities define long-term unemployment as individuals who have been unemployed for at least 15 weeks. The concept of \"relative number/share\" is used in the state grant formulas for Youth, Adult, and Dislocated Worker Activities, with three equally weighted factors based on the relative number compared to other states. An example from the Dislocated Worker Activities formula shows how factors like regular unemployment, excess unemployment, and long-term unemployment are used in state formula allotments. Nevada's share of regular unemployment, excess unemployment, and long-term unemployment was calculated based on the number of individuals in the state compared to all states. Multiplying these shares by 1/3 and summing the results gave Nevada a total share of 1.43%. This share was then multiplied by the total funding for all states ($1,008,151,464) to yield $14,404,698, which Nevada received in PY2012."
