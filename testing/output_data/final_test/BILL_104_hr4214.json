    "content": "The curr_chunk states: \"SECTION 1. LIMITATION OF ANTIQUITIES ACT AUTHORITY.\" Section 2 of the Antiquities Act is amended to require presidential proclamations declaring national monuments to be submitted to Congress for approval within 180 days. The amendment to the Antiquities Act requires presidential proclamations declaring national monuments to be submitted to Congress for approval within 180 days. Congress can only adjourn sine die to break continuity of session, and days when either House is adjourned for more than 3 days are excluded from the 180-day period calculation. This subsection is enacted by Congress as part of each House's rules for procedural purposes. The text chunk discusses the procedure to be followed in the House for resolutions, recognizing the constitutional right of either House to change rules related to its procedure. The term \"resolution\" is defined as a joint resolution with a specific resolving clause. The House and Senate must approve the Presidential decision on a national monument establishment. Resolutions related to a Presidential proclamation will be referred to committees by the President of the Senate or the Speaker of the House. If a committee does not report a resolution on a Presidential proclamation within 30 days, a motion can be made to discharge the committee from further consideration. The motion must be made by a supporter of the resolution and is privileged, except if the committee has already reported a resolution on the same proclamation. The debate on a Presidential proclamation resolution is limited to 1 hour, with equal time for both sides. No amendments or reconsideration of the vote are allowed. If a motion to discharge is agreed to or disagreed to, it cannot be made for any other resolution on the same proclamation within 30 days. The motion to proceed to the consideration of the resolution following the President's proclamation is highly privileged, not debatable, and cannot be amended or reconsidered. Debate on the resolution is limited to 10 hours, divided equally between those in favor and those opposing. The motion to limit debate on the resolution following the President's proclamation is not debatable. Amendments, motions to recommit, and reconsideration of the vote are not allowed within a 180-day period. Motions to postpone or proceed to other business are decided without debate. Appeals from the Chair's decision are allowed. Appeals from the Chair's decision on the application of Senate or House rules to resolution procedures are decided without debate."
