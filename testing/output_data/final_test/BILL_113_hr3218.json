A proposed qualified joint resolution must be introduced in the Senate and the House of Representatives without referral to a committee. In the House of Representatives and Senate, a motion to proceed to a joint resolution is highly privileged, not debatable, and not subject to postponement. Points of order against the motion are waived, and a motion to reconsider is not allowed. If agreed to, the joint resolution remains unfinished business. In the House, a qualified joint resolution is considered as read, with all points of order waived, and the previous question ordered. In the House and Senate, a qualified joint resolution is considered highly privileged, not debatable, and not subject to postponement. Debate time is limited to 2 hours in the House and 10 hours in the Senate, divided equally between majority and minority leaders. Reconsideration of the resolution vote is not allowed, and a final vote must occur within 10 legislative days in the House. The Senate has specific rules for the passage of a qualified joint resolution, including immediate voting after consideration, a single quorum call if requested, and a final vote within 10 legislative days. The Senate has rules for the passage of a qualified joint resolution, including immediate voting, a single quorum call if requested, and a final vote within 10 legislative days. Appeals on procedure decisions shall be decided without debate, and points of order can be raised if a resolution does not meet the definition. Resolutions are not subject to amendment in either the House or Senate, and if one House receives a resolution from the other, it must be considered before passing.

The procedure in the receiving House remains the same until the final vote, which will be on the resolution from the other House. This section is enacted by Congress as an exercise of rulemaking powers in each House. The qualified joint resolution must be considered by the receiving House before passing, following the procedure set out by Congress. The rules of each House apply only to the procedure for qualified joint resolutions and can be changed by each House as with any other rule."
