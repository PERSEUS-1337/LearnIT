    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Hurricane, Tornado, and Related Hazards Research Act\". The Congress acknowledges the risks posed by natural disasters, including hurricanes, tornadoes, and windstorms, which cause loss of life, property damage, and economic disruption. In 1999, Hurricane Floyd alone resulted in 56 deaths and $6 billion in property damage. Increased building activity in high-risk areas exacerbates the vulnerability to these hazards. Improved windstorm and related hazard reduction measures are crucial to reducing the annual property losses and deaths caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, and windstorms. These measures include cost-effective design and construction methods, mitigation programs at various levels, informed land use decisions, and impact prediction methodologies with early warning systems. Failure to implement these measures will only increase the vulnerability of communities to natural disasters. Engineering research needs to focus on improving new structures and retrofitting existing ones. The Federal Government has a role in collecting, coordinating, and disseminating windstorm and related hazards reduction information to protect public health and safety. Improved outreach is necessary to translate research findings into usable specifications and criteria for homeowners. An effective Federal program in windstorm and related hazard reduction requires interagency coordination, input from experts, and mechanisms for knowledge transfer to state and local officials, homeowners, and the construction industry. Tax credits can incentivize homeowners to implement mitigation measures. International cooperation is beneficial for addressing windstorms and related hazards globally. International cooperation is beneficial for addressing windstorms and related hazards globally, promoting mutual learning and mitigation efforts. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines key terms such as \"Director\" as the head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, \"related hazards\" as destructive environmental phenomena like flooding and wildfires, \"State\" as various US territories, and \"windstorm\" as storms with damaging wind components like hurricanes and tornadoes. The National Windstorm and Related Hazard Impact Reduction Program is established. The Director will establish an Interagency Group within 90 days of the Act's enactment, consisting of representatives from various Federal agencies responsible for coordinating a windstorm and related hazards reduction research program. Lead agencies may be designated, existing programs preserved, and regular agency coordination ensured. The windstorm and related hazard impact reduction program aims to achieve significant reductions in losses to life and property within 10 years through cooperation among governments and the private sector. This involves basic and applied research, understanding costs and benefits, and improving construction practices to mitigate windstorm risks. The windstorm and related hazard impact reduction program aims to achieve significant reductions in losses to life and property within 10 years through cooperation among governments and the private sector. This includes better understanding of costs and benefits, systematic collection of data for developing mitigation measures, information dissemination on hazard reduction research results, improved technology for risk assessment and disaster response, and increased public awareness of preventative actions. The windstorm and related hazard impact reduction program focuses on reducing losses to life and property through cooperation among governments and the private sector. It includes research and development on disaster-resistant systems and materials for construction, considering life safety and cost-effectiveness. The windstorm and related hazard impact reduction program aims to evaluate costs and benefits associated with natural hazards, develop mitigation measures, collect information on building performance, and create cost-effective planning strategies. Development of cost-effective methods for critical lifelines and facilities like hospitals, schools, and public utilities in times of disaster, research on wind characterization and hazard mapping, and improved risk assessment systems for windstorm impacts are key focus areas of the program. The program focuses on developing cost-effective methods for critical lifelines and facilities during disasters, researching windstorm hazards, and improving risk assessment systems. Technology transfer elements include disseminating research results and information on reducing windstorm damage. The Interagency Group established under subsection (a) focuses on reducing adverse consequences of natural hazards through curriculum development, outreach efforts to increase public awareness, and refining objectives related to safety in conjunction with State and local governments and private sector organizations. The Interagency Group will develop a 10-year implementation plan emphasizing safety, cost-effectiveness, and affordability, with strategic reviews every 3 years. The plan will include research goals, improved forecasting techniques for windstorms, early warning systems, and building inventory collection methods. The Interagency Group will develop a 10-year implementation plan emphasizing safety, cost-effectiveness, and affordability, with strategic reviews every 3 years. The plan includes collecting an inventory of buildings, building components, and damage from natural hazards, implementing technology transfer to governmental units and the private sector, outreach and dissemination of information and technology, and incorporating research into Federal disaster relief and emergency assistance programs. The 10-year implementation plan for emergency assistance programs includes establishing goals, priorities, target dates, assigning responsibilities, cooperation plans with governmental entities in high-risk areas, and staffing plans. The plan aims to complement existing federal research programs and avoid duplication, including earthquake programs. The Director will provide guidance to program agencies for budget preparation related to the Act, and collaborate on an annual program budget submission to the Office of Management and Budget. Each agency must detail proposed activities, their contributions to the program, and request appropriations accordingly. The Act requires program agencies to allocate appropriations to each program element and states that no provision in the Act supersedes the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974. Any design or construction method developed under the Act is not mandatory for homes certified under the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act. SEC. 5. NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR WINDSTORM AND RELATED HAZARDS IMPACT REDUCTION. A National Advisory Committee will review progress, advise on improvements, and report to Congress on actions to reduce windstorm and related hazards. The committee will have up to 21 members representing various interests such as research, technology, architecture, engineering, and insurance. The Advisory Committee, consisting of representatives from various industries and areas impacted by windstorms, will coordinate with existing advisory committees and provide an annual report to Congress. The committee is exempt from certain regulations under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Interagency Group established under section 4(a) will submit an annual report to Congress within 180 days after each fiscal year, detailing the progress made in windstorm and related hazards reduction programs. The report will include recommendations for legislative action. Additionally, $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2004, $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2005, and $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2006 are authorized for activities under this Act."
