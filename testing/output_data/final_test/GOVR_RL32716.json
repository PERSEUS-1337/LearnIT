    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is a federal statute that provides funding for the education of children with disabilities and ensures the provision of a free appropriate public education (FAPE). It includes detailed due process provisions and has been amended multiple times, most notably in 1997 and by the 108th Congress. The 108th Congress reauthorized IDEA in 2004 with the passage of H.R. 1350. The bill was passed by the House and Senate, with President Bush signing it into law on December 3, 2004. Most provisions went into effect on July 1, 2005. The 110th Congress is expected to consider legislation to amend and extend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), which could impact the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). This report focuses on changes made by P.L. 108-446 to IDEA Part B, which authorizes grants for children with disabilities ages 3 to 21 and includes key provisions on special education services and procedural safeguards. The report discusses amendments made by P.L. 108-446 to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), including changes to Part A, Part B, Part C, and Part D. It also covers the creation of the National Center for Special Education Research and miscellaneous provisions in Title III. The 2004 reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) established the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) within the U.S. Department of Education. It emphasizes the need to reduce paperwork, resolve disagreements between parents and schools positively, and defines \"highly qualified\" teachers. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA established OSEP within the U.S. Department of Education, emphasizing reducing paperwork, resolving disagreements positively, and defining \"highly qualified\" teachers for special education. The definition of \"highly qualified\" under ESEA applies to special education teachers who teach core academic subjects, with additional requirements and options provided by P.L. 108-446. Special education teachers must hold a bachelor's degree and obtain state special education certification to be highly qualified under IDEA. Teachers with emergency or provisional certification do not meet the criteria. P.L. 108-446 modifies ESEA requirements for special education teachers who teach severely disabled children or multiple core subjects. Meeting IDEA criteria also fulfills ESEA requirements for new and veteran special education teachers. Special education teachers can meet the \"highly qualified\" definition by demonstrating competence in academic subjects based on state standards or subject matter knowledge appropriate to the level of instruction. Teachers who teach multiple core subjects exclusively to children with disabilities may qualify by meeting requirements in each core subject under ESEA provisions. Special education teachers can qualify as highly qualified by meeting requirements in each core subject taught under ESEA provisions. Veteran special education teachers teaching multiple core subjects may also qualify through the ESEA HOUSSE option. Newly hired special education teachers teaching multiple core subjects have a two-year window to meet the highly qualified definition for all subjects. This exception is only applicable to special education teachers, with the deadline for meeting the \"highly qualified\" definition being the end of the 2005-2006 school year. Special education teachers can qualify as highly qualified by meeting requirements in each core subject taught under ESEA provisions. Those who provide only consultative services to other teachers may be considered highly qualified if they meet specific criteria. Consultative services do not include instruction in core academic subjects but may involve adjustments to the learning environment and other support strategies. The definition of \"highly qualified\" under IDEA includes requirements for special education teachers to meet criteria for each core subject taught under ESEA provisions. Consultative teachers may be considered highly qualified if they have a baccalaureate degree and state certification as a special education teacher. The definition does not create a right of action for failure to meet the requirements. The curr_chunk provides modified definitions related to education laws, including \"homeless children,\" \"limited English proficient,\" \"universal design,\" and \"ward of the state.\" Changes include exceptions for assistive technology devices and expanded definitions of \"parent.\" The curr_chunk discusses specific services added to the definition of \"related services\" under P.L. 108-446, along with general administrative provisions for the Office of Special Education Services. It also mentions modifications to the Secretary of Education's authority to regulate IDEA compliance. P.L. 108-446 introduces changes to the public comment period on regulations, adds requirements for states to identify unnecessary state-imposed requirements, implements a paperwork reduction pilot program, and ensures continued eligibility for competitive IDEA grants for freely associated states. P.L. 108-446 makes technical changes to some \u00a7611 provisions, maintaining the maximum grant calculation for Part B grants-to-states program through FY2006. The maximum grant will be based on 40% of the national average per pupil expenditure times the number of children with disabilities served in school year 2004-2005 adjusted by annual population changes. P.L. 108-446 authorizes specific funding levels for FY2005-FY2011 for grants-to-states program, with permanent authorization for succeeding fiscal years. The law requires set-asides from the appropriation for certain purposes, including up to 1% for outlying areas and freely associated states. The allocation of funds under P.L. 108-446 has changed, with freely associated states receiving amounts from FY2003 and the rest allocated based on population ages 3 to 21 in outlying areas. Competitive allocation through the Pacific Regional Educational Laboratory has been eliminated. A maximum reserve of 0.5% (or $25 million) is created for technical assistance to improve state data collection, replacing a set-aside for studies and evaluations. States can reserve funds for state administration and other state-level purposes under IDEA. P.L. 108-446 allows states to reserve funds for state administration and other state-level activities under IDEA. It raises the minimum amount that can be reserved to $800,000 annually adjusted for inflation. States can also use inflationary increases for certain activities. The maximum amount that can be reserved for state administration is adjusted annually. States can reserve 10% of their grant for FY2005 and FY2006, with adjustments for subsequent years. P.L. 108-446 increases the minimum amount states can reserve for state-level activities under IDEA to $800,000 annually, with adjustments for inflation. It also adds mandatory activities such as monitoring, enforcement, and complaint investigation, as well as establishing a parental mediation process. Other permitted activities include direct services, assisting LEAs with personnel shortages, paperwork reduction, positive behavior interventions, capacity building, and alternative programming for expelled children with disabilities. The core requirement of IDEA is to provide all children with disabilities with a free appropriate public education (FAPE). P.L. 108-446 allows states to reserve funds to establish a risk pool to assist local education agencies serving high-need children with disabilities. States must develop a state plan to determine high-need children, procedures for LEAs to participate, and how funds are distributed for direct special education services. Funds from the risk pool must only pay for \"direct special education and related services\" for high-need children with disabilities. If funds are not used for these services, they are distributed to LEAs according to the substate formula. States must meet requirements to be eligible for Part B funding, including providing FAPE, individualized education programs, and education in the least restrictive environment. P.L. 108-446 brings changes to state eligibility requirements for children with disabilities, including those in private schools. The law allows for placement in private schools by the LEA or parents, with costs covered by the LEA in some cases. IDEA mandates services for children in private schools, even if unilaterally placed by parents. The specifics of these services have been a contentious issue. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA includes changes to provisions for children placed in private schools by their parents. Children with disabilities in private schools are entitled to special education services, with a new requirement that they must be located in the school district served by the LEA. This change aims to protect LEAs from having to work with private schools located elsewhere. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA includes changes to provisions for children placed in private schools by their parents. The report described this change as protecting LEAs from having to work with private schools located in multiple jurisdictions when students attend private schools across district lines. There are five requirements regarding this provision of special education, including the funds expended by the LEA being equal to a proportionate amount of federal funds made available under part B of IDEA. The Senate report emphasized providing direct services to parentally placed private school children, such as instructional activities and related services. Additionally, a new provision relating to the calculation of the proportionate amount is added. The new provision requires LEAs to conduct a thorough child find process to identify children with disabilities in private schools. Services can be provided on private school premises, including religious schools. A provision on supplementing funds, not supplanting them, is added. LEAs must maintain records of children evaluated and determined to have disabilities. The new provision requires LEAs to conduct a thorough child find process to identify children with disabilities in private schools, including religious schools. It aims to ensure equitable participation and accurate count of parentally placed private school children with disabilities. Additional provisions include activities, cost, and completion period. The Senate report emphasized the importance of reporting the number of children evaluated, determined to have disabilities, and served under private school provisions to ensure funds are serving their intended purpose. The new provision requires LEAs to conduct a thorough child find process to identify children with disabilities in private schools, ensuring equitable participation and accurate count. The cost of child find activities is not included in meeting the LEA's spending obligation. Consultation with private school officials and parents of parentally placed private school children with disabilities is required, including determining the proportionate amount of federal funds available. The consultation process among the LEA, private school officials, and parents of parentally placed private school children with disabilities is crucial. It includes discussions on how special education services will be provided, types of services, apportioning of services if funds are insufficient, and providing written explanations if services are not provided. The consultation procedure is similar to that in the No Child Left Behind Act. The new law requires a written affirmation of consultation signed by private school representatives. Compliance procedures are added, allowing private school officials to submit complaints to the SEA if they feel consultation was not meaningful or timely. If dissatisfied with the SEA's determination, they may appeal. The new law requires private school officials to submit complaints to the Secretary of Education if dissatisfied with the SEA's determination regarding equitable services. Services must be secular, neutral, and nonideological, and funds for private school pupils are controlled by a public agency. Private school placement costs are not covered by the LEA unless specific findings are made. The new law specifies conditions under which reimbursement for private school placement costs can be reduced or denied by the LEA, with exceptions for cases where parents were prevented from providing notice, were unaware of the notice requirement, or if compliance would endanger the child. Additionally, a provision allows reimbursement to be maintained if the parent is illiterate or unable to write, at the discretion of a court or hearing officer. The new law specifies conditions for reimbursement of private school placement costs, with exceptions for parents who are illiterate or unable to comply due to potential harm to the child. Changes to state requirements for personnel qualifications include ensuring that all special education teachers are highly qualified by a specified deadline. P.L. 108-446 strengthens state requirements for personnel qualifications by mandating that LEAs take measurable steps to recruit, hire, train, and retain highly qualified personnel. This law also specifies conditions for private school placement reimbursement and exceptions for parents unable to comply. P.L. 108-446 revises state requirements for performance goals and indicators by aligning them with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). States must now set performance goals that match their definition of adequate yearly progress (AYP) under ESEA, including objectives for children with disabilities. P.L. 108-446 aligns state performance goals and indicators with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), requiring measurable annual objectives for progress by children with disabilities. Reporting requirements on progress towards performance goals are now annual instead of every two years. The law also amends assessment participation requirements to align with ESEA. P.L. 108-446 aligns assessment participation requirements with ESEA, ensuring all children with disabilities are included in state and district-wide assessments with accommodations or alternative assessments as needed. States must have guidelines for accommodations and implement guidelines for alternative assessments aligned with challenging academic standards. States can also adopt alternative academic standards as allowed by ESEA regulations. P.L. 108-466 requires state and districtwide tests to adhere to universal design principles and compare the achievement of children with disabilities with all children. It also adds new requirements for state eligibility determination, including restrictions on using funds to satisfy state-law mandated funding obligations to local educational agencies. The National Instructional Materials Access Center sets standards for providing accessible instructional materials for individuals with print disabilities. States must adopt the standard and ensure timely provision of materials. Policies must be in place to prevent misidentification of children with disabilities. Schools cannot require children to obtain prescriptions for controlled substances to receive services under IDEA. LEAs must meet requirements under Section 613 of IDEA to qualify for assistance. P.L. 108-446 maintains the requirement for local policies to align with state policies under IDEA. Changes include adjustments to maintenance of effort requirements and addition of early intervention services. The maintenance of effort requirement ensures that federal funds supplement, not replace, state and local funding for special education. LEAs must meet financial principles to qualify for assistance under Part B of IDEA. P.L. 108-446 introduces changes to the maintenance of effort requirement under IDEA, allowing LEAs to use up to 50% of the increase in their IDEA grant to reduce special education expenditures. This change is intended to be cumulative, unlike the previous 20% allowance which was applied on a year-to-year basis. P.L. 108-446 requires LEAs to use freed-up local funds for activities authorized under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 and for early intervention services. States can prohibit LEAs from using this authority, with modified criteria under the new law. The exception now applies to states that cover 100% of the non-Federal share of special education costs. The Secretary of Education must deny the option for a state to reduce the non-Federal share of special education costs if it would result in any local educational agency receiving less than 100% of the necessary funds to provide a free appropriate public education to all children with disabilities. P.L. 108-446 allows LEAs to use up to 15% of their IDEA Part B funding for early intervening services for students needing additional academic and behavioral support in a general education setting. Funds under P.L. 108-446 can be used for professional development, educational, and behavioral services for students in kindergarten through 3rd grade. LEAs can use IDEA funds for high-cost education services and administrative technology. P.L. 108-446 modifies provisions for public charter schools serving children with disabilities, including requirements for supplementary services and IDEA funds based on enrollment. It also addresses printed instructional material for blind persons and cooperation for electronic transfer of health and educational records for migratory children with disabilities. Section 614 of IDEA outlines key provisions for special education services for children with disabilities, including evaluation, eligibility determination, and individualized education program (IEP) requirements. P.L. 108-446 makes significant changes to reduce paperwork and non-instructional activities in these processes. The requirements in Section 614 of IDEA include initial evaluations, parental consent, reevaluations, and eligibility determinations for special education services. LEAs must conduct evaluations before providing services and reevaluate as needed. P.L. 108-446 clarifies that either the parent or LEA can request an initial evaluation, with parental consent required. Evaluations must be completed within 60 days or a state-established timeframe. Reevaluations are necessary if the child's teacher or parent requests. Reevaluations under IDEA (\u00a7614(a)(1)(C)) are required if the child's teacher, parent, or LEA determines the need based on educational and service needs, academic achievement, or functional performance. Changes may be needed if the child's progress is not meeting IEP goals or if significant improvement suggests special education is no longer necessary. P.L. 108-446 allows parents and LEAs to agree to override the three-year reevaluation requirement and prohibits reevaluations more frequently than once a year without agreement. The LEA must obtain consent from the parent for an initial evaluation to determine eligibility for IDEA services. Parental consent for evaluation does not commit to special education services. If the parent refuses services based on the evaluation, the LEA can use procedures from \u00a7615 to initiate the evaluation. P.L. 108-446 outlines procedures for parental consent in special education evaluations, including efforts to locate parents and exceptions for wards of the state. P.L. 108-446 maintains evaluation requirements for determining eligibility for IDEA services, including the use of multiple assessments that are technically sound. A notable change is the emphasis on providing assessments in the language and form most likely to yield accurate information on the child's academic, developmental, and functional abilities. P.L. 108-446 emphasizes the importance of providing assessments in the language and form most likely to yield accurate information on a child's academic, developmental, and functional abilities. It also addresses concerns about children with disabilities transferring between schools by requiring coordination for prompt completion of evaluations. Eligibility for special education services must be determined by a team of qualified professionals and the child's parent, with specific requirements for determining specific learning disabilities. In determining a child's specific learning disability, an LEA does not need to consider a severe discrepancy between achievement and intellectual ability. P.L. 108-446 mandates an evaluation before deciding a child no longer needs special education services, with exceptions for graduation or reaching the age where FAPE is no longer provided. The LEA must provide a summary of academic and functional performance for children whose eligibility ends due to graduation or age termination, along with recommendations for postsecondary goals. The IEP serves as a blueprint for education and related services. The IEP is the blueprint for education and related services provided by the LEA for children with disabilities, including goals, academic assessment procedures, and placement. P.L. 108-446 maintains general requirements for the IEP but makes changes, such as eliminating the need for \"benchmarks and short-term objectives\" for most children with disabilities. Accommodations necessary for measuring achievement on assessments should be detailed in the IEP. The IEP must explain why an alternative assessment is necessary and appropriate if the child is to take one. Transition service needs are now required in the IEP when the child is 16, with annual updates. Postsecondary goals for education, training, employment, and independent living skills are also now required. P.L. 108-446 adds rules for IEP construction, team composition, and excusal from meetings to reduce paperwork and burdens, allowing for flexibility in meeting attendance. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (P.L. 108-446) allows members to be excused from IEP meetings with parent and LEA agreement. Written input is required if the meeting pertains to the excused member's concerns. Each LEA must have an IEP for every child with a disability at the start of the school year, with added requirements for children transferring between school districts. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (P.L. 108-446) allows for changes to the IEP without holding a meeting if the parent and LEA agree. Reevaluation meetings can be consolidated with IEP meetings, and changes to the IEP can be made by amending it instead of redrafting it. Additionally, a multi-year demonstration is authorized under P.L. 108-446. P.L. 108-446 authorizes a multi-year demonstration allowing parents and LEAs to adopt optional IEPs covering up to three years, linked to natural transition points. The Secretary of Education can approve demonstration proposals from up to 15 states, with annual reviews to track progress towards goals. Alternatives to physical meetings, like video conferencing, are permitted. The new law allows for alternatives to physical meetings, such as video conferencing, for IEP and administrative meetings related to procedural safeguards under \u00a7615. This section provides safeguards for children with disabilities and their parents, with changes made in the new law closely tracking the Senate version. The new law includes detailed procedures for appointing a surrogate for parents of children who are wards of the state or unaccompanied homeless youth. The state must assign a surrogate within thirty days of determining the need. Procedural safeguards allow parties to present complaints within a two-year limit, with exceptions. The statute of limitations for presenting a complaint has exceptions, such as state law time limitations and situations where a parent was misled by the LEA. Due process procedures require a complaint notice to be provided to the other party and the SEA. Contact information can be used for communication. New provisions in due process procedures require timely filing of a complaint notice, with specific requirements outlined. The receiving party must notify the hearing officer and the other party if the notice is deemed insufficient, within fifteen days. The hearing officer must then make a determination promptly and inform the parties in writing. Detailed requirements for responding to the complaint are also specified. The due process complaint can only be amended with consent from the other party or permission from the hearing officer. Procedural safeguards notice requirements have been amended to reduce paperwork burden on schools. A copy of the procedural safeguards must be given to parents once a year, with additional copies provided upon initial referral, filing of a complaint, or parental request. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA made additions to the law regarding resolving complaints, including timeframes for making complaints, agency resolution opportunities, mediation availability, and civil action filing deadlines. Significant changes include removing the requirement for parents to meet with a disinterested party if they choose not to use mediation and allowing for legally binding agreements if resolution is reached. The 2004 law allows for a legally binding agreement in mediation, stating confidentiality and enforceability in court. It also extends due process hearing rights to parents and educational agencies, adding a requirement for a \"resolution session\" before the hearing. The resolution session, a preliminary meeting involving parents, the IEP team, and a representative of the local educational agency, must be convened within 15 days of receiving a parent's complaint. If the LEA has not resolved the issue within thirty days, a due process hearing may occur. If an agreement is reached at the resolution session, a legally binding agreement must be signed by both parties. The new law adds requirements for IDEA hearing officers, including not having conflicts of interest and possessing knowledge of the IDEA. A party can void the agreement within three business days, and the agreement must be legally binding and enforceable in any state or U.S. district court. The new law requires IDEA hearing officers to have knowledge of the IDEA statute, regulations, and case law. Parties cannot raise new issues at the due process hearing. The decision must be based on whether the child received a free appropriate public education, with exceptions for procedural errors. The new law requires IDEA hearing officers to have knowledge of the IDEA statute, regulations, and case law. A child with a disability must receive a free appropriate public education, with exceptions for procedural errors that impede the child's right to FAPE or significantly impede parental participation. A hearing officer can order compliance with procedural safeguards, and limitations on procedural inadequacies do not prevent parents from filing complaints with the SEA. The Senate report highlighted cases where schools denied FAPE based on procedural technicalities rather than actual harm to the child's education. Such findings can lead to school districts paying attorneys' fees. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA added exceptions to address procedural violations that can deny a child FAPE, including a two-year statute of limitations for filing complaints and requesting hearings. This can subject school districts to paying attorneys' fees. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA added exceptions for procedural violations that can deny a child FAPE, including a two-year statute of limitations for filing complaints and requesting hearings. The statute of limitations provisions do not apply if a parent was prevented from requesting a hearing due to misrepresentations by the LEA or withholding of information. The reauthorization also allows due process hearings conducted by an LEA to be appealed to the SEA, with provisions for safeguards such as the right to counsel, present evidence, and confront witnesses. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA added exceptions for procedural violations that can deny a child FAPE, including a two-year statute of limitations for filing complaints and requesting hearings. The new law also includes provisions for appeals to the SEA after a due process hearing, with rights to counsel, present evidence, and confront witnesses. Additionally, the reauthorization maintains provisions for final decisions after a due process hearing, with the option to appeal to state or U.S. district court within a specified timeframe. The new law also introduces a statute of limitations of ninety days for appealing a hearing officer's decision to a court. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA introduced provisions for attorneys' fees in special education cases, allowing for fees to be awarded against attorneys or parents if complaints are frivolous, unreasonable, or presented for an improper purpose. These provisions do not apply to limitations on attorneys' fees in the District of Columbia. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA introduced provisions for attorneys' fees in special education cases, including requirements for fees to be based on prevailing rates, prohibition of bonuses or multipliers, and exceptions for settlement offers. The new law also prohibits attorneys' fees for resolution sessions and allows for reductions if a parent unreasonably prolongs the resolution process. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA introduced provisions for attorneys' fees in special education cases, including requirements for fees based on prevailing rates, prohibition of bonuses or multipliers, and exceptions for settlement offers. The new law also allows a court to reduce attorneys' fees if the parents' attorney unreasonably protracts the final resolution of the controversy. The stay put provision remains in place, stating that a child with a disability stays in their current education placement during proceedings. Disciplinary provisions for children with disabilities were contentious in both the 1997 and 2004 reauthorizations. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA addressed disciplinary provisions for children with disabilities, with schools arguing for equal treatment and advocates emphasizing the need to prevent denial of services. Despite changes, the concept of a manifestation determination was retained. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA introduced new provisions regarding the authority of school personnel in determining disciplinary actions for children with disabilities. School personnel can consider unique circumstances on a case-by-case basis when deciding on a change in placement or suspension for up to ten school days. If a violation of the school code is not related to the child's disability, disciplinary procedures can be applied similarly to children with and without disabilities, with the exception that educational services must continue. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA includes provisions for providing educational services to children with disabilities even when they are removed from their current placement due to behavior issues. This includes ensuring access to the general education curriculum, progress towards IEP goals, and receiving behavioral assessments and interventions. The concept of a manifestation determination is key in determining if the behavior is related to the child's disability. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA includes provisions for educational services for children with disabilities, even if they are removed from their current placement due to behavior issues. The concept of a manifestation determination is crucial in determining if the behavior is related to the child's disability. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA includes provisions for educational services for children with disabilities, even if they are removed from their current placement due to behavior issues. The manifestation determination process determines if the behavior is linked to the child's disability, or if it is a result of the LEA's failure to implement the IEP. This process does not apply to short-term removals by school personnel. The current manifestation determination process differs from previous law, where the IEP team and qualified personnel conducted the review. Under the 2004 reauthorization of IDEA, the IEP team must determine if a child's behavior is a manifestation of their disability. This process involves conducting a functional behavior assessment if the conduct is deemed linked to the child's disability. Under the 2004 reauthorization of IDEA, the IEP team must determine if a child's behavior is a manifestation of their disability by conducting a functional behavior assessment. If necessary, a behavior intervention plan should be implemented or modified. The child may return to their original placement unless there are serious circumstances, in which case they may be temporarily placed in an alternative education setting. Under the 2004 reauthorization of IDEA, the time limitation for a child's placement in an interim alternative setting is now for not more than 45 school days. This placement is allowed if a child carries a weapon, possesses illegal drugs, or inflicts serious bodily injury. The regulations define \"school day\" as any day students are in attendance for instructional purposes. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA allows for a child to be placed in an interim alternative setting for up to 45 school days if they have inflicted serious bodily injury at school. The LEA must notify parents of disciplinary decisions and procedural safeguards. The IEP team determines the interim setting, including cases where behavior is not a manifestation of disability or serious bodily injury occurs. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA allows for a parent or LEA to request a hearing if they disagree with placement decisions or believe current placement may cause harm. A hearing officer can order a change in placement, including returning the child to their original placement or placing them in an interim setting for up to 45 school days if harm is likely. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA allows for a parent or LEA to request a hearing if they disagree with placement decisions or believe current placement may cause harm. The new law requires an expedited hearing within 20 school days and a determination within ten school days. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA made changes regarding when a LEA is deemed to have knowledge that a child is a child with a disability. This includes instances where a parent expresses concern in writing, requests an evaluation, or when a teacher raises specific concerns about the child's behavior. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA removed the provision that a LEA is deemed to have knowledge of a child's disability based on behavior or performance. A new exception states that a LEA is not deemed to have knowledge if the parent has not allowed evaluation, refused services, or if evaluation determined the child is not disabled. The conditions regarding lack of knowledge were retained. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA maintains requirements for children with disabilities in disciplinary measures and referral to law enforcement. Agencies can report crimes committed by children with disabilities to appropriate authorities. Definitions of \"controlled substance,\" \"illegal drug,\" and \"weapon\" remain the same as in the 1997 reauthorization. A new definition of \"serious bodily injury\" is added. Serious bodily injury is defined as bodily injury involving a substantial risk of death, extreme physical pain, protracted and obvious disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of bodily function. The 1997 reauthorization of IDEA ensures that rights under federal laws protecting the rights of children with disabilities are not restricted. The 2004 reauthorization maintains this language, stating that nothing in this part shall limit these rights. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA includes provisions for transferring rights to children with disabilities upon reaching the age of majority, allowing parents to receive notices by email, and permitting separate due process complaints. Changes were made to Section 616 to focus on student performance monitoring rather than just procedural compliance. The Secretary of Education oversees state supervision and performance plans for Part B implementation. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA emphasizes monitoring student performance over procedural compliance. The Secretary of Education enforces Part B by requiring states to monitor implementation by LEAs and focus on improving educational outcomes for children with disabilities. Priority areas for monitoring include providing a free appropriate public education, general supervisory authority, and addressing disproportionate representation in special education. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA emphasizes monitoring student performance over procedural compliance, with priority areas including providing a free appropriate public education and addressing disproportionate representation in special education. The Secretary of Education is directed to monitor states rigorously, request necessary information, and enforce IDEA requirements. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA emphasizes monitoring student performance over procedural compliance, with priority areas including providing a free appropriate public education and addressing disproportionate representation in special education. States must have a performance plan evaluating their efforts to implement IDEA requirements and purposes, with the Secretary of Education approving the plan. States must review and amend their performance plan every six years. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA requires states to establish measurable targets for indicators, collect valid and reliable information, and report annually to the Secretary. It prohibits a nationwide database of personally identifiable information. States must use targets to analyze LEA performance and report annually to the public. The state's performance plan must be publicly available through various means. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA mandates states to set measurable targets for indicators, collect reliable information, and report annually to the Secretary. They are prohibited from disclosing personally identifiable information. State performance plans must involve stakeholder input and be publicly available. P.L. 108-446 requires the Secretary of Education to review state performance plans with stakeholder input and public dissemination. The Secretary can approve or disapprove a plan within 120 days, providing notice and an opportunity for a hearing if disapproval is considered. If the state responds within 30 days with requested information, the Secretary must make a final decision within 30 days. The Secretary of Education may approve or disapprove state performance plans within 120 days, with a later deadline of 30 days after resubmission. Failure to respond within 30 days results in plan disapproval. Annual reviews are required, and interventions may be necessary based on performance evaluations. The Secretary must provide notice and a hearing for substantial intervention under P.L. 108-446. If the state fails to meet Part B requirements, the Secretary must investigate root causes before selecting enforcement options. If the state needs assistance for two consecutive years, the Secretary can provide technical assistance and take enforcement actions. The state may face intervention and enforcement actions if it fails to meet Part B requirements for three or more consecutive years. The Secretary can require corrective action plans or compliance agreements to address issues. The Secretary can take various enforcement actions if a state fails to meet Part B requirements for three or more consecutive years, including withholding funds, seeking to recover funds, withholding further payments, or referring the matter for enforcement action. The Secretary can take enforcement actions if a state fails to meet Part B requirements for three or more consecutive years, including recovering funds, withholding payments, referring cases to the Office of the Inspector General, and taking appropriate enforcement action. The Secretary must provide notice and a hearing before withholding funds, and may suspend payments or obligation authority after giving reasonable notice. The Secretary is required to report to specific committees on these actions. The Secretary may withhold payments if a state fails to meet Part B requirements for three or more consecutive years. The report to committees must detail the specific actions taken and reasons for them. Payments can be limited to certain programs or agencies until the situation is rectified. If a state needs intervention in implementing Part B requirements, it must inform the public.

The Secretary's findings of fact, supported by substantial evidence, are conclusive but can be remanded for further evidence. P.L. 108-446 requires the SEA to prohibit a LEA from reducing maintenance of effort if not meeting Part B requirements. The 2004 reauthorization allows the Secretary to monitor and enforce IDEA without restrictions. In some states, responsibility for IDEA compliance in adult prisons falls to a different public agency.

The new law adds two additional permitted state-level activities for early intervention services for children with disabilities under Part C infants and toddlers program. Part C of IDEA authorizes grants for early intervention programs for infants and toddlers with disabilities, differing from Part B in eligibility criteria. The new law allows states to extend early intervention services for children with disabilities under Part C programs until they are eligible for kindergarten. This addition maintains the overall structure of Part C with some revisions, including the use of individualized family service plans instead of IEPs. Services are to be provided in natural environments to the maximum extent appropriate.
