    "content": "The curr_chunk is about prompt consideration of certain petitions requesting federal recognition as an Indian tribe. The Secretary must publish a proposed finding within 6 months and a final determination within one year of the enactment of the Act for each eligible tribe seeking federal recognition. Tribes have the option to opt into an expedited procedure within 45 days of the Act's enactment. If a potentially eligible tribe notifies the Secretary within 90 days of the Act's enactment to opt into expedited procedures, they will be considered an eligible tribe under the Act. The number of members in a tribe's petition for recognition will not affect the consideration process. The Secretary may review the eligibility of individual members or groups listed in a petition. If the Secretary fails to publish a proposed finding or final determination within the required time period, the eligible tribe can seek court determination for recognition as an Indian tribe. If the final determination refuses to recognize an eligible tribe as an Indian tribe, they can seek a review in court within one year. No other petitions for recognition can be processed until the Secretary publishes a proposed finding for each eligible tribe. The Act does not change the criteria for determining federally recognized tribes. An eligible tribe is defined as one that applied for recognition before October 17, 1988, is listed as \"Ready, Waiting for Active Consideration\" by July 1, 2004, and notifies the Secretary within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The Act outlines the criteria for a potentially eligible tribe to be considered for recognition as an Indian tribe under an expedited procedure. This includes tribes that applied before October 17, 1988, are listed as \"Ready, Waiting for Active Consideration\" by July 1, 2004, and notify the Secretary of their decision. The Act outlines criteria for tribes to be considered for recognition as an Indian tribe under an expedited procedure. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior or their designee."
