    "content": "The Social Security trustees project that the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund will be depleted in 2032 and the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund in 2034. The combined OASDI trust funds are projected to be depleted in 2034. Despite this, Social Security would still be able to pay benefits even after the trust funds are depleted. In 2034, the Social Security program is projected to have enough tax revenues to pay about 79% of scheduled benefits, declining to 74% by 2092. Although the trust funds would be insolvent, they would not be completely broke and unable to pay any benefits. It is unclear how necessary reductions would be implemented if a trust fund became insolvent. The text explains how trust funds work for Social Security, including projections for future operations and potential consequences if the funds run out. It also discusses scenarios of benefit cuts or tax increases if Congress waits until insolvency to act. Social Security provides monthly cash benefits to retired or disabled workers and their dependents, with insurance protection earned through working in covered jobs. In 2018, an estimated 174 million people will work in jobs covered by Social Security, with benefits based on career-average earnings. The Social Security Administration authorized benefit payments for 62.5 million beneficiaries, including retired workers, disabled workers, dependents, and survivors. Average benefit payments ranged from $596 to $1,412. The Social Security Administration authorizes benefit payments for various beneficiaries, with average payments ranging from $596 to $1,412. Social Security's receipts and expenditures are managed through two federal trust funds: the OASI trust fund for retired workers and the DI trust fund for disabled workers. These funds operate separately but are closely linked. The OASI and DI trust funds are closely linked and have been reallocated in the past to equalize their financial conditions. Analysts often treat them collectively as the combined OASDI trust funds. The Government Accountability Office notes that federal trust funds differ significantly from private sector trusts in terms of their meaning and operation. The federal government creates trust funds with designated assets to benefit specific groups or individuals. Unlike private trust funds, the government can adjust future collections and payments, change laws, and control fund earnings. Revenue for these funds comes from Social Security payroll taxes, federal income taxes on benefits, and interest on investments. The payroll tax is 12.40% on wages and self-employment income up to $128,400 in 2018. In 2018, Social Security payroll tax is 12.40% on income up to $128,400, with 10.03% going to the OASI trust fund and 2.37% to the DI trust fund. Some benefits are subject to federal income tax, with revenue going to Social Security and Medicare trust funds. In 2017, trust funds received $996.6 billion, mostly from payroll taxes, and spent $952.5 billion, mainly on benefit payments. 0.5% was transferred to the Railroad Retirement Board. The Social Security trust funds exchange funds with the Railroad Retirement Board annually to maintain financial balance. Surpluses are invested in U.S. Treasury securities, creating assets for Social Security but liabilities for the government. In 2017, the trust funds had a surplus of $44.1 billion. In 2017, the Social Security trust funds had a surplus of $44.1 billion. The trust funds may face an annual deficit in 2018 for the first time since 1982, as projected by the Social Security trustees. Total receipts may exceed total expenditures, leading to a cash-flow surplus or deficit based on tax revenues. In 2017, the Social Security trust funds had a cash-flow deficit of $41.0 billion, with total receipts of $996.6 billion and total expenditures of $952.5 billion. The trust funds' combined balance increased by $44.1 billion, reaching $2.85 trillion in investments in U.S. government bonds. The annual surplus of $44.1 billion in 2017 increased the trust funds' combined balance from $2.85 trillion to $2.89 trillion. Insolvency means the funds cannot pay benefits in full and on time, but it does not mean they will be completely broke. The OASI trust fund was created in 1939, and the DI trust fund was established in 1956. Neither fund has ever become insolvent. The trust funds have existed since 1957, running annual surpluses in most years but facing deficits since 1975. The aging population and economic factors have led to cash-flow deficits since 2010, requiring transfers from the Treasury's General Fund. Since 2010, the combined trust funds have faced cash-flow deficits, projected to continue indefinitely. Despite this, interest income has exceeded the deficit, resulting in annual surpluses averaging 5% of total expenditures from 2010 to 2017. Cash-flow deficits do not directly impact Social Security, but redemption of trust fund bonds can strain the federal budget. In the early 1980s, a solvency crisis threatened the OASI trust fund, leading to temporary borrowing from the DI and HI trust funds. In 1982, the OASI trust fund faced a solvency crisis, leading to temporary borrowing from the DI and HI trust funds. The Secretary of the Treasury authorized a $581 million loan to cover a shortfall in benefit checks. This measure allowed policymakers time to develop a sustainable solution, leading to the Social Security Amendments of 1983 which increased income and reduced spending, resulting in significant surpluses from 1987 to 2009. The DI trust fund faced declining solvency due to an imbalance between receipts and expenditures. Between 1995 and 2015, tax revenues remained flat while expenditures grew, mainly due to an increase in disabled-worker beneficiaries from 4.2 million to over 8.9 million. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 increased the number of beneficiaries by 113%, from 4.2 million to 8.9 million. It reallocated the payroll tax rate between the OASI and DI trust funds, giving DI a larger share for 2016 through 2018. The DI trust fund's share of the combined tax rate increased by 0.57 percentage points to 2.37%, while OASI's share decreased to 10.03%. The tax rate allocation is set to return to 2015 levels for 2019 and beyond. The trustees' report focuses on Social Security projections, with the DI Trust Fund depleted in 2032 and the OASI Trust Fund in 2034. There is uncertainty in projections, with a 10% chance of insolvency in 2032 or earlier and a 10% chance in 2039 or later. The Congressional Budget Office projects insolvency in 2030. Trust funds will continue to receive income from payroll taxes even after insolvency. The trustees project that tax income will cover about 79% of scheduled benefits after the combined trust funds become insolvent in 2034, declining to 74% in 2092. The trust fund ratio, which peaked at 358% in 2008, is now declining and will reach zero when the funds are depleted. The Social Security trust funds will reach zero when depleted, leading to potential insolvency. The Antideficiency Act prohibits excess government spending, meaning full benefits may not be paid on time if funds are insufficient. Social Security is an entitlement program, legally obligating the government to pay benefits to eligible individuals. If the federal government fails to pay Social Security benefits as required by law, beneficiaries can take legal action. Insolvency does not excuse the government from providing benefits. The Antideficiency Act limits government agencies from exceeding authorized payments. When the trust funds run out, beneficiaries may receive reduced or delayed benefit payments. Total payable benefits would be lower than scheduled benefits. New beneficiaries' payment dates are generally based on their day of birth. If trust fund insolvency caused delays, benefit payments could be made in a different order until the funds ran out. Restoring Social Security solvency has various options that could be combined. Options to restore Social Security solvency include decreasing benefits, increasing income through tax hikes or fund transfers, and implementing policy options like benefit cuts or tax increases after trust fund depletion. Options to restore Social Security solvency include decreasing benefits, increasing income through tax hikes or fund transfers, and implementing policy options like benefit cuts or tax increases after trust fund depletion. The tax increase scenario involves raising the payroll tax rate, converting Social Security to a pay-as-you-go system with no trust fund assets. Congress could address solvency by cutting benefits to match tax income annually if the trust funds run out. The Social Security trustees project that achieving annual balance would require benefit cuts of 21% in 2034, increasing to 26% by 2092. Larger benefit reductions would be needed after 2092 due to longer life expectancies. Replacement rates, the ratio of an individual's program benefit to past covered earnings, can help understand the impact of benefit reductions on beneficiaries. Social Security benefits are indexed to wage growth to maintain replacement rates steady. Replacement rates vary based on lifetime earnings, with lower earners receiving higher rates. Projected replacement rates under benefit cut scenario for low, medium, and high earners are shown. In 2018, estimated replacement rates for low, medium, and high earners are 56%, 42%, and 34% respectively. A 21% reduction would impact low earners more, with their rate dropping from 55% to 43% in 2034. High earners would see a drop from 34% to 26%. Benefit amounts vary based on lifetime earnings, with low earners estimated to receive $12,531 annually, medium earners $20,662, and high earners $27,374. The future initial real benefit amounts in 2018 dollars show how benefits' purchasing power will change over time. Scheduled initial real benefit amounts are projected to increase by 28% between 2018 and 2034. However, under a benefit cut scenario, payable benefit levels are expected to drop by 21% after the trust funds become insolvent in 2034. Payable benefits in 2035 are projected to be similar to those in 2018. The system could be balanced by raising the payroll tax rate to ensure there is enough tax income to pay scheduled benefits. The trustees project that paying scheduled benefits after depletion in 2034 would require an increase in the combined employee and employer payroll tax rate. Raising the payroll tax rate would increase most workers' taxes by the same proportion, with the effective increase being smaller for higher earners due to the taxable maximum. The payroll tax rate would need to reach 16.7% by 2092 to sustain balance. The Social Security payroll tax is levied at a flat rate starting at the first dollar of earnings. The Social Security trust funds are projected to become insolvent, prompting the need for changes to maintain solvency. Taking prompt action would allow for gradual phase-in of changes, rather than abrupt benefit cuts or tax increases, giving workers time to plan for retirement."
