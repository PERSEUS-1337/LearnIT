    "content": "President Bush signed the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2002, reducing general provisions from 67 to 42. The act appropriates $408 million in special federal payments and approves the District's $7.1 billion budget, including $5.3 billion in general operating funds. It includes $12.6 million for security planning post-9/11 attacks and $3.4 million for security at a World Bank and IMF meeting. The World Bank and IMF meeting scheduled for late September 2001 was postponed due to security concerns following the events of September 11. In response to the attacks, Congress appropriated $40 billion in emergency supplemental assistance for national needs. The Defense Appropriations Act, P.L. 107-117, signed on January 10, 2002, allocated $200 million for special federal payments to the District of Columbia and regional entities for upgrading emergency response plans. Since the signing of the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2001, the city has made progress in improving services and financial health. The CFO's report in January 2001 showed a $241 million budget surplus for FY2000, meeting the requirements for the return of home rule. The District of Columbia has met the requirements for the return of home rule, with a favorable report marking the end of a control period. Progress has been made in addressing government service delivery issues, including school reform and medical services for the uninsured. Challenges remain, such as an $80 million budget deficit in the Board of Education and debates over downsizing D.C. General Hospital. The downsizing of D.C. General Hospital led to strained relations between the city's leadership. The District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act of 1995 created the Authority and the Office of Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) to improve city services and financial solvency. Reforms, federal assistance, and economic growth have resulted in four years of budget surpluses, as required by P.L. 104-8 for the termination of the Authority and the return of home rule. The District achieved budget surpluses for FY1997, FY1998, FY1999, and FY2000, totaling $186 million, $445 million, $86.4 million, and $241 million respectively. Natwar Gandhi became the city's third CFO in 2000, and the FY2000 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report showed a surplus of $241 million, meeting key objectives for the fourth consecutive year. The Office of the CFO has been crucial in maintaining budget discipline and fiscal health in the city for the past four years. Legislation is being considered to make the OCFO a permanent part of the city's governing structure, as without it, the OCFO will cease to exist after September 30, 2001. In July 2001, a proposal to strengthen the powers of the CFO was considered but later withdrawn by a conference committee. The proposal to extend the OCFO's independence was withdrawn during conference committee consideration in deference to legislation by the city council. The legislation makes the CFO position permanent, allowing the mayor to appoint and remove the CFO with city council consent, and transferring management responsibilities to the CFO. A public hearing was held on June 19, 2001, regarding the Independence of the Chief Financial Officer Establishment Act of 2001. The CFO's management responsibilities were transferred by legislative act 14-089, approved by the Council on July 10, 2001. Congress has 30 legislative days to review the act, which addresses issues with the Public Benefits Corporation and D.C. General Hospital. The mayor, city council, Authority, CFO, and Chair of the Board of Directors of the PBC were required to develop a restructuring plan for D.C. General Hospital due to mismanagement issues. The PBC accumulated $109 million in unbudgeted loans from the city since 1997, using Medicaid reimbursements inappropriately. The hospital failed to seek reimbursement effectively and had questionable hiring practices. The PBC, under scrutiny for mismanagement, received criticism from health care consultants for lack of oversight, poor patient care, and inexperienced management. Consultants recommended downsizing the hospital to a community access facility. By late August 2000, staff layoffs had begun, with 550 employees out of 2,000 to be laid off by year-end. In December 2000, the mayor proposed formal downsizing with Authority support. In 2000, the mayor proposed downsizing D.C. General Hospital and contracting health care services to a private group led by Greater Southeast Community Hospital. The city council rejected the privatization plan, preferring to keep D.C. General as a full-service hospital and providing $21 million in assistance to keep it open. Concerns were raised about the impact on the city's uninsured residents. The Authority used its veto power to negate a city council's override of a mayoral veto regarding the $21 million proposal to keep D.C. General Hospital open until the end of the fiscal year. Additionally, the Authority dissolved the PBC and transferred its responsibilities to the city's Department of Health, signing an agreement with Greater Southeast Community Hospital Corporation and the Healthcare Alliance to provide healthcare services to uninsured residents. The Authority's controversial actions included overriding the city council's rejection of the mayor's proposal for healthcare services and providing $21 million in supplemental assistance. This led to a legal challenge by council members questioning the Authority's powers to award contracts and dissolve the Public Benefit Corporation. The council members sued the Authority for acting without statutory authority and awarding a contract against the city council's objection. The court found that only council members had standing to sue, but the Authority acted within its powers granted by Congress. In June 2000, voters approved a referendum changing the Board of Education structure. The new nine-member Board of Education includes representatives from four school districts, an elected chair, and members appointed by the mayor. This structure gives the mayor a significant voice in public education and holds him accountable for the success of the city's schools. In November 2000, voters elected a chair and four members, with the mayor appointing four others. The school board began overseeing the system in January 2001 and recently extended Superintendent Paul Vance's contract, receiving praise from various stakeholders. The reform-minded Board of Education and superintendent face challenges in improving special education, academic achievement, and physical facilities. Issues include oversight of charter schools and skepticism about the effectiveness of the school board. Reports criticize the school system's transportation services for special education students and delivery of other special education services. The draft report criticizes the District of Columbia Public Schools' past operation of special education programs and makes recommendations to strengthen staff, improve transportation services, and assess students with special needs. Despite stagnant performance on standardized tests, Superintendent Paul Vance remains optimistic about future improvements. The DCPS has hired new principals and implemented a strategic plan to improve interaction with city agencies and hold principals accountable for school performance. Lack of progress in public school academic performance has led to growth in public charter schools, with nearly 10,000 students enrolled in about 34 schools. Concerns include inconsistency between governing bodies overseeing charter schools and increased regulation costs. On September 6, 2001, city and school officials announced an $80 million budget deficit for FY2001 due to overspending in special education and failure to document expenses properly. The deficit will be addressed through hiring freezes, fund transfers, and increased tax revenue. The overspending was a source of embarrassment for school officials, the CFO, and city leaders. The school board considered shortening the school year by 7 days to address a deficit, but city leaders provided additional funding. The District government successfully regained control of four agencies from court-appointed receivers, including Housing Authority and Jail Medical Services. Mayor Williams negotiated the return of Mental Health Services and Child and Family Services to District control. The court-appointed receivers' lack of progress led to the return of administrative control of the Child and Family Services agency to the District government. Judge Thomas Hogan approved the plan on October 23, 2000, after the agency had been under receivership since August 1995 due to findings of abuse and neglect. The consent decree established preconditions for the agency's return to District control. The Child and Family Services Agency was elevated to cabinet-level status in 2001, fulfilling a requirement for termination of receivership. Legislation is being considered to amend the family court division in DC, increasing the number of judges and requiring expertise in family matters. The tragic death of 23-month-old Briana Blackmon led to congressional interest in reforming Family Court in DC. Legislation required judges to have expertise in family law and serve for a minimum term of three to five years. The Department of Mental Health was transferred back to District government control due to the receiver's inability to manage the agency effectively. The District of Columbia faced challenges with its agency overseeing group homes, leading to the deaths of residents. Legislation outlined conditions for the return of home rule, including financial obligations and balanced budgets. The District met the final precondition in 2001. In 2001, the District of Columbia met the final precondition for the return of home rule, allowing the city's elected leadership to resume control. Congress explored the future role of the CFO and the Authority. The city council passed legislation authorizing the mayor to appoint a CFO for a five-year term with expanded responsibilities. Additionally, Congress allocated $40 billion in emergency supplemental assistance after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. After the 9/11 attacks, Congress allocated $40 billion in emergency funds (P.L. 107-38) for federal, state, and local preparedness. The District requested $13 million for responding to the Pentagon attack, with $6 million reimbursed by the Bush Administration. Criticisms were made towards the District's emergency management response. Additional funds may be directed to upgrade emergency response capabilities in the region. The city is accelerating work on a regional plan for terrorist attacks and has requested additional funds for emergency preparedness and economic recovery. The mayor requested $249 million for emergency planning and response activities, $512.9 million for economic recovery activities, and $182 million in economic stimulus assistance for various projects. The final decision on the budget request is pending. The President signed P.L. 107-20, the Supplemental Appropriations Act for FY2001, which includes $107 million in additional appropriations. The funds will be sourced from the city's surplus or reserves to cover cost overruns or new initiatives. Rescissions were made for taxicab inspectors and employee compensation simplification, with funds transferred to the public education budget for the Excel Institute Adult Education Program. The mayor is required to report to Congress on the use of these funds. The Excel Institute Adult Education Program received additional funding from the Supplemental Appropriations Act for FY2001. The Bush Administration proposed $342.5 million in federal payments to the District of Columbia, with a focus on the courts and criminal justice system. This included $147.3 million for the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency. The Bush Administration proposed $342.5 million in federal payments to the District of Columbia, with a focus on the courts and criminal justice system. This included $147.3 million for the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency, $111.2 million for court operations, and $32.7 million for the trustee overseeing corrections. District officials submitted a $5.3 billion budget for FY2002 to Congress, including a $150 million reserve fund. The city's budget for FY2002 included a $150 million reserve fund mandated by the District of Columbia Appropriations Act of 1999. It also aimed to increase funding for public education by $107 million, human support services by $207 million, and general government support by $88.8 million. The budget requires approval from Congress, with specific requirements outlined in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The Senate and House Appropriations Committees approved revised budget allocations for the District of Columbia in FY2002, with the House revising its allocation to $399 million. Congress reviews and approves the District's budget, including federal payments and local funds, with final approval required from a joint conference committee before it is sent to the President for signing into law. The District of Columbia's budget for FY2002 is reviewed and approved by Congress, with final approval needed from a joint conference committee before it is sent to the President for signing into law. Funds are allocated for Defender Services for the District of Columbia Courts to address previous misuse of funds. Additionally, a separate appropriation is created to ensure payment for attorneys representing indigent persons, guardianship, and abused and neglected children in court proceedings. The $5 million available for FY2001 is unobligated funds from FY2000, not included in total special federal payments. Courts can reallocate up to $1 million. Funds were originally for security at a World Bank and IMF meeting canceled after 9/11. H.R. 2944, House Version, approved $398 million for DC, mostly for court and prison activities. The House bill allocated approximately 95% of the $398 million in special federal payments for court and prison activities, with an additional $16 million for emergency planning. The funds originally intended for security at a World Bank and IMF meeting were postponed due to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The House Appropriations Committee reported out the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2002 on September 20, 2001, following delays caused by the attacks. The House Subcommittee on the District of Columbia Appropriations completed its markup of a bill for FY2002 budget recommendations. House and Senate committees aimed to reduce redundant provisions in the District of Columbia appropriations. District officials have been critical of social riders in previous acts. The House Appropriations Committee approved an amendment to remove the prohibition on using District funds for implementing the Health Care Benefits Expansion Act of 1992, allowing unrelated couples to register as domestic partners for health insurance coverage. The Senate approved its version of H.R. 2944, including $408 million for various District of Columbia programs such as courts, prisons, and emergency planning in response to the 9/11 attacks. Additionally, $1.4 million was allocated for mobile wireless links between the city's Chief Technology Office and federal law enforcement agencies. The Senate Appropriations Committee included a provision in the FY2002 General Provisions, Senate Bill to remove the prohibition on using District funds for implementing the Health Care Benefits Expansion Act of 1992. This would allow unrelated couples to be covered under the same health insurance plan. The Committee also reduced the number of general provisions in the bill to 36, retaining provisions related to medical marijuana, abortion, and needle exchange programs that District officials wanted eliminated or modified. Senator Allen's amendment to reinstate the prohibition on using District funds for needle exchange programs was defeated during the full Senate's consideration of the bill. The Senate reinstated the prohibition on using District funds for needle exchange programs with a vote of 53 to 47. Senator Hutchison's amendment increased the cap on funding for attorneys' fees for special education services to $150 per hour and $3,000 per case. Senators Durbin and Boxer introduced an amendment exempting certain categories of students' families from the funding cap when challenging special education placement. The Senate approved the Durbin/Boxer amendment by a vote of 73 to 26, along with a related amendment by Senator Landrieu. The amendment directs the General Accounting Office to report on awards in judgments exceeding allowable attorney fees for special education placement challenges in the District of Columbia. For more details on H.R. 2944, see CRS Report RL31159(pdf). The District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2002 was approved by the House and Senate in December 2001. It allocated funds for court, prisons, offender supervision, and emergency planning in response to the September 11 terrorist attacks. Funding for the Correction's Trustee was reduced due to the closure of the Lorton Correctional Facility. The House and Senate conferees agreed to reduce the number of general provisions in the Conference Bill, focusing on removing arcane, redundant, or irrelevant provisions. This includes eliminating restrictions on needle exchange programs near schools and the prohibition on using District funds for the Health Care Benefits Expansion Act of 1992. The District's Health Care Benefits Expansion Act of 1992 was implemented with restrictions on federal and District funds for needle programs, lobbying for voting representation, and medical marijuana. The act also directed the GAO to report on legal fees related to special needs children in education cases. Signed into law on December 21, 2001, as P.L. 107-96. In 2001, P.L. 107-96 established reserve funds in the District of Columbia General Funds. These funds include a contingency reserve fund and an emergency cash reserve fund, to be built up over time. One key policy issue was the funding of a needle exchange program, which raised debates on home rule, public health policy, and government involvement in illegal drug use. Proponents of needle exchange programs argue they reduce HIV spread among drug users by providing clean needles. Opponents claim it sanctions illegal drug use and advocate for drug treatment programs instead. The debate also involves issues of home rule and funding restrictions imposed by Congress. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY1999 and FY2001 prohibited federal and District funds for needle exchange programs. Section 150 of the FY2001 Act restricted needle distribution near schools. Earlier versions considered banning organizations receiving funds from supporting needle exchange programs with private funds. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY1999 and FY2001 initially prohibited federal and District funds for needle exchange programs. However, the final version of the act, P.L. 107-96, lifted the restriction on needle exchange programs near schools but maintained the prohibition on the use of federal and District funds for such programs. Only one entity, Prevention Works, currently operates a privately funded needle exchange program in the District. The Senate bill allowed local government funds for needle exchange programs but maintained the prohibition on federal funds. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY1999 included a provision prohibiting the counting of a voter-approved medical marijuana initiative. Congress's power in this matter was challenged in court by the ACLU. On September 17, 1999, Judge Richard Roberts ruled that Congress did not have the power to stifle political speech, allowing the city to tally votes on a ballot initiative. Congress had 30 days to pass a resolution to prevent the initiative's implementation. Language prohibiting the initiative was included in the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2000. Opponents argue that such actions undermine home rule. The District government is prohibited from implementing public funding for abortion services for residents, a perennial issue debated by Congress during annual deliberations on District of Columbia appropriations. The prohibition on using federal or District funds for abortion services has been in place since 1995. Congress has placed limitations on this issue since 1979. Since 1979, Congress has restricted the use of federal and District funds for abortion services in the District of Columbia. In 1989, President Reagan endorsed the inclusion of District funds for abortion services, with restrictions only for cases where the mother's life would be endangered. President Bush vetoed the abortion provision twice in 1989. In 1989, President Bush vetoed the District's FY1990 appropriations act over the abortion issue but signed P.L. 101-168 with restrictions on the use of District revenue for abortion services. The District successfully fought for the removal of funding limitations in the FY1994 appropriations act, reinstating rape and incest as qualifying circumstances for public funding of abortion services. However, subsequent appropriations acts limited funding to cases where the mother's life is endangered. The FY2002 District of Columbia Appropriations Act prohibits the use of District and federal funds for abortion services except in cases where the mother's life is endangered or in cases of rape or incest. The bill included $16 million in funding for emergency planning, specifically for security support for the IMF/World Bank meeting. The FY2002 District of Columbia Appropriations Act includes $17 million in funding from the IMF and World Bank for security support in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. This funding includes $3.4 million for security planning for the World Bank/IMF meeting and additional budget items for combating terrorist acts. Funds for these operations come from local revenue sources. Congress also appropriated $1.4 billion for a wireless telecommunication system linking various government agencies. The FY2002 District of Columbia Appropriations Act includes funding for security support in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, including $17 million from the IMF and World Bank. Congress also appropriated $1.4 billion for a wireless telecommunication system linking government agencies. Additionally, the Defense Appropriations Act for FY2002 provided $200 million in special federal payments for emergency response activities in the District of Columbia and selected regional agencies. The House Appropriations Committee approved an amendment to lift the congressional prohibition on using District funds for the Health Care Benefits Expansion Act, allowing unmarried individuals to register as domestic partners for health benefits. District government employees enrolled in the District of Columbia Employees Health Benefits Program can purchase family health insurance coverage that includes domestic partners. Opponents argue it undermines marriage, while proponents support it as a matter of local autonomy. Over 115 local governments and 4,000 companies already offer benefits to domestic partners. On September 25, 2001, Representative Weldon's amendment to ban the use of District funds for healthcare expansion failed in the House. The Senate bill allows the District to use city funds for the Employees Health Benefits Program. In 1999, Congress mandated a $150 million reserve fund for unexpected expenses, with strict criteria for expenditure approval. The District government requested Congress to eliminate the $150 million budget reserve fund, which was endorsed by the Senate Appropriations. Additionally, in 2000, Congress required the District to establish two additional funds: an emergency reserve fund and a contingency reserve fund, totaling 7% of the District's operating revenue by 2007. The emergency reserve fund requires a 4% positive fund balance above the projected general fund expenditure level for the following year, while the contingency fund sets aside up to 3% of each year's operating budget for unforeseen needs. The Senate Appropriations subcommittee endorsed a plan to abolish the $150 million budget reserve fund in June 2001. The final act requires the District to maintain a budget reserve of $120 million in FY2002, $70 million in FY2003, and a cumulative cash reserve of $50 million for FY2004 and FY2005 under P.L. 107-96."
