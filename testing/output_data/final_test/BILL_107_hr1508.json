    "content": "The \"Elementary and Secondary Counseling Improvement Act of 2001\" amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to enhance elementary and secondary school counseling programs. Congress finds that 1 in 10 children suffer from severe mental illnesses, with few receiving treatment. The burden on families has created a health crisis, as children's needs are not being met by existing systems. There is a growing interest in developing new solutions to reach children and adolescents with mental illnesses. Schools are a strategic point for providing mental health and counseling services to children, allowing for early identification and treatment of emotional or behavioral issues in underserved youth. The Surgeon General's 2000 report emphasizes the importance of effective treatment in diverting youth violence. The effectiveness of mental health and counseling services in preventing violence and crime among youths is highlighted. A model program for elementary school counseling showed a significant decrease in referrals to the principal's office, use of force, weapons, and school suspensions. The report by the Institute of Medicine recommended lower student-to-school counselor, psychologist, and social worker ratios. Grants can be awarded to establish or expand school counseling programs. The Secretary will prioritize grant applications based on the need for counseling services in schools, innovative approaches to school counseling, and potential for replication and dissemination. Grants aim to establish or expand school counseling programs with lower student-to-counselor ratios. In awarding grants under this section, the Secretary ensures equitable geographic distribution and limits grant duration to 3 years. The maximum grant amount is $400,000 per fiscal year, and funds must supplement, not supplant, other sources for school-based counseling services. Each funded program must be comprehensive in addressing counseling needs. The counseling services funded under this section must be comprehensive, use a preventive approach, expand services through qualified professionals, use innovative approaches to improve relationships and decision-making, and provide services in settings that meet students' needs. The counseling services funded under this section must address a range of student needs, provide inservice training for teachers on intervention techniques, involve parents and community groups in program design, evaluate effectiveness annually, and promote a team approach to school counseling. The local educational agency should aim for recommended counselor to student ratios and ensure that counseling staff spend most of their time on counseling activities. Administrative costs are limited to 3% of funds allocated. The term 'school counselor' refers to an individual with documented competence in counseling children and adolescents in a school setting, possessing state licensure, national certification, or a master's degree in school counseling.

The Secretary must report publicly within one year of assistance being available under this section. The Secretary will make public the information on student-to-counselor, student-to-social worker, and student-to-psychologist ratios. $100,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2002, with additional funding for the following 4 years."
