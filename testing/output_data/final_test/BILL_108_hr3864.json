    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Residual Radioactive Contamination Compensation Act\" and includes findings related to the issue. The Residual Radioactive Contamination Compensation Act acknowledges the contamination of private-sector facilities during atomic weapons production. The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act provides benefits for radiation-related illnesses to workers in nuclear weapons factories. The Residual Radioactive Contamination Compensation Act defines private-sector vendor facilities as \"atomic weapons employer facilities\" and employees working in these facilities as \"atomic weapons employees\". Many of these facilities were not properly decontaminated after processing radioactive materials, potentially exposing workers to significant radiation. Congress was unaware of this contamination when enacting the EEOICPA, leading to unintended consequences. In December 2001, the National Defense Authorization Act required a study on atomic weapons employer facilities with residual radioactive contamination. In October 2003, a report was issued on residual radioactive and beryllium contamination. The report on residual radioactive and beryllium contamination in atomic weapons employer facilities found that 44% have significant contamination, 40% have little contamination, and 16% have insufficient information. Congress is now aware of the issue. Congress acknowledges that workers in atomic weapons employer facilities were exposed to residual radioactive contamination without their knowledge or consent, even after production activities had ceased. This exposure occurred years after the Manhattan Project ended, and Congress declares that affected workers should be compensated based on scientific assessments. Significant residual radioactive contamination should be considered for compensation under EEOICPA, on par with atomic weapons employees during active processing periods. SEC. 3. Coverage under Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program for individuals employed at atomic weapons employer facilities during periods of residual contamination. The term 'atomic weapons employee' is defined as an individual who worked at an atomic weapons employer facility during the production of material used in atomic weapons, excluding uranium mining and milling. The report from October 2003 identified significant residual contamination at atomic weapons employer facilities and beryllium vendor facilities, even outside of the production period. SEC. 4. UPDATE TO REPORT. The Director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health must submit updates to Congress on facilities with residual contamination as required by the National Defense Authorization Act. The updates include determining the presence of significant residual contamination and the date it ceased to be present. The Director must report on facilities with residual contamination, including identifying dates of coverage for beryllium or atomic weapons-related activities and any new information available. The Director must report on facilities with residual contamination, including dates of coverage for beryllium or atomic weapons-related activities. The report and updates must be published in the Federal Register within 15 days of release."
