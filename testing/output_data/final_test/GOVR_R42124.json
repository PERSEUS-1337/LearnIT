    "content": "TransCanada Corp. applied for a permit from the U.S. State Department in 2008 to build the Keystone XL pipeline, which would transport oil from Alberta, Canada to Gulf Coast refineries. While states typically decide on pipeline siting, international pipelines require State Department approval through a presidential permit. The proposed Keystone XL pipeline required a presidential permit from the State Department, with significant debate and concerns raised about its environmental impact, particularly in Nebraska. Congress passed the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011, which addressed the Keystone XL presidential permitting process. The Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011 required the President to grant the Keystone XL pipeline permit within 60 days, unless not in the national interest. The State Department recommended denying the permit for the pipeline on January 18, 2012. The State Department press release stated that the 60-day time period provided for in the act was insufficient to determine if the Keystone XL pipeline project was in the national interest. The President determined that the project would not serve the national interest and denied the permit application. TransCanada submitted a new application for a reconfigured pipeline on May 4, 2012. The Keystone XL pipeline proposed new routes through Nebraska, with the governor approving the new route on January 22, 2013. Congress showed legislative interest in the pipeline, introducing various bills for expedited review. One proposal aimed to transfer permitting authority from the State Department to FERC. The 113th Congress has shown continued interest in the Keystone XL pipeline project, with multiple bills introduced to grant a presidential permit for TransCanada. The State Department issued a Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (draft SEIS) as required by NEPA, followed by a 45-day comment period before a decision on the permit is made. The recent legislative activity aims to amend the executive branch procedure for permitting cross-border pipeline facilities, raising constitutional questions. States' actions on pipeline siting and routing have led to debates on federal preemption and the Commerce Clause. Government review under NEPA for the proposed pipeline is also under scrutiny. The report reviews legal issues surrounding the proposed pipeline, including concerns about government review under NEPA, pipeline routing, and emissions from oil production. It suggests that legislation altering the pipeline border crossing approval process is likely constitutional and that state oversight of pipeline siting decisions does not violate federal law. The State Department's authority to issue presidential permits allows for judicial review of NEPA determinations. A companion report on policy issues related to the proposal is also available. The President's authority in foreign affairs allows for regulation of foreign commerce, including border crossing facilities. Judicial recognition exists for the President's authority in matters of foreign commerce, even without explicit delegation from Congress. The executive branch, through the State Department, has permitting authority over facilities like pipelines for the import/export of petroleum products. Executive Order 11423, issued in 1968, granted the U.S. State Department the authority to receive applications for permits for border-crossing facilities. This authority was later amended by Executive Order 13337, which did not significantly change the delegation of authority to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State is empowered to receive applications for permits for various facilities, excluding cross-border permits for specific types of facilities. Executive Order 13337 designates the Secretary of State to receive applications for Presidential permits for the construction, operation, or maintenance of facilities for the importation or exportation of petroleum, coal, or other fuels to or from a foreign country. The Secretary of State is authorized by the President to issue permits for border crossing facilities that serve the national interest. The source of the executive branch's permitting authority is not explicitly stated in the executive orders, but it is based on legislation or inherent presidential powers. Executive Order 11423 does not reference any specific statute or constitutional provision as the source of its authority. The President authorizes the Secretary of State to issue permits for border crossing facilities in the national interest. Executive Order 13337 requires executive permission for construction and maintenance, citing the Constitution and laws of the United States. Federal courts have examined the legitimacy of this permitting authority in cases like Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate v. U.S. Department of State regarding the Keystone Pipeline permit. The U.S. District Court for the District of South Dakota ruled that the crossing permit for the Keystone Pipeline project violated NEPA and the APA. The court stated that the President has the sole authority to allow oil pipeline construction as Congress has not created a federal regulatory scheme for it. In Sierra Club v. Clinton, the President has the sole authority to allow oil pipeline border crossings under his inherent constitutional authority to conduct foreign affairs. The plaintiff challenged the Secretary of State's decision to issue a permit for a pipeline from Alberta, Canada, to Superior, Wisconsin, claiming it was unconstitutional. The U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota agreed that the President's authority over foreign affairs allows him to issue such permits. The court found that the President's authority to issue cross-border permits has been historically recognized and accepted by Congress through inaction. Courts have held that the President's exercise of permitting authority is a legitimate exercise of constitutional authority, not requiring legislative authorization. The Constitution authorizes Congress to regulate foreign commerce, indicating its preeminent authority in this field. The Framers intended for Congress to have the power to regulate foreign commerce at the national level. The Framers intended for Congress to have the power to regulate foreign commerce at the national level, as demonstrated by the requirement for House to enact foreign commerce regulations. Presidents historically deferred to Congress on matters related to border crossing facilities, such as cables and pipelines. President Grant, for example, resisted a transatlantic cable landing from France until Congress legislated on the issue. In the absence of legislation by Congress, President Grant resisted a transatlantic cable landing from France until the monopolistic condition was removed. He proposed legislation to Congress with conditions for public protection from cable telegraph monopolies. President McKinley declined a French company's request to land a supplementary cable under the same terms as the original cable in 1879. President McKinley declined to authorize the landing of a supplementary cable from a French company in 1879, citing the need for legislative enactment. Attorney General opinions dating back to the 19th century suggest that the executive branch's authority in cross-border commercial activity is contingent on congressional action. The Department of Justice has cited Attorney General opinions dating back to 1898, indicating the President's inherent executive authority to issue permits for foreign cables without congressional action. These opinions recognize cross-border cables as instruments of commerce and state that the President can prohibit their landing if deemed prejudicial to US interests. The first opinion from 1898 laid the foundation for future opinions on various types of communication infrastructure. The acting Attorney General, in response to the Secretary of State's query about the President's authority over foreign telegraphic cables without legislative approval, reviewed historical instances of presidential permissions for cable landings. While a 1866 congressional act initially granted a monopoly for cable landing, subsequent cables did not always have legislative terms imposed. Presidents in the late 19th century granted permissions for cable landings, with the understanding that future actions could alter these permissions. In a 1898 opinion, the Attorney General stated that the President's authority over foreign telegraphic cables was not limited to enforcing congressional acts, but stemmed from his duty to preserve the Constitution and protect national interests. The President could impose conditions on cable landings to safeguard the government and its citizens, even without specific legislation. Subsequent Attorney General opinions supported this view. In the 19th century, legislation prohibited the United States from granting any franchises or concessions in Cuba while occupying the island. The Attorney General stated that the executive branch could regulate cables in Cuba, with revocable authority by the President or Congress. The general in charge of U.S. forces in Cuba required approval from the Secretary of War for any grants or concessions. The Attorney General found that congressional will aligned with previous executive branch policies regarding foreign territories. The Attorney General advised against granting permission for a cable to land in Cuba, citing the need to respect previous executive branch policies. A 1913 opinion highlighted the President and Congress's authority to regulate international commercial transactions, specifically regarding the diversion of water from the Niagara River for power purposes. The Attorney General's opinion stated that the President has the authority to supervise the diversion of waters from the Niagara River for power purposes. It also mentioned the President's power to control the importation of electric current from Canada, due to the lapse of a statute. The executive branch's power is subject to Congress's control regarding the importation of electrical power into the United States. The Attorney General concluded that the President could regulate the importation of Canadian electrical power in the absence of legislation by Congress. Executive Order 11423 delegated authority to the Secretary of State for permits on cross-border facilities, while Executive Order 13337 amended this without requiring congressional authorization. Congress's authority to regulate foreign commerce is evident in legislation related to border crossing facilities, including the Submarine Cable Landing Licensing Act of 1921 and the International Bridge Act of 1972. Statutes like the Export Administration Act of 1979 and the Energy Policy and Conservation Act require specific findings by the President. The Supreme Court has recognized the importance of the foreign commerce clause in these matters. The Supreme Court has never struck down an act of Congress as exceeding its powers to regulate foreign commerce. Language in judicial opinions suggests that Congress may amend executive authority to regulate pipeline border crossings. The plaintiff challenged the Secretary of State's 2009 decision to issue a permit for a pipeline from Canada to Wisconsin. The federal district court found that the President has the authority to issue cross-border permits based on foreign affairs and Commander in Chief powers, as Congress has not attempted to exercise exclusive authority over the permitting process. This suggests a recognition that the cross-border permitting process is not solely controlled by Congress. The court recognized that Congress can legislate on cross-border permitting, not just the executive branch. The President has the authority to grant cross-border permits for projects like oil pipelines, as Congress has not created a federal regulatory scheme for them. The court's language suggests that Congress has the constitutional authority to legislate border crossing facilities, indicating that Congress can also amend the executive branch's role in this area. All branches of the federal government historically support Congress's authority to regulate foreign commerce. The absence of previous legislation on cross-border permitting does not mean Congress lacks the constitutional authority to act on these matters. The executive branch has the authority to act on border crossing permitting, derived from its power to conduct foreign affairs under Article II of the Constitution. However, the absence of federal legislation in this area may have allowed for independent presidential action. Congress could assert its authority by regulating foreign commerce and overturning legal actions denying permits for border crossing facilities like the Keystone XL pipeline. The federal government has the authority to deny permits for border crossing facilities like the Keystone XL pipeline. State and local officials have raised concerns about the pipeline's route, leading Nebraska to pass laws giving the state a role in siting major oil pipelines and collaborating with the State Department on environmental statements. Debate in Nebraska over legislation for the proposed Keystone XL pipeline raised constitutional concerns regarding state regulation of interstate oil pipelines. Some worry about potential violations of the dormant Commerce Clause and federal preemption of state regulations on pipeline safety. Congress holds the power to regulate commerce among states and with foreign nations, serving as the constitutional basis for federal laws over the past 50 years. The federal power to regulate interstate commerce has been a key aspect of congressional authority for the past 50 years. The courts have established that this power limits state interference with trade, even in the absence of congressional regulation, through the doctrine of the dormant Commerce Clause. This clause serves as a restriction on state legislation in the realm of interstate commerce. The dormant Commerce Clause is a provision in the Constitution that limits state interference with trade. It involves two inquiries: whether a state regulation discriminates against other states, and if a law impacts interstate commerce, a balancing test is used to determine if there is a legitimate public purpose. Land use regulation, like zoning, is typically seen as primarily a state matter. States have traditionally had primary authority over land use regulation, including the siting of energy facilities and transmission lines. Federal legislation recognizes the state's role in making siting decisions for various tools of interstate commerce. Federal legislation acknowledges the state's authority in making siting decisions for interstate natural gas pipelines, with FERC having a role under the Natural Gas Act. State and local laws, including zoning ordinances, still apply unless preempted by federal law. State regulatory actions play a significant role in siting energy facilities and rights-of-way, with a need for a detailed record for Commerce Clause analysis. In reviewing a dormant Commerce Clause challenge to state action related to the pipeline, a court would consider whether the regulation or siting decision was discriminatory. If the regulatory scheme provides a uniform standard for energy transmission siting decisions, it is unlikely to be found unconstitutional. Discrimination would require showing that the legislation intended to benefit in-state interests over out-of-state interests. Protectionist laws favoring in-state companies in right-of-way acquisition could violate this requirement. The law must apply equally to in-state and out-of-state pipeline companies to avoid being discriminatory. If a law is not discriminatory, a court would assess if it excessively burdens interstate commerce through a Pike analysis. States are generally given deference to set environmental standards, but heightened scrutiny may apply to state actions regarding the Keystone XL pipeline. The Supreme Court applies heightened scrutiny to state actions concerning the Keystone XL pipeline, focusing on how it impacts foreign commerce. State regulations on the pipeline are unlikely to be seen as directly regulating foreign trade but rather as governing domestic transit of imported goods. Local benefits of an oil pipeline siting statute would be considered in court. The court would evaluate the local benefits of an oil pipeline siting statute, considering safety, economic, environmental, and aesthetic concerns. The level of burden on interstate commerce imposed by the state regulatory activity would also be assessed. It is unlikely that such a statute would create an undue burden on interstate commerce. State statutes often require state permission for construction and operation, with conformity to regulatory requirements. Challenges to these laws are rare. A state action regarding oil pipeline siting could burden commerce. For instance, if a regulatory agency refuses to permit a pipeline regardless of location, it may be seen as an undue burden on interstate commerce. However, this may not always violate the dormant Commerce Clause, as courts may consider alternative routes or burdens on other states. The re-routing of the Keystone XL pipeline through states may impose administrative burdens, delays, and increased costs. State requirements could add to the project's overall viability and expense, potentially affecting oil pipeline siting statutes. Establishing the economic impact of a delay in the Keystone XL pipeline project would depend on factors like changes in siting, costs already incurred, potential financial commitments, and increased expenses. The project's economic viability could be threatened by delays, and considerations would include how changed regulations might affect commerce. The Keystone XL Pipeline project's economic impact could be affected by delays due to changed regulations. The state's action may not significantly add to regulatory burdens if already considered in the planning process. Court rulings may support delays for legitimate state interests in public health and safety. Understanding federal pipeline safety legislation is crucial before considering preemption of state statutes. The Pipeline Safety Act, a collection of federal legislation codified at 49 U.S.C. Chapters 601-605, has been amended multiple times since 1979 to include liquid fuels. Concerns have been raised about potential preemption of state actions related to oil pipelines by this federal law under the Supremacy Clause. The Supremacy Clause dictates that federal law preempts state law if there is interference or conflict. Preemption can occur through express congressional action, conflict between federal and state laws, or when federal regulation is comprehensive enough to exclude state regulation. The preemption argument in the case of Keystone XL is based on Congress 'leaving no room' for supplementary state regulation regarding pipeline siting. The Pipeline Safety Act allows states to adopt additional safety standards for intrastate pipelines but not for interstate pipelines. Express preemption is a concern due to potential conflict with federal pipeline safety statutes. The Pipeline Safety Act's express preemption clause limits state action on safety standards for interstate pipelines, with guidance from statutory provisions, plain language, industry usage, federal agency authority, and court interpretations. Federal preemption is stated but with limitations on federal authority. The Pipeline Safety Act limits state action on safety standards for interstate pipelines, with a restriction on federal authority to prescribe pipeline facility location or routing. State actions affecting interstate pipelines must avoid crossing the line from legitimate location/routing decisions to preempted safety standards. The Pipeline Safety Act's preemption provision prohibits states from adopting safety standards for interstate pipeline facilities and transportation. The plain meaning of safety standards is explicit rules regarding safety levels. It is important for states to be aware of this prohibition to avoid being preempted in any legal challenges. The Pipeline Safety Act's preemption provision prohibits states from adopting safety standards for interstate pipeline facilities and transportation. The interpretation of \"safety standards\" is crucial, as it may extend to state actions related to pipeline siting for public safety. The industry's perception of pipeline safety concepts, such as those outlined by the American Petroleum Institute, can provide insight into what is considered part of pipeline safety standards. The American Petroleum Institute (API) publishes standards for pipeline operations, focusing on managing system integrity and safety and fire prevention. These standards prioritize avoiding leaks, preparedness, early warning systems, and integrity testing. They do not address planning or routing concerns. The industry's perception of safety standards for interstate pipelines is crucial, as it may impact state actions related to pipeline siting for public safety. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) is responsible for implementing safety standards for interstate pipeline facilities and transportation. Their regulations, found at 49 C.F.R. Parts 190-195, provide insight into PHMSA's authority under the Pipeline Safety Act. These regulations address various substantive matters related to the physical properties of pipelines. The PHMSA regulations establish safety standards for interstate pipelines, considering different hazards in various locations. State interference with federal jurisdiction could be preempted by statute. The regulations aim to set different requirements based on geographical distinctions, not to dictate pipeline siting policies. The PHMSA's authority over safety standards for interstate pipelines includes aspects like pipeline makeup, monitoring, personnel qualifications, and emergency response. State actions may avoid preemption if they do not impact these areas. Federal court cases help define federal authority in setting safety standards for interstate pipelines and limit states from doing so. In Texas Midstream Gas Services v. City of Grand Prairie, a natural gas pipeline operator challenged a city ordinance requiring special permits for building compressor stations, setback, security, aesthetic, and noise level requirements. The operator had announced plans before the ordinance was enacted. The pipeline operator challenged a city ordinance requiring special permits for building compressor stations, setback, security, aesthetic, and noise level requirements. The federal court upheld the ordinance, except for the security fence requirement, stating that the setback requirement is not a safety standard. The setback requirement in Section 10 aims to prevent unsightly compressor stations from affecting neighborhood aesthetics. Grand Prairie adopted this rule to maintain visual cohesion and property values. The court ruled that the ordinance did not directly impact safety standards and rejected the argument that it was preempted by the Pipeline Safety Act. The court clarified that the Pipeline Safety Act only preempts safety standards and that state or local actions related to pipeline facilities can be preempted if they do not primarily focus on safety standards. This decision is in line with previous court rulings, such as Kinley v. Iowa Utilities Board, which illustrate actions that would be preempted by the Act. In Kinley, the owner/operator of an interstate petroleum product pipeline challenged an Iowa state statute, known as \"Chapter 479,\" which required permits for facilities transporting substances to protect public safety. The state's jurisdiction over interstate pipelines was contested as preempted by the Pipeline Safety Act. The state acknowledged some aspects of Chapter 479 were preempted by the Act but argued for jurisdiction. The court found that certain provisions of Chapter 479, including hearing, permit, and inspection requirements, as well as financial responsibility rules, were preempted by the Pipeline Safety Act. These provisions aimed to protect farmland and topsoil from pipeline-related damage and ensure payment for property and environmental harm. The court ruled that these provisions were so closely linked to federal safety regulations that they were also preempted, affirming the lower court's decision to disallow Chapter 479's application to the interstate pipeline. The court found that certain provisions of Chapter 479, including hearing, permit, and inspection requirements, as well as financial responsibility rules, were preempted by the Pipeline Safety Act. These provisions aimed to protect farmland and topsoil from pipeline-related damage and ensure payment for property and environmental harm. The court disallowed the application of Chapter 479 to the interstate pipeline, citing the example of Kinley as instructive for states seeking to regulate interstate pipelines. The court noted that the \"environmental and damage remedies\" provisions were preempted not by their content but because they could not be severed from other aspects of Chapter 479. The lack of successful preemption challenge does not conclusively demonstrate that state statutes would survive, but they can provide guidance in avoiding preemption. State actions may be preempted by conflict preemption if not expressly preempted. Arguments suggest that state action on siting the Keystone XL pipeline could conflict with federal law and be unconstitutional. It is unclear how a state statute on facility location would conflict with the president's authority to permit cross-border pipelines. The State Department's permitting authority for the Keystone XL project only extends to the portion crossing the U.S.-Canada border. State permitting requirements may not obstruct Congress' objectives, as seen in other international pipeline projects. Executive Order 13337 aims to expedite reviews, but it is unclear how state siting requirements could conflict with federal permitting authority. The purpose of Executive Order 13337 is to expedite reviews of permits for energy projects and border crossings for land transportation, while ensuring safety and environmental protections. This order aims to accelerate the completion of energy production and transmission projects, potentially conflicting with state legislation that may impede these projects. The Executive Order 13337 aims to expedite the processing of presidential permit applications for energy projects and land transportation border crossings. It is unlikely that state action impacting oil pipeline siting would be considered an obstacle to the objectives of the federal government under this order. Conflict preemption may arise if state action conflicts with the Pipeline Safety Act, but without knowing the nature of the state's action, it is difficult to draw a conclusion on operational conflicts. The Pipeline Safety Act aims to provide protection against risks posed by pipeline transportation and facilities. State actions may not be invalidated by conflict preemption unless they interfere with federal objectives. Field preemption may occur if Congress intends to remove a state's regulatory authority over a subject. The Supreme Court has ruled that when Congress explicitly addresses preemption in legislation, there is no need to infer intent from the substantive provisions. The State Department reviews environmental impacts for national interest determinations, but the legal necessity of this review under NEPA for projects under Executive Order 13337 is uncertain. Compliance with NEPA could be required. Compliance with NEPA for projects under Executive Order 13337 is uncertain. The order delegates the President's authority to the State Department for permits on energy projects crossing borders. While the order mentions seeking views from agency heads, it does not explicitly require consideration of environmental impacts, only that the permit be in the national interest. Executive Order 13337 is a modification of a previous order and does not reference a NEPA review. The Keystone XL project underwent multiple environmental reviews under NEPA starting in 2009, leading to the preparation of an EIS to address potential impacts. A draft EIS was issued in 2010, followed by a supplemental draft EIS in 2011, and a final EIS in 2011. After a decision to reroute the pipeline in Nebraska, a draft SEIS was issued in 2013. In March 2013, a draft SEIS was issued to reroute the Nebraska portion of the Keystone XL pipeline. The State Department prepares environmental reviews for projects like international pipelines under its regulations. It evaluates environmental impacts under NEPA before making a national interest determination for a permit. Previous assessments were done for oil pipelines from Canada to the U.S. Only trial-level courts have reviewed State Department's environmental reviews for projects seeking permits under Executive Order 13337. The U.S. District Courts have split decisions on judicial review of Executive Order 13337 actions. The State Department NEPA review for permits under the order is considered a final agency action subject to court review. Sovereign immunity must be waived to sue the federal government, typically through the Administrative Procedure Act. EISs are consistently deemed final agency actions reviewable under the APA. The U.S. District Courts have conflicting views on judicial review of Executive Order 13337 actions. State Department's NEPA review for permits is seen as a final agency action subject to court scrutiny. EISs are generally considered final agency actions reviewable under the APA, but there is disagreement on whether an EIS would be an agency action in this case. The U.S. District Courts have conflicting views on judicial review of Executive Order 13337 actions. The D.C. district court stated that any activity by the State Department under the Executive Order is a presidential action, not an agency action. However, the District of Minnesota court disagreed, finding that the State Department's EIS for a cross-border pipeline permit was reviewable. The court emphasized that the State Department must analyze the environmental impacts of the entire pipeline route, despite the international border crossing permit being a presidential action. The Minnesota district court allows judicial review of the EIS for a cross-border pipeline permit, separate from the issuance of the permit itself. The State Department's preparation of the FEIS is not considered a presidential action, and failure to complete a NEPA review could lead to liability under the APA. The Executive Order does not mandate an environmental review, but a State Department regulation requires an EA consistent with NEPA. The NEPA review is seen as a congressional delegation of authority rather than a presidential one. The national interest determination is separate from the NEPA review, considering economic, energy security, and foreign policy factors. The D.C. district court concluded that issuing a permit under Executive Order 13337 is judicially untouchable, citing Supreme Court precedent. The Court held that presidential actions authorized by statute are insulated from judicial review, as the President has ultimate discretion regardless of the content of agency reports. The President's decision-making authority under Executive Order 13337 is emphasized, with the court ruling that the President's actions are not subject to judicial review, even when based on agency reports. Distinctions are drawn between Supreme Court cases and EIS requirements, highlighting the discretionary nature of environmental reviews under the Executive Order. The agencies act to review agency actions to the fullest extent possible. If a Secretary's \"view\" under Executive Order 13337 is not in the national interest but the State Department issues the permit, it may not be reviewable. However, errors in the EIS can be challenged as \"arbitrary and capricious\" under the APA, making it a final agency action reviewable under legal precedent. The completed EIS is considered a final agency action reviewable under legal precedent, unlike reports in Franklin and Dalton which were not final actions. The EIS is promulgated to the public, has an administrative record, and failure to comply with NEPA can result in injury. The State Department prepared a supplemental EIS to address EPA's concerns with the draft EIS, indicating a difference from previous cases. The D.C. court's ruling on the Keystone XL permit did not recognize the distinction between the permit and the EIS as separate final actions. Minnesota found that the EIS was a final agency action subject to judicial review."
