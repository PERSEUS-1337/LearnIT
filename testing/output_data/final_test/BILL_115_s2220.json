    "content": "The Act titled \"National Timing Resilience and Security Act of 2017\" includes a provision for a backup Global Positioning System. The National Timing Resilience and Security Act of 2017 mandates the establishment of a land-based alternative timing system to reduce dependencies on GPS and ensure reliable timing signals for military and civilian users in case of GPS signal issues. The Act requires the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, to establish requirements for a wireless, terrestrial system with wide-area coverage and a precise 100 kilohertz signal as a backup to GPS timing. The Act requires a wireless, terrestrial system with wide-area coverage and a precise 100 kilohertz signal as a backup to GPS timing. The system must be synchronized with coordinated universal time, resilient, able to penetrate underground and inside buildings, deployable to remote locations, utilize the existing LORAN infrastructure, incorporate private sector expertise, and work in conjunction with other positioning, navigation, and timing systems. Nationwide Differential GPS systems will be provided by the Secretary of Transportation for use by various government agencies and public purposes at no cost. These systems must be adaptable, incorporate recommendations from GPS backup demonstration programs, and include elements deemed appropriate by the Secretary. An implementation plan must be developed within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Transportation will submit a report to Congress outlining a plan to develop a backup positioning and navigation system to complement GPS. The system must be operational within two years of the Act's enactment. The system required by subsection (a) must be operational for at least 20 years. The Coast Guard may transfer LORAN infrastructure to the Department of Transportation for this purpose, without affecting environmental regulations. The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, may enter into a cooperative agreement with an entity to sell timing and other services to third parties, subject to national security requirements. The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, may enter into a cooperative agreement with an entity to develop, construct, and operate a backup timing system at private expense. The entity is allowed to invest in necessary technologies for advanced timing resilience and share revenue with the Secretary from the sale of timing services to third parties. The entity must invest in technologies for advanced timing resilience and assume financial risk for the system's completion and operation. They also need to provide performance and payment bonds as determined by the Secretary and make necessary investments in technologies over the agreement's life to meet future requirements. The Secretary will use competitive procedures to select an entity for a cooperative agreement to provide timing system services for the Department of Transportation and other agencies. Services costs may be offset through revenue sharing, and the Secretary cannot enter into an agreement until the system is operational. The Secretary must determine if a cooperative agreement is financially beneficial for the Federal Government before entering into it. The term \"entity\" refers to a non-Federal entity with the necessary expertise and resources to meet the Secretary's requirements. The Secretary must inform specific committees of this determination within 30 days."
