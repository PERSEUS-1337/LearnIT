The National Dam Safety Program Act defines a \"deficient dam\" as a dam that fails to meet minimum safety standards and poses an unacceptable risk to the public. The National Dam Safety Program Act defines \"rehabilitation\" as the repair, replacement, reconstruction, or removal of a dam to meet State dam safety standards. Additionally, the Act includes a program for the rehabilitation and repair of deficient dams. SEC. 8A. Rehabilitation and repair of deficient dams. The Director will establish a program within FEMA to provide grant assistance to States for rehabilitating publicly-owned deficient dams. States can apply for grants by submitting applications as per regulations set by the Director. Grants may be awarded for dam rehabilitation projects that meet the specified criteria. The Director will enter into a project grant agreement with the State to establish terms, including the grant amount. States applying for grants must comply with specified standards. The Director will develop a risk-based priority system for identifying deficient dams eligible for grants. The total amount of funds appropriated for grants under this section will be allocated to States based on the number of deficient dams identified as a danger to human health within each State. The Federal share of the cost of rehabilitating deficient dams under this section is limited to 65%. Authorization of appropriations includes $10,000,000 for 2008, $15,000,000 for 2009, $25,000,000 for 2010, $50,000,000 for 2011, and $100,000,000 for 2012.
