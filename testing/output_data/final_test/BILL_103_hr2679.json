The Act \"Childhood Immunizations Improvement Act of 1993\" allows the Secretary to grant states funds for demonstration projects providing free immunizations to children against vaccine-preventable diseases. Immunizations must be given at facilities where individuals receive assistance under approved State plans or Federal programs. The Secretary may grant funds to states for immunization programs if the state identifies and administers the programs, submits a plan for incentives to ensure children are immunized, authorizes the incentives in the plan, and receives approval from the Secretary. The Secretary establishes a list of recommended vaccines for children and a schedule for their administration. The Secretary may authorize grantees to provide immunizations to children of individuals not receiving assistance under specified programs. Grants under subsection (a) require a formal application with necessary agreements and information. $2,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 1994 to 1997 for this purpose. The Social Security Act is amended to allow states to adjust aid for parents as an incentive for immunizations for children under demonstration projects. Additionally, the Food Stamp Act of 1977 is authorized for demonstration programs. The Food Stamp Act of 1977 is amended to reduce allotments for households with children under 2 years old who fail to demonstrate immunization compliance under a demonstration project.
