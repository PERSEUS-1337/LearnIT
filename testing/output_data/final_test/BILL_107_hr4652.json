The Commission will create rules to prevent deceptive practices in the advertising of online games of chance and skill on communication networks. This includes prohibiting false claims about game fairness and type (skill or chance). The Commission will establish rules to prevent deceptive practices in online game advertising, including prohibiting operators from displaying unfair seals or insignias. Rules will also address evasions that undermine customer rights.

Rules will also address evasions that undermine customer rights. SEC. 4. ROLE OF SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS. For section 3(a)(2) compliance, a self-regulatory organization must be registered with the Commission and meet specific requirements outlined by the Commission. The organization must demonstrate its capacity to carry out the Act's purposes and enforce compliance among its members. The self-regulatory organization's rules aim to ensure compliance with the Act, prevent fraudulent acts, protect consumers, and discipline members for violations. The self-regulatory organization's rules provide a fair procedure for disciplining members, and the Commission has not revoked or suspended its determination regarding the organization. SEC. 5. ACTIONS BY STATES. Whenever an attorney general of a State believes that residents are affected by a violation of a Commission rule, the State can file a civil action in a US district court to stop the violation, enforce compliance, seek damages, or obtain other relief. The State must notify the Commission before taking action, unless prior notice is not feasible. Upon receiving notice of a civil action, the Commission can intervene, be heard on all matters, and file petitions for appeal. Civil actions can be brought in a district court where the defendant is found, transacts business, or where the violation occurred. The attorney general has investigatory powers for bringing civil actions under this section. The attorney general has powers to conduct investigations and administer oaths. State court proceedings can continue based on alleged violations of civil or criminal antifraud statutes. During a civil action by the Commission, no State can initiate a separate civil action against the same defendant for the same violation. Other State officials can take actions as well. State officials authorized by the Commission can bring actions in State court for consumer protection against violators of Commission rules. Other State officials can also take actions in addition to those by the attorney general. SEC. 6. ADMINISTRATION AND APPLICABILITY. The Act will be enforced by the Commission under the Federal Trade Commission Act, with rules to be prescribed within 270 days. Violations of these rules will be treated as violations of unfair or deceptive acts under the FTC Act. Communications common carriers are subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission for enforcement under the Act. The Commission will prevent violations of its rules with the same authority as the Federal Trade Commission Act, including penalties and privileges. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"Commission\" as the Federal Trade Commission, \"network game operator\" as a business providing game playing services, and \"communications network\" as a system used for information exchange. The Act defines key terms related to gaming services and communication networks. A game of skill is defined as one with minimal chance elements affecting the outcome beyond players' control."
