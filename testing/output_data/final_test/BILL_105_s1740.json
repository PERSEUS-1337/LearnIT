    "content": "The \"Telephone Slamming Prevention Act of 1998\" is aimed at improving protections against unauthorized changes of providers of telephone service. The \"Telephone Slamming Prevention Act of 1998\" prohibits telecommunications carriers from changing a subscriber's telephone service provider without following prescribed verification procedures by the Commission. Negative option letters are not allowed for verification, and the verification of a subscriber's selection must be retained in a specific manner. The \"Telephone Slamming Prevention Act of 1998\" prohibits carriers from changing a subscriber's provider without proper verification. Liability for charges is amended to include a subscriber payment option. The \"Telephone Slamming Prevention Act of 1998\" allows subscribers to pay the previously selected carrier for services received after an unauthorized change, at the rate charged by the original carrier. Civil penalties may apply if the Commission determines a violation. The \"Telephone Slamming Prevention Act of 1998\" imposes civil penalties on telecommunications carriers for unauthorized changes in service providers, with fines starting at $50,000 for the first offense and increasing to $100,000 for subsequent offenses. The Commission may also penalize carriers for unauthorized changes made by their agents or resellers. Criminal penalties apply to individuals involved in such activities. Criminal penalties for willful violation of telephone service provider change procedures include fines and imprisonment up to 1 year for first offense, and up to 5 years for subsequent offenses. Convicted individuals may also be disqualified from certain activities covered by section 214. The FCC may disqualify companies controlled by individuals convicted under subsection (d) from certain activities covered by section 214, but reinstatement can be considered after 5 years if deemed in the public interest. The State attorney general or designated official can take legal action against individuals or companies engaging in unauthorized changes in telephone service providers, seeking injunctions, damages, or both. Courts may increase damages up to three times if violations are willful and knowing. The State attorney general can pursue legal action against those making unauthorized changes in telephone service providers, seeking injunctions or damages. Telecommunications carriers must report complaints of unauthorized provider changes to the Commission, which can use this information for enforcement. The Federal Communications Commission can identify carriers engaging in unauthorized provider changes and may treat existing regulations as consistent with amended requirements. Additionally, the Commission must report enforcement actions against carriers for slamming violations by October 31, 1998. The Federal Communications Commission must report on enforcement actions against carriers for violations of procedures under the Communications Act of 1934. The report should include the number of complaints against carriers with over 100 complaints in 1997 and describe the penalties assessed for violations. The Federal Communications Commission will review the adequacy of licensing requirements and procedures under the Communications Act of 1934 to ensure carriers are suitable for licensing and to prevent licenses from being issued to those with previous violations."
