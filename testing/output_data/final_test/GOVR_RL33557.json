    "content": "The 1990s saw the U.S. military involved in missions to reconstruct governments, infrastructure, and economies after quelling conflicts. This followed earlier efforts in Germany, Japan, Italy, and Austria post-World War II, as well as in the Philippines, Central America, and the Caribbean in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These \"peacekeeping\" missions require limitations on the use of force and involve personnel in security and political/economic activities to build or rebuild state institutions. In the post-Cold War era of the 1990s, the U.S. military engaged in peacekeeping and limited force operations in various multinational missions, including Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo under U.N. or NATO auspices. This shift towards peacekeeping activities required a different approach from the traditional use of overwhelming force to quickly defeat enemies. In the post-Cold War era of the 1990s, the U.S. military engaged in peacekeeping missions in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo under U.N. or NATO auspices. U.S. military involvement in state-building missions began with the U.S.-led operation in Somalia, known as UNITAF, which included troops from other countries and focused on humanitarian aid and community development projects. The U.S.-led operation in Somalia, known as UNITAF, focused on humanitarian aid, community development projects, and the creation of local councils and Somali police units. The operation was turned over to the U.N. UNOSOM II force in May 1993, which aimed to build new political and administrative institutions with the help of some 3,000 U.S. soldiers primarily providing logistics support. The U.S. soldiers served in the U.N. mission in Somalia, providing logistics support. The failure of the Somalia operations led to chaos, with U.S. troops assisting in the U.N. withdrawal in March 1995. U.S. troops were also deployed to Haiti in September 1994 to restore deposed President Jean Bertrand Aristide to power. The multinational force in Haiti, largely comprised of U.S. soldiers, eventually turned the operation over to a U.N. mission. The MNF handed over operations to UNMIH in March 1994 after totaling 21,000 troops at peak strength. U.S. troops assisted in rebuilding Haiti's rule of law institutions and disarming soldiers. Around 2,400 U.S. soldiers were initially part of the 6,000-man UNMIH force. U.S. military involvement in Somalia and Haiti led to skepticism about peacekeeping and nation-building efforts. In the mid-1990s, the United States had limited involvement in the Balkans, contributing troops to the UN Protection Force in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. The US played a leading role in NATO air operations supporting UNPROFOR and enforcing no-fly zones. Additionally, the US led NATO ground forces to enforce the Dayton Peace Accords in Bosnia in 1995. The Dayton Peace Accords in Bosnia in 1995 led to the deployment of the Implementation Force (IFOR) and later the Stabilization Force (SFOR) with U.S. troops. Responsibilities included disarmament, demobilization, security for elections, police force establishment, and overall coordination by the High Representative for the Implementation of the Peace Agreement. The Dayton Peace Accords in Bosnia led to the deployment of foreign military troops for nation-building projects. U.S. troops did not participate due to safety concerns and political opposition. The U.S. led NATO missions in Kosovo, but the UN oversaw most governmental tasks. There was debate on the role of U.S. troops in peacekeeping operations post-Cold War. The \"new world order\" was hoped to spread freedom and democracy, but instead, intrastate conflicts increased as weakened autocrats faced challengers. Many argued for international military response, with U.S. involvement, to prevent instability and conflict and support struggles for freedom. Others believed instability in other countries did not threaten U.S. vital interests. The terrorist acts of September 11, 2001, changed the debate on the use of U.S. force, highlighting the dangers of allowing instability to fester. Policymakers now recognize the need to enhance military capacity to deal with conflicts and prevent international terrorists from finding safe haven in weak states. Operations for peace in unstable environments are now referred to as \"stabilization and reconstruction\" or \"stability\" operations to capture their complexity and avoid the stigma of failure. These operations can involve nation-building and are not without risk, often placing soldiers in hostile situations resembling war. The term \"peacekeeping\" evolved in the late 1950s to include nation-building components. In 1992, the U.N. introduced \"peace enforcement\" for operations in unstable situations where force may be necessary. \"Peacebuilding\" refers to activities aimed at preventing conflict resumption or spread. Peacekeeping operations involve various measures to prevent conflict, such as disarmament, demobilization, repatriation of refugees, and strengthening government institutions. Security for humanitarian relief efforts is also part of these operations. The term \"peacekeeping\" has been replaced by \"peace operations\" and more recently by \"stability operations\" to encompass a wider range of missions, including those in Afghanistan and Iraq. Stability operations, also known as \"Phase IV\" or \"post-conflict\" operations, encompass a variety of missions including peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance, counterterrorism, and nation-building efforts. The question of continued U.S. military involvement in Iraq has raised discussions on the role of nation-building and how to prepare for it. Nation-building is not just a term, but a concept and activities aimed at creating a democratic state, often in post-conflict situations. It involves a range of activities by militaries or civilians to advance this goal, including repairing economic infrastructure. The activities involved in nation-building include repairing economic infrastructure, providing services like medical care and training to various groups, and rebuilding indigenous institutions to stabilize a situation. The U.S. military participates in peacekeeping operations endorsed by the U.N., with minimal personnel serving under U.N. command. As of December 31, 2006, 26 U.S. military personnel were involved in various U.N. peacekeeping operations in the Middle East, Georgia, Ethiopia/Eritrea, Liberia, and Haiti. The U.S. military has personnel involved in peacekeeping operations in various countries such as the Middle East, Georgia, Ethiopia/Eritrea, Liberia, and Haiti. Additionally, U.S. forces are deployed in unilateral and coalition operations with U.N. authority, including in the Balkans and Kosovo. There are also thousands of U.S. troops abroad in stability operations not classified as peacekeeping. Approximately 10,400 U.S. military personnel are assigned to the NATO International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan, while around 29,500 U.S. troops are serving in South Korea under bilateral agreements and U.N. authority. President Bush has maintained troops in peacekeeping missions despite his initial aversion to nation-building missions involving ground forces. He achieved reductions in Bosnia and Kosovo and has resisted calls for additional peacekeeping tasks. The Bush Administration reduced U.S. troops in peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and Kosovo through negotiations with allies, following NATO procedures. U.S. participation in Bosnia ended in 2004 when the EU took over, with a small number of troops remaining to support NATO Headquarters in Bosnia. In Kosovo, the U.S. presence also decreased, with around 5,600 troops involved in NATO operations. The U.S. presence in Kosovo and Afghanistan decreased as part of overall force reductions. In Kosovo, U.S. troops dropped from 5,600 to 1,700 in the NATO Kosovo Force. In Afghanistan, U.S. troops totaled around 21,000 in December 2006, with 10,400 assigned to ISAF and the rest to Operation Enduring Freedom. ISAF, comprising 30,000 troops from 37 nations, including the U.S., took over security responsibility in Afghanistan in October 2006. Initially, ISAF had 5,000 troops under British command in 2002 to patrol Kabul. NATO assumed command in 2003, expanding the mandate to other areas. U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan, ranging from 10,000 to 23,000, were mainly involved in combat operations against Al Qaeda. The U.S. troops in Afghanistan were mainly involved in combat operations against Al Qaeda, while also providing support, training, and reconstruction missions. They assisted the ISAF with logistical, intelligence, and quick reaction force support, as well as training and assistance for the formation of an Afghani national military force. The establishment and operation of Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) since December 2002 aimed to create a secure environment for aid agencies involved in reconstruction work outside Kabul. The U.S. operated 13 PRTs as of April 2006, with ISAF involvement starting in 2004. The U.S. military expanded its operations in Afghanistan by taking over the German-led PRT in Konduz in 2006. The PRTs aim to enhance security, extend government reach, and facilitate reconstruction, similar to peacekeeping operations. Some view them as \"nation-building.\" The U.S. occasionally provides airlift assistance for peacekeeping missions in Africa, such as airlifting African Union troops to Darfur. The United States military is involved in various activities in Iraq, including counterinsurgency operations and peacekeeping duties. Some commanders have noted that troops are engaged in a mix of both types of operations. The U.S. is also establishing military-civilian Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Iraq, similar to those in Afghanistan. The debate over the appropriate role for the U.S. military in peacekeeping activities has resurfaced in light of the military occupation of Iraq, which is characterized by instability and low-intensity conflict. The U.S. military's activities in Iraq include peacekeeping duties amidst low-intensity conflict. Critics argue that the Bush Administration's disregard for peacekeeping has jeopardized the peace in Iraq. The Defense Science Board studies prompted a new policy on stability operations, including peacekeeping, outlined in DOD Directive 3000.05. The DOD recognizes stability operations as a core military mission, alongside combat missions. Efforts are needed to develop doctrine, training, and capabilities for stabilization and reconstruction missions. Recommendations are called for to enhance DOD capabilities in these areas. The DOD has recognized stability operations as a core military mission and is working on developing capabilities for stabilization and reconstruction missions. Recent documents do not mention further steps to enhance DOD capabilities for post-conflict operations, with proposals being considered under \"irregular warfare.\" The March 2006 National Security Strategy mentions developing civilian and international military capabilities for post-conflict operations but does not address augmenting U.S. military capabilities. The Army has adjusted to improve peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Kosovo, but challenges in Iraq highlight the need for further enhancements. Directive 3000.05 calls for significant changes and resources to prepare troops for successful transitions, with specific proposals being developed by the DOD. Implementation steps are still uncertain, and Congress may be involved in the process. The DOD is uncertain about implementing Directive 3000.05 and may request changes in laws, authorities, and funding from Congress in 2006 and 2007. The House Armed Services Committee supports integrating SSTR-related requirements across DOD's operations and has directed the Secretary of Defense to submit an implementation report focusing on professional military education and training. The Directive calls for revisions to military education, training plans, and possible creation of SSTR fellowships. It tasks the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness with identifying personnel and training needs for stability operations. It emphasizes the incorporation of stability operations instruction at all levels of education and training. The Directive does not provide specific recommendations on the size and structure of forces needed for stability operations. Since the 1990s, there has been a debate on whether U.S. military forces should be tailored for peacekeeping and stability operations without compromising their war-fighting readiness. Factors like force size, troop allocation, deployment length, and training opportunities play a crucial role. The 2005 stability operations directive suggests potential increases in specialized personnel like civil affairs officers and foreign area specialists. The Army has long rejected proposals for dedicated peacekeeping forces, primarily due to concerns about diverting resources from combat functions. Recommendations for force size and structure for stability operations are likely to spark intense debate, as proposals to add troops are controversial due to high costs and potential trade-offs with other priorities. The Army's troop size is a topic of debate, with suggestions for 520,000 to 540,000 troops for two major theater wars and peacekeeping missions. The need for additional forces depends on developed capabilities for such operations, including civilians and foreign military forces. The directive calls for incorporating stability operations curricula in military schools and training centers. The directive calls for incorporating stability operations curricula in military education and training programs at all levels, including foreign language capabilities and regional area expertise. It also suggests broadening exposure to U.S. and international civilians through tours of duty in various organizations. Nation-building tasks in post-conflict environments are seen as a military responsibility, but assigning specific responsibilities for state-building tasks remains a challenge. Some policymakers and military officials question the efficiency of using military force for nation-building. Some policymakers and analysts argue for military involvement in nation-building tasks post-conflict to stabilize situations, enhance weak central governments' legitimacy, and reassure local populations. This involvement can also help armed forces assess security situations and is considered essential in the U.S. toolkit post-9/11. Some argue for military involvement in nation-building post-conflict to stabilize situations, enhance weak central governments' legitimacy, and reassure local populations. However, critics believe using troops for such tasks can be detrimental to humanitarian and reconstruction efforts, as it may confuse civilian roles and make them targets of armed opponents. Many humanitarian groups object to military involvement in nation-building, as it confuses civilian roles and makes them targets. Despite proposals for civilian capabilities in peacekeeping operations, no legislation was passed in the 108th Congress. The State Department established the Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS) in July 2004 to enhance civilian capabilities and improve inter-agency coordination in planning and conducting operations. Defense analysts and military experts support developing civilian capabilities. The DSB's summer 2004 study and the follow-up September 2005 study emphasized the importance of developing civilian capabilities for search and rescue missions. They highlighted the need for closer collaboration between the Department of Defense and the Department of State, as well as the State Department's need to enhance its operational planning and execution capacities. The DSB expressed concern that the State Department's Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization was not receiving sufficient resources and authority for its responsibilities. The DOD emphasized the need for increased resources for civilian capabilities in stability operations. The Senate Armed Services Committee commended DOD's support for S/CRS and urged deeper coordination with the Department of State. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2006 provided authority to transfer funds for defense operations. The FY2006 and FY2007 defense authorization acts allowed for the transfer of up to $100 million for reconstruction and stabilization assistance. The FY2007 DOD authorization bill required a report on enhancing interagency cooperation for national security goals. The report aims to enhance interagency cooperation and coordination in SSTR operations to achieve US national security goals. It includes recommendations for legislative proposals, establishing interagency operating procedures, and improving cooperation in multinational operations through military and civilian integration. The directive proposes enhancing interagency cooperation in stability operations by including personnel from various backgrounds in military education and training courses. It calls for the creation of a stability operations center to coordinate research, education, and training. The U.S. military currently has two institutions dedicated to stability operations but lacks a coordinating function. The directive aims to address concerns about the lack of personnel with necessary skills for stability operations, particularly peace operations. It calls for identifying needed personnel and developing recruitment, selection, and assignment methods. The directive also emphasizes the importance of interagency cooperation and proposes the creation of a stability operations center for coordination of research, education, and training. The directive calls for developing methods to recruit, select, and assign personnel with relevant skills for stability operations. It emphasizes the need for foreign area officers, regional specialists, civil affairs personnel, military police, engineers, and psychological operations personnel. Recommendations include recruiting mid-career professionals for Civil Affairs officers and potentially relying on contractors for additional support. The DOD directive mandates oversight of contracts and quick contract support for U.S. commanders in stability operations. Private contractors are seen as a key provider in stability operations, raising concerns about their role. Private contractors, armed and unarmed, are utilized by the United States and other entities for various functions in peacekeeping and stability operations. Controversy surrounds the costs of unarmed contractors for tasks like facility maintenance and services. The use of armed contractors for security services raises concerns about accountability and reliability in dangerous situations, potentially complicating military operations. Directive 3000.05 emphasizes the importance of supporting the development of other countries' security forces to ensure domestic security and contribute to stability operations. The United States provides training for international peacekeepers through the Global Peace Operations Initiative and DOD-sponsored programs. The February 2006 QDR report highlighted DOD's support for initiatives like GOPI, NATO stabilization efforts, European constabulary force development, and African Union's crisis intervention capability. The Bush Administration proposed the Global Peace Operations Initiative to train and equip military forces for peacekeeping, with a cost estimate of $661 million from FY2005-FY2009. The U.S. estimated the cost of the program at $661 million from FY2005-FY2009. Congress authorized DOD to establish a new program for training foreign military forces under Section 1206 of the FY2006 DOD authorization bill. Training under Section 1206 aims to increase foreign forces' ability to participate in military operations and enhance interoperability with U.S. forces. Congress rejected the Administration's request to expand authority for training police forces but increased funding from $200 million to $300 million per year through FY2008 under Section 1206 of the FY2007 National Defense authorization bill (P.L. 109-364). The Secretary of Defense, with the Secretary of State's approval, can now authorize training without a presidential order. The authority was not broadened to include other security forces, and new authorities were provided for training and education of foreign forces under P.L. 109-364. The Secretary of Defense can assist multilateral Centers of Excellence with up to $3 million for operating expenses. DOD can provide educational materials and technology for military interoperability, with the Secretary of State's approval if not authorized by law. DOD Directive 3000.05 mandates procedures for rapid implementation. Many defense analysts argue for flexible funding through discretionary funds for humanitarian relief and reconstruction to benefit local populations in foreign countries. Section 1206 (c) of the FY2007 National Defense authorization act would have authorized funding for all commanders of a geographic combatant command, but this provision was not included in the final bill. The FY2007 National Defense authorization act did not include a provision for flexible funding for humanitarian relief and reconstruction. However, a similar effect may have been achieved through the Section 902 expansion of the Combatant Commander Initiative Fund, which now includes civic assistance for urgent humanitarian relief and reconstruction."
