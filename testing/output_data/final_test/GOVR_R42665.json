CEO Jamie Dimon described the trading strategy as flawed and poorly executed. JP Morgan Chase faced a $2 billion trading loss in its London-based Chief Investment Office in the second quarter of 2012. CEO Jamie Dimon described the portfolio as containing securities with a lot of risk and volatility, potentially costing the bank $1 billion or more. The loss was charged to the bank's corporate and private equity division, resulting in an $800 million second quarter loss. Dimon also mentioned a $1 billion gain from the sale of securities by the unit, partially offsetting the loss. During the May conference call, JP Morgan faced a $2 billion trading loss in its London-based Chief Investment Office. Analysts speculated potential losses of up to $5 billion. CEO Jamie Dimon mentioned unwinding trades deliberately and detailed a $1.6 billion and $4.4 billion loss during a subsequent conference call on July 13, 2012. The CIO lost $1.6 billion and $4.4 billion in the first and second quarters of 2012. JP Morgan's stock price fell by 9% after the May conference call, resulting in a $14 billion loss in market capitalization. The bank suspended a $15 billion stock buyback and faced class action lawsuits alleging investor deception. After a conference call, Fitch Ratings downgraded JP Morgan's debt by a notch, citing concerns about risk management and liquidity. The $2 billion loss was deemed \"manageable,\" but raised questions about the bank's risk appetite. Analysts expressed worries about JP Morgan's risk management quality, although the losses were considered relatively small compared to the bank's balance sheet. Lawsuits alleging investor deception have also been filed. Officials at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) oversee JP Morgan's national bank and subsidiaries. Comptroller Thomas Curry stated that the bank's losses do not pose a solvency issue. The head of the bank's CIO resigned, and internal investigations criticized ineffective risk management and poor judgment. The CIO at JP Morgan was criticized for \"ineffective\" risk management and \"poor\" judgment in trades during the first quarter of 2012. The board of directors is considering implementing the bank's compensation clawback policy for employees responsible for the losses. Various agencies, including the OCC and the SEC, are evaluating the situation and potential corrective actions. The SEC, CFTC, Fed, OCC, and FDIC are investigating trades at JP Morgan. The DOJ and FBI are looking into possible criminal activity. Congressional hearings are focused on bank regulation and the Dodd-Frank Act. This report covers JP Morgan's regulation, the CIO unit, and the losing trades. The report covers various aspects of JP Morgan's operations related to the losing trades, including regulatory issues, risk management, the Volcker Rule, systemic significance of the losses, and implications for other large banks. It draws information from media reports, congressional testimony, and other sources, and will be updated as investigations progress. JP Morgan, a global financial institution with assets exceeding $2 trillion, operates in 60 countries and offers a range of financial services including mortgage lending, credit card issuance, investment banking, and asset management. The bank reported gross profits of $99 billion in 2011 and is a primary dealer in U.S. government securities. With a history of acquisitions and mergers, JP Morgan has evolved into a diversified financial complex with various business lines. The Chief Investment Office (CIO) at JP Morgan manages structural interest rate, currency, and credit risks for the company's primary business lines. It also advises on investment strategies and oversees interest rate and foreign exchange risks. CEO Jamie Dimon discussed the CIO's mission in congressional testimony. Mr. Dimon discussed the CIO's role in managing a $350 billion portfolio consisting of various assets to maintain liquidity and manage the company's assets and liabilities. Before Dimon became CEO, the CIO was part of the bank's treasury unit, which also focuses on asset/liability management. Bank treasury units, like JP Morgan's CIO, focus on asset/liability management. Other banks have similar functions but organized differently. For example, Bank of America's chief investment officer reports to the CFO. Citigroup's treasurer oversees a comparable portfolio and deputy treasurers. Wells Fargo divides the CIO between the CFO and the head of investment banking. Citigroup hedges liability risks centrally but lacks macroeconomic hedging like JP Morgan's CIO. JP Morgan's CIO, under the leadership of CEO Jamie Dimon, had a different portfolio composition compared to other large banks' treasury units. Former employees mentioned that Ina Drew, hired by Dimon to head the CIO, was authorized to increase investments in risky financial products. Ina Drew, head of JP Morgan's CIO, had authorization to increase investments in risky financial products like asset-backed securities, equities, and credit derivatives. The CIO was a profitable unit for the bank, with Ms. Drew earning millions in 2010 and 2011. She hired Achilles Macris in 2006 to oversee trading in the CIO in London. In 2011, Macris allegedly stopped using risk-control caps in the London unit, despite Jamie Dimon's denial. A report in July 2012 revealed that the CIO's trading losses had no limits on size or risk factor. The London unit experienced large gains followed by even larger losses in March 2012. After large gains in March 2012, Mr. Dimon was assured by Ms. Drew that volatility was \"manageable.\" However, extreme trading patterns led to significant losses a few days after JP Morgan's first quarter financials were reported. An investigation revealed problematic trading in the CIO's London office, culminating in a multi-billion dollar trading loss reported by Mr. Dimon in a May 2012 conference call. Media articles have detailed the nature of the trades that led to the losses, piecing together a common narrative through discussions with trading counterparties and market analysis. The authors have pieced together a common narrative on the likely nature of the losing trades, but details remain obscure. The most authoritative discussion comes from congressional testimony by JP Morgan's Michael Cavanagh and Thomas Curry, Comptroller of the Currency. JP Morgan's synthetic credit portfolio was meant to offset losses in a stressed credit environment and started about five years ago. The synthetic credit portfolio started about five years ago with short credit positions and some long positions to reduce costs. It generated about $2 billion in gains from 2007 to 2011. In late 2011, the CIO was directed to reduce risk and risk weighted assets in the portfolio as part of the annual budgeting process. The goal was to move from a net short position to a neutral one while retaining protection against corporate credit defaults. The synthetic credit portfolio aimed to balance long investment grade indices with short positions in high yield indices. As the portfolio grew, they struggled to maintain this balance, leading to market movements against them. They considered reducing the portfolio size but believed it would be costly. Ultimately, their chosen approach proved to be wrong. The portfolio size and complexity were increased dramatically in the first quarter of 2012, leading to heightened risks and losses. The total notional size tripled, leaving little room for error as pricing relationships broke down. The risky approach was not discussed at senior levels, resulting in losses in late March and early April. Market visibility of synthetic credit positions became a concern during this time. After press reports on April 6, a review of the synthetic credit portfolio was conducted by Ina, Doug, Jamie, John Hogan, and others. The review resulted in a forward scenario analysis predicting a P&L range for the second quarter from positive $350 million to negative $250 million. Despite initial comfort with the manageable risk, losses increased in late April, prompting heightened monitoring and a detailed examination by a senior Corporate Risk team. The Corporate Risk team examined the portfolio from the bottom up, providing daily updates and independent analysis that formed the basis for risk measurements adopted by the new CIO team. The bank initially used credit default swaps to offset credit risk in 2007 and 2008 but later revised its strategy in 2011 and 2012, leading to substantial losses due to deviations from expectations. JP Morgan's complex organizational structure includes a financial holding company with various subsidiaries, each regulated by different prudential regulators. The bank's derivatives trading activities are subject to regulation by multiple financial regulatory agencies. The OCC is the primary prudential regulator for federally chartered insured depositories, including JP Morgan's relevant subsidiary. Insured depositories may be subject to regulations of multiple prudential regulators, with the primary regulator depending on the firm's charter. The OCC coordinates examinations and standards through the FFIEC and has a targeted large bank supervision program for complex firms like JP Morgan, covering oversight of risk management. The OCC is raising prudential standards for risk management, aiming to match the complexity of risks faced by depositories. They have a team of 65 examiners onsite at JP Morgan, supported by other experts, reviewing all activities of the depository. The OCC is focusing on risk management in areas such as mortgage banking, trading, capital markets, and compliance with regulations like the Bank Secrecy Act. They do not see JP Morgan's trading losses as a threat to solvency or financial stability. The Federal Reserve is the primary regulator of JP Morgan's holding company. The Federal Reserve, as the primary regulator of JP Morgan's holding company, has examination teams for large complex banking organizations and may designate JP Morgan as a systemically important financial institution (SIFI) under the Dodd-Frank Act, leading to heightened prudential standards. The Federal Reserve is the central bank of the United States and provides emergency credit facilities to troubled financial firms. JP Morgan's depository has access to Fed lender-of-last-resort functions. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates that emergency credit facilities must be widely available, preventing targeted rescues like those for Bear Stearns and AIG in 2008. FDIC-insured depositories, including JP Morgan, must comply with FDIC regulations. The FDIC coordinates prudential standards with the OCC and the Fed through the FFIEC. In the event of JP Morgan failing with large losses, the FDIC would compensate depositors. The DFA grants the FDIC new authorities for SIFIs that fail, allowing the FDIC to dissolve the entire firm if necessary for financial stability. Shareholders and creditors of JP Morgan would experience losses under the FDIC's resolution authority. The Comptroller of the Currency has testified that the CIO's activities at JP Morgan are managed out of New York and supervised by OCC staff. Questions have been raised about the effectiveness of bank regulatory oversight. James Barth from the Milken Institute stated that the loss at JP Morgan does not significantly impact the bank's financial soundness or pose systemic risk. The JP Morgan Chase loss does not significantly impact the bank's financial soundness or pose systemic risk. The solution is not tougher regulations but the enforcement of existing regulations. Regulators must use their authority to prevent excessively risky activities. Senator Sherrod Brown highlighted a letter from the OCC reporting that examiners were not aware of trading risks at the CIO until April 2012. Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo suggested it is unrealistic to expect regulators to track specialized trades that are relatively small in the context of a bank's activities. The OCC and JP Morgan are conducting a review of supervisory activities and response following the bank's loss. Regulators may not always be aware of trading risks in specialized trades that are relatively small in the context of a bank's overall activities. The OCC and JP Morgan are reviewing supervisory activities and response after the bank's loss. The SEC, as the securities markets regulator, focuses on ensuring appropriate disclosures, transparency, CEO compensation, and conflicts of interest. The SEC enforces securities laws related to executive compensation and ensures proper alignment of CEO incentives. SEC Chair Mary Schapiro stated that the agency does not directly oversee the JP Morgan trades in question, particularly those involving credit default swap indices. The agency's inquiry will focus on the accuracy of JP Morgan's financial disclosures. The CFTC regulates certain financial derivatives activities in conjunction with other entities. The CFTC regulates financial derivatives activities, requiring standardized trading through clearinghouses and exchanges. It oversees trading platform safety, investigates market manipulation, and ensures transparent markets. CFTC Chair Gary Gensler is probing JP Morgan losses in credit derivative products. Reports suggest the market for these securities may have suddenly become illiquid during JP Morgan's trading. The CFTC is investigating JP Morgan's trading activities in credit derivative products, specifically looking into potential market manipulation. The probe may address responsibility for illiquidity in the securities market. The CFTC has the authority to require swap dealers and major swap participants to register and report to the agency, aiming to increase regulatory scrutiny on swap dealers. CFTC Chair Gensler mentioned the agency's power to monitor credit derivatives markets for fraud and manipulation but noted that JP Morgan was not yet regulated as a swaps dealer under the DFA. JP Morgan's trading activities in credit derivative products are under investigation by the CFTC for potential market manipulation. The CFTC has the authority to regulate swap dealers and major swap participants, but JP Morgan is not yet regulated as a swaps dealer under the DFA. The CFTC is close to publishing guidance on the cross-border application of swaps market reforms, including how overseas swap market participants can comply with DFA reforms. Similarly, the SEC is working on a similar cross-border release. Chair Schapiro mentioned that the SEC is preparing a cross-border release to provide guidance on overseas derivatives activities of U.S.-based firms. This is relevant to the JP Morgan situation as many trades were conducted in London, with potential losses to be absorbed by the U.S. holding company. The issue of supervising overseas derivatives activities while maintaining competitiveness has been raised by CFTC Chair Gensler. JP Morgan's trading losses have reignited discussions on the \"too big to fail\" doctrine. The discussion over the \"too big to fail\" doctrine has been revived due to JP Morgan's trading losses. The federal government may not allow large financial institutions like JP Morgan to fail to prevent devastating damage to the financial system. Financial columnist Holman Jenkins argues that national support for the doctrine is necessary due to the risks posed by government-insured banking systems. The U.S. is committed to a system with a small number of government-aligned banks, creating liquidity that ends up in institutions like J.P. Morgan. Some argue that the concept of \"too big to fail\" is at odds with the lessons learned from the bank's losses, highlighting the challenges of managing complex derivatives in large institutions. Sheila Bair emphasizes that even with good management, these institutions are too big to effectively oversee. Institutions dealing with complex derivatives in large securities trading books may be too big to manage effectively. Some suggest smaller, more focused institutions with separate lines of commerce to avoid such risks. There is a debate on reinstating parts of the Glass-Steagall Act following JP Morgan's trading losses, although the losses did not occur in the investment banking part of the firm. The Dodd-Frank Act created the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to monitor systemic risk in the financial system and designate firms as systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). SIFIs are subject to heightened prudential standards and regulated by the Federal Reserve. No financial institutions have been officially designated as SIFIs yet. FSOC was established to monitor systemic risk and designate SIFIs, but no financial institutions have been officially designated yet. If JP Morgan were designated a SIFI, the DFA requires the Federal Reserve to enforce heightened standards including risk-based capital, leverage limits, liquidity requirements, resolution plans, and overall risk-management standards. FSOC discussed JP Morgan's trading losses but did not consider them large enough. Systemic risk is being examined by FSOC in relation to JP Morgan's trading losses to prevent threats to the broader financial system and economy. It is argued that stable financial systems do not transmit shocks to the economy, and systemic risk can be created through domino effects, contagion, and fire sales during asset price declines. JP Morgan's trading losses are seen as a potential source of systemic risk due to the risk of contagion and fire sales during asset price declines. While officials believe the losses are not a significant threat to financial stability, trading in low-volume markets could lead to larger-than-anticipated losses. This highlights the importance of effective risk management in preventing systemic risks. JP Morgan's CIO operates separately from its investment banking business, where most trading occurs. Concerns have arisen over potential losses at other banks following JP Morgan's recent losses. The risk of contagion and fire sales during asset price declines poses a systemic risk, emphasizing the need for effective risk management. The argument is that large banks like JP Morgan face pressure to invest in riskier securities for higher profits due to muted demand for commercial loans and low yields on safe investments. This could potentially lead to significant losses, with taxpayers bearing the consequences. The Volcker Rule, part of the Dodd-Frank Act, prohibits banks from engaging in risky trading activities. This regulation aims to prevent large banks like JP Morgan from facing significant losses due to risky investments. Chairman Volcker, Senators Merkley and Levin introduced legislation in March 2010 contributing to the final language of Section 619, known as the Volcker Rule. Firms must comply by July 21, 2014, with good faith efforts since April 19, 2012. Policymakers question if JP Morgan's recent losses would be permissible under the Volcker Rule, which is not yet finalized. Insufficient specific information about the bank's transactions hinders addressing this policy question. Proposed rules issued by agencies are under consideration. The proposed Volcker Rule, introduced by Chairman Volcker, Senators Merkley, and Levin, aims to restrict proprietary trading by banking entities. The rule, not yet finalized, would prohibit banks from engaging in such activities. JP Morgan's recent losses raise questions about compliance with the rule. The complexity of documentation required for risk-mitigating hedging activities is highlighted in the proposed regulation. The proposed Volcker Rule aims to restrict proprietary trading by banking entities, tracking the statutory definition and prohibiting depository banks from speculating in financial markets. Exemptions include risk-mitigating hedging, U.S. Treasury trades, market-making, and customer-driven services. The Volcker Rule aims to restrict proprietary trading by banking entities, with exemptions for risk-mitigating hedging activities in connection with reducing specific risks to the bank's existing portfolio. Financial regulators will interpret how Section 619 is implemented, focusing on ensuring trades are used to offset risks, not for speculative opportunities. The Volcker Rule restricts proprietary trading by banking entities but allows exemptions for risk-mitigating hedging activities that are correlated to the risk being hedged. These activities must not result in a material conflict of interest and are subject to prudential backstops to ensure the safety and soundness of the banking entity. Regulatory agencies face challenges in distinguishing risk-mitigating hedging from speculative trading. The Volcker Rule restricts proprietary trading by banking entities but allows exemptions for risk-mitigating hedging activities. Critics argue that the proposed rule is too permissive and may fail to prevent speculative trading, as large banking organizations could justify almost any speculative trade as being \"reasonably correlated\" to other positions held by the institution. Critics argue that the definition of hedge should be narrowed and firms should not justify trades based on the banking entity's general condition. They also believe the proposed rule is too strict and will hinder legitimate hedging activities. Prudential hedging should address various risks, not just individual asset risks, as large portfolios make risk measurement complex. Firms should be allowed to use hedging strategies to address residual risks. Firms are advised to use hedging strategies to address residual risks after netting portfolios, which may be challenging to document. Industry critics, including Professor Hal Scott and Morgan Stanley, question the strict criteria proposed by the agencies. PNC Financial Services Group Inc. disagrees with the implication that proper hedges do not yield significant profits and suggests focusing on the purpose of hedging rather than compensation. JP Morgan criticized the statute and regulation for potentially hindering legitimate asset-liability management hedging activities. They argued that their losing trades could qualify as risk-mitigating hedges under the proposed rule, but the Volcker Rule has yet to be implemented for testing. The Volcker Rule has not been implemented yet, raising questions about its applicability to scenarios like JP Morgan's trades. Hedging strategies are meant to protect against losses, but can result in losses if not needed. Airlines, for example, may lose money on fuel derivatives if prices stay within expected ranges. The JP Morgan trade may not fit the common understanding of hedging as it was designed to profit the firm if economic conditions improved in the short run. Modern risk management and banking regulation are more complex than traditional hedging practices, with financial institutions exposed to various risks that may move in opposite directions. In banking, risks such as credit risk and interest rate risk may move in opposite directions. Interest rate risk is correlated with economic conditions and can offset default risk. Different types of borrowers may have varying default probabilities during bad economic conditions. Banks face multiple risks besides credit and interest rate risk, including market risk. The JP Morgan CIO transactions involve various risks beyond credit and interest rate risk, such as market, reputational, legal, and liquidity risks. The complexity of modern risk management strategies used by JP Morgan raises issues of congressional oversight. The complexity of modern risk management in trades raises issues for congressional oversight. Financial regulators do not comment on ongoing investigations, making it difficult for third parties to confirm specific transactions. Sound risk management is crucial for bank safety, with regulators like OCC evaluating management's ability to control risk. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke emphasizes the importance of sound bank risk management. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke highlighted the importance of effective risk management in banking, emphasizing the inadequacy of many financial institutions' risk management systems during the financial crisis. The trading losses at JP Morgan, known for quality risk management, have raised concerns about the bank's risk practices. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner sees this as a strong case for financial reform. The report aims to address the factors contributing to risk management shortcomings. The report highlights two key factors contributing to risk management shortcomings at JP Morgan's CIO: Mr. Dimon's focus on profit-making and increased risk-taking, and potential lax oversight of trading. Additionally, issues with the models used to assess trade risk and the lack of experience in the risk management committee have also impacted risk management quality. The report cites Mr. Dimon's focus on profit-making and increased risk-taking as contributing factors to risk management shortcomings at JP Morgan's CIO. Alleged lax oversight of trading and ineffective risk control functions are also highlighted as key issues. The firm-wide risk control function at JP Morgan faced scrutiny due to missed risk management oversight, as highlighted in the July 2012 CIO Task Force Update. Traders and managers of the problematic synthetic securities portfolio failed to properly vet trading strategies and seek support from senior management. The CIO's synthetic securities portfolio lacked adequate scrutiny and support from broader management. Risk management was challenged by transitions in key roles, lack of resources, and ineffective risk committee structure. The risk management group failed to meet expectations in various areas, including setting inadequate risk limits and not communicating concerns over risk-taking to top management. The synthetic credit portfolio traded by the CIO lacked specificity. The CIO's synthetic credit portfolio securities traded problematically lacked specific risk limits and were subject to no limits on size, asset type, or risk factor. Media accounts of comments by past and present JP Morgan employees highlight potential risk management shortcomings at the bank's CIO, associated with alleged lax and ineffective management. Reports as early as 2007 raised concerns over the CIO's growing size and complexity of trades. Former officials have mentioned that risk managers overseeing the CIO's trades tended to neglect their duties. JP Morgan officials have reported that risk managers overseeing the CIO's trades were marginalized by Mr. Macris, the head of the CIO's London office. Ina Drew, head of the CIO, supported Mr. Macris' management but intervened sparingly. In 2011, Mr. Macris unilaterally abandoned risk-control caps, allowing traders to exceed $20 million in losses. Concerns were raised in 2010 when traders in the London desk lost $300 million on foreign exchange options without offsetting gains. Joseph Bonocore, then-CIO's chief financial officer, raised these concerns to JP Morgan's chief risk officer and chief financial officer. After Joseph Bonocore raised concerns about the CIO's London office's risky trades, he was authorized to order a reduction in the trading position. Bonocore, who later became JP Morgan's treasurer, expressed general concerns about the risks taken by the London office before leaving his position in October 2011. The treasurer position remained unfilled until March 2012, during which the CIO suffered losses. In 2011, concerns were raised about large trading positions in illiquid derivative indexes at JP Morgan's CIO's London desk. Executives agreed to liquidate the positions, but new trades contradicted this directive. The CIO's chief risk officer began assessing risk limits in the summer of 2011. Weiland, then-CIO's chief risk officer, assessed risk limits and recommended hiring more personnel with credit risk skills. He was later replaced by Irvin Goldman, who had no prior risk management experience. Ina Drew, the CIO's head, took an extended leave in 2010 due to Lyme disease. During her absence in 2010 to recover from Lyme disease, news reports highlighted conflicts between the CIO's New York and London offices over risk levels, particularly regarding trader Bruno Iskil, known as the \"whale.\" Upon her return, Ms. Drew struggled to regain control over the London desk, where risk management practices like Value at Risk (VaR) models are used by banks like JP Morgan. Financial regulators do not explicitly require financial institutions to use a specific method for measuring risk, such as VaR. However, every major financial institution reports VaR, and the OCC oversees risk management in federally chartered insured depositories. VaR models are also used to determine how much capital a bank will hold against trading its assets, and SEC filings of publicly traded banks often include VaR-based calculations. During a conference call in May 2012, JP Morgan CEO Dimon revealed changes in the CIO's VaR calculations. The model used for VaR was altered in the first quarter of 2012, with the replacement model projecting a potential daily loss of $67 million. However, this replacement model was later deemed inadequate, and the older model, showing a risk of up to $129 million a day, was reinstated. Changes in portfolio assets, new information, or updated VaR computation techniques can prompt companies to alter their VaR measurement methods. JP Morgan, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, and Citigroup have all adjusted their VaR methodologies in recent years. Concerns have been raised about JP Morgan's switch to a more optimistic VaR model in 2012, with suggestions that it may have been an attempt to conceal risk levels. RiskMetrics Group founder Christopher Finger noted that while banks occasionally modify their VaR models, these changes are typically minor. Mr. Finger mentioned that banks make minor changes to their VaR models, which may not significantly alter results. However, the older VaR model reinstated by the CIO showed a substantial increase in risk compared to the replacement model. Mr. Dimon highlighted the constant changes in models due to new facts and the need for improvement. The approval process for the problematic VaR model was deemed inadequate by JP Morgan's independent model review group. The VaR model used by JP Morgan's CIO was deemed inadequate due to reliance on unsuitable assumptions and operational challenges. The OCC may investigate the authorization protocol for changes to the VaR models. SEC Chair emphasized the importance of disclosing changes to VaR models. JP Morgan's risk management committee oversees risk policies and the chief risk officer. The risk management committee at JP Morgan, led by James Crown, Ellen Futter, and David Cote, met seven times in 2011. Unlike other banks, none of the committee members had experience working at a bank or as financial risk managers. James Crown, the committee chair at JP Morgan's risk management committee, lacks recent industry experience. Anat Admati, a finance professor, criticized the committee's composition as inadequate for overseeing the bank's risk. CtW Investment Group raised concerns in 2011 about the committee's lack of expertise in banking and financial regulation. Barbara Matthews, a financial regulatory expert, questioned if JP Morgan's risk management committee was unaware of key information, similar to past incidents like AIG. Jamie Dimon defended the committee's performance during the financial crisis but acknowledged the need for changes. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates transparency in publicly traded bank holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded bank holding companies with over $10 billion in assets to establish a risk management committee of independent directors, including a risk management expert. As of July 2012, the Federal Reserve had not finalized rules in this area."
