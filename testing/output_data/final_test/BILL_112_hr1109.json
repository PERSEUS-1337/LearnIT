    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Global Education Nexus in U.S. Act\" or the \"GENIUS Act.\" Congress finds that international challenges such as security, global markets, immigration, and world health are changing the global landscape. Technological advances are connecting people worldwide, and American workplaces and communities reflect this diversity. Americans must make informed judgments about the role of the United States in the world. The United States' position in the world depends on understanding how international events impact the nation's lives, politics, economics, and security. American businesses require employees with knowledge of foreign languages and cultures to market products globally. Schools play a crucial role in preparing students for the workforce and citizenship roles in a diverse and interconnected world. Recent surveys show the lack of geographic, economic, and historical literacy among young Americans. American students rarely choose to study geography, world history, international relations, or foreign languages. School curricula and university programs are not aligned with new global realities, and there is a need to include international education competency in teacher credentialing and licensing. The Act aims to improve student achievement in world history, international studies, and foreign languages by enhancing teachers' international education competence. It also supports programs that enhance student learning in these areas. The Act establishes a Deputy Assistant Secretary for International and Foreign Language Education.
