    "content": "Large pre-trained Transformers like BERT have been effective for NLP tasks, but inference is slow and expensive. A proposed decomposition allows lower layers to process input segments independently, improving parallelism and caching. Information loss can be recovered in upper layers with auxiliary supervision during fine-tuning. Evaluation on various tasks shows that decomposition enhances performance. The proposed decomposition in large Transformer-based NLP models like BERT enables faster inference and significant memory reduction while maintaining performance. Self-attention over the entire input for all layers is computationally expensive, prompting the question of its necessity in all layers. Previous studies have shown that decomposition enhances performance. In large Transformer-based NLP models like BERT, decomposition enables faster inference and memory reduction while maintaining performance. Previous studies suggest that lower layers capture syntactic phenomena based on local contexts, while higher layers capture semantic phenomena based on global contexts. Focusing on paired-input NLP tasks like reading comprehension, natural language inference, and sentence pair similarity allows for efficient representation computation in different layers. Decomposition technique in large Transformer-based NLP models like BERT allows for faster inference and memory reduction. It enables parallel processing of segments, caching offline segments, and reuse of pre-trained weights. Augmenting fine-tuning loss with distillation loss compensates for differences in the decomposed setting. Evaluation on five pairwise tasks shows significant speedup (2 to 4.3x) and memory reduction (51.1% to 76.8%) with only a small loss in effectiveness (0.2 to 1.8 points). Larger BERT models can even run faster than smaller ones with decomposition. The larger BERT model can run faster than the original smaller model while maintaining accuracy by reducing compute involved. Prior work includes compression techniques and model weights pruning to speed up inference in CNN and RNN models. Pruning attention heads and approximating attention computation with tensor decomposition have also been explored for Transformers. Distillation techniques like DistillBERT aim to train smaller student networks to speed up inference, but they often suffer from a significant drop in accuracy compared to the original BERT model. This approach involves expensive pre-training on language modeling tasks before fine-tuning for downstream tasks. In this work, the authors propose a decomposition method to speed up the inference of Transformer models without compressing or removing parameters. This approach enables parallel processing and caching of segments, allowing for faster inference while retaining the model's overall capacity and structure. Transformers process input sequences through multiple layers of self-attention, which can be computationally expensive, especially in paired-input tasks. The authors propose a decomposition method to speed up Transformer models' inference without compressing parameters. This approach allows for parallel processing and caching of segments, improving efficiency without sacrificing model capacity. Transformers compute attention over input pairs, but decomposing the function over segments can reduce complexity and improve efficiency. The authors propose a method to speed up Transformer models' inference by reducing compute through parallelism and caching. Self-attentions can be computed in parallel, allowing for offline caching of passage representations. This trade-off sacrifices some representation effectiveness but is beneficial in models with multiple layers. The authors suggest a method to accelerate Transformer models by utilizing parallelism and caching, particularly beneficial for models with multiple layers. Lower layers focus on local phenomena, while higher layers handle more semantic tasks. Minimal changes to the Transformer architecture allow for reusing pre-trained weights and achieving high performance through fine-tuning. The authors propose a method to speed up Transformer models by removing cross-interactions between lower layers, resulting in a decomposed Transformer. This model can be initialized with pre-trained weights from the original Transformer and fine-tuned for downstream tasks, although some information in lower layer representations is lost. The authors introduce a method to accelerate Transformer models by creating a decomposed Transformer that eliminates cross-interactions in lower layers. This model is initialized with pre-trained weights from the original Transformer and fine-tuned for downstream tasks. To enhance learning, auxiliary losses are added to align predictions and representations with the full Transformer. Knowledge Distillation Loss is utilized to minimize the difference between prediction distributions of the decomposed and full Transformers during fine-tuning. The Layerwise Representation Similarity Loss is used to bring the layer representations of the decomposed Transformer closer to those of the full Transformer during fine-tuning. It minimizes the euclidean distance between token representations of the upper layers of the decomposed Transformer and the full Transformer. This loss is added along with Knowledge Distillation Loss and Task Specific Supervision Loss during fine-tuning. Loss, Task Specific Supervision Loss (L ts ), and hyper-parameter tuning using Bayesian Optimization are key components in fine-tuning models. Pre-trained BERT models are utilized on various QA tasks and reading comprehension datasets like SQuAD v1.1 and RACE. The curr_chunk discusses various datasets used for evaluating reading and reasoning abilities in Chinese students, including BoolQ, MNLI, and QQP. The datasets have a large number of questions and passages. The data is split for hyper-parameter tuning and efficiency reporting. The models are implemented in TensorFlow 1.14. The curr_chunk discusses implementing models in TensorFlow 1.14 based on BERT codebase, conducting experiments on one TPU v3-8 node, tuning hyperparameters using bayesian optimization library, and caching representations for different tasks. Performance results are compared in Table 1. Table 1 compares the performance, speed, and memory usage of BERT-base and Decomposed BERT-base with nine lower layers and three upper layers. Significant speedup and memory reduction are observed across all datasets, while maintaining high effectiveness. Inference latency on SQuAD datasets shows that Decomposed BERT-base outperforms BERT-base, indicating that a larger Transformer can run faster with decomposition. With decomposition, a large Transformer can run faster and be more accurate than a smaller one half its size. Distilling a larger model into a smaller one can yield better accuracy. Previous studies show speedup but with significant accuracy drops. Fair comparisons require careful experimentation. Device results show impact on different machines. The models were deployed on three different devices (GPU, CPU, mobile phone) showing more than three times speedup. Auxiliary losses were crucial for fine-tuning Decomposed-BERT on SQuAD dataset. Effectiveness and inference speed of Decomposed-BERT varied with separation layer, with speedup scaling quadratically. Ablation analysis on SQuAD datasets highlighted the importance of auxiliary supervision. The ablation analysis on SQuAD datasets for Decomp-BERT models showed the impact of separation layer choice on effectiveness and inference speed. Differences in representations between original BERT and decomposed BERT were analyzed across all layers using encoded question-passage pairs. The analysis on SQuAD datasets for Decomp-BERT models revealed the impact of separation layer choice on effectiveness and inference speed. Figure 5 illustrates the distances of vector representations at different layers, showing that lower layers capture more local context while upper layers capture more global context. Using auxiliary supervision on upper layers helps the decomposed BERT model produce representations closer to the original model. The decomposed model allows for caching text representations offline, with storage costs significantly lower than inference costs. Storing representations for one million question-passage pairs daily using BERT-base amounts to $61.7 per month. The decomposed model significantly reduces costs compared to using GPUs for inference. Recent advancements in NLP models like XLNet and RoBERTa show promise for applying the decomposition technique. Further research is needed to demonstrate its effectiveness on these models. Transformers have improved NLP tools by incorporating large contexts effectively, but this complexity can be reduced. A decomposition model of the Transformer has been developed to improve inference speed and memory usage while maintaining accuracy. This model serves as a strong starting point for efficient NLP models as they handle wider contexts."
