The Games will feature 2,900 athletes from 88 countries competing in 15 disciplines at two main locations: a coastal cluster along the Black Sea and a mountain cluster in the Krasnaya Polyana mountains. Moscow previously hosted the 1980 Olympic Summer Games. Security is a key factor in selecting a host city for the Olympics. The three candidate cities for the 2014 Olympics were Pyeongchang, South Korea; Salzburg, Austria; and Sochi, Russia. They had to complete a security questionnaire and provide guarantees for the safety of the Games. The IOC Evaluation Commission reviewed their plans and issued a report to the IOC. The IOC 2014 Evaluation Commission Report assessed Sochi's security plans for hosting the 2014 games. The Russian government guaranteed full responsibility and cost for security. The Russian police force was praised for its experience in hosting major events. The IOC recommended setting up an Olympic Security Steering Committee and Task Force for security planning.

Three Olympic Games have been targeted by terrorist actions, with the most deadly attack occurring in 1972 at the Summer Games in Munich.

Sochi, historically the capital of an area populated by Circassians, was conquered by Russia in the mid-19th century, leading to the displacement and killing of many Circassians. According to the 2010 Russia census, there are about 718,000 Circassians, with most residing in the North Caucasian republics.
