    "content": "The \"White House Inspector General Act of 1996\" establishes an Inspector General for the Executive Office of the President. The President must nominate an individual for this role within 120 days of the Act's effective date. Special provisions are outlined for the Inspector General of the Executive Office of the President. The Inspector General Act of 1978 is amended to include special provisions concerning the Inspector General of the Executive Office of the President. The Inspector General of the Executive Office of the President is under the authority, direction, and control of the President for audits, investigations, and subpoenas related to criminal investigations, undercover operations, confidential sources, policy decisions, intelligence matters, and national security threats. The President may prohibit the Inspector General from carrying out audits or investigations if the disclosure of information would interfere with the President's constitutional responsibilities and if the prohibition is necessary to prevent disclosure. The President must notify the Inspector General and Congress within 30 days if prohibiting audits or investigations due to potential interference with constitutional responsibilities. The Inspector General must then share this information with relevant congressional committees. The Executive Office of the President must include in each semiannual report to the President a list of inspections, investigations, or audits conducted, status of corrective actions on previous recommendations, certification of Inspector General's access to relevant information, and descriptions of cases. The Inspector General must include in each semiannual report to Congress descriptions of cases where relevant documentary evidence could not be obtained due to a determination by the President, along with recommendations for legislation to promote efficiency and detect fraud in programs and operations of the Executive Office of the President. The President must transmit the semiannual report from the Inspector General of the Executive Office of the President to the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate with any comments deemed appropriate. The Act will be effective on January 21, 1997."
