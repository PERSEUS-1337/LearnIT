    "content": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) train implicit generative models through solving minimax problems. This paper focuses on GANs in the type of integral probability metrics (IPMs) with an overparametrized neural network generator. Stochastic gradient descent on a regularized IPM objective converges globally to a stationary point with a sublinear rate when the discriminator is solved to approximate optimality in each iteration. The obtained stationary point corresponds to a generator that yields a distribution close to the observed data distribution in terms of total variation. The file iclr2020_conference.pdf provides instructions and formatting requirements for submitting papers to ICLR. Submissions must use L A T E X with specific style files. The text should be within specific dimensions and follow formatting instructions outlined in the style files. The formatting requirements for submitting papers to ICLR include using 10 point Times New Roman font with 1.5 inch margins, 11 point vertical spacing, and 1/2 line space between paragraphs. Paper title should be 17 point, in small caps, left-aligned, and authors' names set in boldface above their addresses. The lead author's name comes first, followed by co-authors, with a recommended paper length of 8 pages and a strict limit of 10 pages for the main text. Additional pages are allowed for citations, with reviewers applying a higher standard to papers exceeding 8 pages. Appendices can be used for extra content. Authors submitting papers to ICLR must adhere to formatting requirements such as using 10 point Times New Roman font with 1.5 inch margins and 11 point vertical spacing. The paper title should be 17 point, in small caps, left-aligned, and authors' names set in boldface above their addresses. Papers should not exceed 8 pages, with additional pages allowed for citations. Citations within the text should follow specific guidelines using the natbib package. References should be listed alphabetically in the REFERENCES section, with footnotes indicated by a number 1. When submitting papers to ICLR, adhere to formatting requirements like using 10 point Times New Roman font with 1.5 inch margins and 11 point vertical spacing. The paper title should be 17 point, in small caps, left-aligned, and authors' names set in boldface above their addresses. Papers should not exceed 8 pages, with additional pages allowed for citations. Citations within the text should follow specific guidelines using the natbib package. References should be listed alphabetically in the REFERENCES section, with footnotes indicated by a number 1. Any style is acceptable as long as it is used consistently. Indicate footnotes with a number 1 in the text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page on which they appear. Make sure the figure caption does not get separated from the figure. Leave sufficient space to avoid splitting the figure and figure caption. You may use color figures. However, it is best for the figure captions and the paper body to make sense if the paper is printed either in black/white or in color.

Please prepare PostScript or PDF files with paper size \"US Letter\", and not, for example, \"A4\". The -t letter option on dvips will produce US Letter files. Consider directly generating PDF files using pdflatex (especially if you are a MiKTeX user). PDF figures must be substituted for EPS figures, however. Otherwise, please generate your PostScript and PDF files with the following commands: dvips mypaper.dvi -t letter -Ppdf -G0 -o mypaper.ps ps2pdf mypaper.ps mypaper.pdf Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using \\special or other commands.
