    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Free Flow of Information Act of 2013\" and covers compelled disclosure from covered persons. Conditions for Compelled Disclosure under Federal law prohibit a Federal entity from forcing a covered person in journalism to testify or provide documents unless a court determines, after exhausting other sources, that there are reasonable grounds to believe a crime has occurred. Under Federal law, compelled disclosure of a journalist's testimony or documents is allowed if it is critical to an investigation or prosecution, or to the defense against prosecution. In non-criminal matters, disclosure is permitted if it is crucial to the successful completion of the matter. Disclosure may also be necessary to prevent an act of terrorism. Disclosure of a confidential source's identity may be necessary to prevent terrorism, imminent harm, or identify individuals who have disclosed trade secrets or health information. The compelled testimony or document must not be overbroad, unreasonable, or oppressive, and must serve the purpose of verifying published information. The compelled testimony or document must be limited to verifying published information or relevant surrounding circumstances, narrowly tailored in subject matter and time period to avoid irrelevant information. This Act does not apply to civil defamation claims under State law. SEC. 3. COMPELLED DISCLOSURE FROM COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS. Conditions for compelled disclosure from communications service providers include applying section 2 to testimony or documents related to business transactions with covered persons. Before compelling testimony or document disclosure, the party seeking it must notify the covered person involved in the transaction. The court must provide notice to the communications service provider before compelling testimony or disclosure, with an opportunity for the provider to be heard. Notice may be delayed only if it poses a substantial threat to a criminal investigation. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, a \"communications service provider\" is defined as a person transmitting customer-chosen information electronically, including telecommunications carriers, information service providers, interactive computer service providers, and information content providers. A \"covered person\" is someone engaged in journalism for financial gain, including supervisors, employers, parents, subsidiaries, or affiliates, excluding foreign powers or agents. The term \"document\" refers to writings, recordings, and photographs as defined by Federal Rule of Evidence 1001. The term \"Federal entity\" includes entities or employees of the judicial or executive branch or administrative agencies of the Federal Government. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of \"journalism\" as the gathering, preparing, and publishing of news or information of public interest. It also mentions the power of an administrative agency to issue subpoenas."
