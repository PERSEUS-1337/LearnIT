    "content": "The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Act of 1965 aims to preserve outdoor recreation resources and promote citizen participation in recreational activities. It provides funds for federal land acquisition and state assistance for recreation planning and development. The fund receives $900 million annually but requires congressional appropriation to spend. The LWCF Act authorizes the fund to accrue $900 million annually, with funding from various sources including oil and gas leases. Additional money is received under GOMESA, with no expiration date for accruing revenues. The LWCF Act authorizes the fund to accrue $900 million annually from various sources, including GOMESA. There is a debate on reauthorizing provisions of the LWCF Act and altering the fund's operation, including making appropriations mandatory and directing funds for specific purposes. These issues are being discussed by authorizing committees and during consideration of the annual Interior appropriations legislation. The LWCF Act authorizes the fund to accrue $900 million annually from various sources, including GOMESA. Congressional issues include deciding funding levels for federal land acquisition and state grant programs through the annual Interior appropriations legislation. The LWCF is not a true trust fund and requires Congressional appropriation for spending. Discussions are ongoing about reauthorizing provisions and altering the fund's operation. The LWCF Act authorizes the fund to accrue $900 million annually from various sources, including GOMESA. Amendments have raised the authorization ceiling and mandated that offshore oil and gas leasing revenues should make up any shortfall. $40.0 billion has been credited to the LWCF, with $18.4 billion appropriated for federal land acquisition and state grants, leaving an unappropriated balance of $21.6 billion in the fund. The LWCF Act allocates funds for recreational planning, acquiring lands, waters, and developing outdoor facilities. Congress determines annual appropriations with a minimum of 40% for federal purposes. Originally, the LWCF Act in 1964 allocated 60% for state purposes and 40% for federal purposes. The LWCF Act originally allocated 60% for state purposes and 40% for federal purposes. However, a 1976 amendment resulted in a minimum of 40% for federal purposes to address the inflexibility of the division. In cases where states cannot match their share of funding, additional funding is provided to federal agencies for land acquisition to preserve areas for future generations. The LWCF is the main source of funds for federal land acquisition, managed by four agencies - Forest Service, National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Land Management. The FWS and BLM have additional funding sources for land acquisition. The LWCF Act allocates funds for federal land acquisition for recreation, wildlife, and conservation purposes. The appropriations acts specify how the federal funds are to be used, with the process being similar each year. The annual budget submissions from federal land management agencies identify the lands they seek to acquire. Land management agencies identify lands for acquisition with LWCF funds through a three-level process. The Administration may not seek funding for individual projects, but for certain types like access for recreation. Congress reviews agency requests, determines funding, and decides on specific types of acquisitions. The LWCF Act restricts appropriations to authorized acquisitions, allowing funds to be used for pre-acquisition work with imminent authorization. Appropriations remain available until expended for land acquisition, often carried over due to the lengthy process involving appraisals, resource evaluations, and title research. The LWCF Act authorizes appropriations for land acquisitions, including funds for acquisition management, land exchanges, inholdings, emergencies, and hardships. Grants are also provided to states for outdoor recreation purposes, administered by the NPS through traditional and competitive grant programs. The NPS administers grants for outdoor recreation purposes through traditional and competitive grant programs. States can sub-award grants to various entities, with a focus on developing new or redeveloping existing recreation facilities. Over 42,000 grants have been awarded since FY1965, primarily for outdoor recreation planning, land acquisition, and facility development. The LWCF state grants fund acquisitions for recreation use, with conversions approved by the Secretary of the Interior for other purposes like building schools or widening roads. The NPS approves 50-75 conversions annually, with the appropriation divided among states based on need determined by the Secretary. The LWCF state grants fund acquisitions for recreation use, with conversions approved by the Secretary of the Interior for other purposes like building schools or widening roads. The NPS approves 50-75 conversions annually, with the appropriation divided among states based on need determined by the Secretary. State need is determined by factors such as population relative to the US, use of outdoor recreation resources by non-residents, and federal resources and programs within states. States have up to three years to use discretionary appropriations, with the Secretary required to reapportion any unused funds after this period. Under the LWCF state grants program, states can receive up to $125.0 million annually through FY2056, with exceptions for FY2021 and FY2022 at $162.5 million each. These mandatory appropriations are in addition to any discretionary funds provided by Congress for the LWCF. States must have a statewide outdoor recreation plan to be eligible for grants, with funds available until expended. The LWCF state grants program allows states to receive up to $125.0 million annually through FY2056, with exceptions for FY2021 and FY2022 at $162.5 million each. States must have a statewide outdoor recreation plan to be eligible for grants, with funds available until expended. The plan must address recreation needs and opportunities, with a program for reaching goals. States award grant money through a competitive process based on their plans and priorities. Payments are generally limited to 50% of project costs, with the rest covered by the state sponsor. Congress appropriated LWCF funds for a new outdoor recreation grant program developed by the NPS. The NPS has a competitive outdoor recreation grant program funded by Congress, with funding increasing to $20.0 million in FY2018. The program prioritizes projects in densely settled areas serving populations of 50,000 or more, especially those underserved in outdoor recreation opportunities and economically disadvantaged. Selection factors include connecting people to the outdoors, creating jobs, engaging communities, public-private partnerships, and coordination among sectors. The NPS plans to issue between 25 and 35 grants in 2018. The NPS outdoor recreation grant program prioritizes projects in densely settled areas serving populations of 50,000 or more, especially those underserved in outdoor recreation opportunities and economically disadvantaged. Grants range from $250,000 to $750,000 with a nonfederal funding match requirement. The LWCF Act lists federal purposes for allotting funds, with a portion allocated for other federal purposes since FY2000. Since FY1998, the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) has been used for various purposes, with Presidents seeking funds for different programs each year. Congress decides which programs to fund, such as maintenance of agency facilities, Historic Preservation Fund, Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, and wildlife grants. Since FY2008, funds have been allocated for Forest Legacy and Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation programs, totaling $18.4 billion in appropriations. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) has received $18.4 billion in appropriations since FY2008. The funds have been unevenly allocated among federal land acquisition, the stateside program, and other purposes. The largest portion, $11.2 billion, has been appropriated for federal land acquisition, with the NPS receiving $4.6 billion, the FS $3.1 billion, the FWS $2.4 billion, and the BLM $1.0 billion. The stateside program has received the second-largest portion of LWCF appropriations, totaling $4.7 billion. Since FY2008, the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) has received $18.4 billion in appropriations. The stateside program has received $4.7 billion, with more funds going to this program than to federal land acquisition. Stateside appropriations exceeded federal land acquisition appropriations in 12 out of 16 years from FY1965 to FY1980. However, the stateside program's portion of total LWCF appropriations declined after the mid-1980s, receiving no appropriations from FY1996 to FY1999. In recent years, the stateside program has received less than 20% of total LWCF appropriations, except for FY2018 where it received 38%. Over the last 10 years, stateside funding has averaged 19% of total LWCF appropriations, with other purposes receiving the remaining portion of funds. Other purposes have received $2.6 billion (14%) of total LWCF appropriations since FY1998, with the FWS and FS receiving the largest shares. Mandatory appropriations totaling $75.0 million were provided to the LWCF stateside program during FY2009-FY2018, with an increase to $62.6 million in FY2018 due to additional revenue from the Gulf of Mexico program expansion. The Department of the Interior (DOI) anticipates high mandatory appropriations in the coming years, with estimates for the National Park Service (NPS) program ranging from $85 million to $104 million annually. Discretionary appropriations from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) have fluctuated widely over the years, with annual totals exceeding $400 million in 11 of the 21 most recent years. In FY1998 through FY2018, LWCF appropriations exceeded $400 million in 11 years. In FY1998, appropriations spiked to $969 million, surpassing the authorized level. FY2001 saw another spike to nearly $1 billion, partly in response to President Clinton's Lands Legacy Initiative seeking $1.4 billion for resource protection. President Clinton's Lands Legacy Initiative sought $1.4 billion for 21 resource protection programs, including the LWCF. The 106th Congress considered legislation to fully fund the LWCF and make it operate like a private-sector trust fund. Congress included aspects of the legislation in the FY2001 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations law (P.L. 106-291). LWCF discretionary appropriations ranged from $275.3 million in FY2009 to $450.4 million in FY2010 over the last 10 years. In the last 10 years, LWCF discretionary appropriations ranged from $275.3 million in FY2009 to a high of $450.4 million in FY2010. The most recent appropriation in FY2018 was $425.0 million, nearly half the authorized level. The total appropriation was at least $400.0 million in the three most recent fiscal years and in FY2010, with at least $200.0 million dedicated to land acquisition for all agencies. Land acquisition funding ranged from $152.2 million in FY2009 to $277.9 million in FY2010, and was $220.3 million in FY2018. Appropriations for the stateside program fluctuated between $19.0 million in FY2009 and $124.0 million in FY2018, with each of the last three fiscal years receiving at least $110.0 million. The appropriations for other purposes varied widely since FY1998, with the highest dollar value in FY2001 and the highest percentage in FY2006 and FY2007 in response to specific funding requests. Congress has appropriated significantly less in some years. Congress has appropriated significantly less for other purposes than the Administration has requested, with differing opinions on the optimal level of LWCF appropriations. The LWCF has broad support from resource protection advocates seeking stable and predictable funding. The Obama Administration proposed $900 million for LWCF appropriations. Advocates of higher federal land acquisition funding support a strong federal role in acquiring and managing sensitive areas and natural resources, while opponents seek reduced levels of funds for LWCF. Concerns include reducing the size of the federal estate, minimizing further federal land acquisition, and preferring private or state/local ownership and management of resources. Advocates of reducing federal land ownership support giving more control to state and local governments, with debates on extending the LWCF Act's authority to receive $900 million annually. Many favor a long or permanent extension, citing the program's success in protecting valuable lands and resources for over 50 years. Some proponents argue for the continuity and stability of LWCF's land protection and recreational opportunities, citing the program's dedicated funding stream and sufficient funds to meet national needs. Structural reforms may be necessary for a long-term extension, such as directing funding away from federal land acquisition. Some advocates propose redirecting funding from federal land acquisition to support maintenance and programs for federal lands. The Obama Administration suggested $900 million for LWCF in FY2017, with a mix of discretionary and mandatory appropriations. They also recommended amending current law to provide $900 million in mandatory funding annually starting in FY2018 for program stability and predictability. The curr_chunk discusses the funding stream for LWCF at $900 million and the debate on how to allocate permanent appropriations among different LWCF programs. Proponents of discretionary appropriations argue for Congress to retain authority in determining annual funding levels for LWCF to allow for program oversight. Some argue for regular oversight of LWCF funding, prioritizing maintenance over acquisitions. The Trump Administration initially did not seek funding for this. The Trump Administration did not prioritize funding for individual acquisitions by agencies in FY2019, citing billions of dollars in deferred maintenance as a higher priority. Supporters of LWCF emphasize the need to preserve iconic resources and provide recreational opportunities. Some suggest allocating more funding to maintenance accounts while using LWCF for acquisitions. Some federal lands have limited public access due to private or state ownership or geographical barriers. Proponents want to allocate LWCF funding for acquiring lands to improve recreational access for activities like hunting and fishing. Opposition may stem from concerns about federal land ownership and prioritizing LWCF funds. The LWCF funding is used to enhance public access for recreation, with the Forest Service completing acquisitions to improve access. However, the prioritization of acquisition funding for recreational access may vary among agencies. Congressional focus has been on the level of funds for the stateside program, with some years seeing low support for new grants. Stateside grants are being questioned due to alternative funding sources for parkland, lack of performance measurement, and federal deficits. Supporters argue that the program aids in statewide recreation planning, state leadership in recreation development, and saves money by promoting healthier lifestyles. Some prefer state acquisition of lands with LWCF funds over federal acquisition. Debate surrounds amending the LWCF Act to specify appropriations for the stateside program. The level of discretionary funding for the stateside program is of interest due to increased mandatory funds under GOMESA. Consideration is given to changing how funds are apportioned to states, with the Secretary of the Interior having discretion based on need. The Secretary of the Interior has discretion to apportion funds based on need, with population being a key factor. Congress approved a portion of state grant funds for a competitive grant program since FY2014. There is ongoing interest in the competitiveness of the state grant program and the criteria for any competitive program. Discussions also focus on funding purposes other than federal land acquisition and stateside grants through the LWCF, including maintenance and land protection initiatives. The George W. Bush and Obama Administrations sought LWCF funds for cooperative conservation programs. Some proposals aim to enhance funding for state programs by shifting resources from federal lands. There is debate over using unappropriated funds for broader purposes beyond current authorizations, with concerns about potential reductions in federal land acquisition or state grants."
