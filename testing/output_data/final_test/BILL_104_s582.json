    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Voluntary Environmental Audit Protection Act\" and amends Part VI of title 28, United States Code, by adding a new chapter on \"Voluntary Self-Evaluation Protection.\" The \"Voluntary Environmental Audit Protection Act\" adds a new chapter on \"Voluntary Self-Evaluation Protection\" to Part VI of title 28, United States Code. Section 3801 of the Act states that environmental audit reports prepared in good faith shall not be subject to discovery or admitted into evidence in federal court or agency proceedings, with some exceptions. The \"Voluntary Environmental Audit Protection Act\" prohibits the disclosure of environmental audit reports prepared in good faith, except in certain circumstances. This includes information reported to a regulatory agency, obtained through observation or sampling, or from an independent source. The Act does not apply if the facility owner waives the right to exclude the report or if a Federal court determines otherwise after a hearing. The \"Voluntary Environmental Audit Protection Act\" prohibits disclosure of audit reports showing noncompliance with Federal laws unless efforts for compliance were not promptly pursued. The Federal court conducts a review to determine applicability, and the burden of proof lies with the party seeking protection under the Act. The \"Voluntary Environmental Audit Protection Act\" places the burden of proof on the party invoking protection to demonstrate compliance efforts were promptly initiated. Discovery requests require proof of waiver or fraudulent intent. The Act does not affect other rules on evidence admissibility. The \"Voluntary Environmental Audit Protection Act\" provides protection for individuals or entities conducting environmental audits. It states that those who perform an environmental audit cannot be compelled to testify in a Federal court or administrative proceeding without their consent. Disclosure of information to a Federal or State agency is considered voluntary and subject to protections under the Act. The \"Voluntary Environmental Audit Protection Act\" allows for protection of individuals or entities conducting environmental audits under specific conditions, including prompt disclosure of information and taking action to address identified issues within a reasonable timeframe to achieve compliance with relevant Federal laws. The \"Voluntary Environmental Audit Protection Act\" requires prompt disclosure of information to a Federal agency official, with additional relevant information provided upon request. Involuntary disclosures are not considered voluntary if the disclosing party has a history of repeated violations of environmental laws within the past three years. The \"Voluntary Environmental Audit Protection Act\" mandates prompt disclosure of violations of covered Federal laws to a Federal agency official. There is a presumption of voluntary disclosure if supporting information is provided at the time of disclosure, and immunity from penalties is granted unless the presumption is rebutted. The head of a Federal agency must rebut a presumption established under subsection (c). Failure to do so prohibits the assessment of penalties or issuance of cease and desist orders. A decision by the agency head constitutes final agency action. The Federal agency's decision under this subsection is considered final agency action. This section does not affect a Federal agency's authority to enforce requirements of covered Federal laws related to information disclosed in a voluntary disclosure. Definitions for covered Federal laws are provided in Section 3804. The curr_chunk lists various environmental laws including the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, Oil Pollution Act of 1990, Safe Drinking Water Act, Noise Control Act of 1972, Solid Waste Disposal Act, Clean Air Act, and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980. The curr_chunk defines environmental audit as a voluntary internal assessment of a facility initiated by a person or government entity. It includes regulations issued under various environmental laws and the terms of permits issued under those laws. The curr_chunk defines an environmental audit report as any communication associated with an environmental audit, conducted by employees or consultants to determine compliance with Federal laws. The curr_chunk provides definitions for \"Federal agency\" and \"government entity\" in relation to environmental audits. SEC. 3. APPLICABILITY. This Act and its amendment apply to Federal civil or criminal actions and administrative proceedings initiated after the Act's enactment date."
