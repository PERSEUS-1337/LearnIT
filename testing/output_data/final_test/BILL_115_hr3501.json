    "content": "The \"Family-Owned Business Multiemployer Pension Correction Act of 2017\" allows certain small employers to withdraw from multiemployer plans when establishing a collectively bargained plan. The Act allows covered small employers to apply for eligibility for benefits under subsection (d) of a multiemployer plan within a specified timeframe. The Secretary of the Treasury will establish a program for this purpose, and employers will be notified of their eligibility status within 90 days after the application period ends. Covered small employers can apply for benefits under a multiemployer plan by submitting an application that includes employer's name, plan details, total liabilities, and participant contributions. The application for benefits under a multiemployer plan requires information such as the employer's name, plan details, total liabilities, participant contributions, projected amounts for future plan years, business locations of the employer, number of plan participants at each location, and any other information requested by the Secretary. The Secretary may require additional information from employers for determining eligibility for benefits under subsection (d), with a user fee of $1,000 per business location where plan participants are employed. The Secretary must assess a covered small employer's eligibility for benefits under subsection (d) for a multiemployer plan by ensuring that the aggregate affected plan liabilities do not exceed 1 percent of the total plan liabilities over a 3-year period. Limitation on Withdrawal Liability for covered small employers applying for benefits under subsection (d) with respect to a multiemployer plan. Withdrawal liability under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 applies to employers withdrawing from a multiemployer plan, with the determination treated as under title IV of the Act. This provision does not apply to withdrawals by covered small employers seeking benefits under subsection (d) of the Act. Covered small employers in the retail trade sector, with fewer than 100 plan participants at any location, can withdraw from a multiemployer plan after 3 years from the notice date. The Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 defines a collectively bargained plan as a plan maintained through collective bargaining agreements between employee representatives and employers. The term \"Secretary of the Treasury\" refers to the Secretary of the Treasury (or his delegate) after consulting with the Secretary of Labor and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation."
