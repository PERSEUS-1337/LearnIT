    "content": "The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) was established in 1934 and became part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in 1965. It insures private lenders against losses on home mortgages by paying a claim to the lender if the borrower defaults. FHA charges borrowers premiums for the insurance, making it easier for lower-wealth borrowers or first-time homebuyers to obtain a mortgage with a smaller down payment. The FHA insurance fund, Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, ensures that both borrowers and mortgages meet specific criteria to qualify for FHA insurance. Lenders must be approved by FHA to originate FHA-insured mortgages. The MMI Fund includes both traditional forward home mortgages and reverse mortgages since FY2009. The Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund) primarily receives money from mortgage insurance premiums and sales of foreclosed properties. It pays out claims to lenders when FHA-insured mortgages default and is designed to be self-supporting, maintaining a 2% capital ratio for unexpected losses. The MMI Fund receives funds from mortgage insurance premiums and foreclosed property sales. It maintains a 2% capital ratio to cover unexpected losses. FHA has budget authority to receive funds from the Treasury to cover increases in loan guarantee costs. FHA faces a challenge in balancing mortgage credit provision and MMI Fund health. During the market turmoil starting in 2007, the MMI Fund faced pressure due to mortgage defaults and falling home prices, causing its capital ratio to drop below 2% in FY2009 and turn negative. By FY2014, the ratio became positive again and reached the 2% threshold in FY2015. Concerns arose about the fund's ability to cover future losses, leading to a $1.7 billion infusion from Treasury in FY2013, the first time the fund tapped into this resource. The MMI Fund has not required additional funds from Treasury in recent years. Congress is interested in its financial status and potential need for future funds. This report focuses on the MMI Fund's financial position, including factors affecting its soundness, budgetary treatment, and annual actuarial reviews mandated by Congress. These reviews assess the performance of FHA-insured loans and their impact on the MMI Fund's financial health. The annual actuarial review determines the MMI Fund's capital ratio, while the annual budget process decides if Treasury assistance is needed. Factors affecting the fund include default rates, foreclosure rates, premiums charged by FHA, loan volume, and economic conditions. FHA pays lenders the remaining amount on foreclosed mortgages, known as a claim, resulting in losses to FHA. The number of delinquencies, defaults, and foreclosures on FHA-insured loans impact FHA's total losses. Higher delinquency rates lead to more foreclosures and claims paid out by FHA. Turmoil in the housing and mortgage market also affects FHA's financial status. During the housing and mortgage market turmoil from 2007, delinquency and foreclosure rates on all types of mortgages, including FHA-insured ones, increased. FHA \"serious delinquency\" rates peaked in early 2012 at nearly 10%. As of December 2018, about 4% of FHA-insured loans were seriously delinquent due to factors like unfavorable economic conditions. The housing market turmoil from 2007 led to increases in defaults and foreclosures on FHA-insured loans due to factors like economic conditions and credit quality. However, loan performance improved in 2013 with better economic conditions and credit quality of new loans. Efforts to help borrowers avoid foreclosure, such as mortgage modifications, can impact default and foreclosure rates. FHA data shows that loans insured since 2009 have performed better than those before 2009. Loss mitigation actions aim to reduce losses for the MMI Fund when borrowers with FHA-insured loans default. Options like loan forbearance or modifications can help borrowers keep their homes, while short sales and deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure can prevent foreclosure. FHA provides incentives and partial insurance claim payments to lenders for these actions, which are generally less costly than paying a claim after a foreclosure. Loss mitigation actions aim to reduce losses for the MMI Fund when borrowers with FHA-insured loans default. If a borrower defaults again in the future, FHA may end up paying the full claim amount. FHA can recoup some of the claim amount by selling the property, but usually recoups less than the claim amount. The loss severity rate is the amount of money FHA loses on a claim as a share of the outstanding loan balance. The loss severity rate for FHA, which is the amount lost on a claim as a share of the outstanding loan balance, was about 41% in the fourth quarter of FY2018. This rate has improved over the years due to the increased use of alternative methods for selling foreclosed properties. The loss severity rate for FHA has improved over time, affected by factors like home prices and mortgage characteristics. FHA charges fees to cover claims from the MMI Fund, with revenue depending on premiums charged and outstanding mortgages. FHA has raised and lowered annual premiums multiple times to balance revenue and risk coverage. Lower premiums attract more borrowers but may reduce overall mortgage quality. FHA's current premiums are lower than in 2010 but higher than before the housing market turmoil. The current FHA premiums are lower than any time since October 2010 but higher than before that date. The number and dollar volume of insured loans affect FHA's economic stability. Economic and housing market conditions impact FHA's financial position by influencing default and foreclosure rates. If house prices fall, more people may face default or foreclosure, limiting FHA's ability to recoup losses. Projections of future economic conditions, including house prices and interest rates, are crucial for evaluating the health of the MMI Fund and estimating FHA-insured mortgage performance. Interest rates impact home purchase activity and refinancing decisions, affecting premium revenue for FHA. The financial impact of borrowers refinancing FHA-insured mortgages into non-FHA mortgages includes reduced premium revenue for FHA but also decreases liabilities for future claims. Accuracy of assumptions about economic conditions affects estimates of the MMI Fund's financial position. FHA-insured mortgages are accounted for in the federal budget at the time of insurance and in subsequent years, discussing potential need for appropriations to cover new insurance costs. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) governs the recording of costs for federal loan guarantees, including FHA-insured loans, in the federal budget. The FCRA requires the estimated lifetime cost of guaranteed loans to be recorded in the budget in the year they are insured, using a credit subsidy rate. This rate multiplied by the total loan volume insured in a year determines the total budgeted amount. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) governs the recording of costs for federal loan guarantees, including FHA-insured loans. The credit subsidy rate is estimated each year to determine the total amount of credit subsidy for the loans. Positive rates require appropriations, while negative rates generate offsetting receipts. This can offset other costs in the HUD budget. The credit subsidy rate for FHA-insured loans is estimated annually based on factors like mortgage insurance premium revenue, future insurance claims, and property sales projections. These estimates rely on assumptions about loan credit quality and economic conditions. FHA's single-family mortgages have consistently been projected to have negative credit subsidy, meaning they are expected to generate revenue for the government over the loan's lifespan. The credit subsidy rate for FHA-insured loans is projected to generate revenue for the government over the life of the loans. The estimates depend on factors like mortgage insurance premium revenue and future insurance claims. The total earnings for FHA on insured loans in a year are determined by the total loan amount and the credit subsidy rate. If the single-family program ever has a positive credit subsidy rate, it would require an appropriation to cover the shortfall. The FHA's credit subsidy rate is crucial for insuring new loans, with a negative rate projected for FY2019. The President's budget estimated a negative 3.20% rate, generating $7.4 billion in revenue for the MMI Fund. CBO provides its own credit subsidy estimates for appropriations. If the subsidy rate turns positive, funding would be needed to cover the shortfall. For FY2019, CBO estimated that FHA's single-family programs would generate about $6.9 billion in negative credit subsidy due to lower estimates of credit subsidy rate and loan volume. Actual loan performance may differ from initial estimates, leading to potential increased costs covered by federal credit reform accounting. The OMB and FHA re-estimate credit subsidy rates based on loan performance and economic factors. Recent estimates show positive subsidy rates, indicating FHA may pay out more than it earns on loans. Original estimates were negative, suggesting loans would make money for the government. The re-estimated credit subsidy rates for loans insured in recent years have become less favorable, with many still negative. This suggests that while the loans will still make money for the government, it will be less than originally estimated. However, loans insured between FY2000 and FY2009 are currently expected to lose money overall. The re-estimated credit subsidy rates for recent years show that some loans will make less money than originally estimated, while others will make more. The MMI Fund consists of the Financing Account and the Capital Reserve Account, with funds transferred between them based on the re-estimated rates to cover expected losses on FHA-insured loans. The MMI Fund consists of the Financing Account and the Capital Reserve Account, with funds transferred between them based on re-estimated credit subsidy rates to cover expected losses on FHA-insured loans. Table 2 shows changes in account balances between FY2008 and FY2018, with large transfers of funds from the Capital Reserve Account to the Financing Account due to aggregate increases in expected losses on loans after the housing market turmoil in 2007. The MMI Fund held $9 billion in the Financing Account and $19.3 billion in the Capital Reserve Account in FY2008. The Capital Reserve Account reached zero by the end of FY2013 but increased to $27.2 billion by the end of FY2018. Despite the increase in reserves, the total volume of insured mortgages by FHA also rose from $400 billion in FY2008 to $1.3 trillion in FY2018. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 allows for indefinite budget authority to cover loan guarantee program costs. If needed, FHA can draw funds from Treasury to cover losses on insured loans without congressional approval. Funds drawn are held in the Financing Account and used to pay claims only if necessary. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 allows FHA to draw funds from Treasury to cover losses on insured loans without congressional approval. The President's budget request for FY2014 included an estimate that the MMI Fund would need a mandatory appropriation of $943 million from Treasury during FY2013. If future insured loans do not bring in enough funds to cover losses on past loans, funds received from Treasury could eventually be spent to pay actual claims. In FY2013, the MMI Fund needed $1.7 billion from Treasury to cover expected losses on insured loans, nearly double the amount anticipated in the President's budget. This was the first time FHA required funds from Treasury to transfer money from the Capital Reserve Account to the Financing Account. FHA has not needed additional funds from Treasury since then. The FHA is required by law to conduct an annual independent actuarial review of the MMI Fund's financial position and report the results to Congress. This review assesses the fund's current funds, future earnings or losses on insured loans, and computes the economic value of the MMI Fund. The results are included in FHA's annual report on the fund's financial status. The annual actuarial review of the MMI Fund assesses the fund's financial position and estimates its current financial status, including forward and reverse mortgages. The review is separate from the federal budget process and uses different economic assumptions. The results of the FY2018 review were released in November 2018. The annual actuarial review of the MMI Fund assesses its financial position, including forward and reverse mortgages. It reports the current funds on hand, estimates future cash flows, and projects financial status under different economic scenarios. Key terms in the report include capital resources and present value of future cash flows on outstanding business. The economic value of the MMI Fund is the estimated gain or loss in present value terms on currently insured loans. It represents the capital resources plus future cash flows. FHA must meet a 2% capital ratio requirement based on the total dollar volume of mortgages insured. The capital ratio of FHA fell below 2% in FY2009, turning negative in FY2012 and FY2013. It was positive again in FY2014 and exceeded 2% in FY2015 onwards. The FY2018 annual report showed total capital resources of $49.2 billion, with estimated future cash flows on insured loans at negative $14.4 billion. The economic value of the MMI Fund, estimated by FHA to be approximately $34.9 billion, includes both forward and reverse mortgages. An independent actuary also confirmed the reasonableness of this estimate. This value represents an increase of about $8.1 billion compared to FY2017. The MMI Fund's economic value was estimated at negative $1.3 billion in FY2013, indicating a shortfall in funds to cover future claims on insured loans. However, in FY2018, the economic value improved to positive $34.9 billion, providing a cushion for potential future losses on insured mortgages. The actuarial report and annual report to Congress rely on assumptions about future economic conditions and the FHA's continued insurance of mortgages. While the MMI Fund's economic value is estimated at positive $34.9 billion in FY2018, alternative economic scenarios could result in different values, potentially even negative. The MMI Fund's economic value could vary, potentially being negative in severe economic scenarios. The fund must maintain a 2% capital ratio as required by law since 1990 due to concerns about solvency. At that time, the MMI Fund had a negative economic value, indicating insufficient funds to cover future claims on FHA-insured loans. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 mandated that the MMI Fund must maintain a 2% capital ratio to ensure it can cover future claims on FHA-insured loans. This requirement was put in place due to concerns about the fund's solvency. Additionally, the law directed FHA to make changes to improve the MMI Fund's financial condition, including charging borrowers an annual mortgage insurance premium. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 mandated a 2% capital ratio for the MMI Fund to cover future claims on FHA-insured loans. Changes included an annual mortgage insurance premium for borrowers and suspending certain payments. Congress debated the capital ratio requirement, balancing FHA's financial stability with its goal of providing affordable mortgage credit. The 2% capital ratio requirement for the MMI Fund was set to provide a cushion for unexpected losses without burdening future FHA-insured borrowers. A higher ratio would have led to increased insurance premiums. The adequacy of the reserve level was debated, with concerns about withstanding catastrophic economic downturns. In a study conducted by Price Waterhouse for fiscal year 1989, researchers found that actuarial soundness would require a reserve able to withstand adverse economic conditions, but not catastrophic ones. The Treasury implicitly covers catastrophic risk, while rating agencies expect private mortgage insurers to have enough capital for catastrophic events. Requiring FHA to hold capital equivalent to private insurers could hinder its public purpose. The law mandates a 2% capital ratio for the MMI Fund, but lacks specific consequences if the ratio falls below. The 2% requirement does not consider specific economic conditions the MMI Fund may face. The 2% capital ratio requirement for the MMI Fund does not account for specific economic conditions it may face. Congress could enact legislation to specify these conditions and require FHA to maintain a capital ratio based on the Fund's ability to withstand them. The actuarial review and capital ratio estimate provide important financial information, but do not determine if FHA will need to draw on its budget authority with Treasury for future losses or claims. This determination is part of the annual federal budgeting process. In FY2018, the MMI Fund's capital ratio was estimated at 2.76%, with an economic value of $34.9 billion. This marked an increase from FY2017's 2.18% ratio, remaining above 2% for the fourth consecutive year. In FY2009, the ratio fell to 0.53%, the first time it dropped below 2% since FY1995. The capital ratio fell below 2% from FY2009 through FY2014, reaching 0.41% in FY2014. In FY2012 and FY2013, the ratio was negative. This was the first time since the early 1990s that the MMI Fund had a negative capital ratio. A negative ratio does not automatically trigger assistance from Treasury, but it may indicate a need for future assistance based on credit subsidy rate re-estimates. The Annual Credit Subsidy Rate Re-estimates section reveals that FHA needs to transfer more funds from its Capital Reserve Account to cover future losses. Assistance from Treasury is based on credit subsidy rate re-estimates, not the capital ratio or economic value of the MMI Fund. The drop in the capital ratio post-2008 is due to a decrease in economic value and an increase in the volume of insured mortgages. The FHA is insuring a greater volume of loans, leading to a decrease in the MMI Fund's economic value. This is mainly due to the negative present value of future cash flows, indicating expected net cash outflows. Current issues include the inclusion of reverse mortgages in the MMI Fund, debates over premium levels for FHA-insured mortgages, and trends in FHA-insured mortgage characteristics highlighted in the FY2018 annual report. HECMs, or FHA-insured reverse mortgages, were moved into the MMI Fund in FY2009. These are for elderly homeowners accessing home equity. HECMs insured after FY2009 are under the MMI Fund, with a smaller dollar amount compared to traditional mortgages. Changes in HECM value impact the MMI Fund's economic value and capital ratio, sensitive to economic assumptions like house prices and interest rates. The value of HECMs in the MMI Fund has been volatile, fluctuating between negative and positive values. The standalone capital ratio for HECMs ranged from a high of 3.07% in FY2013 to a low of -18.83% in FY2018, while the overall MMI Fund's capital ratio in FY2018 was 2.76%. The volatility of HECMs in the MMI Fund raises policy questions about assessing the financial health of separate programs. FHA noted in its FY2015 report that including both HECMs and forward mortgages in the fund could complicate independent assessments, as the capital ratio for the entire MMI Fund is often used as a proxy for the larger forward mortgage portfolio's performance. Some industry groups and observers suggest removing HECMs from the MMI Fund to avoid impacting forward mortgage policies. However, GAO notes that this move would have tradeoffs as FHA's mortgage insurance premiums are a significant revenue source for the fund, with varying impacts on its financial status. Setting appropriate levels for mortgage insurance premiums is crucial for the FHA to balance affordability of FHA-insured mortgages and managing risk to the insurance fund. In response to the housing market turmoil post-2007, FHA increased premiums multiple times, mainly affecting annual premiums. However, in January 2015, FHA decreased annual mortgage insurance premiums. This adjustment aims to bring more money into the MMI Fund while avoiding potential negative impacts on FHA's finances, loan volume, and credit quality. The FHA decreased annual mortgage insurance premiums in January 2015 to bring more money into the MMI Fund. Despite calls to further reduce premiums, FHA has indicated it is unlikely to do so in the near future. In January 2017, FHA planned to decrease annual mortgage insurance premiums for new FHA-insured mortgages, but the reduction was suspended by the Trump Administration. FHA cited the need for further study on the impact of the fee decrease on the insurance fund's financial viability. The FY2017 annual report estimated that the capital ratio for the MMI Fund would have been below the mandated level if the premium decrease had gone into effect. The estimated decrease of $3.2 billion in the net present value of future cash flows on insured mortgages and an estimated increase of $45 billion in FHA's insurance-in-force would have impacted the economic net worth and capital ratio for the forward mortgage portfolio. Despite this, the capital ratio for forward mortgages alone would have remained above 2% if the premium decrease had been implemented. The estimated impact of a premium decrease on the forward mortgage portfolio would have affected the capital ratio, but the overall capital ratio for the MMI Fund is the key factor for compliance with the law. FHA's FY2018 report highlighted trends in credit quality, including concerns about cash-out refinances. The share of cash-out refinances insured by FHA has been increasing in recent years, reaching 63% of all FHA-insured refinance mortgages and 15% of all FHA-insured forward mortgages in FY2018. Rising home prices and low interest rates are contributing factors. However, cash-out refinances pose a risk to FHA by increasing borrowers' leverage and reducing their home equity, potentially leading to issues if home prices fall in the future. The average debt-to-income ratio for new FHA-insured purchase borrowers has been increasing, reaching about 43% in FY2018. Additionally, the share of borrowers with debt-to-income ratios above 50% has been rising, posing a risk for mortgage repayment. Furthermore, the average credit scores for FHA-insured borrowers have been decreasing since FY2011, with the average score in FY2018 at 670. In FY2018, the average credit score for new FHA-insured mortgages was 670, reflecting a return to traditional market roles. FHA is monitoring declining credit scores and increasing use of down payment assistance for potential risks to the MMIF. In FY2018, 38% of FHA-insured purchase mortgages included some form of down payment assistance, with a higher default rate. FHA is concerned about certain governmental down payment assistance programs and may provide more clarity on allowed assistance types. Nonbank mortgage originations for FHA-insured mortgages have been increasing in recent years. Nonbank lenders are increasingly originating FHA-insured mortgages, accounting for nearly 87% in FY2018. FHA recognizes the need to balance its business with both nonbank and depository lenders. Various factors such as economic conditions and mortgage credit availability drive this trend, posing different risks to FHA. The impact on FHA loan performance and finances will vary depending on these factors."
