The U.S. has struggled to increase pit production despite the Department of Defense's requirement to produce 50-80 pits per year by 2030. The U.S. is aiming to produce 50-80 plutonium pits per year by 2030. Life extension programs are in progress for existing weapon types, using original pits, retired pits, or newly manufactured pits. There is debate on the need for additional pit manufacturing capacity, with some arguing for more than 80 pits per year. The focus is on achieving a capacity of 80 pits per year. The report summarizes U.S. Nuclear Weapon \"Pit\" Production Options for Congress, focusing on pit production involving shaping plutonium at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Key terms include Material At Risk (MAR) and Hazard Category (HC) for understanding production options. The Hazard Category (HC) system categorizes buildings based on the amount of radioactive material they are designed to hold, with the lower limit for radioactive material in a building being about 26 grams of weapons-grade plutonium (WGPu). Buildings with less material are considered Radiological Facilities and require no special security measures. The Security Category (SC) system categorizes buildings based on the amount and form of radioactive material, determining the level of security needed based on the attractiveness of the materials, especially to terrorists. The Security Category system categorizes buildings based on the attractiveness of materials to terrorists. For example, WGPu in metallic form requires high security measures, while WGPu dissolved in acid requires less security. Analytical Chemistry analyzes plutonium samples to determine isotopic composition and impurities. Plutonium-238 is highly radioactive and used to power space probes. Pu-238 is highly radioactive and mainly used to power space probes. It occupies a significant portion of PF-4 and accounts for a large part of its MAR allowance. PF-4 is crucial for pit production due to its high security and equipment. Increasing capacity would require more equipment and MAR, with the option to move Pu-238 work to another site. One option is to build modules at LANL for high-MAR work like processing Pu-238 or casting pits. Preliminary plans propose buried reinforced-concrete modules with 3,000 to 5,000 sf of lab space near PF-4, connected by a tunnel. Modules would be built for specific tasks, meeting regulatory requirements efficiently. They would utilize support features of the main building, potentially reducing costs and construction time compared to larger facilities. This approach could extend the life of PF-4 by reducing its MAR allowance over time. The potential construction of buried reinforced-concrete modules near PF-4 is being considered to meet regulatory requirements efficiently. Arguments against the modules include concerns about cost estimates, the need for additional infrastructure, and the possibility of extending PF-4's service life instead. Congress could have confidence in cost estimates for modules by using existing buildings in the nuclear weapons complex. Buildings at Idaho National Laboratory and Savannah River Site have unused space suitable for high-MAR work, with Building CPP-1634 at INL and H Canyon and HB-Line at SRS being potential options. A 2013 DOE study found that both sites could be used for this purpose at a cost between $122 million and $272 million. There are two sources of demand for AC capacity, with CMR doing most AC for pit production but scheduled to halt. CMR, built in 1952, does most AC for pit production but will halt operations around 2019. Higher capacity requires more AC, with PF-4 not suitable for most AC work. Finding additional sites for AC is necessary for increased pit production. SRS has facilities suitable for AC, while LLNL's Building 332 used to handle large quantities of WGPu. NNSA directed LLNL to remove most plutonium from Building 332 in 2012, reducing security costs and vulnerability to theft. The building has space for AC work for 80 ppy, but analysts argue against performing all AC at a site other than LANL, which is the \"center of excellence\" for plutonium and requires AC for pit production. LANL would need significant AC capacity for quick-turnaround analyses and problem-solving. LANL requires significant AC capacity for quick-turnaround analyses, problem-solving, and pit production. PF-4 can perform some AC but is unsuitable for large-scale AC due to ventilation limitations and space constraints. Retrofitting PF-4 for large-scale AC would be costly and inefficient use of space. Another option is to use an existing building at LANL for AC work. One option is to use the Radiological Laboratory-Utility-Office Building (RLUOB) at LANL for AC work with 26 grams of WGPu, the maximum allowed amount. However, this amount is insufficient for large-scale AC, which would require an estimated 500 to 1,000 grams of plutonium. The floor space needed for this larger AC operation has not been determined, but it is estimated that all laboratory space in RLUOB could accommodate the required amount of plutonium. LANL estimates that converting RLUOB to an HC-3 building to hold 1,750 grams of WGPu would cost between $15 million and $50 million. An exemption could allow RLUOB to hold HC-3 quantities of plutonium without conversion. This approach could help NNSA stop work in CMR by 2019, reducing the risk of collapse from an earthquake. LANL calculated that the radiation dose from a collapse with 1,000 grams of WGPu would be below DOE standards. Some may object to modifying regulations. This report raises questions for Congress to consider regarding the need for an 80-ppy capacity, space and MAR requirements for fabrication, repurposing PF-4 space, MAR allowance, costs, Pu-238 options, module necessity, and other preferable options. The FY2014 National Defense Authorization Act allows NNSA to build two modules for Pu-238 production. One module could free up space in PF-4 for fabricating 80 ppy. Questions include the cost of modules, space and MAR requirements, pros and cons of using SRS or LLNL for some activities, and the cost of converting RLUOB to HC-3."
