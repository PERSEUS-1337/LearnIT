The text discusses the prevention of money laundering for weapons of mass destruction and the codification of sanctions against Iran. The text codifies sanctions against Iran imposed by previous executive orders, allowing the President to terminate them with advance notice to Congress. The text outlines that the Act does not affect existing sanctions related to Iran's support for international terrorism. It also introduces amendments to the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996, including provisions on multilateral regimes and waivers.

Additionally, a new subsection on investigations is added to the Act. The President can initiate investigations into imposing sanctions on individuals engaged in investment activity in Iran. Within 180 days of initiation, a determination must be made and reported to congressional committees. The Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 is amended to impose sanctions on the development of petroleum resources and weapons of mass destruction in Iran. The President must impose sanctions if a person provides goods or services to Iran that contribute to its development of weapons of mass destruction or advanced conventional weapons. The sanctions apply to actions taken after June 6, 2006. SEC. 203. TERMINATION OF SANCTIONS. Section 8(a) of the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 is amended to state that a person poses no significant threat to United States national security, interests, or allies. SEC. 204. SUNSET.

The Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 is now referred to as the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996. The policy of the United States is to support democracy in Iran and human rights, without authorizing the use of force. Assistance is provided to support democracy in Iran. The President is authorized to provide financial and political assistance to individuals, organizations, and entities supporting democracy in Iran, including grants for pro-democracy broadcasting. Funds cannot be used to support the use of force against Iran. Assistance should only be given to eligible recipients. The organization I22 opposes violence and terrorism, advocates for nonproliferation, supports democratic values, human rights, equality, and freedom of the press, speech, association, and religion. The President may provide assistance using funds from various initiatives and authorization of appropriations. Notification to relevant committees is required before each obligation of assistance. Congress supports diplomatic assistance efforts. The United States should express support for a transition to democracy in Iran, endorse indigenous efforts for democratic elections, and highlight human rights violations by the Iranian government. Assistance under this section expires on December 31, 2011, and the Secretary of State is authorized to appropriate necessary funds. The policy aims to facilitate nuclear nonproliferation in Iran, as stated in the Sense of Congress. Sense of Congress: The US should not enter into cooperation agreements with countries aiding Iran's nuclear program or transferring advanced weapons to Iran unless Iran suspends enrichment activities and commits to refraining from them in the future, or the assisting country meets certain conditions. The government of a country has suspended nuclear assistance and transfers of weapons to Iran until Iran implements measures allowing the President to make a determination. The term \"agreement for cooperation\" is defined in this section. Assisting the nuclear program of Iran refers to the intentional transfer of goods, services, or technology to Iran listed on specific guidelines. The text discusses the definition of transferring advanced conventional weapons or missiles to Iran and amends a section related to the prevention of money laundering for weapons of mass destruction. The text amends a section related to the prevention of money laundering for weapons of mass destruction by including activities by organized criminal groups, international terrorists, or entities involved in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or missiles."
