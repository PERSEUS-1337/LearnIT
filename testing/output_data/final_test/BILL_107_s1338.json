The Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument was created due to key events including a historic battle in 1876 between the US Seventh Cavalry and Native American tribes, official recognition as a national cemetery in 1879, and the establishment of its boundary in 1886. The Reno-Benteen Battlefield was acquired by an Act of Congress in 1926, transferring management to the National Park Service in 1940. The Crow tribe's rights were granted to the United States in 1930, and a historical museum was authorized in 1939. The Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument, previously known as Custer Battlefield National Monument, was redesignated in 1991. The Monument covers 765.34 acres, including the cemetery and the Reno-Benteen Battlefield. Other historical sites related to the 1876 battle are located outside the Monument's boundaries. The United States tradition of preserving historic battle sites within the boundaries of the Monument is important for honoring sacrifices and understanding our past. Increased commercial development around the Monument threatens the visitor experience and the historical integrity of the area. The Battle of the Little Bighorn site at the Monument is of lasting significance for the United States and sovereign Indian nations. To preserve this historical treasure, additional lands surrounding the Monument need protected status or be included in the Monument itself. All areas of historical interest are within the Crow Indian Reservation boundaries. The purpose of this Act is to establish a cooperative process for expanding and enhancing the Monument, ensuring that it reflects the concerns of Indian tribes and protects the resources within the Monument through partnerships with the Crow tribe. Additional land and facilities can be included through voluntary conveyance or donation. The Act aims to establish partnerships between the Crow Tribe, National Park Service, and Native American Tribes involved in the Battle of Little Bighorn, as well as encourage private donations of land and facilities to the Monument. SEC. 3. Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument Enhancement Committee. The \"Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument Enhancement Committee\" is established with members appointed by the Secretary of Interior and Native American tribes involved in the Battle of Little Bighorn. The Committee requires three members for a quorum and decisions are made by a majority vote. The Committee meets regularly with a quorum present, publishes meeting notices and agendas in local newspapers, and ensures public involvement. It advises the Secretary on the Monument's historical and artistic sensitivity. The Secretary can provide technical staff support upon the Committee's request. The Committee, appointed by the National Park Service, serves without compensation but can claim travel expenses. The Committee maintains a registry of potential land and facilities for inclusion in the Monument and decides on their inclusion by majority vote. Waiver of certain provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act applies to the Committee. The Committee, appointed by the National Park Service, maintains a registry of potential land and facilities for inclusion in the Monument. They provide recommendations to the Secretary on the suitability of the land or facility for inclusion, advising on acquisition terms or the use of the Fund. SEC. 4. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\nThis act does not limit the jurisdiction of the Crow Indian tribe.\n\nSEC. 5. ESTABLISHMENT OF FUND.\n\nA fund called the \"Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument Enhancement Fund\" is created in the Treasury of the United States. The Fund will be used as outlined in section 3(d)(3)(B) and will consist of appropriated and donated amounts."
