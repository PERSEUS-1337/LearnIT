    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Promoting Closed-Loop Pumped Storage Hydropower Act\" and it amends the Federal Power Act to include provisions for closed-loop pumped storage projects. The Federal Power Act has been amended to allow for an expedited licensing process for closed-loop pumped storage projects. The Commission may issue licenses and permits for these projects, and a rule establishing an expedited process must be issued within 180 days. An interagency task force will be convened to coordinate regulatory processes with relevant agencies and tribes. The Federal Power Act has been amended to expedite the licensing process for closed-loop pumped storage projects. The Commission must assess dam safety before issuing any license and may grant exemptions from other requirements during the expedited process. The Commission may grant exemptions from certain requirements for closed-loop pumped storage projects, consulting with relevant agencies and including specific terms and conditions in the exemption. The Commission may grant exemptions for closed-loop pumped storage projects, with specific terms and conditions determined by relevant agencies to prevent harm to fish and wildlife resources. Fees for these exemptions will be established by the Commission. The Commission shall establish fees to be paid by applicants for a license for closed-loop pumped storage projects to reimburse fish and wildlife agencies for costs incurred in studies and reviews. These fees will be transferred to the agencies for conducting studies and will remain available until expended. The Commission may add joint permittees and transfer a license to nonmunicipal entities for closed-loop pumped storage projects. Interagency cooperation is required for environmental documents under the National Environmental Policy Act. The Commission will hold a workshop to explore developing closed-loop pumped storage projects at abandoned mine sites and issue guidance for applicants within specified timeframes. Interagency communications related to licensing coordination will not be considered ex parte communications or prevent agencies from participating in licensing proceedings. The Commission will establish criteria for closed-loop pumped storage projects to qualify for expedited process, including minimal impact on water flows and endangered species. SEC. 3. OBLIGATION FOR PAYMENT OF ANNUAL CHARGES: An amendment to the Federal Power Act states that a licensee's obligation to pay annual charges begins when construction of the facility starts."
