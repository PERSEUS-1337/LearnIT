    "content": "State measures denying driver's licenses and IDs to unlawfully present aliens are often challenged for violating the Equal Protection and Supremacy Clauses of the U.S. Constitution. The Equal Protection Clause prohibits states from treating aliens differently than citizens, potentially leading to legal challenges. The level of scrutiny applied by courts in reviewing measures that classify on the basis of alienage determines whether the measure is upheld or struck down. \"Rational basis review\" requires the measure to be a rational means of promoting a legitimate government objective, while \"strict scrutiny\" demands that the measure is necessary to achieve a compelling interest and narrowly tailored for that purpose. Other tests between these two extremes may be applied based on the persons or rights affected by the measure. Federal classifications based on alienage are subject to rational basis review due to Congress's plenary power over immigration. State and local measures, on the other hand, are generally subject to strict scrutiny unless they involve \"political and governmental functions.\" The Supreme Court applies strict scrutiny to state or local measures treating aliens differently than citizens, except for restrictions on \"political and governmental functions\" or if Congress has set standards for an alien subclass. In Plyler v. Doe, the Court used intermediate scrutiny to strike down a Texas law denying education to undocumented children. The heightened level of scrutiny in Plyler reflects the case involving a law depriving minor children of a basic education, not generally applicable to classifications affecting unlawfully present aliens. The Supreme Court recognizes a fundamental right to interstate travel, with restrictions on driving not necessarily constituting a deprivation of this right. The ability to obtain a driver's license is not a fundamental right, and the doctrine of preemption stems from the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. One essential aspect of the federal structure of government is that states can be precluded from taking actions within their authority if federal law would be thwarted. The Constitution entrusts Congress with the power to regulate immigration, preempting state or local measures that purport to regulate immigration. Federal statutes may also preempt other measures affecting aliens, depending on congressional enactments. Federal statutes may preempt state and local measures in three ways: express preemption, field preemption, or conflict preemption. States regulating driver's licenses may have a presumption against preemption. The REAL ID Act of 2005 established new minimum standards for state driver's licenses to be accepted by federal agencies for official purposes, requiring valid documentary evidence of legal status from applicants falling under specific categories. The REAL ID Act of 2005 set standards for state driver's licenses, requiring valid proof of legal status from applicants falling under specific categories such as citizens, permanent residents, refugees, and those with approved asylum or visa status. The REAL ID Act of 2005 established standards for state driver's licenses, requiring proof of legal status from applicants falling under specific categories. States can issue temporary licenses or IDs to those who provide documentation, with expiration based on authorized stay in the US. The initial compliance deadline was May 11, 2008, with possible extensions granted by the Secretary of DHS. The REAL ID Act of 2005 set standards for state driver's licenses, requiring proof of legal status. States can issue temporary licenses to those who provide documentation, with expiration based on authorized stay in the US. DHS announced a phased enforcement plan for noncompliant states and territories. The PRWORA of 1996 bars state and local governments from providing benefits to unlawfully present aliens. The PRWORA of 1996 prohibits state and local governments from providing benefits to unlawfully present aliens, unless specific legislation is enacted to allow for eligibility. This includes various types of benefits such as grants, contracts, loans, licenses, and assistance programs. Additionally, the law requires states to record applicants' Social Security numbers, which unlawfully present aliens generally cannot obtain. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 extended the requirement for Social Security numbers on driver's licenses to all licenses. States are mandated to have procedures for individuals to provide any Social Security Number they may have when applying for licenses. Provisions in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 aimed to bar federal agencies from accepting licenses without a readable Social Security number but were repealed in 1999. Several states have adopted measures that bar unlawfully present aliens from obtaining driver's licenses and state-issued IDs. Legal challenges have been brought against these measures, arguing that they violate the Equal Protection Clause by restricting interstate travel and creating distinctions between aliens and citizens. Legal challenges have been brought against state measures denying driver's licenses to unlawfully present aliens, claiming violations of the Equal Protection Clause. Courts have generally rejected these challenges, ruling that such measures are subject to rational basis review. Courts have rejected challenges to state measures denying driver's licenses to unlawfully present aliens, ruling that restrictions on travel do not violate the fundamental right to interstate travel. Some argue that denying licenses marginalizes unlawfully present aliens socioeconomically. Courts have rejected arguments that denying driver's licenses to unlawfully present aliens marginalizes them socioeconomically, citing the harm caused by the denial of a basic education as more significant. Various legitimate government interests are served by barring the issuance of driver's licenses to unlawfully present aliens, including preventing the concealment of illegal aliens and preserving resources. The State of Arizona was recently enjoined from denying driver's licenses to aliens without legal status who have been granted deferred action and employment authorization documents by the federal government. This decision was based on the grounds that the state's distinction between these aliens and others granted relief from removal cannot withstand rational basis review. The executive branch grants deferred action to unlawfully present aliens not a priority for removal, allowing them work authorization. Resistance arose with the DACA initiative granting deferred action to certain aliens brought to the US as children. The executive order tasked state agencies with preventing DACA beneficiaries from accessing certain taxpayer-funded benefits and state identification, leading to a distinction in driver's license issuance. The Ninth Circuit found the state's justifications for this distinction to be illegitimate. The state's justifications for denying driver's licenses to DACA beneficiaries have been questioned by state courts in Nebraska. Federal court decisions in Arizona and Nebraska are limited to specific cases and do not mean that all state measures barring licenses for unlawfully present aliens violate the Equal Protection Clause. A measure that denies licenses without distinguishing between categories of aliens may be treated differently by the courts. The courts have generally rejected the view that state measures denying driver's licenses to unlawfully present aliens constitute an impermissible regulation of immigration. In challenges to these restrictions, plaintiffs argue that they seek to exclude aliens from the community and determine who should be admitted into the country. For example, in 2011, the U.S. Department of Justice challenged Alabama's provisions that barred unlawfully present aliens from obtaining driver's licenses. Alabama's law denying driver's licenses to unlawfully present aliens has been challenged in court, with arguments that it excludes them from the US. However, courts have generally viewed these restrictions as local matters rather than regulating immigration. Some courts have even seen the state measures as aligning with federal objectives. State measures denying driver's licenses to unlawfully present aliens may be preempted as regulations of immigration if they establish their own classifications for aliens or have state officials determine aliens' status independently from federal authorities. Some argue that these measures are preempted by federal statutes, but courts have generally viewed them as local matters aligning with federal objectives. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit rejected the DOJ's preemption arguments against Alabama's H.B. 56, which denied driver's licenses to aliens not lawfully present in the U.S. The court found that these provisions were not facially preempted by federal law, including the REAL ID Act, which encourages states to require evidence of lawful status for driver's licenses. The Eleventh Circuit court rejected the argument that Alabama's H.B. 56 is inconsistent with federal law, noting a possible tension between state and federal statutes regarding driver's licenses for aliens. The court believed the Alabama law could be interpreted to avoid conflicts, and any issues could be addressed in an as-applied challenge. The court also dismissed the argument that the statute criminalizes conduct not penalized under federal law as hypothetical, as Alabama has chosen not to provide licenses to unlawfully present aliens. The Eleventh Circuit interpreted the REAL ID Act as not regulating driver's licenses for unlawfully present aliens, allowing states to adopt different policies on the subject. Some states permit unlawfully present aliens to obtain visually distinguishable licenses, while others issue licenses that resemble those for citizens and lawful nonimmigrants. Some suggest state measures restricting driver's licenses for U.S. citizens and lawful immigrants may be preempted by federal law, but no judicial rulings have been made on this issue due to standing limitations. The REAL ID Act allows states to issue licenses not recognized by federal agencies, and PRWORA permits certain restrictions on licenses. The REAL ID Act allows states to issue licenses not recognized by federal agencies, and PRWORA permits certain restrictions on licenses. Some commentators argue that state measures granting driver's licenses to unlawfully present aliens may be preempted by federal law as it legitimizes their presence in the US, integrating them into the community. The issuance of driver's licenses to unlawfully present aliens may not be considered a regulation of immigration according to court findings. The REAL ID Act will restrict federal recognition of state-issued IDs for unlawfully present aliens. The REAL ID Act does not prohibit states from issuing driver's licenses to unlawfully present aliens, as it primarily focuses on federal agencies accepting IDs that meet certain standards. Arguments that the act preempts states from issuing IDs to unlawfully present aliens are difficult to maintain, as no court has ruled in favor of such claims. The REAL ID Act does not prevent states from issuing driver's licenses to unlawfully present aliens. States are not preempted from issuing IDs that do not meet the act's minimum standards, as long as they clearly indicate on the ID that it may not be accepted for federal identification or official purposes. The REAL ID Act does not prevent states from issuing driver's licenses to unlawfully present aliens. States can issue IDs that do not comply with the act's standards, but they must clearly indicate that they are not for federal identification or official use. There is debate about whether granting licenses to unlawfully present aliens is preempted by PRWORA, but it is unlikely given the law's provisions allowing states to provide benefits to this population. The PRWORA's definition of state and local public benefits is unclear regarding the issuance of driver's licenses to unlawfully present aliens. Driver's licenses may not be considered public benefits under PRWORA's definition, which includes various forms of assistance provided by state or local governments. Driver's licenses may not be considered state and local public benefits under PRWORA's definition as they do not entail payments or assistance to individuals. Courts have generally interpreted assistance to refer only to services that directly assist unlawfully present aliens. PRWORA does not consider driver's licenses as public benefits for unlawfully present aliens. States can still grant benefits to them through legislation. Some states issue \"Certificates for Driving\" or \"Driving Privilege Cards\" instead of driver's licenses to promote traffic safety. Utah, for example, issues Driving Privilege Cards to those who cannot provide necessary evidence. Some states issue Driving Privilege Cards (DPCs) to individuals without lawful presence in the US for driving purposes only, not for identification. This has raised concerns about the limitations of DPCs for everyday transactions and the stigma associated with not having a regular driver's license. Some states issue Driving Privilege Cards (DPCs) to individuals without lawful presence in the US for driving purposes only. Despite arguments that unlawfully present aliens should be granted driver's licenses like citizens and LPRs, a federal court upheld a Tennessee measure allowing CFDs but not driver's licenses for this group. The court found that denying driver's licenses to \"illegal aliens\" did not violate Equal Protection and Supremacy Clauses. The district court upheld a Tennessee measure allowing Driving Privilege Cards (CFDs) but not driver's licenses for unlawfully present aliens. The court rejected claims of a constitutional right to a state-issued ID card and due process arguments, finding the state's distinctions between documents issued to different groups were rationally related to promoting homeland security. Some cities issue municipal ID cards to unlawfully present aliens, like San Francisco's \"SF City ID Cards\" which are accepted as proof of identity and residence by city agencies and entities receiving city funds. Legal challenges to granting CFDs and DPCs to unlawfully present aliens would likely face similar analysis as challenges to granting driver's licenses to such individuals. The municipal ID cards issued by cities like San Francisco are accepted as proof of identity and residence by various city agencies and entities. They can also be used as library cards, for opening checking accounts, or for \"Family Accounts\" with certain departments. Concerns have been raised about these practices similar to those regarding driver's licenses for unlawfully present individuals, but they may not be prohibited by federal law. Restrictions exist on unlawfully present aliens receiving federal, state, or local public benefits. Federal law prohibits them from receiving federal public benefits, even if administered by state or local governments. State legislation must affirmatively provide for their eligibility for local agencies to offer benefits. Consular IDs issued by foreign consulates to their nationals are a common practice. The recognition and acceptance of consular IDs by government and private institutions in the United States has increased in recent decades. Some states allow consular IDs as a form of identification for obtaining a driver's license, while others have restrictions. These restrictions are generally in line with federal law, particularly encouraged by the REAL ID Act. The REAL ID Act prohibits states from accepting foreign documents other than valid passports for issuing driver's licenses or state ID cards for federal purposes. However, states are not barred from recognizing consular IDs for verifying identity when issuing state-issued IDs. Non-compliant IDs may not be accepted by federal agencies. The REAL ID Act prohibits states from accepting non-compliant IDs for federal purposes, but states can recognize consular IDs for state-issued IDs. The United States is a party to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, which requires informing detained individuals of their right to contact their consulate. Arguably, possession of a consular ID by an arrested person may assist law enforcement in verifying the person's foreign nationality and identifying the appropriate foreign consulate to contact. State or local restrictions on accepting consular IDs could face preemption challenges under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. In 2011, a federal court preliminarily enjoined enforcement of an Indiana statute regarding consular IDs. The district court in Indianapolis preliminarily enjoined enforcement of an Indiana statute that prohibited the offering or acceptance of consular IDs as a form of identification, citing conflicts with the rights of foreign consulates under the VCCR and potential interference with foreign affairs. The court noted that while the law did not bar consulates from issuing consular IDs, it rendered them essentially useless for their intended purposes. The court prohibited the use of consular IDs for various purposes, including private commercial transactions, citing concerns about potential limitations on U.S. citizens' usage of consular IDs in other countries. The court also noted U.S. Treasury Department regulations allowing financial institutions to accept consular IDs, indicating the federal government's interest in regulating their use cautiously. The Buquer court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in their challenge. The Buquer court prohibited the use of consular IDs for various purposes, citing concerns about limitations on U.S. citizens' usage in other countries. Indiana failed to establish a rational relation between the statute's prohibition and a legitimate governmental interest. The court found consular IDs to be as reliable as other forms of ID not sanctioned by Indiana."
