    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Equal Protection School Finance Act\" and includes findings. The Congress finds that public school finance systems in States result in unequal education quality based on location, referencing the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education affirming education as a fundamental right under the equal protection clause of the Constitution. The provision of education to all children within a State on an equal basis, including equality of financial resources, is fundamental to the equal protection of laws. SEC. 3. EQUALIZATION SYSTEM. Beginning 5 years after enactment, a State must maintain a coefficient of variation of at least 10 percent for per-pupil expenditures in local educational agencies to continue receiving Federal funds. The coefficient of variation is defined as the standard deviation of expenditures divided by the mean per-student expenditure, excluding certain factors. The Act requires states to allocate funds for specific student needs, such as educationally disadvantaged or handicapped students. The Secretary can grant a waiver for non-compliance if a state submits a plan for compliance within 5 years. The Act mandates states to allocate funds for specific student needs. A waiver for non-compliance can be granted if a state submits a plan for compliance within 5 years, not exceeding this duration after approval by the Secretary. SEC. 4. REPORT, CERTIFICATION, AND CHALLENGE. Annual Report: States must submit a report to the Secretary by January 1 each year detailing compliance with section 3(a) or any waivers granted. The report must also include any additional information requested by the Secretary. The report must certify compliance with section 3(a) or waiver under section 3(c), serving as evidence unless challenged within 90 days by a local educational agency. SEC. 5. CONSEQUENCES OF NONCOMPLIANCE. If a State fails to comply with education requirements, it will lose Federal funding. Eligibility can be restored once compliance is met or a waiver is granted. Funds may be redistributed to compliant States. The text chunk states that entities must comply with section 3(a) requirements or implement compliance plans under section 3(c). The Secretary has the authority to create rules for implementing the Act. Definitions include \"local educational agency\" as defined in another education act and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Education."
