    "content": "The Act is titled as the \"Bindu Philips and Devon Davenport International Child Abduction Return Act of 2017\". It includes findings related to child abduction. Congress finds that in 2016, 629 American children were abducted from the United States by one parent without consent, violating court orders and international laws. Abducted children often lose contact with the American parent, leading to emotional and psychological issues such as anxiety, eating problems, and aggressive behavior. The Department of State had 944 open abduction cases. In 2016, the Department of State had 944 open cases of child abduction, with only 152 cases resulting in the return of the abducted child to the United States. The return rates hit a three-year low, while cases closed without the child being returned reached a high of 189. Low return rates may encourage parents to abduct their children, violating international laws and the Hague Abduction Convention. The Hague Abduction Convention lacks enforcement, leading to non-compliance by countries like Argentina, Bahamas, Brazil, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Panama, Peru, and Romania in resolving child abductions. The report identified countries like India, Jordan, Nicaragua, and Tunisia as demonstrating non-compliance with the Hague Abduction Convention for failing to resolve abduction cases. Out of the thirteen countries identified, eleven are receiving trade benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences. In India, only 10 abducted children returned home in 2016, with 66 percent of US requests for their return remaining unresolved. The return of abducted children from India has been unresolved for over 12 months. Bindu Philips' legal efforts to bring back her twin sons from India were closed by the State Department in 2016. Brazil has a history of non-compliance since 2005, with 13 cases of abducted American children pending for 2.5 to 10 years. Dr. Christopher Brann has limited visitation with his son Nico in Brazil since 2013 due to abduction by Nico's mother. Devon Davenport has won 24 appeals for the return of his daughter Nadia Lynn in Brazil since 2009, but she has not been returned yet. The Trade Act of 1974 is amended to include a new limitation on beneficiary developing countries related to child abduction cases."
