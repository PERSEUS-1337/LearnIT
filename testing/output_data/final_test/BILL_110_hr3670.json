    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Improving Public Diplomacy through International Travel Act\". Congress finds a 17% decline in overseas visitors since 9/11, with a 10% drop in business travel to the US from 2004 to 2005. The US market share of international travel decreased to 6% in 2007, resulting in 60 million fewer travelers, 194,000 lost jobs, $94 billion in lost spending, and $15.6 billion in lost tax receipts. Despite spending less than $4 million on international travel promotion in 2007, the US lags behind countries like Greece, Mexico, and Australia in this regard. In a recent survey, international travelers ranked the United States as having the \"world's worst\" entry process, with 66 percent fearing detainment for hours or worse. The perception is that the US does not welcome visitors, but this could change with an international travel promotion program that offers a 6:1 return on investment and enhances public diplomacy efforts. Establishment of grant program. The Secretary of State will establish a grant program to promote international travel to the United States, with grant amounts ranging from $150,000 to $1,000,000. Recipients must use the funds to develop a promotion program focused on overseas markets to encourage travel to the US and communicate entry requirements. The promotion programs under this Act target specific markets in a phased approach over five fiscal years, starting with Canada and expanding to include Mexico, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Germany. Entities must submit an application with required documentation to be eligible for a grant to promote international travel to the United States. Entities receiving grants under this Act must provide non-Federal matching funds, including in-kind donations, equal to the grant amount. Under this Act, grant recipients must provide non-Federal matching funds, with up to 25 percent allowed in in-kind donations. The Secretary must reserve 20 percent of funds for promotion programs for destinations lacking international marketing resources. The Secretary must report to Congress on the impact of promotion programs, return on investment analysis, and recommendations for legal improvements. The Secretary must report to Congress on the impact of promotion programs, return on investment analysis, and recommendations for legal improvements regarding United States entry requirements. Authorization of $10,000,000 for grants under this Act for the first 5 fiscal years after enactment. Appropriated amounts remain available until expended."
