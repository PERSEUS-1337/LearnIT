The Universal Net Price Calculator is introduced in Section 3. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a universal net price calculator within the Department of Education, allowing users to receive net prices for any institution required to have a net price calculator. The universal net price calculator, developed in consultation with relevant Federal agencies, must be tested before finalization and public release. If created, a process for consumer testing will be established by the Secretary in collaboration with Federal agency heads. The universal net price calculator will undergo consumer testing with representatives of various student groups, families, educational institutions, counselors, and consumer groups. The testing will last no longer than 6 months after development. The results of consumer testing for the universal net price calculator will be used in its final development. A report detailing the testing results must be submitted to Congress within 3 months of the testing's conclusion. The Secretary has the authority to modify the universal net price calculator based on consumer testing results before finalizing it. A report on steps to raise awareness of net price calculators among students and families must be submitted to Congress within 1 year of the Net Price Calculator Improvement Act enactment."
