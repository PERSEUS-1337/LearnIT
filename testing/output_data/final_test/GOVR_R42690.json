    "content": "ICE and its predecessor, the INS, have a history of issuing detainers for potentially removable aliens. Case law shows examples of detainers being used to request delivery to immigration authorities or notification prior to release from prison. The INS has a history of using detainers to request transfer of aliens after their criminal sentence. The INA grants the Attorney General the power to control borders and issue detainers. The INS has a history of using detainers to request transfer of aliens after their criminal sentence. The INA grants the Attorney General the power to control borders and issue detainers, establishing categories of aliens barred from admission or removal from the US, and granting broad discretion to immigration officials for enforcement priorities. Congress amended Section 287 of the INA in 1986 to address detainers for aliens arrested for violations of any law. The INA grants the Attorney General the power to issue detainers for aliens arrested for violations of any law relating to controlled substances. Immigration officers must promptly determine whether to issue a detainer for aliens believed to be unlawfully present in the United States. The Attorney General has the authority to issue detainers for aliens arrested for controlled substance offenses. The INS regulations were amended in 1986 to address the issuance of detainers, which were later merged into one regulation in 1997. Detainers are issued pursuant to sections 236 and 287 of the INA. Detainers are issued under sections 236 and 287 of the INA, authorizing detention of certain aliens and specifying powers of immigration officers. Authorized officers can issue detainers to other law enforcement agencies and must provide all relevant information on the alien's status. The standard detainer form (Form 1-247) has been in use since at least 1984, allowing ICE to notify other agencies of an individual's alien status and initiation of removal proceedings. DHS is not financially responsible for an alien's detention unless it issues a detainer or assumes custody. ICE can request other agencies to maintain custody of an individual for up to 48 hours beyond their release time, notify DHS of release time, and cancel a detainer upon the individual's conviction. In June 2011, options were added to detainers to provide copies to aliens and make them operative only upon conviction, addressing concerns of awareness and criticism of detainers issued for dismissed charges or not guilty findings. ICE also made changes in response to criticisms of the Secure Communities program, including issuing an interim policy in August 2010 to restrict detainer issuance unless a law enforcement agency independently arrested the alien. ICE made changes to detainers in response to criticisms, including establishing a toll-free hotline for detained individuals to claim U.S. citizenship or victim status. Guidelines were issued in December 2012 for detainers to be issued only for removable aliens meeting specific criteria. In November 2014, detainers were to be issued for convicted offenses prioritized by ICE, discontinuing the Secure Communities program. ICE issues detainers to request that state and local law enforcement officials notify them before releasing or transferring an alien. Detainers are not typically used to request detention unless the alien is subject to a final removal order or there is sufficient probable cause. ICE issued over 270,000 detainers in FY2009 and over 201,000 in FY2010, but it is unclear how many resulted in removals. The Secure Communities program raised questions about detainers from March 2008 to November 2014. These questions include the legality of DHS detainer regulations, state and local compliance with detainers, custody of aliens, and potential violations of constitutional rights. Certain questions about holds of aliens pursuant to detainers may have been mooted by the Obama Administration's announcement that ICE will generally request such holds only \"in special circumstances\" when the alien is subject to a final order of removal or when there is sufficient probable cause to believe that the alien is removable. Plaintiffs and commentators argue that ICE's detainer regulations and practices exceed its statutory authority by issuing detainers for offenses not involving controlled substances. ICE personnel determine whether to issue a detainer for offenses not involving controlled substances, contrary to Section 287 of the INA. Federal immigration authorities have a broader view of their authority, issuing detainers without a request from non-immigration officers. The INS believes holds are permissible under its general authority for warrantless arrests for immigration violations. The U.S. District Court for the Northern has ruled on this issue. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ruled that DHS's detainer regulations are within its statutory authority, based on the Chevron two-step test for judicial review of agency construction of a statute. The court found that the regulations were not facially invalid and consistent with the purposes of the statute. The court ruled that DHS's detainer regulations are within its statutory authority under the Chevron two-step test for judicial review of agency construction of a statute. The regulations were found to be consistent with the purposes of the statute and not contrary to Congress's intent. The court ruled that DHS's detainer regulations are within its statutory authority under the Chevron two-step test for judicial review of agency construction of a statute, despite ongoing challenges to the government's application of immigration detainer regulations. The court ruled that DHS's detainer regulations are within its statutory authority under the Chevron two-step test for judicial review of agency construction of a statute. Other courts may consider the legislative history of the 1986 amendments, which aimed to expand the use of detainers by requiring immigration officers to at least consider issuing detainers when requested by other law enforcement officers. The DHS regulation regarding immigration detainers states that states and localities may be required to hold aliens for up to 48 hours upon issuance of a detainer. However, there is debate over whether this mandatory language applies to holding aliens at DHS's request. The standard detainer form (Form I-247) used to require compliance with immigration detainers, but was later amended to indicate that ICE \"requested\" rather than \"required\" that aliens be held. However, a December 2011 amendment to Form I-247 created confusion as to whether compliance with detainers is requested or required. This confusion stems from federal regulation 8 C.F.R. \u00a7287.7, which states that a law enforcement agency \"shall maintain custody of an alien\" once a detainer has been issued. ICE amended the detainer form in December 2012, indicating that detainer requests derive from federal regulation without quoting the text. Some jurisdictions may have interpreted DHS statements to mean they must honor detainers. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit found that states and localities are not required to comply with immigration detainers in the Galarza v. Szalczyk case. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that the word \"shall\" in DHS's detainer regulation sets the maximum detention period, not mandating states to hold aliens for DHS. The majority considered detainers as \"requests\" and noted DHS's historical interpretation as persuasive. They also cited other court decisions characterizing detainers as requests and invoked the doctrine of constitutional avoidance in their interpretation. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that immigration detainers must be deemed requests, not mandatory orders to local law enforcement officials, based on settled constitutional law. The majority found that federal officials cannot require states and localities to detain aliens for them, as it would disrupt the system of federalism. The Third Circuit's decision on immigration detainers clarified that they are requests, not mandatory orders, based on constitutional law. This ruling addresses the uncertainty of compliance with detainers and the debate over federal preemption of state and local policies. Compliance with detainers may still be argued as mandatory based on district court decisions outside the Third Circuit. The term \"custody\" in immigration law encompasses most restrictions on liberty resulting from a criminal charge or conviction. It is significant for habeas corpus challenges to detention legality and determining authorized immigration detainer holds. Habeas corpus historically reviews Executive detention legality, allowing detained aliens to challenge their status. The legality of Executive detention allows detained aliens to challenge their custody by federal, state, or local law enforcement. Jurisdiction depends on who has custody, impacting the authorization of immigration detainer holds. Courts have debated whether aliens detained under detainers are in federal custody, with some viewing detainers as administrative notices rather than indicators of federal custody. The case of Mohammed v. Sullivan highlighted this issue. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of a habeas petition due to an INS detainer not constituting 'technical custody'. Similarly, the Eleventh Circuit found that a detainer alone did not place the petitioner in INS custody for a habeas proceeding. The court found that lodging a detainer alone did not result in INS custody, but in certain cases, an alien could be considered in federal custody due to an immigration detainer. For example, in Galaviz-Medina v. Wooten, the court ruled that an alien with a deportation order and serving a federal prison sentence was in INS custody because of an immigration detainer. The court established that the INS had a concrete interest in the alien, leading to the conclusion that he was in INS custody. In Vargas v. Swan, the court rejected the INS's attempt to classify a detainer as an internal administrative mechanism and remanded the case for further evaluation. Aliens in the U.S., even those unlawfully present, are entitled to Fourth and Fifth Amendment protections as they are considered \"persons\" under the Constitution. The Fourth and Fifth Amendments protect individuals' rights against unreasonable searches and seizures, ensuring freedom from physical restraint and due process of law. Courts would likely assess specific actions taken under detainers and ICE's reasons for issuing them when determining if constitutional rights are violated. ICE's reasons for issuing individual detainers are crucial in assessing potential violations of constitutional rights, particularly regarding the impact on aliens' criminal cases and sentences. While lodging a detainer can have adverse effects, certain actions may not constitute a seizure of the alien's person or a protected liberty interest. However, holding a person who would have otherwise been released could be seen as a seizure, akin to a new arrest, requiring independent authority. ICE can use Form I-247 to request holds on various grounds, including a determination that an individual is an alien subject to removal, initiation of removal proceedings, a warrant of arrest for removal proceedings, and a removal order. Different grounds could potentially raise different constitutional issues. ICE has broad authority to detain aliens for removal based on warrants, which are presumptively reasonable. However, holding aliens based on a belief they are removable may have more limited authority under the Fourth Amendment, which only prohibits \"unreasonable\" seizures. Arrests made without a warrant are generally considered unreasonable, except in cases where there is sufficient reason to believe the person has committed a felony. Congress has granted immigration officers similar authority in immigration cases. Immigration officers have the authority to arrest aliens in the United States without a warrant if they believe the alien is in violation of immigration laws and is likely to escape. This authority is granted under Section 287(a) of the INA. The authority to make warrantless arrests under Section 287(a) of the INA is the same as that for issuing detainers. The INS considers a detainer under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7287.7 as an arrest. Other provisions like Sections 236 and 241 of the INA also authorize ICE's detainer practices, including arrest and detention pending removal decisions, and detention of aliens with criminal offenses. Section 241(a)(2) mandates detention of certain aliens during the removal period. Some commentators believe that Section 287(d) of the INA may authorize the detention of aliens arrested for controlled substance offenses. The courts have not definitively settled whether ICE detainers are authorized under this provision if the alien is in ICE custody. There is debate over whether detainers for aliens not arrested for controlled substance offenses could be impermissible if the INA provisions are the sole authority. Even if other authorities apply, questions could still be raised. Questions could be raised about the authorization of holds for particular aliens, even if other authorities are found to be generally applicable. For a warrantless arrest to be permissible under Section 287(a) of the INA, there must be \"reason to believe\" that the alien is in the United States in violation of immigration law and likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained. Probable cause is required for such arrests. Questions could be raised about whether ICE had probable cause to believe that individual aliens were removable based on available information at the time of issuing detainers. Some jurisdictions require an individualized assessment of factors like ties to the community and attempts to flee before placing a hold, as a court could find a hold without considering these factors impermissible. ICE regulations require that individual aliens must be brought before an immigration officer within a reasonable time after arrest, typically within 48 hours, to determine if formal removal proceedings should be initiated. Failure to do so could result in ICE being found to have violated the regulations. Some jurisdictions question if state law or federal law provides authority for actions taken in response to immigration detainers. While some argue that federal regulations suffice, others believe state law must also be a basis for action. Questions may arise regarding the legality of specific actions taken under immigration detainers. Some courts have raised concerns about the legality of holding aliens based on immigration detainers for investigatory delays, potentially violating the Fourth Amendment. It is unclear if federal law authorizes ICE to detain aliens for investigation of their removability. (Section 287 of the INA does not address such holds). The Fifth Amendment's procedural due process ensures fair procedures to prevent unjust deprivation of life, liberty, or property by the government. It does not protect individuals from deprivation itself but aims to safeguard against arbitrary interference with key interests. The government must use fair procedures to satisfy due process when taking away interests, as outlined in Mathews v. Eldridge. Due process requirements consider the private interest affected, the risk of erroneous deprivation, and the government's interest. The government must provide individuals with the opportunity to challenge the basis for depriving them of a protected interest, including notice and a hearing before an impartial tribunal. Additional procedural protections may be necessary in certain circumstances to prevent unfair deprivations. Whether government practices violate due process rights depends on the interests involved and existing procedural safeguards. Loss of freedom, such as detaining an alien who would otherwise be released, is considered a significant deprivation. The government's interest in detaining certain aliens for removal proceedings to prevent evasion and protect the community has been recognized by the courts. The courts have recognized the government's interest in detaining certain aliens for removal proceedings to prevent evasion and protect the community. Procedural safeguards associated with immigration detainers could impact claims of deprivation of liberty without due process. The federal government has evolved detainer practices in response to criticism, amending Form I-247 in June 2011. In June 2011, Form I-247 was amended to allow aliens to request a copy of the detainer. Despite this, aliens are only notified of an ICE detainer after it is issued. In December 2011, ICE established a hotline for detained individuals to call if they believe they are U.S. citizens or crime victims, aiming to address concerns about detainer misuse by state and local officials. The hotline established by ICE allows detained individuals to contest the issuance of a detainer, but there is no formal procedure associated with calls to this hotline. It is unclear if the procedural safeguards are sufficient to protect against erroneous deprivations of liberty rights. The existence of due process in future removal proceedings may not be enough to prevent deprivations of aliens' liberty interests prior to the commencement of such proceedings. The Secure Communities program raised questions about immigration detainers, including DHS's authority, state compliance, custody of aliens, and constitutional rights. The Obama Administration's new Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) will use detainers for convicted aliens of \"priority\" offenses, reducing some concerns. Under the Obama Administration's Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), immigration detainers will be used for convicted aliens of \"priority\" offenses. Detainers will only be used to request notification of the alien's release, not to hold them for up to 48 hours. However, detainers may still be used for aliens with final removal orders or probable cause of removability. Future administrations could change detainer policies, and legislation may increase detainer use."
