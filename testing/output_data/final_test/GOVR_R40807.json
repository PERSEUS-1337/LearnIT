    "content": "The misclassification of employees as independent contractors contributes to the tax gap, leading to congressional interest in proper worker classification. The IRS defines the gross tax gap as the difference between tax liability and voluntary payments, with a 16.3% noncompliance rate in 2001. Enforcement activities and late payments recovered $55 billion, resulting in a net tax gap of $290 billion. Business owners are required to withhold income taxes. In 1984, the IRS found that 15% of employers misclassified 3.4 million workers as independent contractors, causing a total tax loss of $1.6 billion. 84 percent of misclassified workers had their compensation reported to the IRS on Form 1099-MISC. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimated that in February 2005, independent contractors numbered 10.342 million or 7.4% of the U.S. workforce, accounting for 24% of the total contingent workforce of 42.6 million. Independent contractors provide flexibility to the labor market for both employers and workers, as they can be easily terminated and receive fewer fringe benefits. Independent contractors offer flexibility to the labor market as they can be easily terminated and receive fewer benefits. Employers prefer this classification, but workers may prefer employee status for job security and protections. The report analyzes the impact of misclassifying employees and the evolution of employee vs. independent contractor definitions. The evolution of the definition of employee versus independent contractor is discussed, along with findings from a TIGTA report, proposed legislation in the 112th Congress, President Obama's modification proposal, and two new IRS programs on misclassification. The costs and benefits of improved classification are compared, with common-law rules defining an employee based on employer control. IRS enforcement of employment tax collection increased in the late 1960s and 1970s, leading to complaints from some employers reclassified by the IRS. Congress responded with Section 530 Safe Harbor Rules. The IRS established \"safe harbor rules\" in response to complaints from employers reclassified as employees. To qualify for the safe harbor, employers must meet three Section 530 relief requirements, including having a reasonable basis for not treating workers as employees. The IRS established \"safe harbor rules\" for employers facing reclassification issues. To qualify, employers must meet three Section 530 relief requirements, including having a reasonable basis for treating workers as independent contractors. This prevents retroactive reclassification by the IRS. The IRS established safe harbor rules to prevent retroactive reclassification of workers as employees for tax purposes. These rules shield employers from penalties and interest on employment taxes. In 1987, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling 87-41 with 20 factors to determine employee-employer relationships under common law, impacting FICA, FUTA, and income tax collection. The factors aim to distinguish between employees and independent contractors. The IRS provides 20 factors to determine the status of a worker as an employee or independent contractor. These factors fall under three categories: Behavioral, Financial, and Type of Relationship. The classification is subjective, with no relative weighing of the factors. After reviewing the 20 factors provided by the IRS to determine worker classification as an employee or independent contractor, if there is still uncertainty, either party can file Form SS-8 with the IRS for a determination. This process may take up to six months. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration has reported an increase in misclassification of employees as independent contractors, leading to tax issues. The IRS needs to address the growing issue of misclassification of employees as independent contractors to reduce the tax gap. A study from 1984 shows the IRS lacks current data on the problem's magnitude. Recommendations include developing an agency-wide employment tax program and conducting a compliance study to measure the impact of misclassification on the tax gap. The IRS agreed with these recommendations. The IRS has agreed with recommendations to develop an agency-wide employment tax program and conduct a compliance study on the impact of worker misclassification on the tax gap. Two bills have been introduced in Congress regarding the misclassification of employees as independent contractors. The bills introduced in Congress aim to ensure accurate classification of employees and non-employees, prohibit discrimination against individuals based on their classification, and increase penalties for violations related to maximum hours, minimum wage, and notice of classification. The bills introduced in Congress aim to increase penalties for violations related to maximum hours, minimum wage, and notice of classification by an employer. Violators may face civil penalties of up to $1,100 for violations and up to $5,000 for repeated or willful violations. The bills also require the Secretary of Labor to establish a webpage summarizing employee rights under the FLSA and amend the Social Security Act to include provisions for auditing programs to identify noncompliant employers. The bills introduced in Congress aim to increase penalties for violations related to employee misclassification, including exclusion from unemployment compensation coverage and administrative penalties. Senator Brown and Representative Woolsey introduced companion bills in the 111th Congress, with President Obama proposing modifications to increase certainty in worker classification. The proposal aims to modify Section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978 to allow the IRS to reclassify misclassified workers and issue guidance on worker classification under common law standards. The guidance would include safe harbors and rebuttable presumptions, industry- or job-specific, to provide clarity for service recipients. The proposed change to Section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978 aims to provide clearer guidance on worker classification under common law standards, with a focus on industries where misclassification has been an issue. The change would be effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2011, and is estimated to yield $8.71 billion from FY2012 to FY2021. In September 2011, the IRS introduced new programs to address worker misclassification, including a \"Memorandum of Understanding\" with the Department of Labor and a \"Voluntary Classification Settlement Program.\" The IRS official stated that the \"Memorandum of Understanding\" and the Voluntary Classification Settlement Program (VCS) were not connected, calling their simultaneous announcement a coincidence. On September 19, 2011, the IRS Commissioner and the Secretary of Labor signed the MOU, with labor commissioners from seven states also signing agreements with the DOL. The MOU aimed to enhance collaboration between parties to reduce employee misclassification, close the tax gap, and improve compliance with labor laws, while strengthening the relationship between the IRS and DOL. The IRS introduced the Voluntary Classification Settlement Program (VCSP) to allow taxpayers to voluntarily reclassify workers as employees for federal employment tax purposes. This program aims to provide relief similar to the Classification Settlement Program (CSP) and presents a united compliance front to employers regarding their duties to properly pay employees and employment taxes. The Voluntary Classification Settlement Program (VCSP) allows taxpayers to voluntarily reclassify workers as employees for future tax periods with limited federal employment tax liability. To participate, employers must meet eligibility requirements, apply to VCSP, and enter into a closing agreement with the IRS. Eligibility criteria include consistent treatment of workers as nonemployees, filing all required Forms 1099 for the previous three years, and not being under audit by the IRS, Department of Labor, or a state agency. Employers in the VCSP program will pay 10% of the employment tax liability on compensation paid to workers for the most recent period. The Voluntary Classification Settlement Program (VCSP) allows employers to reclassify workers as employees with limited federal employment tax liability. This helps reduce the federal tax gap by ensuring proper tax withholding for employees, leading to higher tax compliance compared to independent contractors who must file their own taxes. The classification of worker status is subjective, with costs and benefits to improving worker classification. Reduced tax gaps at federal, state, and local levels due to misclassification of workers as independent contractors. Workers misclassified may rely on public assistance programs, leading to higher government outlays. Deliberate misclassification affects worker compensation and protection. Improving worker classification would raise worker compensation and protection by addressing deliberate misclassification by employers. This would also lead to a better allocation of resources and prevent an unfair competitive advantage for non-compliant employers. Increased enforcement of worker classification by the IRS may lead to higher federal outlays and reduced privacy, impacting labor market flexibility and potentially increasing unemployment rates and lowering GDP. The misclassification of employees as independent contractors contributes to the tax gap and imposes costs on the economy. Reducing misclassification would decrease tax gaps and provide benefits, but the process would be costly. Data on the tax gap caused by misclassification are unavailable, making it difficult to assess the benefits versus costs. Factors in IRS Revenue Ruling 87-41 include instructions on worker control. The control factor in determining employee status includes the right to require compliance with instructions, training, integration of services into business operations, and services rendered personally. Continuing Relationship: A continuing relationship between the worker and the person for whom services are performed indicates an employer-employee relationship. A continuing relationship between the worker and the person for whom services are performed indicates an employer-employee relationship. Factors such as set hours of work, full-time requirement, and working on the employer's premises also suggest control over the worker. The worker's freedom from control is indicated by work done off the premises of the employer, but this alone does not determine employee status. Control over the place of work is shown when the employer can dictate the worker's route, territory, or specific work locations. If the worker must follow a set order or sequence of tasks determined by the employer, it indicates lack of freedom in work pattern. Payment by the hour, week, or month generally indicates an employer-employee relationship, while payment by the job or commission suggests an independent contractor. Reimbursement of business and travel expenses by the employer typically signifies an employee status. An employer's control over expenses and direction of business activities indicate an employer-employee relationship. Furnishing tools and materials by the employer suggests the same. Significant investment in facilities by the worker leans towards independent contractor status, while lack of investment indicates employee dependence. Realization of Profit or Loss is a key factor in determining if a worker is an independent contractor or an employee. If a worker can realize a profit or suffer a loss beyond what employees typically experience, they are likely an independent contractor. However, if the worker does not have a real economic loss due to investments or expenses, they are more likely an employee. The risk of not receiving payment is not enough to classify someone as an independent contractor. The factors indicating an independent contractor include working for multiple firms, making services available to the public, and the right to discharge. The ability to realize a profit or loss also plays a key role in determining worker classification. In the 111th Congress, proposed legislation addressed concerns about misclassification of employees as independent contractors. Representative Jim McDermott introduced H.R. 3408, the Taxpayer Responsibility, Accountability, and Consistency Act of 2009, to address this issue. The Taxpayer Responsibility, Accountability, and Consistency Act of 2009 aims to combat the misclassification of employees as independent contractors. This misclassification allows employers to reduce tax liability and avoid labor laws, resulting in lost revenue for governments and rights for workers. Senator John F. Kerry introduced bill S. 2882 to address the misclassification of employees as independent contractors, aiming to prevent billions of dollars in lost revenue for federal and state governments. The bill would require reporting payments of $600 or more to the IRS, modify statutory standards under the Revenue Act of 1978, and place the burden of proof on employers for safe harbor relief. Additionally, the Secretary of the Treasury would be required to issue an annual report on worker misclassification enforcement actions. The Second Session of the 111th Congress introduced companion bills to address misclassification of workers by employers. The bills aimed to increase penalties for failure to file correct information returns and furnish correct payee statements. They also focused on the impact of misclassification on the federal tax system and the outcomes of petitions requesting review of employment classification. Four bills were introduced to address concerns about employee misclassification as independent contractors. The Misclassification Prevention Act, introduced by Representative Lynn C. Woolsey and Senator Sherrod Brown, would require record-keeping and notice requirements for non-employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. The bill aims to protect employees and non-employees from discrimination and inaccurate classification. It increases penalties for violations and directs the Secretary of Labor to establish a webpage for enforcement. The bill increases penalties for violations to $5,000 each and requires the Secretary of Labor to create a webpage summarizing employee rights. It also amends the Social Security Act to include provisions for auditing programs and penalties for misclassifying employees or paying unreported compensation. The Fair Playing Field Act of 2010, introduced by Senator John F. Kerry and Representative Jim McDermott, aims to address misclassification of workers as independent contractors. This misclassification contributes to tax inequities, affects competitive positions of businesses, and results in denial of benefits to employees. The act seeks to close the tax gap and ensure proper classification of workers for various benefits and protections. The Fair Playing Field Act of 2010 aims to address worker misclassification as independent contractors to close the tax gap and ensure proper classification for benefits and protections. The act seeks to provide clear guidance on employment tax status for workers, businesses, and taxpayers, allowing an orderly transition to new rules for increased certainty and uniformity."
