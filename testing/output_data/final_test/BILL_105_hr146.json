    "content": "The Act titled \"Notch Baby Act of 1997\" establishes a new guaranteed minimum primary insurance amount during a transitional period. Section 215(a) of the Social Security Act is amended to include a new provision for calculating the primary insurance amount for individuals described in paragraph (4)(B). This provision includes a transitional increase amount based on former law and the applicable percentage in relation to the year. The primary insurance amount for individuals becoming eligible for old-age insurance benefits is determined by a transitional increase amount and an applicable percentage based on the year of eligibility. The applicable percentage for individuals becoming eligible for old-age insurance benefits varies based on the year of eligibility, ranging from 60 percent in 1979 to 10 percent in 1983. The term 'excess under former law' refers to the difference between the former law primary insurance amount and the individual's primary amount. The term 'applicable former law primary insurance amount' refers to the individual's primary insurance amount calculated under previous laws, without certain adjustments. The paragraph outlines specific provisions related to the computation of an individual's 'computation base years' for social security benefits, with exceptions and adjustments specified. The paragraph specifies that it applies to individuals if it results in a higher primary insurance amount compared to the computation without this provision. The effective date and related rules are outlined in Section 3. The amendments made by this Act are effective as if they were part of the Social Security Amendments of 1977, with no benefit increases before January 1998. Recomputation of benefits is required for individuals entitled to monthly insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act for December 1997. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will recompute the primary insurance amount for individuals entitled to monthly insurance benefits under the Social Security Act, taking into account the amendments made by the Act."
