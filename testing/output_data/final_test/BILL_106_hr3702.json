This new part emphasizes the importance of recruiting teachers in these fields. The 'Recruit and Reward Future Math and Science Teachers of America Act of 2000' aims to address the shortage of qualified math and science teachers in the United States. Congress acknowledges the impact of teachers' knowledge on student learning and the need to hire over 2,000,000 teachers in the next decade. The success of placing highly qualified teachers in these fields depends on proactive policies. The success of placing highly qualified math and science teachers depends on proactive policies that increase funding for teacher training, recruitment, and induction. The purpose of this part is to provide grants for scholarship awards to outstanding students in teacher training programs focused on math and science for urban or rural secondary classrooms. $5,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2001 to 2003. Scholarship designation and selection criteria are outlined in section 10995C. The funds under this part are designated as 'National Math and Science Teacher Scholarships'. The Secretary of Education may award funds to qualifying higher education institutions with graduate programs in teacher training on a competitive basis. Institutions can receive up to $100,000 per academic year if ranked in the top 25% of schools in the State based on graduates passing the State teacher qualification assessment. The Secretary gives priority to eligible institutions meeting specific criteria, such as offering internship programs, mentoring for novice teachers, placing graduates in rural and urban schools, and maintaining high teacher retention rates. \"Individual scholarship eligibility under SEC. 10995D.\" To be eligible for a National Math and Science Teacher Scholarship, an individual must be a US citizen, majoring in physical or life science, or mathematics graduate teacher training program, and enrolled in a top-ranked higher education institution based on teacher qualification assessment pass rates. To qualify for the National Math and Science Teacher Scholarship, a US citizen must major in physical or life science, or mathematics, be enrolled in a top-ranked teacher training program, and commit to teaching math or science in a public secondary school for at least 3 years. The National Math and Science Teacher Scholarship awards $10,000 per student for any academic year, not exceeding the total cost of attendance. If funds are insufficient, the number of scholarships awarded will be reduced. The scholarship amount cannot exceed the cost of attendance and will not be affected by other federal student financial assistance. Recipients of the National Math and Science Teachers Scholarships must teach in urban or rural public secondary schools for at least 3 years. Failure to fulfill this agreement will result in repayment of scholarship funds plus interest and collection fees. Exceptions to repayment provisions are outlined in the regulations. Recipients of the Scholarship are exempt from violating the agreement if they are pursuing full-time math and science studies, serving in the military for up to 3 years, temporarily disabled, seeking employment without success for up to 12 months, or seeking math and science teaching positions for up to 27 months. The borrower can be exempt from repayment if they are permanently totally disabled, as confirmed by a qualified physician. The Secretary of Education must report to Congress three years after funds are first available for the National Math and Science Teacher Scholarships pilot program, evaluating its success in recruiting teachers for public secondary schools."
