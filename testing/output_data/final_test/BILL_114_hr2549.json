    "content": "PART 4 of the HITECH Act adds provisions for accessing, sharing, and using health data for research purposes. It includes definitions and references to regulations governing health data research. The Secretary will revise the rule to allow covered entities to use and disclose protected health information for research purposes, treating it as part of health care operations. The rule will specify that such disclosures can only be made to another covered entity for health care operations. The Secretary will revise the rule to allow covered entities to disclose protected health information for research purposes and data aggregation, without limitations specified in section 164.506(c)(4) of part 164. This section should not restrict the use or disclosure of protected health information. The rule will be revised to allow covered entities to disclose protected health information for research purposes without restrictions specified in part 164. The Secretary will revise the Rule to allow disclosures of protected health information for research purposes without limitations on remuneration. Research activities related to the quality, safety, or effectiveness of FDA-regulated products will be considered public health activities for disclosure of protected health information. The Secretary will revise the Rule to allow remote access to protected health information by researchers, as long as appropriate security measures are in place and the information is not copied. Additionally, a one-time authorization for the use and disclosure of protected health information for research purposes will be permitted. The Secretary will revise the Rule to specify that an authorization for the use or disclosure of protected health information for future research purposes must sufficiently describe the purpose and include an expiration date or condition for revocation by the individual. The Secretary will revise the Rule to specify that an authorization for future research purposes must include instructions for revocation by the individual. The covered entity cannot use or disclose information once authorization is revoked, except as allowed under specific circumstances. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must update regulations within 12 months for consistency with federal law. The Rule will be revised to align with federal regulations under the HITECH Act, ensuring authorization for future research includes instructions for revocation by the individual."
