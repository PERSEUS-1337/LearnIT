Congress finds that the placement of commercial telecommunication towers near homes can devalue properties, obstruct views, and decrease the desire to live in such homes. States and localities should have control over tower siting through zoning and other measures to protect the environment and public safety. Additionally, there are alternative technologies available to meet telecommunication needs without the construction of towers. The Federal Communications Commission proposed a rule in 1997 that would preempt State and local zoning ordinances on broadcast transmission facilities placement. It is argued that alternative tower designs can meet telecommunication needs without obstructing views or devaluing properties near homes. The Federal Communications Commission proposed modifying rules to allow State and local governments to regulate the placement of telecommunications towers, shifting the burden of proof to the entity seeking to place or modify the towers. This includes addressing concerns about obstructing views and devaluing properties near homes. The Federal Aviation Administration lacks authority to regulate the placement of personal wireless telephone or broadcast transmission towers near airports or high-traffic airspaces. The Commission's proposed rules to override State and local zoning restrictions for tower placement could negatively impact aviation safety and airport operations. The Act aims to repeal limitations on State and local authority regarding personal wireless service towers and related facilities. It allows governments to require alternative technologies when tower placement conflicts with local regulations and to regulate tower placement. The Act allows governments to regulate the placement of wireless service towers to ensure they do not interfere with public airspace or compromise safety. State and local authorities have control over the placement, construction, and modification of broadcast transmission and other telecommunications facilities. The amendment repeals limitations on the regulation of personal wireless facilities under the Communications Act of 1934, ensuring non-discrimination among providers of similar services and adjusting timeframes for administrative remedies. The amendment repeals limitations on the regulation of personal wireless facilities under the Communications Act of 1934, ensuring non-discrimination among providers of similar services and adjusting timeframes for administrative remedies. In any action involving tower facilities, the burden of proof lies with the person seeking to place, construct, or modify the facility. The FCC is prohibited from adopting a rule preempting state and local authority over broadcast transmission facilities. The FCC retains authority over the placement, construction, and modification of other transmission towers. The FCC retains authority over the placement, construction, and modification of other transmission towers under the Communications Act of 1934. SEC. 337 grants state and local authorities control over the placement, construction, and modification of telecommunications and broadcast towers. SEC. 337 of the Act gives state and local authorities the power to regulate the placement, construction, and modification of broadcast and telecommunications towers. This includes ensuring compliance with state and local laws, as well as official decisions of the relevant government entities. Additionally, the Act does not prevent states or local governments from requiring safety studies for telecommunications or broadcast facilities within their jurisdiction. The Act grants state and local authorities the power to regulate the placement of broadcast and telecommunications towers, including ensuring compliance with RF exposure limits and aviation safety standards. Failure to provide required documentation may result in denial of authority to locate facilities within the jurisdiction."
