    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Family and Medical Leave Clarification Act\". The Family and Medical Leave Clarification Act is not working as intended due to the Secretary of Labor's broad regulations causing compliance issues for employers. Congressional hearings from 1996 to 2002 highlighted implementation problems caused by the Department of Labor's misapplication of the Act. The Department of Labor's misapplication of the Family and Medical Leave Clarification Act has led to significant administrative costs, scheduling difficulties, and conflicts with employers' sick leave policies. Compliance issues with intermittent leave under the Act are well-documented. The Commission on Leave reported compliance difficulties with the Act, based on leave taken before final regulations became effective in early 1995. Compliance problems arose after contradictory interpretations of serious health conditions were issued. The Commission on Leave reported compliance issues with the Act due to leave taken before final regulations took effect in early 1995. A Department of Labor survey in January 2001 showed a 21.5% decline in covered establishments finding it easy to comply with the Act between 1995 and 2000. SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION. Section 101(11) of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 is amended to include various illnesses, injuries, impairments, and conditions that require care or treatment, such as heart conditions, back conditions, strokes, respiratory conditions, spinal injuries, appendicitis, pneumonia, arthritis, nervous disorders, and injuries. The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 includes severe arthritis, nervous disorders, injuries from accidents, ongoing pregnancies, miscarriages, and pregnancy-related complications. Short-term illnesses or injuries with brief treatment and recovery are not covered. SEC. 4. INTERMITTENT LEAVE. Amends the Family and Medical Leave Act to allow employers to require employees to take intermittent leave in half-day increments. Employers can also require employees traveling for work to take leave for the duration of their assignment if unable to accommodate their request. Section 102(e) of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 is amended to allow employers to require timely requests for leave under certain conditions. Failure to make a timely request may result in denial of leave. Employees must provide notice and submit any required written application for leave within 5 working days after notifying the employer. In cases of unforeseeable leave, employees must orally notify the employer before the leave commences or within an additional necessary period if the employer is unable to receive the notification. Employees must provide notice and submit any required written application for leave within 5 working days after notifying the employer, or within an additional necessary period if physically or mentally incapable. SEC. 6. SUBSTITUTION OF PAID LEAVE.\n\nSection 102(d)(2) of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 is amended to allow employers to require employees to choose between paid absence provided under certain agreements or plans and unpaid leave under the Act.\n\nSEC. 7. REGULATIONS. The Secretary of Labor will issue revised regulations implementing the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 within specific timeframes, including reviewing existing regulations and issuing proposed and final regulations. The Secretary of Labor's letters issued before the effective date of revised regulations will not apply to employer actions taken after the effective date regarding leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. The amendments made by this Act will be effective upon issuance of final regulations required under section 7(a)(2)."
