    "title": "SB 1174",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Business and Professions Code in California is amended to prioritize the investigation and discipline of physicians and surgeons posing the greatest threat of harm to the public. This includes cases involving gross negligence, incompetence, drug or alcohol abuse leading to death or serious bodily injury to patients. Repeated acts of excessive prescribing of controlled substances without proper examination or medical reason may lead to disciplinary action against physicians and surgeons in California. However, prescribing for intractable pain in accordance with lawful regulations will not be prosecuted. The California Medical Board may take disciplinary action against physicians for various reasons, including repeated excessive recommending of cannabis without proper examination, sexual misconduct with patients, practicing medicine under the influence, and excessive prescribing of psychotropic medications to minors without a valid medical reason. The board may prioritize cases not described in these categories through regulations. The Medical Board of California must report on temporary restraining orders, interim suspension orders, and disciplinary actions by priority category. Additionally, the Board is required to review data on excessive prescribing of psychotropic medications and investigate potential violations of law. The State Department of Health Care Services will distribute treatment guidelines annually to Medi-Cal providers. The Medical Board of California will take disciplinary action for violations of law or excessive prescribing of psychotropic medications inconsistent with the standard of care. Starting July 1, 2017, the Medical Board of California will annually report data analysis results to the Legislature, State Department of Health Care Services, and State Department of Social Services as required by Section 14028 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. The report submission must comply with Section 9795 of the Government Code. The Medical Board of California will conduct an internal review of its data review, investigative, and disciplinary activities by January 1, 2022, in consultation with the State Department of Social Services and the State Department of Health Care Services. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2027, and may be repealed or extended by a later statute. The Medical Board of California, in collaboration with the State Department of Social Services, will provide information on Medi-Cal physicians' prescribing patterns of psychotropic medications for children every five years. This data-sharing agreement aims to ensure appropriate oversight and may be revised as needed. The State Department of Social Services will share pharmacy claims data with the Medical Board of California annually for foster children on three or more psychotropic medications for 90 days or more. Personal identifiers will be removed, and information such as medication prescribed, start/stop dates, prescriber details, and birth year will be provided. Additional deidentified information necessary for oversight will also be shared. The Medical Board of California will analyze prescribing patterns for children in foster care and wards of the court, with a focus on medication unit, quantity, and days' supply. They will contract a psychiatrist specializing in pediatric care to review the data and consider treatment guidelines. The section will be in effect until January 1, 2027, and will be repealed on that date unless a later statute extends it."
