    "content": "The \"Renewable Energy Environmental Research Act of 2009\" aims to establish a research program supporting renewable energy through ocean, coastal, Great Lakes, and atmospheric research. The Administrator will develop a plan to define requirements for a comprehensive ocean, coastal, Great Lakes, and atmosphere science program to support renewable energy development in the United States. This plan will also identify current climate, weather, and water data programs within NOAA relevant to renewable energy development and provide targeted research and data concerning climate, weather, and water to support renewable energy and smart grid technology. The plan aims to quantify micro-climate impacts of wind-power turbines, provide data for renewable energy decisions, and coordinate with various NOAA programs and external entities. The Administrator will develop a plan to support renewable energy development by collaborating with organizations, higher education institutions, and the private sector. Public hearings will be held to gather input from various stakeholders to enhance NOAA's climate, weather, and water observation data products for renewable energy purposes. Establishment of a research, prediction, and environmental information program. The Administrator will establish a program within 18 months to support renewable energy development in the US, focusing on climate, weather, and water research. This program will also address the impact of renewable energy on marine resources and include coordinated prediction efforts. The program established by the Administrator supports renewable energy development in the US with a focus on climate, weather, and water research. It includes coordinated prediction efforts, reliable delivery of operational products, identification of ecological effects on marine resources, and baseline ecological characterization for marine renewable energy development. The program supports renewable energy development by addressing potential impacts on the marine environment, promoting the development of marine special area management plans, and utilizing digital mapping and modeling techniques. The program supports renewable energy development by providing geospatial information and services for planning in ocean and coastal areas, examining micro-climate impacts of wind-power farms, and conducting outreach to the public and private sector. The data collected will be used by marine resource managers. The program supports marine renewable energy development by providing geospatial information for planning and permitting decisions. Public-private cooperation is encouraged to expand information services for the renewable energy industry. SEC. 5. BIENNIAL REPORTS. The Administrator will prepare and transmit a report every 2 years on progress in implementing the Act, including activities description, recommendations, and funding levels. SEC. 6. LIBRARY. Within 1 year of the Act's enactment, the Administrator will establish a renewable energy information library and data portal in consultation with relevant Federal agencies. The library will include links to data, planning tools, baseline ocean resources data, and digital mapping services. SEC. 7. FEDERAL COORDINATION.\n\nThe Administrator will coordinate with various federal agencies in carrying out activities under this Act.\n\nSEC. 8. AGREEMENTS.\n\nThe Administrator is authorized to enter into contracts, agreements, and transactions with different entities to fulfill the Act's purposes.\n\nSEC. 9. AUTHORITY TO RECEIVE FUNDS. SEC. 9. AUTHORITY TO RECEIVE FUNDS.\n\nThe Administrator can accept funds from agreements for Act purposes.\n\nSEC. 10. USE OF OCEAN OBSERVING OFFSHORE INFRASTRUCTURE.\n\nOffshore facilities can use platforms for ocean observation sensors.\n\nSEC. 11. DEFINITIONS. SEC. 11. DEFINITIONS.\n\nThe term \"Administrator\" refers to the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere in their role as the Administrator of NOAA. \"Marine renewable energy\" encompasses various forms of renewable energy derived from the sea. \"NOAA\" stands for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Authorization of Appropriations: The Administrator is authorized to receive $100,000,000 annually from 2010 to 2014 to implement the Act. Grants will be allocated to educational institutions and coastal states to support the program. \n\nSavings Provision: This Act does not override the jurisdiction or authority of any Federal or State agency under existing laws."
