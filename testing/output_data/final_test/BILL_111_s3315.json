The Social Security Act is amended to include special rules for adjustment for case mix changes for 2011 and subsequent years. Processes and criteria for evaluating changes in case mix are established by convening a Technical Advisory Group to advise the Secretary. The Technical Advisory Group, composed of stakeholders, will evaluate changes in case mix to distinguish real changes from coding or classification changes. The Technical Advisory Group, consisting of stakeholders from various healthcare organizations, will assess changes in case mix to differentiate genuine changes from coding or classification adjustments. Members must not have an existing contract with the Secretary when appointed. The Secretary will allow the group to review and provide input. The Secretary allows stakeholders to review and comment on proposed rulemaking or final determinations before issuance. If an outside contractor is involved in evaluating case mix changes, the Secretary must ensure they do not have an existing contract. The Secretary must use an outside contractor that has not previously been involved in designing case mix adjustment factors. If case mix changes are related to home health services, the Secretary will evaluate the increase by reviewing claims and services. The Secretary will review claims and services to evaluate changes in volume or nature, without using proxies or surrogates. Standards will be established by regulation, and all data and supporting materials will be made public. The Technical Advisory Group will provide comments on the establishment of standards at the time of the proposed regulation. Considerations include the impact of changes in the program on individuals' characteristics. The curr_chunk discusses characteristics of individuals receiving home health services, changes in the provision of home health services, distinctions in individuals initiating home health services from different care settings, and potential impacts of these changes. The curr_chunk discusses changes in coding affecting aggregate payments under this subsection during the fiscal year, along with other factors determined appropriate by the Secretary in consultation with the Technical Advisory Group. The curr_chunk states an exception for certain adjustments for 2011 under clause (iv) as of January 1, 2010."
