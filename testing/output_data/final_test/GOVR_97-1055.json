    "content": "When Turkmenistan gained independence in 1991, Saparamurad Niyazov became president and retained power. He was reelected in 1992 and declared president for life in 1999. Niyazov ruled with overwhelming powers, leading a highly corrupt regime with serious human rights abuses. After his death in 2006, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow became president in 2007, but Turkmenistan remained a closed society. Since becoming president in early 2007, Turkmenistan has remained a closed society with sporadic progress towards reforms. The country has limited political parties, including the ruling Democratic Party of Turkmenistan and the Party of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. Exiled political groups opposing the regime have been formed by former officials who have fled the country. Several exiled political movements have been formed in opposition to the Turkmenistan regime, including the Watan Social-Political Movement, the Republican Party, and the Fatherland movement. Leaders of these movements have received life sentences in absentia for alleged coup attempts. The People's Democratic Movement of Turkmenistan was founded by former Foreign Minister Boris Syhmyradow and the Turkmen government has not disclosed his current status. Additionally, activist organizations such as the Turkmenistan Helsinki Foundation and the Turkmen Human Rights Initiative have been established in Bulgaria and Austria, respectively. On December 21, 2006, Niyazov reportedly died from a heart attack, leading to Berdimuhamedow becoming acting president. The People's Council convened on December 26, changing the constitution to legitimize Berdimuhamedow's position. They also approved an electoral law and set the date for the next presidential election on February 11, 2007, with six government officials designated as candidates. The presidential election in Turkmenistan saw a high voter turnout with 89.23% endorsing acting President Berdimuhamedow. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe praised some aspects of the election law but criticized others. The U.S. State Department viewed the election as a modest step towards political electoral change. In his inaugural address in 2007, Berdimuhamedow promised to continue providing free natural gas, water, and electricity, as well as subsidized bread, gasoline, and housing. He removed some of Niyazov's statues but kept the Ruhnama as required reading in schools. A draft constitution was approved in 2008 after public debate. The new constitution of Turkmenistan, approved in September 2008, reaffirmed the country as a \"secular democracy\" with a powerful president ruling by decree. It emphasized individual rights but stated they must not violate public order or national security. The constitution abolished the HM, expanded the Mejlis, and held a legislative election in December 2008, criticized for lack of democratic participation. The Turkmen Central Electoral Commission reported a high voter turnout in an election hailed by President Berdimuhamedow as advancing Turkmen democracy. Approved civil society groups nominated candidates, but independent citizens' efforts were reportedly suppressed. The Mejlis, which supports presidential decrees, saw some members from civil society groups elected. In 2008, a Council of Elders was reaffirmed, and in 2009, a session was held under President Berdimuhamedow. In 2010, he called for a multi-party system and the creation of a Farmers' Party. However, only the Democratic Party and approved groups could participate in the 2010 local elections. In 2011, Berdimuhamedow urged the legislature to pass a law facilitating new political parties. Troops proclaimed him the \"Arkadag\" in 2010, and in 2011, the Council of Elders recommended naming him the \"hero of.\" In October 2011, the Council of Elders recommended naming the president the \"hero of Turkmenistan\" and the Mejlis voted for the \"Golden Moon\" medal. A new presidential election law in May 2011 faced criticism for not ensuring a fair election. The Turkmen Central Electoral Commission announced a presidential election for February 12, 2012. Initiative groups nominated candidates and gathered signatures for registration, with President Berdimuhamedow being nominated by the National Revival Movement. In January 2012, President Berdimuhamedow won the election with over 97% of the vote. The OSCE decided not to monitor the election due to inadequate legal and political framework. A new political party, the Party of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (PIE), was formed in August 2012. In June 2013, Ovezmammed Mammedov of a new pro-government party was elected to the legislature. President Berdimuhamedow resigned as chairman of the ruling party in August 2013. A legislative election is set for December 15, 2013, with 283 candidates registered from various political groups. The OSCE sent a needs assessment mission to Turkmenistan for the upcoming legislative election in December 2013. President Berdimuhamedow decreed a 10% increase in public wages, pensions, and student stipends. Human Rights Watch reports that Turkmenistan remains one of the world's most repressive countries. In 2012, Turkmenistan was labeled as one of the world's most repressive countries with severe restrictions on media, religion, and human rights activists facing government reprisals. The State Department's report highlighted arbitrary arrests, torture, and limitations on freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and movement as significant issues. Security officials were reported to torture and beat detainees for confessions, while the government partially addressed some concerns from the previous year. The government in Turkmenistan partially addressed torture concerns by revising the criminal code in 2012. Arbitrary arrests, harassment of NGOs, religious groups, and ethnic minorities were common. The judiciary was under the president's control, violating due process for defendants. The government in Turkmenistan violated various rights, including the presumption of innocence, access to accusatory material, and the right to call witnesses. Family members of detainees faced repercussions, and there were no political prisoners. Freedom of speech was not respected, with censorship of media and surveillance of journalists. The government controlled local media but citizens had access to foreign broadcasts. The government in Turkmenistan restricted academic debate, research on sensitive subjects, and access to government information. They also limited freedom of assembly, association, international travel, and emigration. Few NGOs were considered independent due to registration barriers. The Turkmen government in 2012 was reported to engage in corrupt practices and restrict international travel and emigration. Turkmenistan was identified as a source and destination country for forced labor and sex trafficking. Despite some progress in convicting traffickers, the government did not fully comply with anti-trafficking standards, leading to its placement on the \"Tier 2 Watch List\" for the second consecutive year. The State Department recommended training border guards and police to identify trafficking victims, providing aid to anti-trafficking organizations, conducting awareness campaigns, and formulating a national plan of action. The Turkmen government continued to restrict religious freedom, with some groups unable to register. The Turkmen government restricted religious freedom by denying registration to certain denominations, disrupting meetings of unregistered groups, and imposing restrictions on religious organizations through a 2003 religion law. The Council on Religious Affairs controls clergy appointments and religious activities, while foreign missionary activity is prohibited. The Turkmen government restricts religious freedom by controlling clergy appointments, religious activities, and publications. Unregistered religious groups face limitations on conducting activities, establishing places of worship, and disseminating religious materials. Unregistered religious activity is punished, and the importation of religious literature is rarely approved. Jehovah's Witnesses who refuse military service receive fines and suspended sentences. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom has urged Turkmenistan to be listed as a \"Country of Particular Concern\" due to severe violations of religious freedom. New media legislation in 2013 redistributed state-owned newspapers to government-affiliated organizations. Journalists Annakurban Amanklychev and Sapardurdy Khadjiyev were released from prison in February 2013 after serving seven-year sentences on illegal firearms charges. In 2013, journalists in Turkmenistan faced restrictions and harassment despite claims of progress in human rights legislation and social programs. The country was ranked as the least free in the world for press freedom. The U.S. delegation expressed concern over human rights violations in Turkmenistan, including excessive use of force, mistreatment of journalists and religious groups, imprisonment of conscientious objectors, and restrictions on freedoms. Turkmenistan agreed to implement half of the Working Group's recommendations but rejected calls to decriminalize same-sex relations and release prisoners of conscience. Human Rights Watch urged Turkmenistan to protect freedom of expression and reconsider rejected recommendations. Turkmenistan's President established a stabilization fund in response to the global economic downturn. The country introduced a new currency in 2009 and faced economic challenges due to a decline in gas sales. Efforts to diversify the economy include developing industries and launching building projects. The GDP of Turkmenistan has shown growth according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) estimates Turkmenistan's GDP grew by 7% in 2012, with inflation at 8.5%. Gas exports to China and Iran boosted GDP. Trade turnover with China was $9 billion in 2012. Over half of GDP comes from energy production. Turkmenistan's economy relies heavily on state-owned sectors like oil, gas, power generation, and textiles, which make up 75% of GDP. Privatization plans were delayed in 2013 due to a GDP increase. The state budget for 2014 projected revenues of $33 billion with expenditures of $34.3 billion, including public investment in projects like the Avaza seaside resort. The planned deficit in Turkmenistan will be covered by transfers from the state's Stabilization Fund, created in 2008 from surplus energy revenues. The International Monetary Fund warns of future budget deficits compromising fiscal sustainability. Unofficial estimates suggest high poverty and unemployment rates, with a significant number of Turkmen labor migrants in Turkey or Russia. The country faces challenges such as corruption, a poor educational system, and government misuse of oil and gas revenues, hindering market-oriented reforms. The International Crisis Group warned in 2011 about deep-seated issues in Turkmenistan, including paralyzed education and healthcare systems, declining energy and transportation sectors, and widespread government corruption hindering investment. Despite the absence of violent criminal organizations extorting businesses, the U.S. trade with Turkmenistan remains minimal at $92 million in exports in 2012. U.S. trade with Turkmenistan is limited, with $92 million in exports in 2012 and $90.4 million in imports, mainly fuel oil. President Berdimuhamedow has promoted foreign investment, with FDI averaging $3.7 billion annually from 2009-2012, mostly in the energy sector. China and Turkey are major investors in Turkmenistan, while U.S. FDI is not significant. According to the State Department, U.S. FDI is not prominent in Turkmenistan. The country ranks 169th out of 177 in the \"Index of Economic Freedom,\" indicating repressed levels of investment and monetary freedoms. Turkmenistan's economy is hindered by tight state control, slow economic reform, and a restrictive visa regime. Critics are concerned about a massive lake construction project that may impact the Amu Darya River. Turkmenistan has significant natural gas reserves, with 618 trillion cubic feet, and notable oil reserves. Gas exports to China increased in 2012, while crude oil and oil products are exported to various countries. Turkmenistan was previously dependent on Russian energy export routes but has since diversified its export destinations. In 1993, Russia stopped Turkmen gas exports to Western markets, diverting gas to other Eurasian states due to payment issues. In 1997, Russia cut off shipments to leverage Turkmenistan's agreement with Gazprom. A 25-year gas supply accord was signed in 2003, with disputes over prices leading to a halt in shipments in 2004. The two countries clashed over gas prices until reaching an agreement in late 2007. In late 2007, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, and Russia agreed on gas prices based on \"market principles\" for 2009. Plans for a new gas pipeline carrying Turkmen and Kazakh gas to Russia were made, but the project was not carried out. In April 2009, a gas pipeline explosion halted Turkmen gas shipments to Russia. After negotiations, Turkmen gas exports to Russia resumed in December 2009. In December 2009, Turkmenistan and Russia agreed to resume gas exports with altered terms. Turkmen gas exports to Russia decreased to 1 tcf per year, leading to a price increase. Despite diversifying export routes, Turkmen gas exports fell in 2010. In 2012, Russia purchased about 350 bcf of Turkmen gas. Turkmenistan sought alternative routes to Iran to reduce reliance on Russian pipelines. In 1997, Turkmenistan opened its first gas pipeline to Iran, increasing gas supplies in 2009. A second pipeline to Iran doubled export capacity. Turkmenistan exported about 318 bcf of gas to Iran in 2012. In 2013, a rail line was opened between Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan with plans to link to Iran. In 2006, Turkmenistan and China signed an agreement for Chinese investment in gas fields and a pipeline with a capacity of about 1.4 tcf per year. Turkmenistan began construction of a gas pipeline to China in 2007 with a capacity of 1.4 tcf per year. Gas delivery to China started in 2009, with plans to increase exports to 2.3 tcf per year. In 2012, Turkmenistan provided 752 bcf of gas to China, and in 2013, both countries agreed to boost Turkmen gas exports to nearly 2.3 tcf per year. President Xi Jinping announced an agreement to increase Turkmen gas exports to China to nearly 2.3 tcf by 2020 through a new pipeline. China inaugurated gas processing facilities at the Galkynysh gasfield and agreed to provide financing for further development. Turkmenistan is currently China's largest foreign gas supplier. Additionally, Turkmenistan expressed interest in building a trans-Caspian gas pipeline. Turkmenistan signed a memorandum with the EU in 2008 to supply gas through a trans-Caspian pipeline. President Berdimuhamedow expressed intentions to cooperate with European countries in the energy sector. The EU approved talks with Turkmenistan in 2011 to build a trans-Caspian gas pipeline, despite opposition from Russia and Iran. The EU Energy Commissioner praised the decision to build the trans-Caspian pipeline to bring new gas sources to Europe. Russia opposed the talks, claiming decisions about the Caspian Sea should be made by consensus among all littoral states. Azerbaijani border forces stopped a Turkmen ship conducting seismic work in the disputed Serder/Kyapaz oil area in June 2012. The disputed offshore Serder/Kyapaz oil and gas field has caused tensions between Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, leading to diplomatic protests. Plans for a trans-Caspian pipeline supplying gas to Europe have been affected. Turkmenistan began transporting oil through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline in 2010. Turkmenistan shipped millions of barrels of oil through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline from 2010 to 2013. They also proposed the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline, signing agreements with India and Pakistan in 2012. The TAPI pipeline aims for gas supply diversification and integration. Nuland praised the signing of the TAPI pipeline as a positive step towards energy diversification and regional integration. The agreement was signed in mid-November 2013 by Turkmenistan's Turkmengaz, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and the Asian Development Bank. Turkmenistan aims to diversify gas exports to Iran and South Asia due to expected economic slowdowns in Russia and China. Turkmenistan is constructing a rail line to Afghanistan to bypass Uzbekistan for oil shipments. The country follows a neutral foreign policy and maintains good relations with both East and West, including Iran and Turkey. Turkmenistan also aims to strengthen cultural ties with Turkmen residing in Iran. Turkmenistan maintains good relations with Iran, Russia, and China. Despite US pressure, Iran and Turkmenistan pledged closer ties in 2012. Turkmenistan sees Russia as a strategic partner but resists some influence. Turkmenistan joined the CIS but refused certain agreements. Relations with China have been positive. Turkmenistan has good relations with China, signing agreements on a gas pipeline and establishing a strategic partnership in 2013. The partnership includes cooperation on trade, energy, security, and culture, with a focus on combating terrorism, extremism, and separatism. Military training and cooperation were also pledged. Relations with Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan have been tense. Tensions between Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, and Uzbekistan have been ongoing due to rival claims over Caspian Sea oil and gas fields. However, there is potential for agreement on a trans-Caspian gas pipeline. Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan have also had disputes over regional influence and water sharing, with accusations of conspiracy and mistreatment of ethnic Uzbeks. Despite past conflicts, relations have improved, with discussions on boosting trade and cooperation. Calls have been made for region-wide talks to address water-sharing concerns before dams are built by Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. In 2013, Presidents Berdimuhamedow and Karimov emphasized strengthening mutual ties, including security cooperation against terrorism and drug trafficking. They highlighted the importance of improving transport links between their countries and to Iran, Turkey, and the Persian Gulf. Turkmenistan has been collaborating more with Kazakhstan and Tajikistan on southern transport routes. Turkmenistan also hosts the Regional U.N. Center for Preventive Diplomacy in Central Asia and approved a joint plan for implementing the U.N. Counter Terrorism strategy. Turkmenistan's armed forces consist of about 22,000 personnel. Turkmenistan's armed forces consist of about 22,000 personnel, including ground, air, and naval/coast guard forces. The army has tanks, vehicles, and artillery pieces, the air force has combat capable aircraft and helicopters, and the naval force has patrol boats. Turkmenistan purchased missile boats in 2011. Other forces include police, security troops, a presidential guard, and border troops. Turkmenistan joined NATO's Partnership for Peace in 1994. In January 2009, Turkmenistan released a new defense doctrine to enhance its national security. The military, which is conscript-based, is actively acquiring military equipment in line with the new doctrine. President Berdimuhamedow upgraded the navy/coast guard base in Turkmenbasy in August 2009 to combat smuggling, terrorism, and other threats. Reports suggest that the Turkmen navy may be the second-largest in the Caspian Sea after Russia's. In late July 2012, Assistant Secretary of State Robert Blake praised Turkmenistan for its humanitarian aid to Afghanistan and its plans for rail and energy projects, including the TAPI gas pipeline. He emphasized the country's potential for economic leadership in the region but also highlighted the need for addressing human rights issues. The United States offered assistance for democratization and human rights respect through annual bilateral consultations. In June 2010, Assistant Secretary of State Robert Blake emphasized the new beginning in the relationship between the United States and Turkmenistan, focusing on developing strong ties based on mutual respect and trust. Discussions included common concerns about stability in Afghanistan and opportunities for cooperation in economic and energy sectors. Opportunities for further cooperation in economic and energy sectors, including trade and investment expansion and assistance with economic development and diversification. Discussions on combating terrorism and narcotics, humanitarian affairs, human rights issues, and meeting with civil society leaders. Annual consultations between the U.S. and Turkmenistan focused on increasing economic and trade relations, social and cultural ties, and human rights protection. The Turkmenistan delegation met with U.S. officials to discuss economic cooperation, human rights protection, and regional security, including efforts in Afghanistan. They also engaged with American business representatives to encourage investment in Turkmenistan, with a focus on diversifying export routes. Turkmenistan participated in the 8th U.S.-Central Asia Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) Council Meeting in 2013. The country is part of the \"New Silk Road Vision\" and the Central Asia Counter-Narcotics Initiative. In 2012, 36 students were trained under the Department of Defense's Counter-Drug Assistance program. Security-related visits included the Commander of the U.S. Central Command in late March 2012. In late March 2012, the Commander of the U.S. Central Command visited Turkmenistan and met with President Berdimuhamedow. They discussed joint efforts to combat drug trafficking, terrorism, and organized crime, as well as Turkmenistan's contributions to stabilization in Afghanistan. U.S. Secretary of the Navy also visited Ashgabat in July 2012 to discuss partnership, maritime security, and regional stability. U.S. assistance to Turkmenistan totaled $351.57 million from FY1992-FY2010. In FY2010, U.S. aid to Turkmenistan increased to support counter-terrorism operations in Afghanistan, but overall foreign assistance has since declined. Aid amounts were $11.01 million in FY2011, $9.2 million in FY2012, and an estimated $6.02 million in FY2013, with a request for $6.455 million in FY2014. Various programs are covered, including Economic Support Fund, Food for Peace, FMF, Global Health, IMET, INCLE, and NADR. Training reports show Turkmen students receiving counter-terrorism and IMET courses in 2012. In 2012, Turkmen students participated in counter-terrorism and IMET courses, regional training on transnational threats, and counter-narcotics training. For FY2014, $1.9 million will be allocated for governance transparency, citizen participation, legal reforms, and civil society capacity building. Additionally, $900,000 will be used to enhance English language skills for education and employment. Economic support will focus on Turkmenistan's WTO accession, financial reporting standards, livestock improvement, veterinary care, and fruit and vegetable supply. The Administration has requested $1.82 million in peace and security funding for various programs. Turkmenistan initially hesitated to cooperate in a U.S.-led military campaign after 9/11 but later allowed humanitarian aid delivery to support anti-terrorism efforts in Afghanistan. In 2009, Turkmenistan agreed to facilitate land transit of humanitarian cargoes to Afghanistan. The US military's use of land routes through Central Asia has declined due to increased shipments through Pakistan and barriers imposed by Uzbekistan. Turkmenistan sold jet fuel and goods for military operations in Afghanistan, with $821 million in purchases made in FY2012. In 2012, Turkmenistan showed political will to enhance law enforcement against terrorism, improve border security, and combat terrorist financing. The Financial Action Task Force recognized Turkmenistan's progress in this area by releasing them from compliance monitoring. Despite some corruption hindering law enforcement efforts, State Border Service officers displayed increased professionalism. The Turkmen government established new frontier garrisons on borders with Iran and Afghanistan and collaborated with the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Technical Assistance to train Ministry of Finance officials in financial analytical and investigative techniques. Turkmenistan is a transshipment route for Afghan opiates destined for various markets. Regional drug seizures have declined, possibly due to decreased production in Afghanistan. However, drug usage remains stable or has increased in Russia and Central Asia. The Turkmen government has trained officials in financial analytical and investigative techniques to combat financial crimes and terrorist financing. The Turkmen government focuses on counternarcotics efforts, with a priority on stopping drug flow from Afghanistan and Iran. Seizures mainly consist of raw opium, with reports of increasing heroin trafficking for local consumption. Public awareness campaigns against illegal drug use have been conducted, but corruption is fueled by low law enforcement salaries. Allegations suggest links between law enforcement officials and the drug trade, prompting a desire for enhanced cooperation with international donors. The government in Turkmenistan adopted a law in March 2012 to reduce compulsory treatment for alcoholism and drug addiction from one-two years to six months. The Ministry of Health operates drug treatment clinics and a Psychological and Narcological Hospital in each province. Heroin users make up the majority of registered addicts.
