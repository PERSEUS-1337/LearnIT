    "content": "The United States has maintained foreign aid programs in Latin America and the Caribbean since the 1940s, with recent programs focusing on addressing poverty, health, economic growth, counternarcotics, and trade capacity building. The region is important to U.S. interests due to trading partnerships, immigration sources, narcotics production, and environmental concerns. U.S. support for development is a key pillar of the National Security Strategy post-9/11. Development challenges identified by USAID include promoting transformational development, strengthening fragile states, providing humanitarian relief, supporting U.S. geostrategic interests, and mitigating global and transnational threats. The main security threats to the United States are terrorism, weapons of mass destruction proliferation, and global criminal networks. The focus has shifted to strengthening weak state institutions to combat terrorist and criminal activities. Foreign aid reform categorizes countries into five groups based on development challenges, linked to strategic objectives such as promoting peace and security. This report tracks foreign aid funding levels to Latin America and the Caribbean over the last three years, funded through annual State Department appropriations bills. Congress is interested in aid levels, counternarcotics effectiveness, HIV/AIDS spread, and poverty alleviation in the region. The report will be updated with country-specific aid levels for FY2008. U.S. foreign assistance to Latin America has evolved over the years, with a focus on preventing Soviet and Cuban influence in the 1960s and supporting friendly governments in Central America in the 1980s. Aid was also provided to the U.S.-backed Contras in Nicaragua. The report tracks funding levels and trends in aid to the region, with a focus on counternarcotics, HIV/AIDS, and poverty alleviation. Since the 1980s, U.S. assistance to Central America has increased following political developments in Panama and Nicaragua. The region has made progress in resolving political issues but remains one of the least developed areas in the hemisphere. With the end of the Soviet Union in 1991, U.S. concerns about communist influence decreased, leading to a temporary decrease in assistance levels. Since 2000, U.S. aid has focused on counternarcotics activities in the Andean region. Assistance levels have not returned to those seen during the Alliance for Progress in the 1960s, with the average annual aid since 1990 being approximately half of that period. Since the 1990s, U.S. regional annual aid levels have averaged around $1.9 billion, increasing to $2.4 billion since 2000, mainly for counternarcotics efforts in the Andean region. The FY2008 budget request of $1.6 billion is consistent with levels since FY2006, but with an additional $550 million for counternarcotics in Mexico and Central America, the total request is $2.1 billion. Some countries are benefiting from new presidential initiatives, such as increased HIV/AIDS assistance for Haiti and Guyana, and Millennium Challenge Corporation compacts totaling $846 million for El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Honduras. Nicaragua, Honduras, Guyana, and Paraguay have received Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) compacts and grants totaling $846 million over five years. Assistance in the region has increased for counternarcotics, military training, and HIV/AIDS programs since 2000. The United States has funded counternarcotics programs with $6.7 billion from FY2000-FY2007, surpassing previous funding levels. The FY2008 budget request includes $1.04 billion for counternarcotics, with an additional $550 million for Mexico and Central America. Assistance for health programs in Mexico and Central America has increased significantly since 2000, reaching $1.04 billion, with a focus on HIV/AIDS funding. Security assistance has fluctuated but averages $161.9 million per year, lower than the 1990s average of $459.8 million. Military assistance has also increased, mainly due to higher Foreign Military Financing to Colombia, averaging $80.8 million annually since 2000. In FY2007, U.S. military assistance averaged $80.8 million, with a focus on counternarcotics programs in the Andean region, particularly Colombia. The Andean region receives 52.9% of the total aid budget, followed by the Caribbean (20.8%), Mexico and Central America (16.2%), and Brazil and countries of the Southern Cone (2%). Regional programs like trade capacity building and migration assistance receive 8% of the aid budget. The assistance requested for FY2008 is similar to the previous year, with the Andean region expected to receive 52.4% of the aid. The requested assistance for FY2008 is similar to the previous year, with the Andean region expected to receive 52.4% of the aid. If Congress approves the budget request and a $550 million supplemental request for Mexico and Central America, assistance to the Andean region and Mexico/Central America region would be comparable at 39% and 36% respectively. The Andean region is known for its rugged terrain, large indigenous communities, high poverty levels, and history of political unrest. U.S. assistance in the region has focused on narcotics since 2000, with support for Plan Colombia. The United States provides significant support to the Andean region through the Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI), which focuses on counternarcotics efforts in Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru. Assistance also includes economic development, health programs, and aid to countries like Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, and Panama. Peace Corps programs are maintained in several Andean countries. The Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) focuses on counternarcotics efforts in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, and Peru. Colombia receives the majority of ACI funding. Enforcement programs include drug crop eradication and interdiction of drug shipments, while alternative development funds support economic development programs in coca growing regions. Funding for ACI was $727.2 million in FY2006 and an estimated $721.5 million for FY2007. The FY2008 budget shifts support of alternative development programs from the ACI account to the ESF account. The FY2008 funding request for ACI is $442.8 million, a 39% decrease from FY2006 levels. This cut is due to the transfer of alternative development funds to the ESF account. The United States has allocated over $6 billion for ACI since 2000. Mexico and Central America are sources of immigration and narcotics trafficking to the U.S. Environmental concerns exist along the shared border with Mexico. Environmental concerns along the U.S.-Mexico border are prominent. U.S. assistance to Mexico, primarily for counternarcotics and law enforcement programs, has ranged from $60-70 million annually. The Merida Initiative could significantly increase aid, with an initial $500 million requested in FY2008. In FY2006, $39 million (58%) was allocated through the INCLE account for narcotics and law enforcement programs. In FY2007, approximately $37 million was spent on narcotics and law enforcement programs. The funding for CSH, DA, and ESF programs in Mexico remained at $27 million in FY2007. The Administration's FY2008 budget request reduces aid to Mexico by 30%, with significant cuts in Development Assistance (DA) and International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) accounts. Despite justifying the cuts due to Mexico's economic status, a new counternarcotics initiative for Mexico and Central America was announced in October 2007. The United States and Mexico announced a $1.4 billion multi-year plan to combat drug trafficking in Mexico and Central America in 2007. The M\u00e9rida Initiative aims to disrupt criminal organizations involved in drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, financial activities, currency smuggling, and human trafficking. Funding for this initiative in FY2008 is through the INCLE account administered by the Department of State's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law. The $500 million funding for Mexico under the M\u00e9rida Initiative includes equipment and training for law enforcement agencies. The Central American portion involves $50 million to enhance government capacity for drug interdiction and anti-gang strategies. Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Shannon pledged support for regional security coordination and community action programs. Central America may need $600-$800 million for increased law enforcement and equipment. The region consists of seven small countries with limited resources. Panama and Belize receive small amounts of U.S. aid but have distinct histories from the core countries of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. Costa Rica has a stable democracy. Costa Rica, a core Central American country, has a stable democracy and higher per capita income compared to Nicaragua. The other countries in the region are recovering from civil war, facing poverty and crime. Trade with the United States is crucial for all Central American countries, with the U.S.-Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement playing a significant role. The Central America Regional program focuses on promoting regional trade integration and enforcing labor and environmental laws as required by CAFTA-DR. The FY2008 Administration request for regional programs in Central America is for $10.7 million, including $5 million to support customs regulations. Funding will also combat HIV/AIDS in Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Belize, Costa Rica, and Panama. The House-passed bill would provide $8 million to combat crime and youth gangs in the region. The FY2008 Administration request for regional programs in Central America includes $8 million to combat crime and youth gangs, with a focus on prevention, police training, and judicial reform in countries like El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. The major recipients of U.S. bilateral foreign assistance in Central America are El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, with a total assistance of $173.6 million in FY2007 and an estimated $155.5 million in FY2008. In FY2006, DA assistance to Central America totaled $77.6 million, decreasing to $59.5 million in FY2007 and $49.4 million in the FY2008 request. Panama did not receive DA assistance. ESF funds in FY2006 and FY2007 went to Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Panama, with Guatemala receiving all ESF funds in the FY2008 request. El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua receive between $7 million and $12 million in CSH funds annually for HIV/AIDS and infectious disease prevention and treatment. Honduras and Nicaragua, facing high poverty and foreign debt levels, also receive CSH funds. Honduras and Nicaragua qualify for debt-relief under the HIPC initiative. They also receive economic assistance through the MCC, totaling $851 million. Aid cuts have been experienced since FY2006, with decreases of 43% to El Salvador, 19% to Honduras, and 35% to Nicaragua. The US provides military assistance to some Central American governments through IMET funding. The United States provides military assistance to Central American countries through IMET funding. Additionally, some countries like El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama have received Foreign Military Financing (FMF) funding. Guatemala had withheld Military Assistance Program (MAP) funds since 1990 due to human rights concerns, but received FMF funding in FY2008 after establishing an International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG). El Salvador is the only country in Latin America with troops in Iraq and has received increased Foreign Military Financing in recent years. The Caribbean region, with 16 independent countries and 13 overseas territories, includes some of the hemisphere's richest and poorest nations. The Caribbean region, with 16 independent countries and 13 overseas territories, includes some of the hemisphere's richest and poorest nations. The United States has provided significant foreign assistance to the Caribbean over the past 25 years, with aid programs focused on countries like Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and the Eastern Caribbean. In the 1990s, U.S. assistance to Caribbean nations declined to about $2 billion, with Haiti being the largest recipient. During the 1990s, the United States provided significant foreign assistance to the Caribbean region, with Jamaica receiving $1.1 billion, the Dominican Republic receiving $507 million, and the Eastern Caribbean nations receiving $178 million. The majority of the aid was economic assistance, with military assistance totaling less than $60 million. U.S. aid to the Caribbean region from FY2000 through FY2007 totaled about $1.9 billion, with increases in HIV/AIDS assistance, disaster relief, and support for Haiti. In the 2000s, the United States continued to provide significant foreign assistance to the Caribbean region, with a focus on economic aid. Congress allocated $100 million in emergency assistance for Caribbean nations in 2004, with significant amounts going to Grenada, Haiti, Jamaica, and other affected countries. Assistance to the Caribbean totaled $308 million in FY2006 and an estimated $337 million in FY2007. The Bush Administration requested almost $366 million in assistance for the Caribbean in FY2008, with a large portion allocated to Haiti. In FY2008, Eastern Caribbean nations would receive $3.2 million for a Peace Corps program, $0.6 million for International Military and Training (IMET) assistance, $0.5 million in counternarcotics assistance, and $0.5 million in anti-terrorism assistance (ATA). The Third Border Initiative funding would decline and be included in a Western Hemisphere Regional Program, with $1.750 million identified for the TBI in the State Department's FY2008 Congressional Budget Justification for Foreign Operations. Several Caribbean nations have become eligible for Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) assistance, but none have been selected for the program yet. In FY2008, Eastern Caribbean nations would receive assistance for various programs including Peace Corps, IMET, counternarcotics, and anti-terrorism. Several Caribbean countries, including Guyana and Haiti, have been potentially eligible for MCA funding since FY2004 but have not met the performance criteria to participate. Guyana received assistance in FY2005 to improve fiscal policy for MCA eligibility. In FY2006 and FY2007, the per capita income level for MCA-eligibility increased, making additional Caribbean countries potentially eligible but not approved for participation. Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, has been a top recipient of U.S. foreign aid. Assistance to Haiti, including food aid, increased from $72 million in FY2003 to $214.9 million in FY2007. U.S. assistance supports efforts to restore security and democratic institutions after the ouster of former President Aristide in 2004. The U.S. also funds programs to combat urban crime, drug trafficking, and trafficking in persons in Haiti. Haiti, a focus country under PEPFAR, receives increased assistance for HIV/AIDS, healthcare, education, and food aid through P.L. 480 Title II. U.S. aid also supports trade and employment opportunities, especially since the enactment of the HOPE Act of 2006. The United States provided significant financial assistance to Haiti through the Partnership Encouragement/HOPE Act of 2006, totaling almost $226 million in FY2006 and $214.9 million in FY2007. The assistance included funds for healthcare, police and judicial reform, job creation, HIV/AIDS combat, and urban crime mitigation programs. The House-passed FY2008 State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs Appropriations bill aimed to fully fund various assistance categories for Haiti, with additional funds allocated for Development Assistance and Child Survival and Health programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee report to the FY2008 foreign operations appropriations bill (H.R. 2764; S.Rept. 110-128) would provide $73.4 million in Economic Support Funds (ESF) for Haiti, $10 million above the Administration's request. $5 million would be allocated for programs to improve case management and reduce pre-trial detention in the Haitian judicial system, and $5 million would support USAID's watershed reforestation program in Haiti. Congress has closely monitored aid to Haiti and established conditions on assistance over the years. The United States has provided assistance to increase information on democracy, human rights, and free enterprise in Communist Cuba through USAID and NED. The assistance aims to support the Cuban people and isolate the government of Fidel Castro. USAID's Cuba program supports U.S.-based NGOs to promote democracy, civil society, and human rights activism, funded through ESF. Funding for these projects ranged from $5 million to $21.4 million in recent years. In FY2003, $6 million was allocated for Cuba democracy funding, increasing to $21.4 million in FY2004 due to re-programmed ESF assistance. In FY2005, $8.9 million was provided, followed by $10.9 million in FY2006 and $13.3 million in FY2007 for democracy programs. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported significant problems in U.S. democracy assistance for Cuba from 1996-2005, highlighting the need for better management and oversight. The Administration requested $45.7 million in FY2008 for democracy assistance for Cuba, following recommendations to support Cuban civil society and promote a democratic transition. Investigative reports highlighted high shipping costs and oversight issues affecting the program's effectiveness. The FY2008 State, Foreign Operations, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act would fully fund the Administration's request for $45.7 million in ESF for Cuba democracy programs. NED funding for Cuba has increased over the years, with $2.4 million allocated for 17 projects in FY2005. In FY2008, the area received a total of $31.2 million in funding, with a reduction to $18.5 million for FY2008. Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay are considered middle income countries and receive lower levels of assistance. Brazil and Paraguay are the top recipients in the area, with Brazil receiving Development Assistance and Child Survival and Health programs, while Paraguay receives Development Assistance, Child Survival and Health, and Economic Support Fund programs. Peace Corps maintains a program in Paraguay. Brazil also receives some ACI funding as a drug transit country. ACI funding in Brazil focuses on increasing capacity to interdict drug shipments, addressing poverty and social inequality, and health issues like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. Environmental degradation, particularly in the Amazon region, is also a concern. Paraguay faces stagnant growth and external debt, with U.S. programs focusing on economic growth and reproductive health. Assistance to Paraguay would decrease by 20% from $23.4 million to $9.7 million in FY2008. Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay receive minimal aid for military training and anti-terrorism programs. The United States also funds regional programs focusing on issues like trade, migration, biodiversity, and anti-terrorism in Latin America and the Caribbean. Funding in FY2007 was $110 million, with a requested $88 million for FY2008. Congressional debate often questions the effectiveness of foreign aid in reducing poverty and promoting U.S. interests abroad. Critics argue that foreign aid may be ineffective in reducing poverty and promoting U.S. interests abroad due to wasteful spending and poorly designed programs. Proponents believe that consistent implementation is key for long-term development success, but studies question the impact of aid on global poverty reduction. Some suggest that trade contributes more to sustainable economic growth than current aid structures. Aid programs often have multiple objectives beyond development, such as national security and human rights considerations. The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) aims to address concerns about corruption and lack of transparency in foreign aid. It links assistance to good governance and economic policy criteria, focusing on poverty reduction. Critics worry about fragmentation of resources and lack of coordination with traditional aid programs. Secretary of State Rice initiated a reform effort in January 2006 to address criticisms of the fragmented, uncoordinated, and opaque aid program. She created the Director of Foreign Assistance (DFA) position and a Bureau of Foreign Assistance (F) to better coordinate aid programs. The DFA, also serving as Administrator of USAID, has authority over State Department and USAID assistance programs, as well as providing guidance for foreign assistance from other government agencies. The DFA, under the direction of Secretary of State Rice, has limited input on aid provided by other government agencies. In 2006, a new Strategic Framework for Foreign Assistance was presented, categorizing countries based on development challenges. Rebuilding, transforming, developing, and sustaining partnership countries are identified for aid programs linked to U.S. strategic objectives. Partnership countries are upper-middle income countries with economic, trade, and security relationships with the United States. Restrictive countries are authoritarian regimes with human rights issues, ineligible for most U.S. assistance. A sixth category includes global programs. Countries are expected to graduate from one category to another. Latin American and Caribbean countries fall into categories like Rebuilding (Colombia, Haiti), Transforming (Bolivia, Brazil, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Uruguay), and Sustaining Partner (Argentina, Bahamas, Belize, Chile, Costa Rica, Eastern Caribbean, Mexico). The State Department categorizes countries into Sustaining Partner, Developing, and Restrictive groups based on development challenges. Each category is linked to strategic objectives such as peace, security, and economic growth. Some countries may receive assistance under multiple objectives. The reception to this framework within the development community is mixed. The development community has mixed reactions to the new framework for assistance programs. Some see it as a positive step towards addressing fragmentation, while others criticize it for not going far enough in addressing technical expertise and coordination issues. The Administration and Congress began reassessing U.S. policy towards the International Criminal Court in 2006 due to negative effects on relations with some ICC member countries. Support for aid restrictions on countries not signing Article 98 agreements has decreased. The FY2007 Defense Authorization Act ends the ban on International Military Education and Training assistance but restrictions on Foreign Military Financing and Economic Support Funds remain in place. The Nethercutt Amendment restricted economic assistance to ICC member countries without Article 98 agreements. President Bush waived these restrictions for 14 countries in FY2006. Aid restrictions continued in FY2007 and FY2008. The AIDS epidemic in the Caribbean and Central America is impacting economic and social development. The AIDS epidemic in the Caribbean and Central America, primarily transmitted through heterosexual contact, threatens future development prospects. Countries with the highest prevalence rates include Belize, the Bahamas, Guyana, Haiti, and Trinidad and Tobago. Response efforts involve support from governments, donors, and NGOs. U.S. government funding for HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean and Central America has significantly increased in recent years, reaching $132 million in FY2008. This includes support for focus countries like Haiti and Guyana through programs like PEPFAR and GHAI. In the 110th Congress, H.R. 848 (Fortu\u00f1o) proposed adding 14 Caribbean countries to the list of focus countries for increased HIV/AIDS assistance. The Millennium Challenge Account, administered by the Millennium Challenge Corporation, links funding to performance and results, allowing countries to develop their own development projects. The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) funds are focused on development goals without considering other U.S. foreign policy objectives. Concerns have been raised about potential cuts to traditional assistance programs to accommodate increased MCA funding. Funding for Development Assistance and health programs in Latin America is proposed to decline in FY2008. In FY2008, proposed cuts would reduce funding for countries in Central America, particularly those with MCC compacts. MCA eligibility is based on per capita income, with performance criteria in ruling justly, investing in people, and economic freedom. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) categorizes countries based on ruling justly, investing in people, and economic freedom. Specific measurements are taken from various organizations. Countries meeting eligibility requirements can receive assistance. Examples include compacts with Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador for rural development, property rights, and economic growth. Guyana and Paraguay are receiving aid to prepare for compacts. The U.S. provides significant counternarcotics assistance to Latin America through the Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) and International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) funding. This aid aims to prevent drug trafficking, combat terrorist organizations and organized crime involvement, enhance law enforcement capacity, reduce corruption, and support drug education and demand reduction programs. The Department of State's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) administers these funds. The M\u00e9rida Initiative, a new plan focused on Mexico, aims to increase U.S. counternarcotics activities in Latin America. In FY2006 and FY2007, the United States provided bilateral INCLE assistance to countries like the Bahamas, Guatemala, Haiti, Jamaica, and Mexico, with Mexico receiving the majority of the aid. However, there was a decline in funding for FY2008, with cuts in bilateral assistance to Mexico and Haiti. Mexico would receive $27.8 million in the regular FY2008 budget. The M\u00e9rida Initiative aims to increase counternarcotics aid to Mexico significantly. INL manages the Interregional Aviation support program, which operates aircraft in Latin America and globally for counternarcotics efforts. The program also supports border security operations in Pakistan and counternarcotics aviation programs in Afghanistan. In FY2006, $62.9 million was spent on interregional aviation support programs globally, with a request for $60.1 million in FY2008. The U.S. provides economic assistance to Latin America through USAID and the Department of State, focusing on poverty alleviation, HIV/AIDS, environment, and humanitarian relief. The Bush Administration's objectives for Latin America include strengthening democracy, encouraging development, and enhancing security through counternarcotics and military programs. Child Survival and Health (CSH) funds focus on combating infectious diseases, promoting child and maternal health, family planning, and reproductive health. Programs target children affected by AIDS and aim to reduce child mortality and maternal deaths through various interventions. The CSH funds support pneumonia and diarrhea prevention, oral rehydration, safe birthing, prenatal care, nutrition, and breast-feeding initiatives, as well as expanded access to family planning and reproductive health services. Development Assistance funds aim to improve trade, investment, agriculture, education, environment, health, and democracy, including trade capacity-building and agriculture programs promoting non-traditional exports. Basic education programs are also funded to strengthen preschool, primary, and secondary education. The USAID manages various initiatives in Latin America and the Caribbean, focusing on sustainable development, natural resource management, clean water access, anti-corruption, and strengthening democracies. Transition Initiatives support stabilization and post-conflict reconstruction programs, with Haiti being a major beneficiary of funding. The United States provides economic aid to countries of strategic interest through the security-related ESF program, managed by USAID and the State Department. 11 Latin American countries, including Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador, Mexico, and Peru, have received ESF funding for justice sector reform, free trade agreements, governance improvement, anti-corruption efforts, and human rights promotion. Food aid funded through the Agriculture Appropriations bill allows USAID to quickly respond to emergency food assistance needs for vulnerable populations in countries facing disasters. The Migration and Refugee Assistance program supports refugee relief activities, including resettlement, with a focus on internally displaced persons in Colombia. The Peace Corps sends U.S. volunteers to assist in various countries. The Peace Corps sends U.S. volunteers to developing countries in Latin America to provide technical aid and promote mutual understanding. The Inter-American Foundation provides grants for programs promoting entrepreneurship and economic progress in the region. The Millennium Challenge Account increases foreign assistance to countries pursuing democracy and economic growth. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) administers assistance for economic growth. President Bush launched the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in 2003, pledging $15 billion for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria treatment. The Global AIDS Initiative focuses on 12 African countries, Haiti, and Guyana. The International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL) funds programs to strengthen law enforcement capabilities globally, including the Andean Counterdrug Initiative. The International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL) funds programs to combat organized crime, money-laundering, and terrorist financing. It also supports initiatives to enhance border security, fight trafficking, corruption, and cybercrimes. INL provides funding to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the Organization of American States Drug Abuse Control Commission. Its current bilateral assistance in Latin America includes programs in the Bahamas, Guatemala, Haiti, Jamaica, and Mexico. Support INL manages the Interregional Aviation Support program with a fleet of aircraft for drug crop imagery and eradication in Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru, as well as border security in Pakistan and aviation programs in Afghanistan. The Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) aims to eliminate cocaine and opium production, enhance law enforcement, and seize traffickers' assets in countries like Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, and Peru. Funding is primarily allocated to programs in Colombia, with Venezuela excluded from receiving ACI funds in FY2008. The Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) aims to eliminate cocaine and opium production, enhance law enforcement, and seize traffickers' assets in countries like Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, and Peru. Funds are divided between programs supporting eradication, interdiction efforts, alternative crop development, and democratic institution building. Interdiction programs include training national police and military forces, providing communications and intelligence systems, supporting aerial eradication aircraft, and improving counternarcotics infrastructure. Alternative development programs focus on economic development in coca growing areas, assisting internally displaced persons, promoting the rule of law, and expanding judicial capabilities. Military assistance is provided through the State Department for Foreign Military and Anti-Terrorism Assistance. Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program provides grants to foreign nations to purchase U.S. defense equipment, services, and training. The program aims to assist key allies in improving their defense capabilities, strengthening military relationships, and promoting professionalism in friendly countries. In the Western Hemisphere, a significant portion of FMF funding is allocated for Colombia and the Andean region to support their efforts in establishing and strengthening national defense. The Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program aims to support nations in remote areas previously controlled by guerrilla organizations, paramilitaries, and traffickers. It also enhances foreign military capabilities in land approaches to the US and the Caribbean, known as the \"third border.\" Additionally, FMF provides equipment and training for peacekeeping operations. The International Military Education and Training (IMET) program offers training grants to students from allied nations to improve defense capabilities and promote democratic governance. The largest IMET programs in Latin America are for Colombia, El Salvador, and Mexico. Anti-Terrorism Assistance (ATA) is funded through the State Department's NADR program to build partner countries' capacity in fighting global terrorism by providing training, equipment, and advice to law enforcement organizations. Colombia has received training and equipment for anti-kidnapping units, with funding for an assessment of needs in the tri-border region of Brazil, Paraguay, and. The State Department proposed using additional funds for training and investigating terrorist networks in the tri-border region of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. Latin American countries benefit from multilateral sources of assistance, including the World Bank, the United Nations, and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). The IDB provides financing for economic, social, and institutional development projects in the region. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) provides loans and investments to promote growth in private enterprises in poor countries through its Fund for Special Operations (FSO) and the Inter-American Investment Corporation (IIC). The Enterprise for the Americas Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF), administered by IDB, offers grants and investments to businesses and NGOs in Latin America for small enterprise development, worker skills, and environmental management. The Organization of American States (OAS) is a regional organization of 35 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean focused on promoting democracy, human rights, peace, security, free trade, and addressing issues like poverty, drugs, and corruption, with the United States contributing a significant portion of its budget. The United States contributes 59% of the regular budget of the OAS and supports specific funds for democracy, economic prosperity, and demining efforts in the Western Hemisphere. The OAS also monitors disarmament in Colombia and provides assistance to Highly-Indebted Poor Countries through the HIPC initiative. The HIPC initiative was launched in 1996 by the IMF and the World Bank to provide relief to extremely poor countries facing unsustainable amounts of foreign debt. It encompasses 41 countries, mostly in Africa, but only those with sound fiscal policies and a poverty reduction plan may qualify. Latin American beneficiaries include Bolivia, Guyana, Honduras, and Nicaragua. The total costs are estimated at $51 billion, with the U.S. contributing a relatively small amount. Additionally, Congress created a new account in FY2006 with $95 million to promote democracy, governance, and human rights. In addition to other bilateral assistance, Congress allocated $95 million to promote democracy, governance, human rights, an independent media, and the rule of law. $3 million was designated for forensic assistance in Central and South America, and $2 million for programs in Venezuela by the National Endowment for Democracy."
