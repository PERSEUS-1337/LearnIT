    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Separation of Powers Restoration Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that the Constitutional framers vested Federal powers in three coequal branches of government to uphold and sustain the Constitution, as stated by a Supreme Court justice. James Madison also quoted Montesquieu in support of the separation of powers. James Madison emphasized the importance of separating legislative and executive powers to preserve liberty. The Constitution vests all legislative powers in Congress. A congressional committee print highlighted that the President's proclamations are not legally binding unless based on constitutional grants of authority. The Supreme Court has ruled that Congress retains exclusive authority to make laws necessary to carry out powers granted by the Constitution. Treaties or Executive Agreements cannot assign powers not specifically granted by the Constitution. SEC. 3. SEPARATION OF POWERS RESTORING RESCISSIONS. The War Powers Resolution is repealed, and all powers and authorities resulting from any national emergency declaration in effect on the date of enactment of this Act are terminated 90 days after such date. This termination does not affect ongoing actions, proceedings, rights, duties, or penalties incurred prior to the date of enactment. The term \"national emergency\" is defined as a general declaration of emergency made by the President or any other officer of the executive branch. Any power to declare a national emergency granted to the President or executive branch by existing laws is now solely vested in Congress. SEC. 4. REQUIREMENT OF STATEMENT OF AUTHORITY FOR PRESIDENTIAL ORDERS. The President must include a statement of the specific statutory or constitutional provision granting authority for each Presidential order. Nonconforming orders without this statement are invalid under congressional authority. SEC. 5. EFFECT OF PRESIDENTIAL ORDERS. Presidential orders have limited effect and do not constitute law, applying only to the executive branch. Exceptions include pardons, military orders related to the Commander in Chief role, and orders citing specific congressional authority. The curr_chunk states that certain orders must not violate the ninth or tenth amendments to the Constitution or delegate power to a foreign government without constitutional authority. SEC. 6. STANDING TO CHALLENGE PRESIDENTIAL ORDERS IMPACTING SEPARATION OF POWERS INTEGRITY. Persons who can challenge the validity of a Presidential order in court include Congress members if the order infringes on Congress' powers, exceeds congressional authority, or lacks statutory authority. State and local governments also have standing to challenge such orders. State and local governments, as well as aggrieved persons directly affected by a challenged Presidential order, have standing to challenge the order if it infringes on state powers or impacts liberty or property interests. The term \"Presidential order\" in this Act refers to any Executive order, Presidential proclamation, or directive, as well as any other Presidential or Executive action with normative effect outside the executive branch."
