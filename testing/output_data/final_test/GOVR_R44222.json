Congressional attention has focused on \"reverse payment\" settlements in patent litigation, where generic firms delay selling generic drugs in exchange for compensation from brand-name companies. The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 reformed patent and drug laws to balance innovation and competition in the pharmaceutical industry. Brand-name drug companies compensate generic firms with substantial payments to delay generic entry, termed \"reverse\" payments. Product hopping, releasing new patent-protected versions while discontinuing older drugs, can also delay generic competition. Complaints over product hopping raise questions about the therapeutic benefits of new drugs and the balance between public access to better medications and lower costs. Judicial opinions, such as the 2013 Actavis case and the 2015 Schneiderman case, have applied antitrust scrutiny to these practices, evaluating them under the \"rule of reason\" approach to assess their potential anticompetitive effects and business justifications. The report discusses the antitrust implications of product hopping in the pharmaceutical industry, focusing on recent judicial developments. It also covers the process of obtaining patent protection from the USPTO. A patent application must include a detailed specification and at least one claim that defines the invention. The examiner assesses if the invention meets patentability criteria such as novelty and nonobviousness, which require the invention to be new and not obvious to skilled artisans. The USPTO grants patents to inventions that are not obvious to skilled artisans and are new. Patent owners have the right to exclude others from using, selling, or importing the invention for 20 years. This exclusivity allows inventors to profit from their discoveries by charging higher prices. The introduction of generic competition leads to lower-cost substitutes for patented products. Patent owners must monitor competitors and may need to litigate to protect their rights. While a patent grants proprietary interest, FDA approval is required to distribute pharmaceutical products. FDA approval necessitates demonstrating safety and efficacy through preclinical and clinical investigations. The FDA evaluates test data in a New Drug Application (NDA) for marketing approval. Before the Hatch-Waxman Act, generic manufacturers had to file their own NDA. Some could use published literature for a paper NDA, but not all drugs had this option. FDA sometimes requested additional studies for safety and efficacy concerns. The Hatch-Waxman Act created an expedited pathway for generic drug approval called an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) to address concerns about the costly and time-consuming process for generic drug approval. The Hatch-Waxman Act established the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) pathway for generic drugs, allowing independent generic applicants to demonstrate bioequivalence to pioneer drugs without extensive clinical data. This process helps generic manufacturers avoid costs and delays associated with a full New Drug Application (NDA) and allows them to market their FDA-approved bioequivalent drugs once relevant patents expire. Congress also provided patent proprietors with a way to restore lost patent term, with a maximum extension period of five years. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows for a maximum patent term extension of five years to compensate brand-name firms for regulatory delays. This extension is limited to the approved use of the product. Special procedures were established to resolve patent disputes between brand-name and generic drug manufacturers. The Hatch-Waxman Act established procedures for resolving patent disputes in generic drug applications. NDA applicants must file a list of patents they believe would be infringed by generic drugs. The FDA lists these patents in the \"Orange Book,\" and generic manufacturers must certify their views on these patents. The Hatch-Waxman Act established procedures for resolving patent disputes in generic drug applications. Generic companies can certify that a patent has expired, agree not to market until expiration, or assert that the patent is invalid. Certifications are labeled as paragraph I, II, III, or IV. Approval for paragraph I or II certifications is immediate, while paragraph III requires waiting for patent expiration. Filing with a paragraph IV certification is considered patent infringement under the Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act incentivizes challenges to pharmaceutical patents by granting a 180-day exclusivity period to the first generic applicant filing a paragraph IV certification. This discourages subsequent generic competition and allows the initial applicant to potentially earn higher profits. The antitrust laws, including the Sherman Act and Clayton Act, address anti-competitive behavior such as reverse payment settlements and product hopping. These laws prohibit certain types of anticompetitive economic conduct, with Section 1 of the Sherman Act declaring any restraint of trade to be illegal. The courts determine if conduct constitutes an unreasonable restraint of trade. The determination of whether conduct constitutes an unreasonable restraint of trade is commonly conducted under the \"rule of reason.\" This approach requires the finder of fact to consider various factors, including the business's condition before and after the restraint, its history, nature, and effect. The rule of reason involves balancing the anticompetitive consequences of a practice against its business justifications and potential procompetitive impact. Certain restraints are deemed unlawful per se when experience predicts that the rule of reason will condemn them. The Supreme Court has established that certain agreements or practices are conclusively presumed to be illegal without elaborate inquiry under the per se standard. This includes practices like price fixing, group boycotts, and market division. Courts may also apply a \"quick look\" approach between per se illegality and the rule of reason, where defendants must justify their practices to avoid liability. Independent generic drug companies may face patent infringement suits from brand-name drug companies when filing a paragraph IV ANDA. If the NDA holder proves patent violation, a court injunction may prevent the generic company from marketing the product. In response, generic firms may amend their ANDAs to avoid infringement claims. Alternatively, courts may rule in favor of the generic firm if patents are deemed invalid or not infringed. In pharmaceutical patent litigation, independent generic firms may face infringement suits when filing a paragraph IV ANDA. If the NDA holder proves violation, a court injunction may prevent the generic company from marketing the product. Another resolution involves settlements where the generic firm agrees not to challenge the patent or produce a generic version in exchange for compensation from the NDA holder. In pharmaceutical patent litigation, generic firms facing infringement suits may reach settlements with NDA holders, receiving compensation in exchange for not challenging the patent or producing a generic version. Congress addressed these settlements in 2003 with the MMA, requiring DOJ and FTC to receive certain patent-based agreements. Section 1112 of the MMA covers agreements between brand-name drug companies and paragraph IV ANDA applicants. Section 1112(a) agreements under the MMA must occur between an ANDA applicant and either the NDA holder or an owner of an Orange Book-listed patent. These agreements are subject to notification requirements if they relate to the manufacture, marketing, or sale of the brand-name or generic drug listed in the ANDA, or the 180-day generic exclusivity period. Section 1112(b) requires agreements between two paragraph IV ANDA applicants regarding the 180-day exclusivity provision to be submitted to the DOJ and FTC. Certain agreements, such as those solely consisting of purchase orders, are exempt from this filing requirement. The MMA requires certain agreements to be submitted to the DOJ or FTC, failure to do so can result in penalties. The legislation did not establish antitrust standards for reverse payment settlements, leaving it to the courts to determine. The Supreme Court's decision in Federal Trade Commission v. Actavis, Inc. clarified the legality of these settlements. The Actavis case clarified that reverse payment settlements should be evaluated under the \"rule of reason\" approach, resolving a split among lower courts. The case involved Solvay Pharmaceuticals and generic firms Actavis and Paddock Laboratories settling patent infringement charges over the drug AndroGel. The Actavis case involved Solvay Pharmaceuticals and generic firms settling patent infringement charges over AndroGel. The FTC charged the parties with violating antitrust laws by agreeing not to market generic products for nine years. The District Court and Eleventh Circuit rejected the FTC's claims, citing the \"scope of the patent\" standard. The Supreme Court reversed the Eleventh Circuit's judgment on the Actavis case involving Solvay Pharmaceuticals and generic firms settling patent infringement charges over AndroGel. Justice Breyer accepted that anticompetitive effects fell within the patent's scope but stated that such agreements could still have adverse effects on competition if the generic firm successfully challenged the patent's validity or noninfringement. Justice Breyer emphasized that antitrust legality should not be determined solely based on patent law policy, but also by considering procompetitive antitrust policies. The Court highlighted that antitrust questions should be evaluated based on traditional factors like anticompetitive effects, market power, and legal considerations related to patents, rather than just the length or earning potential of a patent. The Court concluded that the Hatch-Waxman Act's structure supports subjecting reverse payment settlements to antitrust scrutiny. Justice Breyer cited five considerations for this, including the risk of anticompetitive effects from large and unjustified payments, inability to justify such payments, potential market power from patents, and the ability to assess anticompetitive effects based on payment size. The Court's decision supports subjecting reverse payment settlements to antitrust scrutiny, considering factors like the risk of anticompetitive effects from unjustified payments and the potential market power from patents. Justice Breyer rejected the idea of presumptively unlawful reverse payment settlements and emphasized the importance of assessing anticompetitive effects without automatically granting antitrust immunity. The Court's decision in this case concluded that the FTC must establish antitrust liability using the traditional rule of reason analysis for reverse payment settlements. Chief Justice Roberts, along with Justices Scalia and Thomas, dissented, arguing that such settlements violate antitrust law only under specific circumstances. They expressed concerns about the potential impact on generic firms challenging patents and the settlement of patent litigation. The Actavis ruling in patent-antitrust practice requires greater care in structuring agreements, potentially leading to more litigation in pharmaceutical patent cases. District court opinions post-Actavis continued to uphold reverse payment settlements as lawful, despite initial expectations of increased antitrust scrutiny. District court opinions post-Actavis continued to uphold reverse payment settlements as lawful, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in King Drug v. Smithkline Beecham addressed whether Actavis was limited to cash payments and dictated the rule of reason analysis. Many settlements involved non-cash consideration like payment for generic services. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in King Drug v. Smithkline Beecham rejected the idea that Actavis was limited to cash payments, stating that the rule of reason analysis could apply to non-cash considerations in settlements involving payment for generic services. In King Drug v. Smithkline Beecham, the Third Circuit rejected the argument that Actavis only applied to cash payments, stating that any unusual transfer of value in patent settlements is subject to antitrust scrutiny. This reasoning potentially applies to any value transfer in patent cases between brand-name and generic firms. King Drug v. Smithkline Beecham reinforces the Actavis ruling, extending its logic to various commercial arrangements. The Third Circuit's decision on reverse payment settlements has sparked debate on the scope of the rule of reason analysis in antitrust law. Lower courts have utilized Justice Breyer's \"five sets of considerations\" to assess market power, anti-competitive consequences, and justifications in these settlements. Justice Breyer outlined five key considerations for analyzing reverse payment settlements in antitrust cases, emphasizing the risk of anticompetitive effects, the inability to justify large payments, market power derived from patents, the court's ability to assess anticompetitive effects, and the potential for settling disputes without such payments. These factors were seen as the basis for adopting a rule of reason approach in the Actavis ruling. The Supreme Court outlined key considerations for analyzing reverse payment settlements in antitrust cases, emphasizing anticompetitive effects, unjustified large payments, patent-derived market power, court assessment of effects, and settling disputes without payments. District courts sometimes misinterpreted these factors as guidelines for applying the rule of reason, leading to unnecessary case-by-case analysis. The Third Circuit clarified that the Supreme Court's justifications should not alter the rule of reason analysis in King Drug v. Smithkline Beecham. The Supreme Court's guidelines for analyzing reverse payment settlements in antitrust cases should not be seen as part of the rule of reason itself. District courts should proceed directly to the rule of reason analysis to avoid imposing a heavier burden on antitrust plaintiffs in these cases. Concerns have been raised about brand-name drug companies developing new drugs to delay generic entry, despite FDA approval promoting the public interest in new medications. Brand-name drug companies engage in \"product hopping\" by introducing new patented drugs while removing off-patent drugs from the market. This practice aims to deter generic competition, but the FDA allows generic firms to file an ANDA for withdrawn drugs as long as they were not removed for safety or effectiveness reasons. Product hopping is a strategy used by brand-name drug companies to exclude generics by introducing new patented drugs and withdrawing off-patent ones. This strategy takes advantage of state drug substitution laws where pharmacists can dispense therapeutically equivalent generic drugs unless specified by the prescribing physician. Generic firms compete with brand-name companies through these laws, leading to brand-name firms \"product hopping\" to maintain their market dominance. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit's Namenda decision in New York ex rel. Schneiderman v. Actavis PLC addressed product hopping, where brand-name companies introduce new patented drugs to prevent generic substitution. This landmark decision may lead to increased enforcement of antitrust laws in product hopping cases. Namenda involved two versions of the Alzheimer's drug, Namenda IR and Namenda XR. Actavis introduced Namenda XR as a once-daily extended release version to replace the soon-to-be off-patent Namenda IR. The Attorney General of New York accused Actavis of using a \"soft switch\" strategy to promote Namenda XR over Namenda IR, leading to an antitrust lawsuit alleging violations of state and federal laws. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a preliminary injunction requiring Actavis to continue marketing Namenda IR until 30 days after generic entry. The Second Circuit affirmed the injunction, stating that Actavis' product switch from Namenda IR to Namenda XR was anticompetitive and exclusionary. Judge Walker found that removing Namenda IR would reduce competition and force patients to switch to Namenda XR. The Second Circuit found Actavis' switch from Namenda IR to Namenda XR to be anticompetitive, lacking procompetitive justifications. The decision violated the Sherman Act by impeding generic competition without legitimate business reasons. Future litigation may address issues left unresolved, such as the permissibility of a \"soft switch\" marketing approach. Aggressive marketing while maintaining older products may not violate antitrust laws. Critics argue new products may not offer significant improvements. Courts may consider new medicines' superiority in product hopping cases. The debate over brand-name firms supporting generic competitors by keeping older products on the market remains contentious. Federal courts apply antitrust principles to address product hopping and reverse payment settlements. Congress has options to address these issues. In the 114th Congress, the Fair and Immediate Release of Generics Act (S. 131) aims to discourage reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation. It grants generic firms the right to share regulatory exclusivity if they win a patent challenge or are not sued for infringement. Brand-name firms must enforce patents within 45 days of a challenge notification. The Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act (S. 2019) aims to address reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation. It would declare certain settlements as acts of unfair competition and amend the Federal Trade Commission Act to presume anticompetitive effects if an ANDA filer receives anything of value and agrees to limit research or development. Exceptions include the payment of reasonable litigation expenses not exceeding $7.5 million. The Prescription Drug Affordability Act of 2015, introduced by Senator Sanders, includes provisions similar to the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act (S. 2019) in addressing reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation. However, unlike S. 2019, this legislation creates a presumption that such settlements violate the Federal Trade Commission Act without the ability for parties to overcome it by showing procompetitive benefits outweigh anticompetitive harms. Congress has yet to address product hopping, leaving room for potential antitrust enforcement actions. The interaction between brand-name and generic firms is crucial for the US public health system. Federal oversight and active antitrust enforcement could discourage product hopping. The Hatch-Waxman Act mediates patent litigation and generic substitution between these rivals, balancing the need for medical innovation and access to medications. The public policy aims to promote medical innovation and ensure fair distribution of its benefits to consumers."
