This approach helps infer hidden models underlying datasets and devise tailored algorithms based on in-group interactions and statistical patterns of comparisons. Our framework, utilizing deep learning architectures, aims to achieve high performance in match prediction by tailoring algorithms to specific datasets.

It can also be adapted for rank aggregation tasks and other applications. The traditional approach in developing algorithms for predicting match outcomes and ranking alternatives has limitations. Existing algorithms are tailored to specific models, leading to inconsistent performances across different scenarios. Without expert domain knowledge, finding the right algorithm becomes a trial-and-error process. In this work, a unified algorithmic framework is proposed to address the limitations of existing algorithms for match prediction. The focus is on estimating the likelihood of a group of items preferred over another based on partially observed group comparison data. The complex statistical patterns in the data are influenced by two underlying models: the interaction model governing in-group interactions and the comparison model governing pairwise comparisons. The main contribution of the study is incorporating deep learning techniques into a framework design to accurately infer underlying models from real-world data for match prediction tasks. Insights are gained from analyzing existing state-of-the-art algorithms in related tasks, revealing a common reward-and-penalty mechanism in estimating individual utilities.

The curr_chunk discusses the use of statistical models for in-group interactions and group comparisons, specifically focusing on estimating individual utilities from group comparison data. Prior works by Huang et al. (2006), Li et al. (2018), and Herbrich et al. (2007) are referenced for their statistical analysis. The BTL model is extended to consider group utility as the sum or product of individual utilities. The BTL-sum and BTL-product models are used for in-group interactions, with a focus on group utility as the sum of individual utilities. Different scenarios of synergy among individuals in a group are explored, including the Thurstone model where individual utilities follow a Gaussian distribution.

The algorithm is developed based on cross entropy loss, with other metrics considered for evaluation. The algorithm focuses on predicting unobserved group comparison outcomes using a neural network architecture with modules R, P, and G. The architecture learns from observed group comparison data and utilizes cross entropy loss for evaluation. The architecture consists of three modules denoted as R, P, and G. Modules R and P have the same structure but different weights, while G has a separate architecture. The decision to include R and P was inspired by optimal algorithms in the BTL model. These algorithms share a mechanism of estimating individual utilities through reward and penalty terms. The algorithm design principles are based on rewarding individuals for contributing to their group's win and penalizing for contributing to their group's loss. Rewards and penalties vary based on group dynamics and individual contribution levels. Deep neural networks are used in separate modules to represent rewards and penalties. The algorithm design principles involve rewarding individuals for contributing to their group's win and penalizing for contributing to their group's loss. Deep neural networks are utilized in modules to infer unknown underlying models. State-of-the-art algorithms under extensions of the BTL model, like Rank Centrality, have been developed to achieve minimal sample complexity for top-K rank aggregation. The algorithm rewards individuals for contributing to their group's win and penalizes for contributing to their group's loss. Majorization-Minimization (MM) for the BTL-sum model has been developed, defining individual utility update rules. The update rule is similar to Rank Centrality, but with different reward and penalty terms. The MM algorithm for the BTL-product model has different reward and penalty terms compared to Rank Centrality. It rewards individuals based on their contribution to their group's utility estimate and penalizes for contributing to losses. The individual utility update rule is similar to Rank Centrality, achieving global minima in cross entropy loss. The decision to incorporate module G is to fit underlying models for match prediction task. Modules R and P quantify individual utility estimates for group comparison. Modules interact to predict winning probabilities. Module input/output dimensions are 2M, where M is an integer > 1. Value of M is dataset-dependent. \u03b1 = 1/dmax, where dmax is the maximum number of distinct items compared. Rank Centrality is an iterative algorithm used to obtain the stationary distribution of the empirical pairwise preference matrix. It utilizes reward-and-penalty mechanisms based on current utility estimates of individuals in a group comparison. The algorithm is designed to be scalable and robust against arbitrary orderings of items within a group through data augmentation. The algorithm for Rank Centrality is designed to be robust against arbitrary orderings of items within a group by creating extra samples with different item orderings.
