The Act \"America's Commitment to Clean Water Act\" aims to restore and maintain the integrity of the Nation's waters and redefine the waters subject to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. The Act aims to define and protect \"waters of the United States\" in accordance with the Constitution and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. SEC. 3. FINDINGS. Congress finds that the decisions of the United States Supreme Court unduly restricted the scope of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, impairing statutory protections for waters of the United States. Water is a vital resource for sustaining life, agriculture, energy production, recreation, and various other uses, moving through interconnected hydrologic cycles. The pollution, degradation, or destruction of aquatic systems in the United States can impact the integrity of the entire system, including small streams and their headwaters which play a crucial role in the ecosystem. This pollution has a significant impact on interstate commerce and the overall health of the waters in the country. Millions of people in the United States rely on the waters, including wetlands, for various purposes such as improving water quality, protecting human health, and creating economic opportunities. Source water protection areas with small streams provide water to over 117 million people. Recreational activities dependent on these waters generate billions of dollars annually. Protecting the waters of the United States from pollutants is crucial for implementing treaties and safeguarding territory and property, including parkland and refuge land under Federal ownership. Administrative and judicial interpretations support this protection. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act treats ground water separately from \"waters of the United States\" and does not consider it to be included in the Act. The Act and its amendments do not change existing interpretations of the law. The authority of the Secretary of the Army and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under the Act remains unaffected by the amendments. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. Section 502 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1362) is amended to define \"waters of the United States\" to include all waters used in interstate or foreign commerce, interstate and international waters, and intrastate lakes, rivers, and streams. The definition of \"waters of the United States\" includes intrastate lakes, rivers, streams, wetlands, impoundments, tributaries, and territorial seas. The definition of \"waters of the United States\" includes intrastate lakes, rivers, streams, wetlands, impoundments, tributaries, and territorial seas, as well as waters adjacent to these areas. Exclusions from this definition are waste treatment systems and prior converted cropland. The final authority for jurisdiction under this Act lies with the Administrator. A waste treatment system is a specific structure designed to meet the Act's requirements and documented by the permitting authority. The Administrator cannot make a determination if the system is not documented after the enactment of this Act. \"After the enactment of this paragraph, a waste treatment system or structure created in or resulting from waters of the United States must meet applicable standards. A waste treatment system existing before this paragraph may include systems created in waters of the United States if discharge meets standards similar to other discharges under this Act.\" The term 'prior converted cropland' refers to wetlands that have been altered for agricultural production without further manipulation, as defined by the Secretary of Agriculture. Prior converted cropland refers to wetlands that were converted for agricultural production before December 23, 1985, and met specific hydrologic criteria. Prior converted cropland refers to wetlands that were converted for agricultural production before December 23, 1985, and met specific hydrologic criteria, including ponding and saturation levels during the growing season. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to replace \"navigable waters of the United States\" with \"waters of the United States\" in various sections."
