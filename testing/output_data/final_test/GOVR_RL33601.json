    "content": "The Senate Committee on Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces held hearings on military space programs, overseen by the Department of Defense (DOD) and the intelligence community. The National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) builds and operates intelligence-collection satellites for agencies like the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the National Security Agency (NSA), all under the Director of National Intelligence (DNI). The DOD and intelligence community manage various space activities, including satellites for communication, navigation, early warning, weather, and reconnaissance. The 1990-1991 Persian Gulf War is considered the first \"space war\" due to improved space support. Organizing DOD and intelligence community for space programs has been a long-standing issue. Congress established commissions to review the NRO in FY2000. The NRO, NGA/NIMA, and \"Rumsfeld Space Commission\" reports were established by Congress to review U.S. national security space management and organization in the FY2000. Both military and civilian space programs share similar technology and launch vehicles for satellites. The NRO, NGA/NIMA, and \"Rumsfeld Space Commission\" reports were established by Congress to review U.S. national security space management and organization in the FY2000. Military and civilian space programs share technology and launch vehicles for satellites. Interest in space weapons to attack satellites or ballistic missiles declined after the Cold War but was rekindled in the 104th Congress. The Strategic Defense Initiative was announced by President Reagan in 1983 to study building a ballistic missile defense system. The Clinton Administration changed the name to the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, focusing on theater missile defense post-Persian Gulf War. The George W. Bush Administration renamed it the Missile Defense Agency for broad missile defense goals. The Bush Administration's new national space policy aimed to field offensive and defensive space weapons, sparking controversy. Representative Kucinich introduced a bill to ban weapons in space, but the House rejected the amendment. The issue of using weapons to destroy satellites gained attention after China destroyed a weather satellite in 2007, causing concern for US reconnaissance satellites. DOD budget does not specify \"space activities,\" making funding figures uncertain. DOD sometimes releases incomplete or revised budget information. Detailed program acquisition costs for weapon systems in FY2008 are available online. The FY2007 authorization and appropriations bills provide funding for DOD space activities without specifying figures. Congress passed conference agreements on the bills, which were signed into law by the President. Questions have been raised about DOD's management of space activities, leading to the creation of commissions to study the issue. The \"Rumsfeld Space Commission\" chaired by Donald Rumsfeld released a report in January 2001 with recommendations for managing DOD and intelligence community space programs. DOD planned to implement 10 of the 13 organizational recommendations, but concerns arose over cost overruns and schedule delays in DOD space programs. The Defense Science Board and Air Force Scientific Advisory Board commissioned a task force to review DOD space program acquisition, which found significant cost increases in several programs. In May 2003, a report highlighted cost-driven acquisition processes in space programs, with concerns about low cost estimates, eroded government capabilities, and long-term issues with the space industrial base. An update in August 2004 noted progress but called for better coordination between military and intelligence agencies. A Senate hearing in April 2006 discussed space acquisitions, with GAO's Cristina T. Chaplain testifying on DOD's challenges. Cristina T. Chaplain, GAO's Acting Director of Acquisition and Sourcing, testified about substantial cost and schedule overruns in DOD's space acquisition programs. Cost growth has neared or exceeded 100%, leading to a doubling of investment without increased functionality. Many programs have faced significant schedule delays, up to six years, delaying promised capabilities to the warfighter. DOD plans to launch sensors on two satellites in highly-elliptical orbits but will only procure up to three of the planned five geostationary satellites. Funds for the remaining satellites will be redirected to develop an alternative system with advanced technologies. The SBIRS-High program, scheduled for launch in 2009, aims to replace the Defense Support Program early warning satellites. However, the program has faced significant schedule delays and cost growth, raising concerns about its success. Despite test delays and technical difficulties, Congress continues to fund the program at high levels due to its importance. The President's FY2008 budget request for the SBIRS program includes $1.07 billion, with $587 million for RDT&E and $483 million for procurement. The proposal includes assembly, integration, and testing of GEO satellites, procurement of one SBIRS GEO satellite, and two HEO satellite payloads. The Transformational Communications Satellite program is planned as a follow-on to the AEHF program, aiming to provide greater communication capacity for the DOD. The Transformational Communications Satellite (TSAT) program aims to revolutionize DOD communications with higher frequencies. GAO reported issues with cost and schedule goals, but DOD is working to mitigate risks. The FY2007 budget for TSAT is $737.1 million, below the $867 million request. Congress requested a report on actions taken to address concerns raised in the TSAT Program Review. The Air Force has taken actions to address concerns raised by the TSAT Program Review Group and the GAO, including refining requirements, staffing the TSAT program office with experienced professionals, refining key performance parameters, and considering implications for other programs. The President has requested a budget increase for research and development in FY2008. The total appropriation for the Space Radar program in 2007 saw a 43% increase from the previous year. The launch of the first TSAT was delayed to early 2016, with plans for a satellite constellation to track mobile targets on the ground. The Air Force had not finalized the design or architecture of the satellites. The House Appropriations Committee criticized the program for cost overruns and missed milestones. Congress directed a joint report on roles and responsibilities in the program's development. The report requested by Congress on the Space Radar program, including coordination between the intelligence community and DOD, cost-share agreements, and a single responsive system, was due in March 2007 but has not been submitted yet. Funding for Space Based Radar will transfer to the Defense Reconnaissance Support Activities Program in FY2008, with classified amounts for the budget request due to integration into the National Intelligence Community. The Space Radar program received a budget increase in FY2007 to $186.4 million, up from $98.3 million in FY2006. The first satellite launch is planned for FY2016. The program is detailed in the January 2007 Congressional Budget Office report, \"Alternatives for Military Space Radar,\" which outlines different system architectures. The Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS) supports missile defense by tracking missiles and providing data for intercept assessments. Tracking missiles during the mid-course phase is challenging due to the lack of engine heat signature. Discriminating between warheads and decoys is also difficult. Cost estimates for the program are uncertain. In FY2008, the president requested a budget increase for the STSS program. Launch information was not available."
