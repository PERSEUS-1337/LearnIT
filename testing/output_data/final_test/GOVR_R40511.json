    "content": "This report discusses federal policy issues related to electric power transmission, including the need to improve reliability, reduce costs, and meet national energy goals. Proposals before the 111th Congress aim to change federal transmission law and regulations, such as the Clean Renewable Energy and Economic Development Act (S. 539) and the Senate Energy Majority Draft. Transmission development and regulation are complex and sometimes contentious policy areas, with six major topics covered in the report. The curr_chunk reviews six major transmission policy topics including planning, permitting, financing, system modernization, reliability, and smart grid. It discusses the physical and technical characteristics of the power system and regulation of electric power transmission. Generating plants produce electricity, transmission lines carry it to demand centers, and high voltage lines are crucial for moving large power amounts. The transmission grid in the United States consists of high voltage networks used to transport power over long distances. Most of the system operates on alternating current (AC), which can easily be adjusted with step-down transformers. A small portion runs on high voltage direct current (DC) lines, which are efficient but require costly converter stations to connect with the AC system. The grid was not systematically planned like the interstate highway system, but rather evolved as a patchwork of interconnected systems built by individual utilities to meet local needs. The transmission grid in the United States consists of three major interconnections: Eastern, Western, and ERCOT. These interconnections must be synchronized to rotate generators at 60 cycles per second to prevent damage and blackouts. There are limited connections between the interconnections, with only eight low capacity links. The grid is operated by about 130 balancing authorities, usually utilities that own transmission systems. The transmission grid in the United States is overseen by balancing authorities, with a single authority like ERCOT supervising entire regional grids. Ownership of the transmission grid is divided among private and public entities, with ownership patterns varying across regions. NERC regions, as shown in Figure 3, play crucial roles in maintaining power system reliability. The U.S. transmission grid is regulated by federal, state, and regional authorities. State regulation is typically overseen by public utility commissions, which set retail rates and issue permits for new transmission lines. Federal regulation focuses on the reliability of the bulk power system. The U.S. transmission grid is regulated by federal, state, and regional authorities. Publicly-owned utilities (POUs) issue permits for new transmission lines and are self-regulated by their governing boards. Federal regulation of the power industry is overseen by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which regulates wholesale electricity rates. FERC regulates wholesale electricity rates and approves transmission line projects. Its authority is limited to IOUs in the 48 contiguous states outside of ERCOT. FERC must approve transmission projects and establish rates, but multi-state permitting has caused delays. In the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Congress granted FERC \"backstop\" siting authority based on DOE studies of transmission system congestion. The DOE can designate National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors (NIETC) for areas with severe congestion. A special permitting rule allows projects in NIETC to bypass state approval if not acted upon within a year. Two NIETCs were designated in 2007, but as of early 2009, no projects had used the backstop process. In 2009, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that FERC had exceeded its authority in implementing the backstop process. The Fourth Circuit Court ruled that a state's rejection of a project cannot be appealed to FERC. FERC promotes competition in the electric power market through open access to transmission systems and the creation of regional transmission organizations. Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) oversee the operation of transmission networks in large states, ensuring open access to the grid and coordinating planning. FERC's authority covers all entities in the 48 contiguous states for reliability oversight of the bulk power system. Before EPACT05, NERC self-regulated system reliability, but after the 2003 blackout, FERC designated NERC as the Electric Reliability Organization to enforce mandatory standards. NERC, now known as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, has legal enforcement authority as the ERO, with all reliability standards and enforcement actions needing approval from FERC. NERC has delegated some reliability functions to its eight regions. Analysts suggest a need to expand the national transmission system due to a lack of major projects in the past decade. Increasing demands without significant equipment additions may pose reliability challenges, requiring reliance on special protection schemes. Special protection schemes may be relied on more to deal with challenges as the system operates closer to the edge of reliability. Transmission policy proposals include a federally sponsored planning process involving utilities, states, power developers, and community representatives to determine the need for additional transmission capacity. The proposed federally sponsored transmission planning process involves utilities, states, power developers, and community representatives to identify high priority transmission projects for renewable energy development and resolving grid congestion and reliability issues. The objectives of the planning process and planning authority are discussed in the report. The proposed transmission planning process aims to expand the grid to reach remote renewable energy areas like wind power in the Midwest and solar power in the desert southwest. Legislation like S. 539 focuses on developing transmission lines for National Renewable Energy Zones, with 75% of connected generating capacity being renewable. The plan includes objectives such as congestion relief but primarily focuses on serving remote renewable resource areas. Two concepts for expanding the transmission grid involve constructing a continent-spanning ultra-high voltage \"overlay\" system. The proposed transmission planning process aims to expand the grid to reach remote renewable energy areas like wind power in the Midwest and solar power in the desert southwest. Legislation like S. 539 focuses on developing transmission lines for National Renewable Energy Zones, with 75% of connected generating capacity being renewable. Two concepts for expanding the transmission grid involve constructing a continent-spanning ultra-high voltage \"overlay\" system of AC or DC transmission lines to move renewable electricity across the country. Critics argue that a renewable-centric approach to transmission planning could lead to costly facilities due to underutilization of transmission lines built for peak renewable power output. Critics argue that a renewable-centric approach to transmission planning may lead to underutilization of transmission lines, causing congestion and high costs. Studies suggest that annual congestion costs range from hundreds of millions to billions of dollars, with solutions not necessarily requiring massive transmission construction. In the Eastern Interconnection, a small increase in transmission capacity could greatly benefit consumers by reducing congestion costs. NERC defines transmission system reliability as having enough capacity and resilience to withstand failures. Solutions for reliability issues may involve building new substations or installing specialized equipment. When new transmission lines are necessary for congestion relief or reliability improvements, they are not always the only solution. The $820 million Trans-Allegheny Interstate Line (TrAIL) project involves constructing 210 miles of new transmission lines and substations to relieve anticipated overloads in the Washington, DC area. The project is expected to take five years from planning to operation and is seen as essential for meeting renewable development and reliability goals in the power system. A National policy commitment to develop extra-high voltage transmission is emphasized. In early 2009, a National policy commitment to develop extra-high voltage transmission infrastructure for renewable energy was emphasized. The focus on transmission planning may overlook non-transmission approaches to meeting energy needs, as seen in reactions to the \"Joint Coordinated System Plan\" for bringing wind power from the Dakotas to the East Coast. The plan to bring wind power from the Dakotas to the East Coast was criticized for not considering other options like eastern wind plants, demand response, and shorter transmission lines to renewable power in Canada. The National Governors' Association's \"infrastructure vision\" report also promotes decentralized solutions over big transmission projects. Utilizing conventional coal, nuclear, and natural gas-fired generation near load centers could reduce the need for interstate transmission lines. Transmission upgrades may still be necessary, especially for nuclear plants. Upgrades may still be necessary and expensive for nuclear plants, but they may be less intrusive than long-distance interstate lines for moving renewable power. The proposed interconnection-wide transmission plans should consider non-transmission solutions equally, implying a broader and more complicated planning process. Current regional transmission planning efforts are voluntary and cover only a few states, with no obligation for states to permit new projects. Proposals like S. 539 and the Senate Energy Majority Draft would mandate Eastern and Western Interconnection-wide transmission plans. The proposed Eastern and Western Interconnection-wide transmission plans would establish new federally authorized planning authorities responsible for coordinating and submitting plans to FERC for approval. These plans would shift from regional to interconnection-wide focus, aiming for more integrated and binding planning for new high voltage transmission lines. The proposed shift to interconnection-wide transmission planning would involve a more integrated and binding approach, with new projects receiving preferential permitting and financing. Proponents argue that centralized planning is necessary for grid development, but states may object to losing influence. Key issues for Congress include defining planning objectives and the scope of authority. The scope of authority of planning entities for federal transmission planning is a key issue. It can be centralized at an interconnection-wide level or conducted regionally. The planning process may need to extend beyond transmission planning to include solutions like demand response and distributed power. Preferential treatment in the planning process could distort transmission investment by incentivizing unnecessary features and costs. The planning process for federal transmission planning needs realistic schedules, budgets, and oversight to avoid distortions in proposals. Interstate transmission projects require siting permits from every state the line will traverse, which could lead to delays or cancellations if any state disapproves. Multi-state transmission permitting can cause delays or cancellations if any state disapproves a project. FERC's backstop siting authority has not been used in practice, and proposals for transmission reform aim to expand FERC's siting authority. The Senate Energy Majority Draft proposes expanding FERC's siting authority for transmission projects, allowing projects to go directly to FERC for approval if they fail to make reasonable progress in state permitting. Projects eligible for FERC permitting must be included in an interconnection-wide plan, while other projects would remain under state purview. Some suggest giving FERC permitting authority over all high voltage transmission projects, while others believe the current permitting process is sufficient. The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) passed a resolution urging caution in expanding federal jurisdiction over transmission infrastructure siting and planning. State regulators are seen as best equipped for this task due to their local knowledge and resources. Criticisms of FERC's siting decisions for natural gas pipelines and LNG terminals have led to calls for alternative agencies to handle new federal transmission siting authority. In considering additional federal transmission siting authority, Congress may need to decide whether to view the grid from a national or state perspective. The evolution of the grid into three synchronized interconnections raises questions about the appropriate level of oversight for long-distance power transactions. The issue may require a nuanced approach, with a state perspective for routine projects and a national perspective for high-priority interstate projects. The federal government's authority over new transmission construction, including permitting, is being questioned in relation to grid reliability. Accelerating the construction of new transmission lines is seen as crucial, with criticism of the current lengthy permitting process. Expanding federal authority is suggested to speed up the process and ensure the timely construction of new lines. The importance of accelerating the permitting process for building transmission lines is highlighted, especially in relation to national priorities such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting electric vehicles. The management of the permitting process, whether by FERC or another agency, is crucial for expeditiously processing applications. Between 1977 and 1998, real dollar investment in the transmission system by investor-owned utilities generally declined, reaching a low of $2.1 billion annually by 1997 and 1998. Despite concerns, transmission investment increased to $6.5 billion in 2007, with Congress providing construction incentives in EPACT05. Critics argue that FERC has awarded incentives to projects that did not require special rates. More growth in annual investment may be necessary. The estimated cost of expanding the transmission grid for renewable power delivery and other goals is in the tens of billions of dollars. Estimates range from $49 to $80 billion for the Joint Coordinated System Plan to bring Great Plains wind power to the East Coast. A DOE study projected transmission expansion costs of $60 billion by 2030 for wind power. Total transmission funding requirements for all purposes from 2010 to 2030 are estimated at about $300 billion. Financing policy issues include early funding for new projects and cost allocation for interstate projects to customers, especially for renewable power. The early funding issue for renewable power projects is exacerbated by the phased development pattern, as transmission lines must be built at once for maximum capacity. Regulatory solutions are being developed, but there is no standard approach. The Western Governors' Association has proposed federal involvement in addressing the funding problem. The Western Governors' Association has proposed federal funding and incentives for transmission developers to expand planned lines to accommodate future generation, including renewable power and potentially new coal plants with CCS technology. This could lead to similar transmission funding issues for both renewable and coal projects in remote areas. The most contentious issue is the cost of transmission financing. The cost allocation for new interstate transmission lines is a major impediment to development in remote areas. Resolving cost allocation disagreements is crucial for transmission siting. Current proposals integrate cost allocation into the transmission planning process. If cost allocation proposals are not submitted or rejected by FERC, FERC can order its own scheme. One suggestion is to allocate costs of new projects in an interconnection-wide plan to all customers, known as \"socializing\" costs. This approach aims to benefit all ratepayers in a synchronized grid and make transmission projects more acceptable by spreading costs and accelerating project approvals. The criticism of interconnection-wide cost allocation is that it may lead to less cost discipline and bias towards transmission funding over other solutions like demand response or local renewable power. Various cost allocation approaches are being explored, but none are standard or widely used. Congress is considering whether the federal government should help finance new transmission lines. The federal government is considering financing the expansion of the transmission grid and establishing a national cost allocation rule for new projects. Proposals suggest all ratepayers in an interconnection should pay for new projects to expedite development. However, there are concerns that this approach may bias investment away from other alternatives. Additionally, there are proposals for modernizing the transmission system under the \"smart grid\" concept. The smart grid encompasses technologies from advanced meters to software in control centers, giving the grid computer network characteristics. It allows better management of electricity demand, with self-monitoring and protection schemes to improve reliability. The concept involves software and small-scale technology like smart meters for homes and businesses. The smart grid involves small-scale technology like smart meters for homes and businesses, focusing on grid controls rather than new transmission lines. Implementation requires new electricity rate structures, especially for residential customers. The smart grid includes transmission monitoring, real-time grid condition monitoring, and improved automated capabilities. The smart grid includes real-time monitoring of grid conditions, improved automated diagnosis of disturbances, automated responses to grid failures, and \"plug and play\" ability for connecting new generating plants. It also enhances the management of wind and solar power. Consumer energy management involves the installation of smart meters with capabilities like signaling. The smart grid technology includes capabilities such as signaling customers about expensive or scarce power, automatically reducing electricity consumption, detecting distribution line failures, isolating failures to prevent blackouts, and facilitating the dispatch of repair crews. The smart grid technology aims to prevent blackouts and improve energy management by integrating distributed generation, net metering, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 supports the modernization of the power system with smart grid technology through research, development, and demonstration projects. The 2009 stimulus bill allocated $4.5 billion for smart grid technologies and related programs. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 reduced the depreciation period for smart meters and equipment from 20 years to 10 years, benefiting the power industry by $915 million over 10 years. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is leading the development of interoperability standards for smart grid equipment to ensure communication between utilities and control centers. Interagency efforts are underway to accelerate this work. NIST, DOE, and FERC are collaborating to speed up the development of smart grid standards. FERC plans to establish national interoperability standards once NIST's work progresses. FERC published a proposed smart grid policy statement and action plan in March 2009, focusing on prioritizing key standards development and proposing an interim rate policy. Comments on the statement are due back to FERC in May 2009. Advocates believe in the enormous potential benefits of the smart grid, with estimates suggesting a 10% annual increase in GDP by 2020. The Galvin Institute claims a modernized grid could reduce the need for massive infrastructure investments by $46 to $117 billion over 20 years. However, the evolving nature of smart grid technology means benefits and costs remain uncertain. Xcel Energy is developing a smart grid demonstration in Boulder, Colorado, highlighting the need to assess the available technology for the project. The smart grid project aims to determine the existing data architecture and scalability, with 60% already developed. The high costs of implementing smart meters are highlighted, with estimates ranging from $40 billion to $50 billion nationwide. Some utilities are replacing recently installed smart meters, indicating rapid technological advancements. Some consumer advocacy groups are concerned about the rapid changes in smart grid technology and the lack of firm standards. Critics claim that utilities may be eager to invest in smart grid technology for higher profits. Consumer advocates also worry about potential changes in utility rate structures with the implementation of the smart grid, questioning if consumers will respond to signals about expensive or limited electricity. Consumer response to utility price signals is crucial for the success of the smart grid concept. New rate structures, such as dynamic pricing, are being introduced to reflect real-time power costs. This shift is necessary as traditional fixed rates do not provide immediate economic incentives for consumers to adjust their power usage. Dynamic rates align electricity prices with market conditions, encouraging consumers to reduce usage during peak demand periods when costs are higher. Consumer response to utility price signals is crucial for the success of the smart grid concept. Dynamic rates incentivize consumers to adjust their power usage based on real-time power costs, encouraging them to reduce usage during peak demand periods. Critics argue that the benefits of demand response scenarios are uncertain, as lower income individuals may not have the flexibility to shift their usage to less expensive hours. Some argue that lower income individuals are more responsive to price signals for shifting power usage to cheaper hours. Concerns arise for the elderly or ill facing higher power bills or health risks. The effectiveness of smart grid technology in demand response programs remains uncertain, with varying levels of technology showing different savings. Industrial customers suggest implementing a cost-benefit test for smart grid investments. Customers recommend adding a cost-benefit test for smart grid investments to FERC's final policy. Congress has federal programs in place to develop the smart grid, with ongoing policy issues including program oversight and monitoring of smart grid cost/benefit. State utility commissions will make many smart grid investment decisions, while FERC jurisdiction will be involved in transmission systems and bulk power system reliability standards. The report discusses Congressional oversight of smart grid investments related to FERC jurisdiction and bulk power system reliability standards. It addresses grid modernization, evaluating current reliability, and the impact of changes in the energy market on transmission system reliability. The report highlights the lack of nationwide data on transmission system reliability, making it difficult to assess overall performance and identify trends in outages. While studies are conducted on specific parts of the grid, there is a need for uniform data to evaluate system improvements or deteriorations. This contrasts with the available data on generating plant reliability. The lack of nationwide data on transmission system reliability hinders the assessment of overall performance and trend identification in outages. Existing data on power plant reliability contrasts with the minimal data available for transmission system reliability, leaving policymakers without a full understanding of transmission reliability risks and how to improve reliability. NERC has launched a new Transmission Availability Data System (TADS) to provide data for improving transmission reliability. TADS reporting is mandatory for high voltage transmission owners in the 48 contiguous states. It may take up to five years to analyze trends and judge the effectiveness of TADS in collecting necessary data. The transmission grid may need modernization to improve reliability, as shown by the causes of the 2003 northeastern blackout. The full smart grid is not necessary for using intelligent technologies to enhance transmission system reliability. The 2003 northeastern blackout was caused by transmission line trips and overloads on the FirstEnergy utility system in Ohio. Factors contributing to the blackout included a lack of understanding of the system's strengths and weaknesses, operating at dangerously low voltages, and a lack of situational awareness by system operators. Monitoring and computer system breakdowns also played a role in the blackout. The 2003 northeastern blackout was caused by transmission line trips and overloads on the FirstEnergy utility system in Ohio due to monitoring and computer system breakdowns, training deficiencies, and procedural failures. FirstEnergy did not trim trees under its transmission lines, leading to line sagging and contact with trees. The Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) lacked real-time information to assess the situation, resulting in a cascading series of outages affecting millions of people in the Northeast. The 2003 blackout was caused by transmission line trips and overloads on the FirstEnergy utility system in Ohio due to monitoring and computer system breakdowns, training deficiencies, and procedural failures. The outage spread quickly due to sensitive automatic protection mechanisms tripping units prematurely, with little time for manual intervention. Factors such as malfunctioning computer systems, human errors, mis-calibrated protection systems, and inadequate tree trimming by FirstEnergy contributed to the blackout. Modernizing the grid is crucial to prevent future blackouts, as identified after the 2003 blackout. This involves updating technology and procedures within operating companies, rather than just building more power lines. By installing new technology, operators can have real-time data, advanced simulation tools, and automatic responses to problems in the power network. This approach is more cost-effective and immediate than investing in new infrastructure. The grid is being modernized with new technology and procedures to prevent blackouts. Control centers installed by WECC can monitor the Western Interconnection and respond to outages. They have the authority to direct grid operators to take actions to protect the system, but cannot remotely control equipment like circuit breakers. The transmission grid is being modernized with new technology and procedures to prevent blackouts. Control centers can monitor the system and respond to outages, but manual intervention is still required to reset equipment. Investing in monitoring and control technology may be a better solution than building new transmission lines for enhancing power system reliability. The traditional one-way power flow model is changing with the rise of Variable Renewable Generation. The rise of Variable Renewable Generation, such as wind power, is changing the traditional power system model. Wind plants' variable output requires improved forecasting, electricity storage, and quick start natural gas-fired plants. Demand Response is another factor influencing the power system's operation. The increasing use of wind power and demand response programs are changing the traditional power system model. Demand response allows customers to reduce output during peak demand, shifting the operating model from adjusting power plant output to matching available electricity supply. Real-time information and control over industrial and commercial facilities participating in demand response programs are key issues. The use of distributed generation, such as rooftop solar units and industrial cogeneration facilities, can impact traditional power systems by sometimes taking power off the grid and selling excess power to utilities. This poses challenges for standard utility technology, accounting, and rates, especially when the generation is connected to the distribution system designed for delivering power to customers. Distributed generation, like rooftop solar units, can create control and visibility issues for power systems designed for one-way delivery. Institutional challenges arise due to the lack of NERC standards for distribution-connected generation. States may need to implement net metering laws for owners to sell surplus power. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles present a unique challenge as their batteries can act as both a load and a source of stored electricity. System operators must adapt to manage this dynamic demand. Integrating non-traditional resources into the grid poses a reliability challenge as system operators must manage the integration of large amounts of distributed generation and demand response. NERC predicts that demand response will be crucial for system reliability in the next decade. Additionally, there are proposals to connect 145,000 MW of new wind capacity to the transmission grid by 2017. The transmission grid is expected to connect 145,000 MW of new wind capacity by 2017, equivalent to 14% of current total generating capacity in the US. Wind generation is forecasted to increase by 300% by 2030. Variable renewable generation, demand response, and distributed generation share less predictability than traditional resources. Improved monitoring and control of the grid could address this issue. Consideration is given to collapsing the 130 balancing authorities into a smaller number for better management of electricity supply and demand. Congress granted FERC authority over the reliability of the bulk power system after the 2003 northeastern blackout. Key policy issues include the lack of reliable transmission grid data and the need for modernization to improve grid reliability. NERC is working on collecting and analyzing transmission reliability data, which is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of FERC's standards. Modernized technology and management could be an alternative to building new transmission lines. Congress may need to ensure a balance between modernization and new construction in the transmission system to improve reliability. The power system is evolving towards a more diverse range of resources, including renewable power and distributed generation. Oversight may be necessary to ensure that reliability standards are developed for the changing grid. Certain types of distributed generation are not currently covered by federal reliability authority, a situation that Congress may need to address in the future. Proposals like S. 539 suggest a larger federal role in transmission planning on a broader geographic scale. The planning process for transmission infrastructure should be conducted on a larger geographic scale than before, with a focus on objectives like renewable power development and congestion relief. Questions arise regarding the authority of planning entities, the scope of the planning process, and potential distortions in transmission investment due to preferential treatment. The planning process for transmission infrastructure should be conducted on a larger scale with a focus on renewable power development and congestion relief. Questions arise about preferential treatment distorting transmission investment and the realism of managing and financing the planning process. Issues include federal vs. state authority in permitting and the need for realistic schedules and resources for effective planning. The grid's evolution into three separate synchronized interconnections raises the question of whether a state-by-state or national view is more appropriate. The issue of transmission system reliability and authority over new construction is also debated, with Congress granting federal jurisdiction over grid reliability. The federal government's control over permitting transmission lines for enhancing system reliability is a topic of discussion. The debate over permitting transmission lines for enhancing system reliability is centered on the need to accelerate construction to meet various objectives. Expanding federal authority over permitting is seen as a way to speed up the process, but it requires adequate resources for efficient application processing. The cost of building new transmission lines, which could run into billions of dollars, is a contentious issue. The debate over funding interstate transmission lines is contentious. Some propose federal government assistance in paying for new lines or expanding projects. Questions arise about the extent of federal financing and establishing a national cost allocation rule. One approach suggests all ratepayers in an interconnection should contribute to new projects to benefit the interconnected grid. The smart grid is a modernization concept funded by Congress, with policy issues including program oversight and cost/benefit analysis. State utility commissions will make many investment decisions, but federal monitoring may be necessary for certain programs. The smart grid modernization concept funded by Congress raises policy issues for oversight and cost/benefit analysis. State utility commissions will make decisions, but FERC will oversee investments and rate decisions. Congressional oversight is needed for actual costs, benefits, and performance. Key policy issues include the transmission system information gap and the need for modernization and reliability improvements. The implementation of modernized technology and management may be an alternative to building new transmission lines for grid reliability. Congress should ensure a balance between modernization and new construction. The power system is evolving with diverse resources, and oversight is needed to develop reliability standards for the changing grid. Congress may need to revisit federal reliability authority for certain types of distributed generation in the future."
