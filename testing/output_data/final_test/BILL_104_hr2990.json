    "content": "The \"Significant Regulation Oversight Act of 1996\" requires significant rules proposed by agencies to undergo congressional review and approval before taking effect. Congress aims to ensure that these rules align with the intent of the enacted law and are approved through established procedures. The \"Significant Regulation Oversight Act of 1996\" mandates that significant rules must receive congressional approval through a joint resolution before becoming effective. Agencies proposing such rules must submit a report to Congress including the rule, a summary, cost-benefit analysis, and statutory interpretation explanation. The \"Significant Regulation Oversight Act of 1996\" requires agencies proposing significant rules to submit a report to Congress, including an explanation of whether the interpretation is required by the statute or within permissible interpretations, and any other relevant information or requirements under other Acts and Executive orders. Upon receipt of the report, each House of Congress must provide a copy to the relevant committee members. The \"Significant Regulation Oversight Act of 1996\" mandates agencies to submit reports to Congress on proposed significant rules. If Congress does not approve a rule, no inference can be drawn from their inaction. CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL PROCEDURE FOR SIGNIFICANT RULES. The Congressional approval procedure for significant rules requires the majority leader of each House to introduce a joint resolution containing the text of any proposed significant rule within 3 legislative days. The joint resolution is then referred to the appropriate committee for consideration and may be reported with or without recommendation, or not reported at all. The Congressional approval procedure for significant rules requires the joint resolution to be reported by the Speaker of the House of Representatives or the Senate majority leader within 45 legislative days. If a committee fails to report the joint resolution within this period, it will be automatically discharged and placed on the calendar. A vote on final passage must occur within 90 legislative days of the joint resolution's introduction. In the House of Representatives, a motion to proceed to consideration of the joint resolution is highly privileged and not debatable. Debate on a joint resolution in the House of Representatives is limited to 4 hours, divided equally between those in favor and those opposing. Appeals on the application of House rules are decided without debate. Consideration of a joint resolution under this section in the House of Representatives is governed by applicable rules. In the Senate, a motion to proceed to the joint resolution is privileged and not debatable, with limited debate time of 10 hours. (C) Debate in the Senate on any debatable motion or appeal in connection with a joint resolution under this section shall be limited to 1 hour, equally divided between the mover and the manager of the joint resolution. The minority leader or designee controls the time in opposition. Additional time can be allotted by leaders during consideration of motions or appeals. (D) A motion to further limit debate on a joint resolution is not debatable, and a motion to recommit is not allowed. Amendments to a joint resolution are prohibited. No amendments allowed to joint resolutions under this section in either House. If the other House has passed a joint resolution with the same text, the procedure remains the same, and the final vote will be on the other House's joint resolution. The section is enacted by Congress as an exercise of rulemaking power, applicable only to the procedure for joint resolutions. It recognizes the constitutional right of each House to change rules relating to their procedures. SEC. 5. EXISTING RULES. Any existing rule may be revised or revoked in accordance with this section if a petition for review is filed. The Clerk of the House of Representatives or the Secretary of the Senate will determine if the petition meets the requirements, and if so, the majority leader will introduce a joint resolution for the revision or revocation of existing rules. If the joint resolution is not introduced, any Member of that House may do so. Any joint resolution introduced under subsection (b) for consideration in the House of Representatives and the Senate must follow the procedures outlined in section 4. A petition for review under subsection (a) must include the affected rule and its contents if the joint resolution is enacted, along with signatures from 30 Senators or 120 Members for the Senate or House of Representatives, respectively. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this Act, \"agency\" and \"rule\" are defined as per section 551 of title 5, United States Code. The term \"rule\" excludes specific types of rules related to rates, wages, prices, corporate structures, and accounting practices. The term \"final rule\" refers to any final or interim rule.
