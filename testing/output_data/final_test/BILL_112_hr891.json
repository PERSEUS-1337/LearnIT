    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Medication Therapy Management Benefits Act of 2011\". Congress recognizes the importance of medications in managing chronic diseases and the role of pharmacists in helping patients adhere to their prescribed therapies. Nonadherence to medications is a significant issue, with only 50% of patients in developed countries following their medication regimens. This lack of adherence results in high costs. Studies show that community-based medication therapy management services by pharmacists improve health outcomes and reduce costs associated with nonadherence to medications. Nonadherence leads to disease progression, reduced quality of life, and higher healthcare costs. Adhering to medication therapy can prevent unnecessary medical attention and human costs. Pharmacists improve health outcomes and reduce healthcare costs through various programs. The Asheville Project, for example, led to significant cost savings and increased productivity. Another project focusing on high cholesterol patients saw a substantial increase in medication compliance. In North Carolina, the ChecKmeds NC program saved millions in healthcare costs through pharmacist-provided MTM consultations for seniors. Enhancing the MTM benefit under part D of the Medicare program could save $10,000,000 in healthcare costs and improve health outcomes for seniors. Similar successful results have been seen in other programs using community pharmacists. Improvements in Part D Medication Therapy Management (MTM) programs are being proposed. Improvements to Part D Medication Therapy Management programs include targeted medication reviews by licensed pharmacists. The pharmacist should assess medication use quarterly, monitor unresolved issues, identify problems with new drug therapies, and address transitions in care. Additionally, there is a push to increase beneficiary access to MTM services and involve community pharmacies in providing these services. Chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, respiratory disease, arthritis, and mental health conditions contribute to high Medicare spending. Prescription drug plan sponsors must identify individuals who could benefit from medication therapy management. The Secretary's approval allows pharmacists to identify potential enrollees for medication therapy management interventions. Subparagraphs are redesignated for program development and automatic enrollment. The Secretary's approval allows pharmacists to identify potential enrollees for medication therapy management interventions, including medication reviews for dual eligibles and enrollees in transition of care. The prescription drug plan sponsor must offer any willing pharmacy in its network the ability to provide medication therapy management interventions, including medication reviews for individuals in transition of care. The prescription drug plan sponsor must reimburse pharmacists and entities for medication therapy management services based on resources used and time required. Performance evaluation for payment incentives is also required. The Secretary will establish measures and standards for data collection by prescription drug plan sponsors to evaluate performance of pharmacies and entities in providing medication therapy management services. The Secretary will establish measures and standards for data collection by prescription drug plan sponsors to evaluate performance of pharmacies and entities in providing medication therapy management services, beginning with the first plan year after the date of the enactment of the Medication Therapy Management Benefits Act of 2011. Measures will help assess and improve quality of care, reduce adverse medication reactions, improve adherence and persistence in chronic medication use, and reduce drug spending. Plan sponsors will use measures to compare outcomes based on the type of entity offering services and ensure broader participation of entities with better outcomes. The Secretary will establish measures for data collection to evaluate performance of pharmacies and entities in providing medication therapy management services. Measures will help assess and improve quality of care, reduce adverse medication reactions, and improve adherence in chronic medication use. The Secretary will support the continual development and refinement of performance measures, including medication use measures as part of broader health care outcomes measures. The Secretary will establish performance measures for pharmacies and entities providing medication therapy management services to improve quality of care and reduce adverse medication reactions. Pharmacies and entities furnishing these services may receive incentive payments based on these measures. Incentive payments for pharmacies and entities providing medication therapy management services will be based on performance measures established by the Secretary. Payments will be made from the Medicare Prescription Drug Account, with the possibility of using funds from other trust funds if deemed necessary by the Secretary. Incentive payments for medication therapy management services are limited to the amount determined by the Secretary based on reductions in expenditures under Medicare."
