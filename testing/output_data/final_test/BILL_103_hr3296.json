The Secretary may insure eligible refinancing mortgages under the Home Refinancing Assistance Act of 1993, with insurance provided for the portion exceeding 95% of the property's appraised value. The Secretary may insure refinancing mortgages under the Home Refinancing Assistance Act of 1993 if certain eligibility requirements are met, including approval by an authorized mortgagee and timely payments on the underlying mortgage for at least 36 months. The Home Refinancing Assistance Act of 1993 allows the Secretary to insure refinancing mortgages if the mortgagor meets credit risk criteria, has sufficient income to make payments, and uses the proceeds to pay off an underlying first mortgage on a 1- to 4-family residence. The Home Refinancing Assistance Act of 1993 allows the Secretary to insure refinancing mortgages for family residences that are not delinquent and located in stable real estate markets. The Home Refinancing Assistance Act of 1993 allows the Secretary to insure refinancing mortgages for family residences that are not delinquent and located in stable real estate markets. The refinancing mortgage should not exceed 95 percent of the property's appraised value as determined by the Secretary. For condominium units in converted rental housing projects, certain conditions must be met, such as the mortgage being executed more than 1 year after the conversion, having a tenant as a mortgagor, or being sponsored by a tenants organization. The Home Refinancing Assistance Act of 1993 allows the Secretary to insure refinancing mortgages for family residences in stable real estate markets. The refinancing mortgage should not exceed 125 percent of the property's appraised value and the outstanding balance owed under the underlying mortgage. Monthly payments under the refinancing mortgage should be lower than those under the underlying mortgage. The refinancing mortgage under the Home Refinancing Assistance Act of 1993 bears interest at an agreed rate, has a maturity not exceeding 35 years, and includes terms on maturity, amortization, periodic payments, and application of payments. The Home Refinancing Assistance Act of 1993 covers alterations, taxes, default reserves, delinquency charges, foreclosure proceedings, and other related matters as determined by the Secretary. Hardship provisions allow a mortgagor to be considered an acceptable credit risk if failure to meet requirements was due to circumstances beyond their control. The Home Refinancing Assistance Act of 1993 allows for refinancing mortgages under certain conditions, including alleviating circumstances causing payment failure, increasing income, and meeting additional requirements set by the Secretary. The insurance of these refinancing mortgages is covered by the General Insurance Fund, with premiums to be fixed by the Secretary. The Secretary determines the premium charges for refinancing mortgages, payable by the mortgagee in cash or debentures issued by the Secretary. Premiums received are credited to the General Insurance Fund. The Secretary determines premium charges for refinancing mortgages based on risk. If a refinancing mortgage meets requirements, it can be insured. If the mortgage is paid off early, unearned premiums may be refunded. The mortgagee is entitled to insurance benefits upon the sale of the insured property, either at foreclosure or by the mortgagor after default, as long as the sale meets certain criteria determined by the Secretary. Upon the sale of insured property, the mortgagee is entitled to insurance benefits, subject to specific criteria set by the Secretary, including appropriate adjustments, homeownership counseling, and assignment of claims to the Secretary. Upon the sale of insured property, the mortgagee is entitled to insurance benefits. The mortgagee's obligation to pay insurance premiums ceases, and the Secretary will either pay cash equal to the insured mortgage value or issue debentures. Cash payments include interest equivalent to debenture earnings. Debentures are also an option. Debentures issued under this section by the Secretary shall be negotiable, bear interest established by the Secretary, have a specified maturity, and be tax-exempt. Debentures issued under this section by the Secretary shall be in prescribed form and amounts, paid out of the General Insurance Fund, and fully guaranteed. The Secretary of the Treasury shall fully guarantee debentures issued in certificated registered form. In case of default, the Treasury will pay the holders and succeed to their rights. The Secretary also has other powers related to refinancing mortgages. The Secretary may make expenditures to protect their interest in insured mortgages and acquire property at foreclosure sales. The Secretary has the authority to secure payment of indebtedness under this section. Refinancing mortgages can be extended with terms set by the Secretary. Definitions for terms like 'mortgage' and 'mortgagor' are provided. The term 'underlying mortgage' refers to the first mortgage on a dwelling in a multifamily project or cooperative ownership housing corporation. The term 'refinancing mortgage' refers to a subordinate lien on a dwelling used to pay off advances or the unpaid purchase price of the same dwelling secured by a first mortgage.
