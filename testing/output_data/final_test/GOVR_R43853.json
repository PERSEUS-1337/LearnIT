Data for the executive department profiles were collected from authoritative sources, detailing full-time PAS positions and appointment actions during the 112th Congress. The Executive Schedule pay levels range from level I ($199,700) for Cabinet-level offices to level V ($145,700) for lower-ranked positions. The appointment action table provides information on each nomination, including nominee name, position, dates, and confirmation details. It also includes statistics on the time between nomination and confirmation, with average days to confirm calculated as mean and median. The mean and median are used to assess central tendency in data, with the median being less influenced by outliers. Titles for positions in a department may differ between tables due to various factors. The first table uses department-provided data, while the second relies on the Senate nominations database.

The report provides confirmation, nomination returns, and withdrawals data for each department, along with mean and median confirmation times.
