    "content": "Issue advocacy is distinguished from campaign intervention under the tax code. Campaign intervention involves publishing or distributing statements for or against a candidate for public office. Any advertisement explicitly endorsing or opposing a candidate is considered campaign activity. The IRS guidance on campaign activity states that endorsing or opposing a candidate is considered campaign intervention. The focus is on whether the activity shows a preference for or against a candidate, even if the ad only refers to party affiliation or distinctive features of a candidate's platform. This blurs the line between issue advocacy and campaign activity, making it difficult to discern. The IRS has released revenue rulings discussing the blurred line between issue advocacy and campaign activity. Determination is based on facts and circumstances, focusing on whether the ad supports or opposes a candidacy. These rulings reflect the IRS' position but have not been court-challenged. This lack of court approval may be relevant due to potential First Amendment implications. The IRS has issued rulings on the distinction between issue advocacy and campaign intervention, which may have First Amendment implications. Commentators have raised constitutional concerns about the vague campaign intervention standard, but no court has addressed this issue yet. Key factors in determining campaign intervention include identifying candidates, expressing approval or disapproval, and timing close to an election. The IRS has issued rulings on the distinction between issue advocacy and campaign intervention, considering factors like timing close to an election and identifying candidates. Another ruling addresses whether an expenditure for issue advocacy is subject to the 527(f) tax, with factors including identifying a candidate and their position on the subject. The IRS has issued rulings on the distinction between issue advocacy and campaign intervention, considering factors like timing close to an election and identifying candidates. Factors that determine whether an expenditure for issue advocacy is subject to the 527(f) tax include the candidate's position on the subject, timing of the communication, and targeting voters in a particular election. The distinction between issue advocacy and campaign intervention for tax purposes is determined by factors like the candidate's position, timing of communication, and voter targeting. The practical differences in IRS rulings may not have significant impact, as each case depends on specific facts and circumstances. Understanding whether an advertisement constitutes campaign activity requires analyzing the ad and considering the organization's overall activities. The IRS distinguishes between issue advocacy and campaign intervention based on factors like candidate references and timing of communication. Simply mentioning party affiliation or candidate features can be enough to identify a candidate in an ad. References to candidates or upcoming elections increase the risk of being classified as campaign intervention, but context must be considered before making any conclusions. The IRS distinguishes between issue advocacy and campaign intervention based on factors like candidate references and timing of communication. Simply mentioning party affiliation or candidate features can be enough to identify a candidate in an ad. References to candidates or upcoming elections increase the risk of being classified as campaign intervention, but context must be considered before making any conclusions. The example provided shows how these points come together, emphasizing the importance of context before arriving at any conclusions. The IRS distinguishes between issue advocacy and campaign intervention based on factors like candidate references and timing of communication. Simply mentioning party affiliation or candidate features can be enough to identify a candidate in an ad. References to candidates or upcoming elections increase the risk of being classified as campaign intervention, but context must be considered before making any conclusions. Determining campaign intervention would require knowing additional facts not discussed in the ad, such as whether mass transit and/or highway funding had been raised during the election to distinguish the candidates. If the answer is yes, then the IRS would likely find the ad to be campaign intervention, particularly in light of the ad including the group's position on the issue. The IRS distinguishes between issue advocacy and campaign intervention based on factors like candidate references and timing of communication. An example involves an ad urging people to contact an elected official, who is also a candidate, to support pending legislation. The ad was published shortly before a Senate vote on the bill and a primary election. The IRS ruled the ad was not campaign intervention. The IRS ruled that an ad mentioning a Senator's position on a bill shortly before an election was not campaign intervention, as it did not mention the election or candidacy. The ad's timing and focus on the bill were key factors. The IRS ruled that an ad mentioning the governor's support of the death penalty and urging people to contact him/her before an upcoming execution was not campaign activity. The ad coincided with an election where the governor was running. Another ad, not part of a series before scheduled executions, urged a moratorium on the death penalty shortly before the election. The IRS rulings suggest that it can be challenging for an ad to avoid being classified as campaign activity when there is no pending legislative vote or non-electoral activity. An example involves an education reform group releasing an ad supporting increased state funding for public education without indicating the governor's position on the issue. The IRS ruled that an ad supporting increased state funding for public education was considered campaign intervention because it was run shortly before an election, not part of an ongoing series, and not timed with a non-electoral event. The ad did not state the governor's position, but the issue had been raised by the opponent to distinguish themselves. The ad released shortly before an election without a link to a pending non-electoral action may not always be campaign activity. An example involved a union advocating for better law enforcement conditions through ads calling for increased federal funding, including one published before a Senator's reelection without indicating their position on the issue. No legislative vote or Senate activity was scheduled at the time. The IRS ruled that certain advocacy communications by a group were not campaign activity as they did not distinguish the Senator from opponents. Both the IRC and FECA play a role in regulating political activities of tax-exempt organizations, but terms in tax and campaign finance law may not always have the same meanings. The characterization or treatment of activities for campaign finance and tax purposes are interconnected. \"Independent expenditures\" are considered campaign intervention for tax purposes, while \"electioneering communications\" present a more complex situation with no clear standard in the IRC. The IRC does not have a clear bright-line standard for determining campaign intervention based on communications referring to a candidate. The timing and content of issue advocacy communications can lead to different classifications under FECA and the IRC. Reporting an ad as an electioneering communication to the FEC does not necessarily mean it will be treated as campaign intervention under the IRC. When determining if a 501(c) group has violated the primary purpose test by engaging in excessive campaign activity, the amount reported to the FEC may not accurately reflect the actual campaign activity for tax purposes under the IRC."
