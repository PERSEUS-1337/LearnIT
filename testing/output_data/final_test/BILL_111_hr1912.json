    "content": "The Act titled \"Complete America's Great Trails Act\" establishes the National Scenic Trail Conservation Credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The National Scenic Trail Conservation Credit allows a tax credit for contributions towards preserving National Scenic Trails. The National Scenic Trail Conservation Credit defines terms like National Scenic Trail, trail corridor, and qualified conservation contribution. The National Scenic Trail Conservation Credit defines terms related to qualified conservation contributions and qualified real property interests. Special rules include determining fair market value and making the election irrevocable. The credit for qualified conservation contributions may not be revoked. No deduction is allowed under this chapter if an election is made under this section. The credit is limited based on the taxpayer's regular tax liability and can be carried forward if it exceeds the limitation. The credit for qualified conservation contributions cannot be revoked and is limited by the taxpayer's regular tax liability. Any excess can be carried forward to the next taxable year, but not beyond the tenth year. Contributions of real property for National Scenic Trail conservation purposes are not disqualified solely based on the contribution type. The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, will study the effectiveness of the National Scenic Trail conservation credit in completing, extending, and increasing the number of National Scenic Trails. The Secretary of the Interior will study the feasibility and costs of making the National Scenic Trail conservation credit refundable or transferable. A report to Congress on the study results is due within 4 years. The National Scenic Trail conservation credit amendments will apply to contributions made after the enactment of this Act."
