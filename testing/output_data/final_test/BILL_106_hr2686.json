    "content": "The curr_chunk is about the creditability of service. The curr_chunk discusses the amendment to Section 8332 of title 5, United States Code, allowing employees or Members to receive credit for service performed between 1965 and 1987. To be eligible, individuals must have completed at least 5 years of civilian service and make a deposit to the Fund equal to deductions from pay required under section 8334. Employees or Members can make a deposit to receive full retirement credit for service performed between 1965 and 1987. If the deposit is not made in full, retirement credit is still allowed but the annuity will be reduced. The Office accepts certification from the relevant nonappropriated fund instrumentality regarding the service and compensation. The Office will prescribe regulations for individuals receiving credit for service under this subsection, ensuring they do not receive credit under any other retirement system. Applications must be submitted within 2 years of the effective date of regulations. APPLICABILITY TO ANNUITANTS AND DEFERRED ANNUITANTS. An annuity or survivor annuity based on service creditable under section 8332(o) of title 5, United States Code shall be recomputed upon application to the Office of Personnel Management.
