    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges California's significant economic impact and leadership in developing public policy in response to technological and societal advancements. State officials must navigate complex legal issues, considering the influence of California's laws on a national and global scale. California's renowned universities and law schools contribute to its role as a hub for legal and policy innovation. California is home to prestigious universities and law schools. The state faces a surplus of law school graduates, with only 5% of attorneys nationwide working for state governments. To address vacancies as older attorneys retire, California should encourage attorneys to enter public service. Establishing a law fellowship program can help the state benefit from the experience of its graduates for government improvement. The California Law Fellowship Program is established to offer licensed attorneys and qualifying law school graduates limited-term placements in public sector positions within state government. Participants are encouraged to seek permanent public-sector employment after the fellowship. The University of the Pacific McGeorge School of Law, in consultation with other California law schools, is requested to oversee the program. The California Law Fellowship Program aims to provide post-graduate educational experience for law graduates and offer legal assistance to governmental entities. The program is managed by overseeing funding, processing applications, and giving preference to current or former members of the United States military. Placement with a state agency is contingent on the agency's acceptance criteria. The California Law Fellowship Program, also known as the Program, aims to provide post-graduate educational experience for law graduates and offer legal assistance to governmental entities. Participation in the program by attorneys, state agencies, or public officials is not considered a gift of public money. State funds are not used to administer the program. A \"California Law Fellow\" is a participant in the program. The California Law Fellowship Program, established for law graduates from accredited schools, provides benefits to the Legislature. Participants are not considered compensation for legislators. A participant in the California Law Fellowship Program, duly authorized by the Senate Committee on Rules, the Assembly Committee on Rules, or the Joint Committee on Rules, is not considered an employee of the Legislature. The selection of a California Law Fellow must meet specific criteria approved by the relevant committees. The California Law Fellow program requires participants to adhere to conduct standards and disclosure requirements set by the Senate Committee on Rules, the Assembly Committee on Rules, or the Joint Committee on Rules. Section 8169 of the Government Code is amended accordingly. Section 8169 of the Government Code is amended to allow the director to lease state-owned real property within the core area for purposes consistent with the Capitol Area Plan. The lease terms and conditions will be determined by the director, including leasing to private parties and public agencies for various uses outlined in the plan. The director may sell state-owned real property within the Capitol Area Plan area designated for residential and commercial purposes at fair market value to a joint powers authority for development. Sales must not reduce the number of dwelling units for low-income households as required by Section 8193. The determination of the total number of dwelling units on property leased by the joint powers authority created under Section 8169.4 includes units sold at fair market value within the Capitol Area Plan area. The director cannot sell residential properties managed by the joint powers authority unless it leads to a net increase in residential units on the site. The director cannot sell existing residential properties managed by the joint powers authority unless a deed restriction is recorded for at least 45 years, ensuring the properties are used for residential purposes. The director's authority in residential leases is limited to the Capitol area. They must prevent involuntary displacement of tenants in the Capitol area from leases signed after January 1, 1978. The director can enter into long-term leases up to 60 years and allow financing by pledging or assigning these leases. The director must notify specific members of the Legislature before executing certain agreements related to state-owned property in Sacramento or Yolo County, with a minimum 30-day notice period. The director or designee may determine a shorter notification period before execution. A copy of the notice must be provided to anyone who requests it in writing. The Legislature aims to stimulate development in the Capitol Area Plan by allowing the director to sell property to a joint powers authority at fair market value to meet development goals. The Capitol Area Development Authority can request these sales with economic analysis, and the director can approve the sale if they agree with the analysis. The Legislature allows the director to lease residential units in the Capitol area to low or moderate-income individuals below market rates. Leases of state-owned property in the core area are subject to possessory interest taxes. The net proceeds from selling state parcels are deposited into the General Fund, and the department is reimbursed for any related expenses."
