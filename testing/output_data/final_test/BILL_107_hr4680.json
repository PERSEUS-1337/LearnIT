The Congress finds that strengthening undergraduate education in science, mathematics, and technology at associate-degree-granting colleges is crucial for sustaining the Nation's post-industrial economy. Nearly half of all U.S. undergraduate college students are enrolled in these colleges, and they educate a significant portion of the Nation's science and mathematics teachers. The Advanced Technological Education Program aims to improve science, mathematics, and technology education at associate-degree-granting colleges. Millions of students take core courses in these subjects, which are essential for future teachers and transfer students. Expanding this program is crucial for enhancing advanced-technology education. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines key terms such as associate-degree-granting college, Director, Foundation, and Program. SEC. 4. CORE SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS COURSES. SEC. 4 of the Scientific and Advanced-Technology Act of 1992 is amended to improve the quality of core education courses in science and mathematics. It includes provisions for instructors in science, mathematics, and advanced-technology fields. SEC. 5 of the Scientific and Advanced-Technology Act of 1992 is amended to establish articulation partnerships, providing students with research experiences and faculty mentors at bachelor-degree-granting institutions. Stipend support for students and summer salary support for faculty mentors are included. The Director will establish an advisory committee on science, mathematics, and technology education at community colleges, consisting of non-Federal members from academia and industry. The committee will assess the Program's activities, including its conformity to the Scientific and Advanced-Technology Act of 1992, the effectiveness of strengthening scientific and technical education at community colleges, and the dissemination of information by the Foundation and awardee institutions. The advisory committee established under the Program will make recommendations to the Director for improvements based on reviews and assessments. The committee will report annually to the Director and Congress on findings and recommendations resulting from the reviews and assessments. Within 6 months of this Act's enactment, the Director of the National Science Foundation must submit a report to Congress on efforts to disseminate project results, the effectiveness of national centers for science education, and compliance with specific requirements. Authorization of appropriations is also included. In Fiscal Year 2003, $50,000,000 is authorized for the Foundation's Program. Specific allocations include $5,000,000 for core science and math education, $3,000,000 for instrumentation acquisition, and $750,000 for support. In Fiscal Year 2004, $55,000,000 is authorized for the Foundation's Program. Specific allocations include $5,000,000 for core science and math education and $750,000 for research experiences for undergraduate students. In Fiscal Year 2005, $60,500,000 is authorized for the Foundation's Program, with specific allocations for instrumentation acquisition, research experiences for undergraduate students, and other purposes. In Fiscal Year 2005, $60,500,000 is authorized for the Foundation's Program, with specific allocations for core science and mathematics education, instrumentation acquisition, and research experiences for undergraduate students. The Advanced-Technology Act of 1992 was amended by section 5 of this Act."
