    "content": "Since its establishment in 1977, the Department of Energy (DOE) has faced criticism for its lax approach to counterintelligence, especially at its nuclear weapons laboratories. In 1998, evidence emerged suggesting China had stolen nuclear weapons secrets from DOE's labs, leading to a directive from President Clinton to restructure the counterintelligence program. This included implementing security measures like using polygraphs to screen employees. The Department of Energy (DOE) implemented security measures, including polygraph screening for employees with access to sensitive information. In 1999, a polygraph testing program was initiated for high-risk programs, testing 800 employees. The program was later expanded to include 3,000 DOE contractors with access to classified information. In 1999, Congress expanded DOE's polygraph program to cover 13,000 employees, including those in high-risk programs. Despite the legal requirement, Secretary Richardson proposed testing only 800 individuals, citing sufficient counterintelligence measures. Congress later passed legislation to align testing with their intent. In 2001, Congress expanded the DOE's polygraph program to include employees with access to \"Sensitive Compartmented Intelligence.\" Some DOE nuclear weapons laboratory employees criticized the scientific validity of polygraph testing. Congress directed DOE to revamp its polygraph screening program, considering recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Report in 2003 questioned the accuracy of polygraph testing, especially for personnel security screening. NAS highlighted issues with generic questions and the difficulty in determining truthful answers. The report also noted the complexity of predicting future behavior based on past actions like drug use or lying on a polygraph test. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Report in 2003 questioned the accuracy of polygraph testing for personnel security screening. NAS concluded that polygraph testing is not reliable in distinguishing security violators from innocent individuals and recommended using it only as a trigger for further investigation, rather than as a basis for personnel action. The report acknowledged the utility of polygraph screening as a tool for deterring security violations. The Department of Energy (DOE) revamped its polygraph program in response to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Report in 2003, which questioned the accuracy of polygraph testing for personnel security screening. DOE eliminated the use of polygraph testing for screening applicants and employees without specific cause in October 2006, requiring mandatory polygraph screening only under specific circumstances. The Department of Energy (DOE) revamped its polygraph program in response to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Report in 2003, which questioned the accuracy of polygraph testing for personnel security screening. DOE now requires mandatory polygraph screening only under specific circumstances, such as clandestine relationships with foreign entities, certain job assignments, random counterintelligence evaluations, and specific incident examinations. No adverse decisions will be based solely on polygraph results. Congress provided funding for a joint NSF and OSTP research study on developing new techniques for security evaluations, emphasizing the need for standardized protocols and considering variables like culture and gender. The study highlighted the lack of theoretical models linking human reactions to deception and recognized the deterrent value of polygraphy. The joint NSF and OSTP research study emphasized the need for standardized protocols in security evaluations and recognized the deterrent value of polygraphy. The out-going administration of President George W. Bush issued a legal opinion stating that a forty-year-old memorandum limiting polygraph tests is not binding on executive branch agencies today. Critics question the clarity of this opinion. The polygraph machine, developed in the early 1900s, measures physiological responses to yes-or-no questions to detect deception. Critics question the validity of polygraph testing, which aims to detect lies and reveal truth through physiological reactions. The polygraph examination is used to detect deception and reveal truth in various circumstances such as event-specific investigations, preemployment screening, and current employee screening. It is utilized by the Intelligence Community as both an investigative tool and a screening device, while the Department of Defense primarily uses it for investigations and screening employees for highly sensitive programs. The Department of Energy also uses the polygraph for investigating specific events like crimes. The Department of Energy began using polygraph screening in 1999 after intelligence suggested China stole secrets from weapons labs. This was in response to President Clinton's directive to strengthen counterintelligence. The program included organizational changes and screening employees with access to sensitive information. The Department of Energy implemented a polygraph screening program in 1999 to deter unauthorized disclosures of classified information, provide early warning of such disclosures, and expedite personnel security clearances. Employees facing unresolved CI issues could opt for a polygraph test for quick resolution. Adverse personnel action based solely on a polygraph result indicating deception was prohibited without reasonable independent efforts. The NAS Report highlighted the limited scientific evidence supporting the validity of polygraph screening, with only one flawed field study identified. The American Polygraph Association acknowledges the lack of evidence but blames limited research funding. NAS also criticized the lack of serious research efforts despite the ongoing debate over polygraph accuracy and the government's heavy reliance on polygraph testing for security screening. The NAS Report found that polygraph screening accuracy is insufficient for federal agencies, as it can lead to too many loyal employees being falsely judged as deceptive or major security threats going undetected. The NAS Report concluded that polygraph screening is not accurate enough for federal agencies, as it can result in loyal employees being falsely judged as deceptive and major security threats going undetected. The report also highlighted the potential for individuals to manipulate polygraph results through countermeasures, making it unsuitable for agencies like the DOE where the proportion of security threats is low. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the congressional Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) both found that polygraph screening is not accurate enough for populations with very low rates of security threats. OTA stated that the complexity of the polygraph examination process makes it impossible to establish its overall validity. The OTA study found that polygraph testing can vary significantly in terms of examiner training, test purpose, and question types. Research on polygraph validity also varies widely in results and quality, with conclusions about scientific validity needing to consider specific applications and research limitations. Supporters like the APA cite research showing polygraph accuracy ranging from 80 to 98 percent, but note that real-world conditions are hard to replicate in studies. The APA asserts that physiological measures and psychological principles apply in polygraph examinations for screening purposes, with improved accuracy rates due to computerized algorithms. Examiners use techniques to counter subjects attempting to undermine testing. U.S. intelligence agencies defend polygraph screening. The OTA study found that some intelligence agencies, like the NSA and possibly the CIA, use polygraph testing to elicit admissions rather than determine deception. NSA security adjudicators prioritize admissions over test results. Despite skepticism about its validity, polygraph testing is seen as useful for deterring security violations and increasing admissions. The Redmond Panel, convened by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, concluded that polygraphs have utility in deterring security violations and increasing public confidence in national security organizations. Despite some skepticism about its validity, the panel found that polygraphs are an essential element of a comprehensive counterintelligence program. Many DOE scientists questioned the polygraph's utility and validity, with a \"very negative\" attitude towards it among laboratory personnel. The Redmond Panel found that many DOE laboratory personnel have a negative attitude towards the polygraph, especially scientists who prefer scientifically precise techniques. Congress was considering reexamining the use of polygraphs as a screening tool in 2001. In response to Congress's directive, DOE developed a new counterintelligence polygraph program based on NAS Study recommendations. Despite NAS's advice against using polygraphs for screening, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham stated that polygraph screening would be retained as one of several CI tools. The DOE decided to keep polygraph screening as a counterintelligence tool, citing its role in minimizing classified data risks. Critics, including Senator Bingaman, expressed concerns about the accuracy of polygraphs and their potential impact on national security. The DOE faced criticism for its use of polygraph screening in employee screening, with concerns raised about the accuracy of the tests and potential security threats. Senator Domenici called for a reevaluation of the program, leading to a revised policy proposal in 2005. Deputy Secretary McSlarrow recommended limiting polygraph screening to employees with regular access to classified information. Mr. McSlarrow recommended retaining mandatory polygraph screening for employees with regular access to DOE's most sensitive information, reducing the number of affected individuals from potentially over 20,000 to around 4,500. He suggested that polygraph testing should only be used to trigger further investigation and collection of information, in line with NAS recommendations. DOE also considered implementing random polygraph testing as part of its counterintelligence evaluation program to deter security violations and increase admissions of such violations. Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman commended DOE for revising its polygraph testing policy, with Domenici expressing concern over the reliability of polygraph tests and commending DOE for reducing the number of individuals subject to testing. Bingaman acknowledged the policy change as a step in the right direction but maintained reservations about the accuracy of polygraph testing as a screening tool. DOE proposed a rule on polygraph screening, following recommendations from Mr. McSlarrow. The rule would limit polygraph testing to less than 1,000 employees with access to Top Secret information. The DOE proposed a rule for polygraph testing, allowing certain managers to identify individuals for testing with approval. The rule also included random CI evaluations for employees not qualifying for mandatory screening but with access to sensitive information. Around 6,000 employees would be eligible for random polygraph testing, with only a small percentage tested annually. The DOE proposed a rule for polygraph testing for employees with access to sensitive information, including specific incident examinations for potential clandestine relationships with foreign entities. After public comments, a final rule was issued in 2006 establishing CI evaluation regulations. The DOE issued a final rule in 2006 for CI evaluation regulations, eliminating random polygraph screening tests without cause and focusing on specific-cause criteria to align with the Intelligence Community and NAS's recommendations. This change significantly reduced the number of employees subject to testing, estimating between 2,000 and 2,500 employees to be polygraph-tested in 2006-2007. Additionally, the rule included a provision for making video and audio recordings of the tests. The final rule issued by the DOE in 2006 for CI evaluation regulations included provisions for recording polygraph examinations and allowing individuals to request test reports through FOIA. It also maintained requirements for specific incident polygraph exams and denial of access to sensitive information based on polygraph results. Congress may monitor the implementation of the revamped polygraph screening program. The DOE has focused polygraph testing on individuals in sensitive positions and established a for-cause examination policy. There is debate on whether the program should be further refined to reduce the number of individuals tested. Critics and supporters agree on the need for more research into deception detection techniques. The NAS Report recommended further research into alternative deception detection techniques, cautioning that improvements in polygraph accuracy may be limited. Alternative methods like brain activity measurements and facial expressions show promise but have not yet surpassed the polygraph. The NAS recommended further research into alternative deception detection techniques, suggesting that organizations without operational responsibilities should oversee the research. Supporters of the polygraph argue for additional research to improve its validity and reliability, citing difficulties in replicating real-world conditions. Congress funded research in 2003 to address this issue. In 2003, Congress funded research to improve the validity and reliability of deception detection techniques, including the polygraph. However, a 2007 Intelligence Science Board study found a lack of significant scientific research on the effectiveness of interrogation techniques used by the U.S. military and Intelligence Community in the past four decades. The Intelligence Science Board found a lack of scientific research on interrogation techniques used by the U.S. military and Intelligence Community in the past four decades. Critics suggest replacing polygraph screening with more thorough financial and travel record examinations and more frequent reinvestigations. They argue that polygraph results can lead to a false sense of confidence in identifying spies, potentially hindering other security measures. Critics caution that polygraph tests can be defeated through countermeasures, but supporters argue it is the best tool for detecting deception and remains important for counterintelligence. Some supporters believe in its utility despite questionable scientific validity, and the CIA claims classified research shows its accuracy."
