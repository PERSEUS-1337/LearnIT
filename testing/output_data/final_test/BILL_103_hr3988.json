    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"West Virginia National Coal Heritage Area Act of 1994\". The Congress finds that events in southern West Virginia's coalfields are historically significant for the US industrialization, union organization, and Appalachian culture. Preservation of this heritage is in the national interest. Assistance is needed to protect vestiges with cultural, historic, and architectural value. The West Virginia National Coal Heritage Area is established to preserve and interpret lands and structures with historical and cultural significance related to coal mining. It includes counties in West Virginia identified in a 1993 National Park Service study. The Area will be administered according to the Act, and there will be a contractual agreement in place. The Secretary of the Interior can enter into a contractual agreement with the Governor of West Virginia to assist in developing cultural, historical, and land resource management policies. This includes preserving and promoting buildings, structures, and sites with cultural and historical value for public use. The coordination of activities by Federal, State, and local governments, as well as private businesses and organizations, is aimed at furthering historic preservation and economic revitalization in the coal mining heritage Area. This includes developing guidelines and standards for projects consistent with National Park Service standards, acquiring real property with cultural and historical value for public use. The curr_chunk mentions acquiring real property with cultural and historical value for public use in the coal mining heritage Area. The resources eligible for assistance in the coal mining heritage area include those listed in a 1993 National Park Service study. Priority consideration will be given to sites identified as \"Conservation Priorities\" and \"Important Historic Resources\" on the study's map. A Coal Heritage Management Plan is also mentioned. The Governor of West Virginia must submit a Coal Heritage Management Plan to the Secretary within 2 years of the enactment of the Act. The plan should outline cultural, historical, and land resource management policies, project guidelines, and responsibilities for property administration. The Secretary will approve the plan. The Secretary will approve the Coal Heritage Management Plan unless it does not meet the objectives of the Act. Authorization of appropriations is granted to carry out the purposes of the Act.
