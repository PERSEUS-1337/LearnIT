The \"Mortgage Modification Reform Act of 2010\" defines terms such as \"covered trial loan modification,\" \"home loan modification program,\" and \"homeowner.\" It also defines \"permanent loan modification.\" The \"Mortgage Modification Reform Act of 2010\" defines terms like \"qualified counselor,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"servicer.\" It also explains \"servicer incentive payment.\" The \"trial loan modification\" is an agreement between a homeowner and a servicer under a home loan modification program, made at the time of an offer for a loan modification. SEC. 3. FORECLOSURE. A servicer cannot start or continue a foreclosure if the homeowner applied for a loan modification before receiving a foreclosure notice or within 30 days after receiving one, and the servicer has not determined that the homeowner does not qualify for a modification. SEC. 4. PROCESS FOR REVIEW OF IMPROPER DENIALS. The Secretary will establish a process for homeowners to request a review of denials for loan modifications by servicers. Qualified counselors will help identify wrongful denials, and servicers must provide supporting documentation for denials reviewed by the Secretary. If the Secretary finds that a servicer wrongly denied a homeowner's loan modification application, a penalty will be imposed on the servicer. Penalties will be imposed on servicers that do not timely evaluate homeowners. The servicer must evaluate a homeowner's loan modification application within 3 months of submission. They must then notify the homeowner of their qualification status. Servicers must prioritize evaluating applications in the order they are received. Penalties will be imposed on servicers for delays in evaluation. Prohibition: Servicers in a home loan modification program cannot prioritize applications based on homeowner income or loan value. Late fees: Servicer incentive payments reduced by 10% for each full month of delay in evaluating individual homeowner loan modifications. The Secretary may reduce a servicer's incentive payment by 10% for each full month of delay in evaluating individual homeowner loan modifications. If less than 75% of homeowners have been evaluated within 3 months of applying for a loan modification, the Secretary will reduce the servicer's incentive payment by 25%. (e) Collection and Report of Data. Each servicer must report data to the Secretary regarding the processing of loan modification applications. The Secretary will publish a monthly report based on the collected data. SEC. 6. REDUCED PAYMENTS FOR FAILURE TO EVALUATE HOMEOWNERS FOR PERMANENT MODIFICATIONS. If less than 70 percent of trial loan modifications offered by a servicer are evaluated for conversion to permanent modifications within 3 months, the Secretary will reduce the servicer's incentive payment by 25 percent. This reduction is in addition to any other penalties for violations of the Act. SEC. 7. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION RELATING TO PAYMENTS TO HOMEOWNERS. This Act does not require a reduction of payments made by the Secretary to homeowners for loan modifications."
