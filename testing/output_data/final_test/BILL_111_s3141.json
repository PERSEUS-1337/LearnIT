    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Low Income Housing Tax Credit Recovery Act of 2010\" and includes a provision for a five-year carryback of the low-income housing credit. The amendment allows for a 5-year carryback of the low-income housing credit, separate from other business credits, effective for taxable years after December 31, 2007. The amendment allows for a 5-year carryback of the low-income housing credit, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2007. SEC. 3. CARRYBACK OF NEW INVESTMENTS. Section 42(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a special rule for certain investments made in 2010 and 2011. Taxpayers entering into specific agreements during this period can benefit from low-income housing credits for tax purposes. The special rule under Section 42(f) of the Internal Revenue Code allows taxpayers entering into agreements in 2010 and 2011 to receive low-income housing credits in the taxable year of agreement, with certain exceptions. The provisions of this section apply to buildings with agreements described in subparagraph (A) as if the subparagraph had not been enacted. Excess credits at the end of the credit period will be recaptured. The amendments made by this section will recapture excess credits for taxable years starting after December 31, 2009. SEC. 4. Allowing low-income housing credits to offset 100% of federal income tax liability. The amendment allows low-income housing credits to offset 100% of federal income tax liability by treating the tentative minimum tax as zero and modifying the limitation under paragraph (1) to be the net income tax reduced by certain factors. The excess credit for the taxable year is increased by business credit carryforwards not allowed due to limitations under paragraph (1). The limitation under paragraph (1) is modified by clause (ii) to increase the limitation for taxable years with excess low-income housing credits carried back. This allows for determining the portion of excess credits for which credit will be allowed in preceding taxable years, following rules similar to those described in subparagraph (A). The excess business credit carryforwards are treated on a first-in first-out basis. Applicable low-income housing credits are determined based on buildings placed in service after a specific date and for certain taxable years. For taxable years 2008-2010, business credit carryforwards related to buildings placed in service are subject to specific conditions, including a binding commitment to invest equity by a certain date for future projects. For taxable years 2008-2010, business credit carryforwards for building investments must not exceed the proposed investment amount, with specific deadlines for claiming the credits. The amendment applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 2007, and credit carrybacks from those years."
