    "content": "Nanotechnology is a promising area of technological development with a global competition emerging among nations and companies to capture its value. Competitiveness is assessed based on indicators like revenues and market share, but data collection for nanotechnology products is limited. The U.S. industrial competitiveness in nanotechnology is difficult to assess due to the small fraction of total sales from nanotechnology products. Instead, national research and development investments, scientific papers, and patents are reviewed as indicators of U.S. scientific and technological competitiveness. The federal government has played a key role in catalyzing R&D efforts through the National Nanotechnology Initiative launched in 2000. The President and Congress have consistently increased funding for federal nanotechnology R&D, totaling $8.4 billion since the inception of the NNI. This investment aims to maintain U.S. technological leadership, create high-wage jobs, spur economic growth, address national needs, and improve health and the environment. Over 60 nations have also established their own nanotechnology initiatives following the U.S. model. Global public investments in nanotechnology are significant. Global public investments in nanotechnology, including those from the United States, reached $6.4 billion in 2006, with an additional $6.0 billion from the private sector. Some countries have strategic plans, science parks, and venture capital funds to accelerate nanotechnology research. Concerns about the U.S.'s competitive position have led to the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act to address key challenges and establish global technological leadership. The 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act aims to establish global technological leadership in nanotechnology, advance productivity and competitiveness, accelerate deployment in the private sector, and encourage research on nanotechnology advances. Congress is interested in assessing if current appropriations and activities are sufficient for these goals. Nanotechnology involves understanding and controlling matter at nanoscale levels, between 1 and 100 nanometers. This field has unique properties that differ from individual atoms or bulk materials. The report discusses current and potential applications, U.S. scientific strength, and options for Congress to promote competitiveness in nanotechnology. Nanotechnology research focuses on creating improved materials, devices, and systems by exploiting the unique properties of atoms and molecules. Current nanotechnology products offer evolutionary benefits, with potential for further improvements in the next five to ten years. Proponents believe that nanotechnology could lead to revolutionary advances beyond ten years, transforming existing products and industries while creating new ones. Nanotechnology could revolutionize industries by creating new products like organs, clothing, clean energy, water purification systems, memory systems, agricultural technologies, and self-healing materials. Nanotechnology has the potential to revolutionize industries by creating new products such as organs, clothing, clean energy, water purification systems, memory systems, and agricultural technologies. It also has applications in nutrition, reducing global hunger and malnutrition, self-healing materials, sensors for detecting toxins and pathogens, environmental remediation, national defense, homeland security, and space exploration. Congress has established programs and funding to address key issues in nanotechnology research and development. The National Nanotechnology Initiative, authorized through FY2008, is being considered for reauthorization by both the House and Senate in 2008. A companion report provides an overview of nanotechnology, federal funding, and issues related to its management and reauthorization. Congress is focusing on U.S. competitive position in nanotechnology, nanomanufacturing, commercialization, and environmental concerns. Nanotechnology is still in its early stages, with issues such as nanomanufacturing, commercialization, and safety concerns being key areas of focus. Despite a lack of data on revenues and market share, experts believe that the United States is a global leader in nanotechnology. A survey of U.S. business leaders in the field showed that 63% believe the U.S. is leading in this technology. Some experts believe the United States is leading in nanotechnology R&D and commercialization, but the lead is narrower compared to previous technologies. Charles Vest noted in 2008 that the U.S. doesn't have a significant lead in nanotechnology, unlike other emerging technologies. The federal government's efforts in commercializing nanotechnology products have been a significant test of the United States' public-private partnership. Evidence shows over 600 nanotechnology products on the market, with a majority produced by U.S. companies. Estimates suggest that nanotechnology revenues were $50 billion in 2006 and are projected to reach $2.6 trillion by 2014. The United States' efforts in commercializing nanotechnology products have been successful, with over 600 products on the market and revenues reaching $50 billion in 2006. Projections indicate that nanotechnology revenues are expected to reach $2.6 trillion by 2014. However, indicators such as research investments, scientific papers, and patents may not accurately reflect the nation's competitive position in emerging technologies. Basic research in nanotechnology may not lead to viable commercial applications as it focuses on gaining comprehensive knowledge without specific applications in mind. It can take decades for basic research to result in commercial opportunities, and not all scientific advances may be commercially viable. Basic research is generally available to all competitors and may not always provide a national advantage. Open publication and free exchange of research results are guiding principles of federally funded fundamental research and research conducted by U.S. colleges and universities. This approach allows for the rapid expansion of global scientific knowledge, but may not confer competitive advantage to the United States as work can be conducted globally. Supply chains are global in today's economy, and even if U.S.-based companies develop nanotechnology products, the economic value may be captured outside the United States. Federal policies and investments can make the United States more attractive for companies to conduct value-adding activities, leading to economic growth and job creation. U.S.-educated foreign students may return home to contribute to research and business creation. Many talented students from around the world were attracted to U.S. science and engineering programs post-World War II, contributing to U.S. global leadership. Today, foreign students educated in the U.S. have economic opportunities in their home countries. Federal support for universities, scientific and engineering research activities, and federal programs like SBIR and STTR can help develop leading scientists and engineers who may return to their home countries to utilize the knowledge gained in the United States. Small businesses may benefit from federally funded university research, leading to the development of commercially valuable technology. Start-up ventures with valuable nanotechnology capabilities may struggle to bring their advances to market due to lack of capital, infrastructure, or distribution channels. Foreign competitors may acquire U.S. companies with leading-edge nanotechnology, either through intentional strategies, hostile takeovers, or acquisitions of failing businesses. U.S. policies or other factors could hinder nanotechnology commercialization efforts. U.S. policies or other factors may hinder nanotechnology commercialization efforts, making it less attractive than foreign alternatives. Factors such as taxes, regulations, labor availability, and manufacturing infrastructure could prevent or discourage the commercialization of nanotechnology innovations in the United States. Companies may face obstacles in producing commercially viable products in the U.S. due to cost or regulatory issues, leading them to seek more favorable conditions abroad. Comparisons of national data may be misleading, as smaller nations with limited resources may struggle to pursue nanotechnology advancements. Comparisons of national data in nanotechnology may be misleading, as smaller nations with limited resources may struggle to pursue advancements. A country's competitive position in a specific area may not be evident from aggregate numbers. Rapidly developing nations investing in nanotechnology research may lack key elements for full capitalization on the investment. The globalization of research, technical talent, and production has made determining national competitive positions more challenging. For instance, leading-edge nanotechnology research may involve collaboration across multiple countries, making it difficult to attribute competitiveness to a single nation. This global distribution of knowledge workers, investors, and producers complicates the assessment of national competitiveness. The section discusses how international R&D collaboration can benefit the United States by improving productivity. It reviews input measures like national research and development investment as indicators of the U.S. competitive position in nanotechnology. Factors affecting the long-term value of these investments are also considered. The United States leads in public investments in nanotechnology R&D, but its global share has decreased as other nations increase funding. Many countries have established similar programs. Many nations have established national nanotechnology programs following the U.S. lead to harness its potential benefits for various sectors. Countries like Japan, Germany, and South Korea are investing significantly in nanoscale science and technology, while China and Russia have also increased their investments. Other countries like Israel, Singapore, and Taiwan are focusing on specific nanotechnology niches. Lux Research estimates that total 2006 public global R&D investments in nanotechnology increased by 10% over 2005, reaching $6.4 billion. Different methods of comparing international investment levels show varying perspectives on leadership. The United States leads in public R&D investments with $1.78 billion in 2006, followed by Japan and Germany. When adjusted for purchasing power parity exchange rates, China ranks second in public nanotechnology spending at $906 million in 2006. In 2006, China ranked second in public nanotechnology spending at $906 million, behind the United States. Global corporations invested $5.3 billion in nanotechnology R&D, showing a 19% increase from 2005. The United States led in private sector R&D investments with an estimated $1.9 billion. In 2006, global corporations invested $5.3 billion in nanotechnology R&D, with the United States leading private sector investments at $1.9 billion. Japan followed closely with $1.7 billion in private investments, driven by companies like Mitsubishi, NEC, and Hitachi. China, despite ranking high in public R&D spending, only accounted for about 3% of global private R&D investments in nanotechnology. Japan's strength in Li-ion batteries contributes to its leading position in nanotechnology innovations. Japan's strength in Li-ion batteries drives its leading position in MWCNT manufacture and investments in ton-scale production capabilities. Venture capital investment in nanotechnology reached $702 million globally in 2007, with U.S.-based companies receiving $632 million. The quantity of peer-reviewed scientific papers published by each nation's scientists and engineers is used as an indicator of scientific leadership, although it has limitations in assessing national competitiveness. The United States leads in peer-reviewed nanotechnology papers, with a 24% global publication output share, double that of China. However, the indicator has limitations in assessing the significance of contributions and potential applications of the research. The United States leads in nanotechnology papers with a 24% global publication output share, down from 40% in the 1990s. A quantitative analysis comparing the US to the EU shows a doubling of nanotechnology papers from 2000 to 2005, with the US maintaining a 22% share. The NBER working paper predicts the US will remain dominant in nanotechnology despite increasing international competition. The EU27's share of nanotechnology papers fell from 32% to 25% from 2000 to 2005, while China's share rose from 11% to 20%. The EU27 led the United States in paper output, but its share has been declining. China's share is approaching that of the US and EU27. Evaluametrics' analysis suggests China may have surpassed the US in paper share in 2007. The US, EU27, and China led in paper output in 2006, with the US at 25%, EU27 at 29%, and China at 23%. The US had more papers in biological and medical disciplines. The United States, China, and the EU27 showed varying levels of commitment to nanotechnology research. South Korea, China, and Japan demonstrated the highest relative commitment, while the US and EU27 fell below the world average. The quality and value of peer-reviewed papers are important indicators of global leadership in nanotechnology. The analysis by Evaluametrics shows that papers from the United States are cited more frequently than those from China, the EU27, and the rest of the world across various disciplines. The U.S. lead is particularly strong in biology, while China falls below the world average in citations. The EU27 performs near the world average in engineering and physics, and slightly higher in chemistry. The U.S. has a higher percentage of papers with 10 or more citations compared to the EU27 and China. The quality of a nation's papers can be measured by the share of papers in influential journals, with the United States accounting for over 50% of nanotechnology-related papers in top journals in 2004. However, the U.S. share of papers has decreased as other countries have increased their production at a faster rate. Patent counts are also used to assess a nation's competitive position, with patents granted by the USPTO indicating innovation and ownership rights. Patents are indicators of future value and national strength in technology. The United States leads in patents issued by the USPTO, especially in nanotechnology-related patents. U.S. inventors have the most nanotechnology-related patent publications globally and show a strong pursuit of international intellectual property protection. The United States leads in nanotechnology patents, followed by Japan, Germany, Korea, and France. There has been rapid growth in nanotechnology patents in the USPTO and EPO databases, with U.S. assignees accounting for two-thirds of all patents in the USPTO database. In 2004, U.S. assignees held 66.9% of USPTO nanotechnology patents. In 2003, the United States, Japan, Germany, Canada, and France continued to rank in the top five for nanotechnology patents. The Republic of Korea and the Netherlands moved up to sixth and seventh places, with Ireland and China entering the top 20 nations for the first time. U.S. nanotechnology patents dominated citations, showing strong interactions with Japanese and German patents. Not all patents have equal value, with some being \"blockbusters\" that define products and industries, while others offer only moderate value. Patents vary in value, with some being highly valuable while others offer only moderate benefits. Patent counts do not reflect the relative value of each patent, and a high count does not necessarily mean more benefits. Companies may choose not to patent valuable ideas to avoid public exposure and potential competition. Additionally, companies can engineer around patents or block original patent holders from making improvements by filing their own patents. The importance of protecting intellectual property through patents is highlighted, as companies may choose to hold valuable ideas as trade secrets instead. The debate over nanotechnology funding and competitiveness is also discussed, with the U.S. government facing challenges in ensuring its position in the field. The federal government's role in promoting U.S. competitiveness in nanotechnology is a topic of debate. Some argue for limited funding for basic research and workforce development, while others advocate for funding development efforts towards commercial products. There are differing views on the government's role in establishing a healthy business environment and allowing market forces to drive competitiveness. The debate over the federal government's role in promoting U.S. competitiveness in nanotechnology includes concerns about health, safety, and the environment. Some advocate for increased federal funding for environmental, health, and safety research, while others prefer a more cautious approach to the development and commercialization of nanotechnology. Advocates for increased federal support argue for funding downstream research closer to commercial products. Advocates for increased federal funding argue that research breakthroughs often fail to reach the market due to inadequate funding mechanisms. They believe that short-term investor demands hinder long-term technology development projects needed for future viability. Advocates for increased federal funding argue that federal investments can reduce technical risk for promising research and early-stage technologies, helping them overcome barriers to reaching the marketplace and capturing economic and societal benefits. Economists suggest that the private sector under-invests in R&D due to benefits being captured by others, but as research nears commercialization, private sector incentives increase, reducing the rationale for federal funding. The development of emerging technologies may be beyond the ability of any single company or industry due to high cost, risk, and lack of expertise. Federal funding is justified to overcome barriers and promote collaborative research efforts. Opposition to expanded federal R&D efforts comes from various perspectives. Opposition to expanded federal R&D efforts comes from various perspectives, including concerns about effectiveness and counterproductivity. Some economists argue that government allocation of investment ignoring market signals can hinder growth by diverting resources from more productive uses. Public R&D funding may displace private investment, leading to an overall decrease in R&D funding. Terence Kealey suggests in his book that increased government planning, subsidies, and protectionism in industrial policy could be detrimental to long-term economic prosperity. Opponents of increased federal R&D funding argue that it can decrease overall R&D investment by companies, leading to reliance on public funding. They believe that government decisions may not align with market signals, resulting in economically unsound investments. Libertarian opposition, like that from the Cato Institute, stems from a belief in limited government and the free market. The Cato Institute advocates for limited government and free market principles, arguing that government interventions in technology funding can distort market forces and lead to less efficient resource allocation. They believe that government support for specific technologies may skew corporate development activities and private investments towards less promising directions. The Cato Institute criticizes government financial support for technology development as \"corporate welfare,\" warning of a potential unhealthy relationship between government and industry. Federal efforts to support technology development can include direct support through grants or loans to companies, universities, and consortia for research and development activities. The government supports technology development through programs like the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Technology Innovation Program (TIP), the Advanced Technology Program (ATP), and the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program. These programs aim to accelerate innovation and advance technology development towards commercialization. The federal government can support nanotechnology research and development through indirect approaches like using the tax code to increase private investment in nanotechnology companies. This could include incentives for companies to expand their research and production activities, such as the current research and experimentation tax credit. The federal government can support nanotechnology research and development through tax incentives for companies to expand their activities, such as the research and experimentation tax credit. Other options for federal support include investments in infrastructure and technologies to reduce costs and accelerate research and development. State and local governments, as well as foreign governments, have also established support mechanisms for nanotechnology. Some nanotechnology advocates believe the federal government should provide funding for the planning and development of nanotechnology-focused parks that offer land, facilities, equipment, and services to new, emerging, and established companies. Private sector also seeks increased federal efforts to protect intellectual property rights of inventors and companies, including improving the patent process and safeguarding U.S. patent holders against infringement. USPTO has educated patent examiners on nanotechnology and established a separate class for it. The USPTO has made efforts to educate patent examiners on nanotechnology, established a separate class for nanotechnology (Class 977), and created cross-reference sub-classes to improve search and examination of nanotechnology-related patents. EHS concerns pose potential barriers to nanotechnology commercialization and U.S. competitiveness. The properties of nanoscale materials have raised hopes for beneficial applications but also concerns about health, safety, and environmental implications. The National Nanotechnology Initiative is focusing on EHS issues, with $58.6 million allocated for EHS research in FY2008. President Bush has requested $76.4 million for NNI EHS research. Some believe that funding levels for NNI EHS research are too low, currently at 3.9% of NNI funding and should be increased to 10% or more. Concerns about adverse effects on health, safety, and the environment may deter investment in nanotechnology due to potential regulations, compliance costs, and liability claims. Restrictive U.S. regulations could lead companies to move research and production to nations with less stringent regulations. Advocates urge the federal government to increase EHS R&D investments to reduce uncertainty and inform decision-making. The federal government should increase EHS R&D investments to reduce uncertainty, inform regulations, and protect the public. Regulation of nanotechnology products may involve multiple federal agencies. In addition to research support, the federal role in policy and program activities could be strengthened. Some suggest using specialized extension centers for technical and EHS best practices information. The federal government should increase EHS R&D investments to reduce uncertainty and protect the public. Efforts to create regulatory processes that can keep pace with technological change are advocated. Over-regulation of nanotechnology exports could impede investment and development. The Department of Commerce and the President's Export Council worked to ensure that nanotechnology products were not unnecessarily restricted from sale to other nations under export control regulations. The Commerce Department announced the establishment of an advisory committee to make recommendations on emerging technologies, including nanotechnology. Advocates for nanotechnology emphasize the importance of federal support for education and collaboration with other nations to ensure fair competition in the development and commercialization of nanotechnology. The federal government is actively involved in promoting the advancement of nanotechnology through various activities such as R&D, addressing environmental and safety concerns, education and training, public engagement, and international cooperation. These efforts require significant investments in resources to develop standards and address new challenges and opportunities. Some NNI activities have evolved to address new challenges and opportunities. Resource allocation decisions have been made without considering alternative uses, leading to a potentially unbalanced portfolio. Reassessing and realigning resources with current needs could enhance federal investments' efficiency and effectiveness. However, barriers exist, such as resistance within and between agencies and Congressional appropriations subcommittees. The NNI operates with Congressional appropriations subcommittees' jurisdiction and agencies participate voluntarily. The NNI aims for scientific leadership, meeting agency missions, and fostering U.S. commercial leadership. Assessments are conducted by the NRC and NNAP as required by the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act. The NNI operates under Congressional appropriations subcommittees' jurisdiction and agencies participate voluntarily. Assessments are conducted triennially by the NRC and biennially by the NNAP to evaluate U.S. competitiveness in nanotechnology. Congress could direct a focused assessment on the effectiveness of the NNI in achieving global technological leadership and whether additional resources are needed. Nanotechnology is expected to bring significant economic and societal benefits, with the U.S. launching the first national nanotechnology initiative in 2000. Tens of billions of dollars have been invested in nanotechnology research and development over the past eight years, with a focus on gaining scientific understanding and manipulating matter at the nanoscale. This investment is expected to bring revolutionary changes to products and industries, raising concerns about the U.S. competitive position in nanotechnology. The U.S. competitive position in nanotechnology is difficult to assess due to its newness and wide application across industries. Data collection on nanotechnology is currently lacking, but the number of nanotechnology products in the market is rapidly increasing. Congress may consider directing federal agencies to collect relevant data to inform policy decisions and resource allocation. The United States leads in nanotechnology based on investments and outputs like scientific papers and patents. However, other nations are catching up due to increased investments and capabilities. National technological leadership does not guarantee economic value capture within borders. In the global economy, companies can choose where to conduct work effectively, including research, development, and manufacturing. Federal policy issues impact nanotechnology development in the United States, with debates on the level of federal involvement. U.S. competitiveness in nanotechnology also relies on foreign development efforts. Congress has laid the legislative groundwork for National activities in this field. The 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act of 2003 established a legislative foundation for the National Nanotechnology Initiative. Funding authorizations were provided for five NNI agencies through FY2008, with possible amendments and reauthorization being considered by Congress. Issues related to nanotechnology may be addressed during deliberations on the reauthorization of the act or through separate legislation."
