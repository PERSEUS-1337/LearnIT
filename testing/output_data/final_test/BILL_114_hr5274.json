The Secretary can reissue federal student loans with a lower interest rate upon borrower's application, discharging and reissuing FFEL program loans as refinanced federal direct loans for qualified borrowers. The interest rate for each reissued loan shall be based on the high yield of the 10-year Treasury note auctioned at the final auction held prior to the reissuance. The applicable rate of interest for a reissued loan under this section is based on the high yield of the 10-year Treasury note auctioned at the final auction held prior to the first day of the month in which the application is received, plus 1.0 percent. The interest rate is fixed for the period of the loan, and the terms and conditions of the reissued loan remain the same as the original loan, with no extension of the repayment period. The borrower can keep the same repayment term as the original loan and may choose a different plan. An administrative fee of up to 0.5 percent is charged for reissued loans. A qualified borrower is defined as someone who received a loan before July 1, 2017. The Secretary will establish income requirements for refinancing eligibility based on financial need. Amendments to the Public Service Repayment Plan provisions are also made. Section 455(m) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to include special rules for refinanced federal direct loans and refinanced FFEL loans under section 460A. In amending the Higher Education Act of 1965, special rules are established for refinanced federal direct loans and FFEL loans under section 460A, including provisions for calculating repayment periods based on reissued loans.

Interest Rates.--Section 455(b) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to include new interest rate provisions for Federal Direct Stafford Loans and Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loans issued to undergraduate students after July 1, 2017. The applicable interest rate for these loans disbursed during any 12-month period starting on July 1 shall be determined in the preceding June. The interest rates for Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loans issued to graduate or professional students, with the first disbursement on or after July 1, 2017, will be determined based on the high yield of the 10-year Treasury note auctioned at the final auction held before June 1, plus 1 percent, or 8.25 percent, whichever is lower. The interest rates for Federal Direct PLUS Loans, with the first disbursement on or after July 1, 2017, will be determined based on the high yield of the 10-year Treasury note auctioned at the final auction held before June 1, plus 1 percent, or 9.5 percent, whichever is lower. The interest rates for Federal Direct PLUS Loans beginning on July 1 and ending on June 30 are determined based on the high yield of the 10-year Treasury note auctioned at the final auction held before June 1, plus 1 percent, or 10.5 percent, whichever is lower. For Federal Direct Consolidation Loans after July 1, 2017, the interest rate is the weighted average of the unpaid principal balance. The applicable rate of interest for Federal Direct Stafford Loans, Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, and Federal Direct PLUS Loans is determined based on the weighted average of the interest rates on the loans consolidated, rounded to the nearest higher one-eighth of one percent. The Secretary consults with the Secretary of the Treasury to determine the interest rate and publishes it in the Federal Register. The interest rate remains fixed for the period of the loan. In School Deferment, the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended regarding the determination of interest rates. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a special rule for in-school deferment. Borrowers with an expected family contribution of not more than $10,000 are eligible for a deferment where interest does not accrue.

Borrowers with an expected family contribution of more than $10,000 are subject to a yield on the 10-year Treasury note for unsubsidized loans. The amendments made by subsections (a) and (b) shall take effect as if enacted on July 1, 2017. Elimination of origination fees for Federal Direct Loans is mandated by Congress, repealing subsection (c) of section 455 of the Higher Education Act of 1965. This change applies to loans made under part D of title IV of the Higher Education Act for disbursements after the first July 1 following the enactment of this Act."
