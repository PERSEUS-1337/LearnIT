    "content": "The Transition to Teaching Act may be cited as the official title of this legislation. Key findings are outlined in the Act. The Transition to Teaching Act outlines key findings regarding the need for more than 2,000,000 teachers in the next decade, with a particular emphasis on recruiting talented individuals for high-need areas such as mathematics, science, and special education. Concerns are raised about the lack of qualified teachers in high-poverty schools, as well as the low ranking of U.S. high school seniors in international math and science studies. Based on academic scores, there is a need to focus on improving math and science education. High-poverty schools struggle to fill bilingual teaching positions and many teachers have students for whom English is a second language. Career-changing professionals with strong content-area skills are interested in teaching but need training. The Troops to Teachers program successfully places quality teachers in high-poverty districts. The Act aims to address the need for highly qualified teachers in high-poverty school districts, especially in subjects like math, science, foreign languages, bilingual education, and special education. It involves continuing the Troops to Teachers model and recruiting career-changing professionals with relevant knowledge and experience to become teachers. The Secretary is authorized to use funds for grants to institutions for programs authorized by the Act. Before making awards, consultation with the Secretary of Defense and Transportation is required to determine funding for the Troops to Teachers program. The Secretary may enter into agreements with the Departments of Defense and Transportation to ensure the continuation of the Troops to Teachers program. $18,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2000 to 2005 for this purpose. SEC. 5. APPLICATION. Each applicant seeking an award under section 4(a) must submit an application to the Secretary with specific information required, including a description of the target group of career-changing professionals, recruitment strategies, training for participants related to teacher certification, and placement in high-poverty areas. The program participants are placed in high-poverty local educational agencies and receive teacher induction services. The applicant must collaborate with other institutions to recruit, train, place, and support participants. Evaluation of the program's progress and effectiveness is also required. The applicant must provide performance indicators and outcome measures to measure and determine the effectiveness of the program. Additionally, they must assure the Secretary of providing necessary information for evaluating the overall effectiveness of programs under this Act. SEC. 6. USES OF FUNDS AND PERIOD OF SERVICE. Authorized activities under this Act include recruiting program participants, providing training stipends up to $5,000 per participant, tailoring teacher training for career changers, and assisting in placement activities for newly trained participants. Program participants receive training stipends and assistance in obtaining employment in local educational agencies. Upon completion of training, participants must serve in a high-poverty local educational agency for at least 3 years. The Secretary may require repayment if participants fail to fulfill their service obligation. The Secretary will prioritize awards that support programs in different regions of the nation. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines \"high-poverty local educational agency\" as an agency with 20% or more children below the poverty level or over 10,000 such children, and \"program participants\" as career-changing professionals with a degree, interest in teaching, and relevant knowledge."
