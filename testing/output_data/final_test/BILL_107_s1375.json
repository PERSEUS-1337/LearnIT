    "content": "The \"Public Good IRA Rollover Act\" allows tax-free distributions from individual retirement accounts for charitable purposes. The \"Public Good IRA Rollover Act\" amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow tax-free distributions from individual retirement accounts for charitable purposes to qualified organizations described in section 170(c). The \"Public Good IRA Rollover Act\" allows tax-free distributions from individual retirement accounts to charitable organizations through charitable remainder trusts, pooled income funds, or charitable gift annuities. This applies when no person holds an income interest in the trust, fund, or annuity other than the designated beneficiaries. The distribution from individual retirement accounts to charitable organizations is tax-free when no person other than the designated beneficiaries holds an income interest in the trust, fund, or annuity. The amount included in gross income is determined by the qualified charitable distribution to the trust or annuity. The distribution to charitable organizations from individual retirement accounts is tax-free when no other person holds an income interest. The amount included in gross income is determined by the qualified charitable distribution to the trust or annuity. Amounts distributed to pooled income funds are not included in gross income. For tax purposes, a qualified charitable distribution from an individual retirement account is tax-free if the account holder is over 70 1/2 years old. If the distribution is to a trust, fund, or annuity, the age requirement is 59 1/2. The distribution must be made directly to a qualifying organization. The amendment allows tax-free qualified charitable distributions from individual retirement accounts to certain organizations or trusts, effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2001."
