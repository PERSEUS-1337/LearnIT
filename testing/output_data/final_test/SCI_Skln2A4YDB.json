    "content": "Current model-based reinforcement learning approaches use the model as a black-box simulator for policy optimization or value function learning. This paper proposes a policy optimization algorithm that leverages the model's differentiability by using the pathwise derivative. By incorporating a terminal value function and adopting an actor-critic approach, the algorithm prevents instabilities across timesteps. The approach is shown to be more sample efficient than existing model-based algorithms, matches the performance of model-free algorithms, and scales well to long horizons. Model-based reinforcement learning offers efficient learning in real-world systems by first learning system dynamics in a supervised way. It uses the model to derive controllers, achieving convergence with less data than model-free methods. Tools like ensembles and probabilistic models enhance performance. In this work, the authors propose estimating the policy gradient by backpropagating through the learned model using the pathwise derivative estimator. This approach allows for linking the model, reward function, and policy to obtain an analytic expression for the gradient of the returns with respect to the policy, enabling more efficient learning in high-dimensional or long-planning environments. The authors propose a model-based method that reduces sample complexity compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. They use a terminal Q-function to compute the gradient for rapid policy learning, avoiding instabilities from back-propagating through long horizons. This approach achieves a 10k return in the half-cheetah environment with just 50 trajectories. The authors present a model-based method with low sample complexity and high performance, achieving a 10k return in the half-cheetah environment with just 50 trajectories. They experimentally analyze the theoretical derivations and highlight the importance of their objective through ablation studies in model-based benchmarking environments. The approach presented utilizes a differentiable simulator model to optimize policy with analytical gradient, addressing the model-bias problem in long-term predictions. Various methods like meta-learning and interpolation have been used to tackle this issue, but the focus here is on exploiting the model for short horizons to prevent model-bias. The approach utilizes a differentiable simulator model to optimize policy with analytical gradient, addressing model-bias in long-term predictions. It exploits the model for short horizons and uses a terminal value function for the rest of the trajectory. The stochastic policy, dynamics model, and value function can benefit from model-predictive control (MPC) for better performance at test time. Previous work has used backpropagation through learned models to obtain optimal action sequences, which can be incorporated into neural network architecture or formulated as a differentiable function. Our method learns a neural network policy in an actor-critic fashion aided with a learned model. Evaluating the benefit of MPC on top of the learned policy at test time suggests that re-planning does not result in significant benefits. The reinforcement learning objective involves computing the gradient of an expectation using Gaussian processes to compute the expectation analytically. When learning expressive parametric non-linear dynamical models and policies, closed form solutions do not exist. Gradient is estimated using Monte-Carlo methods. Previous approaches in model-based RL mostly used the score-function or REINFORCE estimator, which has high variance. Our approach uses the pathwise derivative estimator, relying entirely on model predictions to reduce variance. Actor-critic methods in reinforcement learning alternate between policy evaluation and policy improvement. They can be classified as on-policy or off-policy, with off-policy methods offering better sample complexity. Recent advancements have improved off-policy methods using maximum-entropy objectives and multiple value functions. The method presented combines the benefits of both, resembling an on-policy method while still being off-policy. In reinforcement learning, a Markov decision process (MDP) is defined by states, actions, transition distribution, reward function, discount factor, and horizon. The goal is to find a policy that maximizes the expected return. Actor-critic methods involve learning a Q-function to optimize the policy. Actor-critic methods involve learning a Q-function to optimize the policy. The Q-function is learned by minimizing the Bellman residual in one-step Q-learning. Recent methods have stabilized Q-function training. The actor is then trained to maximize the learned Q-function. This method can be applied off-policy by sampling random mini-batches of transitions from an experience replay buffer. Model-based RL learns the transition distribution from experience by using a dynamics model to predict the next state. In model-based reinforcement learning, the dynamics model predicts the next state as \u015d t+1 \u223cf \u03c6 (s t , a t). The models are trained using maximum likelihood and Monte-Carlo gradient estimators, such as the pathwise gradient estimator. This estimator, derived from the law of the unconscious statistician, allows computing expectations without knowing the distribution of the random variable. Our approach, model-augmented actor-critic (MAAC), utilizes the learned model to compute the full gradient of returns with respect to the policy, enhancing policy learning efficiency and reducing sample complexity. Actor-critic methods have demonstrated superior performance in sample efficiency and asymptotic performance. The proposed modification of the Q-function parametrization utilizes model predictions to optimize policy by back-propagation through time, enhancing efficiency and reducing sample complexity in reinforcement learning. The proposed objective utilizes the pathwise derivative estimator to compute the gradient, capturing uncertainty with low variance. It differs from previous approaches by avoiding compromise between off-policy and stability, obtaining a strong learning signal through backpropagation, and preventing exploding and vanishing gradients. The proposed objective uses the terminal Q-function to address vanishing gradients in back-propagation through time. The horizon H controls the model-based vs. model-free nature of the algorithm. Policy optimization is done by deriving the objective, requiring accuracy on derivatives rather than the objective value. A lemma provides a bound on gradient error in terms of errors on the model, Q-function, and horizon H. The error on the gradient between the learned objective and the true objective can be bounded by the maximum error in the model derivatives and the error in the Q derivatives. The functions c1 and c2 depend on the Lipschitz constants of the model and the Q-function. The gradient magnitude will be scaled by the learning rate or optimizer when applying it to the weights. The text discusses bounding the KL-divergence between policies resulting from gradient steps on the true objective and the approximated one, quantifying the effect of modeling error on return. The total variation bound is presented, showing the distance between parameters from exact and approximated objectives. The text presents a bound on the total variation distance between policies derived from true dynamics and learned counterparts. The Monotonic Improvement Theorem extends previous work by considering model and function errors, providing lower bounds on improvement. The text discusses deriving the optimal horizon H to minimize gradient error, treating H as an extra hyper-parameter due to approximation errors. It presents a new algorithm, MAAC, that optimizes the model-augmented actor-critic objective through model learning, policy optimization, and Q-function learning using a bootstrap ensemble of dynamics models to capture uncertainty. The text discusses using a bootstrap ensemble of dynamics models to capture uncertainty in the environment. The dynamics models are trained via maximum likelihood with early stopping on a validation set. Policy optimization is performed by maximizing the policy learning through H steps and the Q-function by sampling multiple trajectories. The goal is to derive optimal parameters for the policy to perform well in the real environment. The text discusses training two Q-functions to improve results in policy optimization. The Q functions are trained by minimizing the Bellman error on states previously visited and imagined states. Value targets are obtained using Stochastic Ensemble Value Expansion with a horizon of H. This approach maximizes the use of the model for both policy gradient steps and training. Our method, MAAC, involves collecting samples from the environment, training the Q-function, and optimizing the policy. Trajectories are obtained from the real environment and used to train dynamics models. Imaginary data is collected from the models to learn the Q-function and train the policy. The algorithm maximizes the use of actor-critic methods for policy optimization. The MAAC method outperforms previous model-based and actor-critic methods in continuous control tasks. Experimental evaluation compares MAAC against state-of-the-art methods, examines gradient error correlation, key performance components, and planning benefits at test time. Evaluation is done on MuJoCo simulator tasks, comparing sample complexity and performance against model-free and model-based baselines like SAC. The MAAC method outperforms previous model-based and actor-critic methods in continuous control tasks, showing strength in performance and sample complexity. It scales well to higher dimensional tasks while learning faster than previous methods in all tested environments. Our method, MAAC, learns faster than previous model-based and actor-critic methods in all tested environments. It achieves near-optimal performance with significantly fewer rollouts, showcasing strength in performance and sample complexity. The study investigates the relationship between bounds obtained and empirical performance, focusing on the effect of horizon on gradient error in a double integrator environment. The study explores the impact of horizon values on error in learned dynamics compared to true dynamics. Results show that error in learned dynamics is lower than in the Q-function, but scales poorly with horizon. Short horizons decrease error, but large horizons magnify model errors. The ablation test investigates the importance of different components in the algorithm. Results show that backpropagating through the model is crucial for performance, while using STEVE targets has a minor impact. Single sample estimates are not accurate in higher dimensional environments. The ablation test highlights the importance of different components in the algorithm, such as not using the model to train the policy, not using STEVE targets for Q-function training, and using a single sample estimate of the pathwise derivative. The performance is most affected by not using the model, emphasizing the significance of the derived estimator. Combining model-based reinforcement learning and actor-critic methods results in a stochastic policy, dynamics model, and Q-function, enabling refinement of action selection through model predictive control at test time. Planning at test time using the cross-entropy method with the stochastic policy as initial distributions shows benefits in online planning in complex domains. In this work, the MAAC algorithm utilizes a learned model to improve policy planning in complex domains. The algorithm prevents instabilities with a terminal value function and achieves policy improvement by analyzing model and value errors. Performance comparison with and without planning using MAAC objective shows gains in complex domains but less improvement in easier domains. The algorithm presented builds on MAAC to achieve superior performance in reinforcement learning. Future work includes deploying the algorithm on a real-robotic agent and bounding errors in gradient and model terms. The total variation distance can be bounded by the KL-divergence using Pinsker's inequality, and assuming third-order smoothness on the policy leads to a specific inequality. The text discusses establishing an improvement bound in terms of gradient error using the monotonic improvement theorem. Ablation studies were conducted to analyze the significance of different components of the MAAC method, with results shown in Figure 5. The effects of training the Q-function with real environment data, not learning a maximum entropy policy, and increasing batch size were examined. The method involves training policy and Q-functions using real data from environments, removing entropy from optimization, and using a single sample estimate of the pathwise derivative with increased batch size. The importance of considering entropy and dynamic models for data augmentation is highlighted."
