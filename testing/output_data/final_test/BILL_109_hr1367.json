The Congress acknowledges the historical importance of American coal miners in fueling industrial development and the nation's economy. Government intervention has been crucial in regulating the coal industry, ensuring the health and safety of miners, and providing healthcare benefits for those affected by black lung disease.

Certain coal industry employers have abused bankruptcy laws, gaining unfair advantages over competitors and harming employees. Congress recognizes this abuse as damaging to the economic health of the United States. AMENDMENTS TO TITLE 11 OF THE UNITED STATES CODE. Title 11 of the United States Code is amended to define 'coal industry employer' and 'covered facility of a coal industry employer' related to the production, processing, or transportation of coal. A covered facility of a coal industry employer sold by the trustee remains subject to the labor rights of current and former employees, including obligations under collective bargaining agreements or the National Labor Relations Act. Labor rights apply whether covered by a current agreement or represented by a labor organization without an agreement. The sale of a covered facility of a coal industry employer must adhere to labor rights, including obligations under collective bargaining agreements or the National Labor Relations Act. Labor organizations representing employees at the facility are presumed to have majority support for a year after the sale. Rejection of a collective bargaining agreement relating to a covered facility requires additional conditions to be met. The executive management of the debtor must verify information under penalty of perjury. The Secretary of Labor provides a list of potential trustees, and the court ensures no wage increases or bonuses for management during the bankruptcy process. The court ensures that wage increases or bonuses are refunded to the debtor, and the proposal must not relieve the debtor or purchaser from obligations under the National Labor Relations Act. It also states that the purchaser is considered a 'successor' under the Act, does not abridge labor rights, and ensures existing employees retain all noneconomic employment rights.
