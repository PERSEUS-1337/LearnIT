    "content": "The 114th Congress is focused on supporting federal R&D activities despite concerns about the federal debt. The government plays a crucial role in funding R&D efforts that have led to scientific advancements and new technologies. Prioritization of R&D is challenging due to budget deficits and competing needs within the federal R&D portfolio. The U.S. government supports a wide range of scientific and engineering R&D for national defense, health, safety, environment, and energy security. The federal R&D budget is an aggregation of the R&D components of each federal agency, developed internally as part of each agency's budget process and approved by the Office of Management and Budget. The federal R&D budget is determined by aggregating the R&D components of each federal agency, with Congress playing a key role in setting priorities and funding levels. Concerns have been raised about federal spending given the current deficit and debt. Congress faces challenges in growing R&D investments amidst budget constraints and must prioritize and allocate available funding. Budget caps may limit overall R&D funding, requiring resource reallocation across disciplines, programs, or agencies. The report discusses the complexity of funding for programs/agencies, starting with the President's FY2016 R&D request and analyzing it from various perspectives. It also includes the R&D budget requests of federal departments and agencies, accounting for over 98% of total federal R&D funding. President Obama's proposed FY2016 budget was released on February 2, 2015. The President's FY2016 budget proposes $145.694 billion for R&D, a 5.5% increase from FY2015. This includes a real increase of 3.9% after adjusting for inflation. Congress and Presidents Bush and Obama aimed to double funding for physical science and engineering research in the first four years of Obama's presidency. The R&D emphasis in disciplines like DOE Office of Science, NSF, and DOC NIST core laboratory research aimed to double funding as per President Bush's American Competitiveness Initiative and budget requests from President Obama. However, appropriations fell short of authorized levels in relevant acts. In FY2015, the President requested a 1.2% increase in funding for targeted accounts. In his FY2016 budget, President Obama is requesting a 5.7% increase in funding for targeted accounts, aiming to double the funding in about 12 years. Obama's goal is to increase national investment in R&D to over 3% of the U.S. GDP, without specifying the means to achieve this. In 2012, R&D as a percentage of GDP was 2.89%, with federal government contributing 0.86% and non-federal sources contributing 2.02%. Achieving the 3% goal would require a substantial increase in government and corporate R&D spending, estimated at $18 billion above the actual U.S. R&D funding level of $452.6 billion. Analysis of federal R&D funding is complicated by inconsistencies among agencies in reporting R&D activities. Federal R&D funding can be analyzed from various perspectives, including by agency, type of work supported, and whether it is defense-related. President Obama's FY2016 budget request allocated over 95% of total federal R&D funding to seven agencies, with the Department of Defense receiving the largest share. Congress makes funding decisions through the authorization and appropriations process primarily based on individual agencies and programs. The report analyzes R&D budget requests for key federal agencies, including NIH, DOE, NASA, NSF, USDA, and DOC. These agencies, along with others like DHS and EPA, account for over 98% of federal R&D funding. The largest increases in R&D funding in the President's FY2016 request are for DOD, DOE, DOC, HHS, USDA, and NSF. In President Obama's FY2016 budget request, federal R&D funding for various agencies would see changes, with some agencies receiving increases while others facing decreases. The budget includes allocations for basic research, applied research, development, and facilities/equipment. The rationale for public investments in basic research is based on the belief that the private sector may underinvest in this area without government support. The federal government funds the majority of basic research in the US, as private companies often underinvest in this area due to factors like long time horizons, technical risk, and shareholder demands for short-term returns. Industry primarily funds applied research instead. In the United States, industry is the main funder of applied research, accounting for 54.0% in 2012, while the federal government funded 36.2%. Industry also provides the majority of funding for development, contributing 76.4% in 2012, compared to the federal government's 22.1%. Federal R&D funding reflects national priorities such as spaceflight, energy sources, and counterterrorism efforts. In the President's FY2016 budget request, the Department of Health and Human Services, primarily NIH, would account for nearly half (48.8%) of all federal funding for basic research and about 43.5% of all federally funded applied research. DOD is the primary federal funder of development, accounting for 85.6% of total federal development funding. Defense-related R&D is mainly provided by the Department of Defense, fluctuating between 50% and 70% of total federal R&D funding. Defense-related R&D funding has fluctuated between 50% and 70% of total federal R&D funding for over three decades. In FY2016, the President's budget allocated $76.9 billion for defense-related R&D (52.8% of total R&D request) and $68.8 billion for non-defense R&D (47.2% of total R&D request). The American Competitiveness Initiative (ACI) aimed to double funding for physical sciences and engineering research by FY2016 from their FY2006 levels for targeted accounts at NSF, DOE, and DOC. The America COMPETES Act authorized increases for NSF, DOE, and NIST accounts, but funding fell below targets in subsequent years. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 authorized appropriations for FY2011 to FY2013. The America COMPETES Act authorized increases for NSF, DOE, and NIST accounts, but funding fell below targets in subsequent years. Congress has not authorized appropriations for the targeted accounts beyond FY2013. FY2013 funding for the targeted accounts was $2.964 billion less than authorized, setting a pace to double over more than 22 years from the FY2006 level. Budget constraints have put the future of the doubling path in question. President Obama's budget plans aimed to double funding for basic research in targeted accounts over a specified period. While the FY2013 budget reiterated this goal without specifying a timeline, the FY2014 budget showed a commitment to increasing funding without doubling. The FY2015 budget did not mention funding increases explicitly. In FY2016, President Obama requested $13.877 billion for targeted accounts, an increase of $752 million. The FY2016 budget includes $13.877 billion in funding for targeted accounts, a 5.7% increase from FY2015. This funding level would set a doubling pace of about 20 years over the FY2006 level. Some analysts have questioned the effectiveness and unintended consequences of the doubling policy. The doubling of funding for specific agencies raises questions about the basis for the target increase and time period. A 2009 study on the NIH doubling from 1988 to 2003 analyzed the impact on biomedical research funding. The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) is a multiagency R&D initiative launched by President Clinton in FY2001 to advance understanding and control of matter at the nanoscale. Federal nanotechnology efforts are coordinated by the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Subcommittee on Nanoscale Science, Engineering, and Technology (NSET). The President's request for NNI R&D funding for FY2016 is $1.495 billion. The President's request for NNI R&D funding for FY2016 is $1.495 billion, which is a slight increase from FY2015. The NITRD program coordinates federal government investments in networking and information technology R&D, with President Obama requesting $4.091 billion for FY2016. The largest agency increases in NITRD funding under the Administration's FY2016 request are for the DOE and NSF. The President's budget proposes reductions in NITRD funding for DOD, DHS, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The US Global Change Research Program aims to understand and respond to global change. Funding data for USGCRP for FY2016, FY2014, and FY2015 is not available. In April 2013, President Obama launched the BRAIN Initiative to unlock the mystery of the brain and provide scientists with tools to better understand brain function. Agencies involved include DARPA, NIH, NSF, and FDA. Research aims to improve understanding of how the brain processes information and its link to behavior for better prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of brain disorders. The BRAIN Initiative aims to improve understanding of brain function and behavior, with federal investments totaling $100 million in FY2014 and $200 million in FY2015. The President's FY2016 budget includes over $300 million for the initiative, with contributions from NIH, DARPA, NSF, IARPA, and the FDA. President Obama also announced the Precision Medicine Initiative in January 2015, proposing $215 million in FY2016 funding to tailor medical treatments based on individual characteristics like genes. The President's FY2016 request for the Precision Medicine Initiative includes funding for NIH, NCI, FDA, and ONC to support the development of a national research cohort, identification of genetic drivers in cancer, development of databases for regulatory structure, and interoperability standards for data exchange. The Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) was announced in June 2011 by President Obama to accelerate the discovery, manufacture, and deployment of advanced materials. Agencies are working on implementation strategies focused on creating an innovation infrastructure, achieving national goals with advanced materials, and preparing the next generation materials workforce. The initiative aims to speed up the understanding of materials science to provide practical information for American entrepreneurs and innovators to develop new products and processes. The White House asserts that American entrepreneurs and innovators will be able to use research from the Materials Genome Initiative to develop new products and processes, similar to how the Human Genome Project accelerated biological sciences. This research may lead to the identification of substitutes for critical minerals, the development of materials to reduce traumatic brain injuries, and the creation of new lightweight materials for vehicles. Over $250 million has been invested in R&D and innovation infrastructure since the launch of MGI in 2011. The Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) in the United States focuses on advanced materials in industrial sectors. The initiative is coordinated by the NSTC Subcommittee on MGI, involving agencies like DOE, DOD, NASA, and NIH. President Obama also launched the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP) to invest in emerging technologies for manufacturing jobs and global competitiveness. AMP includes the National Robotics Initiative (NRI) and the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI). The National Robotics Initiative (NRI) aims to develop robots that enhance human capabilities in various sectors such as manufacturing, space missions, drug discovery, and food safety. Funding for NRI efforts was announced by multiple agencies in January 2015, with support indicated in the President's FY2016 budget. The National Network for Manufacturing Innovation was proposed by President Obama in his FY2013 budget to invest in emerging technologies for manufacturing jobs and global competitiveness. The National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) was proposed by President Obama in his FY2013 budget with a request for $1 billion to establish up to 15 institutes. The NNMI would consist of a network of institutes focusing on developing new manufacturing technologies to support local manufacturing activity and bridge the gap from the laboratory to the market. Despite the lack of congressional authorization and appropriations, the Obama Administration competitively awarded eight institutes for manufacturing. The Obama Administration competitively awarded eight institutes for manufacturing innovation under the NNMI using DOD and DOE authorities. Congress passed the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act in 2014, directing the establishment of a Network for Manufacturing Innovation program. The President's FY2016 budget proposes funding for additional centers supported by various agencies. The President's FY2016 budget includes a request for $1.9 billion in mandatory funding for NIST to establish 29 additional centers by FY2024, bringing the total to 45. The Obama Administration proposed a major overhaul of federal STEM education in FY2014, but the proposal was rejected due to lack of implementation plan and support from the education community. The Obama Administration proposed a reorganization of federal STEM education in FY2015, aiming to consolidate or eliminate 31 programs at 9 agencies, affecting $145 million in budget authority. The goal was to reduce STEM education programs to 111 from the FY2014 level of 138. The Obama Administration aimed to reduce STEM education programs to 111 from the FY2014 level of 138. The President's FY2016 budget continues to reduce fragmentation in federal agencies. Details on government-wide funding were not available at the time of the report. Annual appropriations for key agencies are provided through regular bills. Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, providing discretionary appropriations for federal agencies for FY2016. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 provided discretionary appropriations for federal agencies for FY2016. R&D funding levels are known only after departments and agencies allocate their appropriations to specific activities and report those figures. Congress had not completed action on any of the 12 regular appropriations bills for FY2015 at the start of FY2016. The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-53) provided funding for agencies through December 11, 2015, with a 0.2108% across-the-board decrease in FY2016 budget authority for FY2015 projects. The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-53) provided funding for agencies through December 11, 2015, with a 0.2108% across-the-board decrease in FY2016 budget authority for FY2015 projects. CRs include specific provisions for agencies, accounts, or programs, such as anomalies and provisions that create or change laws. Identifying R&D funding in agency budget data can be challenging. The CRS produces individual reports on appropriations bills, accessible on their website. Congress supports research and development in the Department of Defense primarily through the RDT&E appropriation, which funds future military technology. RDT&E funds are mainly allocated in Title IV of the defense appropriation bill, but also in other parts like the Defense Health Program. The Defense Health Program (DHP) and Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program are funded through Defense appropriations. DHP supports healthcare for DOD personnel and their families, with RDT&E funds allocated for research in cancer and other medical areas. The Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program aims to destroy lethal chemical agents and munitions to prevent future risks and costs. Funding for these programs is requested through Defensewide Operations and Maintenance and Procurement appropriations. The National Defense Sealift Fund supports procurement, operation, maintenance, and research of the naval reserve fleet and U.S. flagged merchant fleet. RDT&E funding for this is requested in the Navy's Procurement request. The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund contains RDT&E monies but does not have a specific line item. JIEDDF funding is not included in the table below. The RDT&E funds for Global War on Terror (GWOT) and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) are requested separately and accounted for in Title IV. The Obama Administration includes OCO funds in the regular budget but may request additional funds if needed. The OCO budget is decreasing as operations in Iraq and Afghanistan are scaled back. The Obama Administration includes OCO funds in the regular budget but may request additional funds if needed. OCO funding will continue as the United States battles ISIS. Various transfer funds are included in GWOT/OCO-related requests, such as the Iraqi Freedom Fund and the Mine Resistant and Ambush Protected Vehicle Fund. Congress authorizes the Secretary to make transfers to other accounts at his discretion. For FY2016, $69.785 billion was requested for DOD's baseline Title IV RDT&E, $6.101 billion above FY2015. The President's budget request for FY2016 exceeded the Budget Control Act caps. OCO funding for RDT&E was not subject to these caps. Additional RDT&E funding was requested for Defense Health, Chemical Agents, Munitions Destruction, and National Defense Sealift Fund. The House approved $66.151 billion for DOD's baseline RDT&E program for FY2016, $3.634 billion below the Administration's request. Reductions were made to the Air Force's request, including $460 million for the Long Range Strike program and $275 million for the Next Generation Refueling K-46 Aircraft program. Concerns were raised about the use of funds for new programs instead of improving existing ones, leading to reductions in the Advanced Extremely High Frequency Military Satellite Communication program and the Space Based Infrared Satellite (SBIRS) program. The House approved a $1.594 billion increase in Air Force OCO RDT&E, including $915 million for classified programs. The Navy's request was reduced by $648 million, with the largest decrease in the Marine Assault Vehicle program. The Army's request was increased by $447 million, with the biggest increase in the Combat Vehicle Improvement program to upgrade the Stryker combat vehicle's lethality. The House reduced the Defensewide account by $123 million, including cuts to DARPA and increases for the Defense Rapid Innovation Fund and U.S.-Israeli Cooperative program for ballistic missile defense technologies. They also recommended funding for the National Defense Sealift Fund, Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction program, Office of the Inspector General, and Defense Health Program RDT&E. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $70.325 billion for Title IV RDT&E, $540 million more than requested. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $70.325 billion for Title IV RDT&E, which is $540 million more than the Administration's request. Some notable changes included increases for various defense programs such as the Navy's Unmanned Carrier Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike System, the Air Force's Expendable Launch Vehicle, and the Defense Technology Analysis program focused on assessing cyber vulnerability of weapons systems. Additionally, funds were recommended for the National Defense Sealift Fund and the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $70.325 billion for Title IV RDT&E, with increases for various defense programs like the Navy's Unmanned Carrier Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike System, the Air Force's Expendable Launch Vehicle, and the Defense Technology Analysis program. Additionally, funds were recommended for the National Defense Sealift Fund and the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction program. President Obama signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 on December 18, 2015, providing $69.785 billion for Title IV RDT&E, including funding levels for the Army, Navy, and Air Force. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 provided funding for various defense programs, including $25.217 billion for the Air Force and $18.696 billion for Defensewide for FY2016. The act also allocated funds for Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction RDT&E, Defense Health Program RDT&E, National Defense Sealift Fund, and the Office of the Inspector General. Additionally, the act fully funded the OCO request and added $40 million for support. P.L. 114-113 fully funded the OCO request and added $40 million for the Israel Technical Working Group. RDT&E funding is allocated to military departments, DOD agencies, and Defensewide accounts. Budget activities 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 focus on research, while 6.4 and 6.5 target specific weapon systems development. The FY2016 Title IV baseline S&T funding request was $12.266 billion, $81 million more than FY2015. The House voted to appropriate $12.573 billion for Title IV S&T, including $100 million for specific programs like the Joint Strike Fighter and missile defense systems. Congressional policymakers and the defense community emphasize the importance of S&T funding for developing new technologies and maintaining U.S. military superiority. The House appropriated $12.573 billion for Title IV S&T in FY2015, with a $100 million reduction to DARPA's request. The Senate recommended $12.822 billion. P.L. 114-113 allocated $13.250 billion for FY2016, $984 million more than the request and $1.065 billion above FY2015. Basic research receives attention, with DOD funding a significant portion at universities. The Administration requested $2.089 billion for basic research in FY2016, $189 million less than FY2015. The House approved $2.100 billion for basic research. The House approved $2.100 billion for basic research in FY2015, while the Senate Appropriation Committee recommended $2.317 billion. P.L. 114-113 provides $2.309 billion for basic research in FY2016, with increases in in-house basic research and Navy's University Research Initiatives. The Department of Homeland Security has identified five core missions, with new technology from research and development contributing to these goals. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for coordinating R&D activities, with specific divisions like the S&T Directorate and DNDO focusing on nuclear and radiological threats. In FY2016, the President requested $1.154 billion for R&D, a decrease from the previous year. The House committee recommended $1.162 billion, while the Senate committee recommended $1.103 billion for R&D programs within DHS. The final appropriation for R&D programs within DHS in FY2016 provided $1.152 billion, with $787 million for the S&T Directorate, $347 million for DNDO, and $18 million for Coast Guard RDT&E. The S&T Directorate, led by a Senate-confirmed Under Secretary for Science and Technology, conducts R&D in its own laboratories and funds R&D by DOE national laboratories, industry, and universities. The Administration's request of $779 million for the S&T Directorate in FY2016 was 29.4% less than the FY2015 appropriation. The FY2016 budget for the S&T Directorate included funding for Apex projects and University Programs, with a total request of $787 million. The request proposed supporting six new Apex projects and a \"technology engines\" activity. University Programs saw a decrease in funding to $31 million from $40 million in FY2015. The House committee recommended a $9 million increase for University Programs. The Senate committee recommended a $765 million budget for S&T, $14 million less than the request. They supported the Apex concept and suggested funding at the requested level. An $8 million increase for University Programs was proposed, offset by a $20 million decrease for RD&I. The committee emphasized maintaining at least 10 university centers of excellence. Funding for the Apex program was to be maintained at not less than prior year levels. The final appropriation for the Apex program was $787 million, $8 million more than the request. It included increases for University Programs and decreases for Laboratory Facilities and Management and Administration. DNDO, responsible for nuclear detection research, received a requested budget of $357 million for FY2016, a 16.1% increase from the previous year. The Administration proposed merging the Radiation Portal Monitors and Human Portable Radiation Detection Systems programs into a single Radiological and Nuclear Detection Equipment Acquisition program with a budget of $101 million for FY2016. The House committee recommended $357 million for DNDO, supporting the consolidation and expansion of the Nuclear Detection Equipment Acquisition program. The Senate committee recommended $320 million for DNDO, $37 million less than the Administration's request. The Senate committee recommended $320 million for DNDO, $37 million less than the request. The final appropriation of $347 million for DNDO was $10 million less than the request, with reductions from Management and Administration and Nuclear Detection Equipment Acquisition. DHS lacks department-wide policies for R&D coordination, as reported by the Government Accountability Office in 2012. DHS lacked department-wide policies for R&D coordination and reporting, leading to a lack of knowledge on total R&D investments. Recommendations were made for developing policies, guidance, and a tracking mechanism for R&D projects. Congress directed DHS to develop new policies and procedures in response to GAO's findings in the FY2013 and FY2014 appropriations cycles. In response to GAO's recommendations, DHS is working on implementing new policies for R&D prioritization and oversight department-wide. Concerns persist regarding the coordination of R&D efforts across the department, with ongoing efforts to develop a process for this purpose. GAO's reports have highlighted the need for a strategic planning process to focus research and development investments within DHS. The department currently lacks a mechanism to capture and understand all R&D activities conducted. DHS is establishing Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) to assist with R&D coordination and prioritization. IPTs will identify technological gaps and coordinate departmental R&D efforts. S&T will lead the overall IPT effort, with representation from operational components and JRC Portfolio Teams. S&T will also support DHS-wide acquisition programs with technical assessments. S&T plays a key role in DHS-wide acquisition programs by conducting independent technical assessments to ensure acquisitions fill capability gaps. Congress directed DHS to review programs related to threats and evaluate potential consolidation of organizations, including DNDO and OHA. DHS planned to consolidate DNDO, OHA, and smaller elements of several other DHS programs into a new office, led by a new Assistant Secretary, with responsibility for DHS-wide coordination of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosives (CBRNE) strategy, policy, situational awareness, threat and risk assessments, contingency planning, operational requirements, acquisition formulation and oversight, and preparedness. The House and Senate committee reports on FY2016 appropriations did not address the proposed consolidation. A provision in the final bill prohibited DHS from using FY2016 funds to establish an Office of CBRNE Defense \"until such time as Congress has authorized such establishment.\" The provision did, however, give DHS the authority to transfer funds for the establishment of such an office, if authorized. The President is requesting $31.0 billion in R&D funding for HHS, an increase of $565 million (1.9%) from its FY2015 level of $30.5 billion. NIH provides more than 95% of total HHS R&D funding. Other HHS agencies' R&D funding includes: CDC: $398 million, FDA: $410 million, AHRQ: $385 million, HRSA: $22 million. The President's budget for HHS includes $22 million for Services Administration and $17 million for Administration for Children and Families, with an increase of $6 million (54.5%). R&D funding for Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services would be eliminated, while $163 million is allocated for departmental management related to R&D, an increase of $6 million (3.8%). The National Institutes of Health (NIH) plays a key role in biomedical and behavioral research, training researchers, and disseminating health information. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) consists of the Office of the NIH Director (OD) and 27 institutes and centers (ICs). NIH supports basic and clinical research, research training, and health information dissemination. About 83% of NIH's budget goes to extramural research through grants and contracts. The OD sets policy and coordinates programs, while ICs focus on specific diseases and research areas. Each IC manages its own research. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) consists of the Office of the NIH Director (OD) and 27 institutes and centers (ICs). Each IC plans and manages its own research programs in coordination with OD. Congress provides separate appropriations to 24 ICs, OD, and an intramural Buildings and Facilities account. NIH's funding primarily comes from the Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations bill, with additional funding for Superfund-related activities. Additional funding is provided for a special program on type 1 diabetes research and through a PHS Act transfer. The Obama Administration requested a total of $31.311 billion for NIH activities in FY2016, including $150 million for type 1 diabetes research. $847 million was proposed to be transferred to NIH from the PHS Program Evaluation Set-Aside. The evaluation tap allows the Secretary to use a portion of appropriations to study federal health programs. The PHS Act limits the evaluation tap to 1% of appropriations, but recent Labor/HHS/ED appropriations acts have specified a higher amount (2.5% in FY2015 and FY2016). NIH has been a major donor of program evaluation funds, but under the President's FY2016 budget request, most ICs would receive a 2% to 4% increase compared to FY2015, with exceptions for specific programs like the National Institute on Aging and the National Library of Medicine. The increase in funding for the National Library of Medicine (NLM) was targeted for the National Center for Biotechnology Information to support PubMed Central in providing public access to papers from NIH research. The increase also aimed to support ClinicalTrials.gov to accommodate the increased volume of clinical trial reporting. Congress generally appropriates specific amounts to each IC and leaves it to NIH and its scientific advisory panels to allocate funding to different research areas. The House and Senate versions of the FY2016 Labor/HHS/ED appropriations bill proposed different funding levels for NIH, with the House version at $31.411 billion and the Senate version at $32.311 billion. This includes additional funding from various sources for Superfund-related activities and the mandatory type 1 diabetes program. The FY2016 NIH budget is $32.311 billion, with an increase of $2 billion (7%) over FY2015. The budget includes $77 million for Superfund-related research and $150 million for diabetes funding. About 54% of the budget focuses on basic biomedical and behavioral research, including the BRAIN Initiative. The BRAIN Initiative is a collaborative effort with NSF and DARPA to study complex brain functions. The FY2016 budget includes a $70 million increase for NIH's BRAIN Initiative, bringing the total to $135 million. Additionally, $638 million is estimated to be spent on Alzheimer's Disease research in FY2016, an increase of $51 million from FY2015. The House report on H.R. 3020 allocated $886 million for Alzheimer's disease research, a $300 million increase from FY2015. The Senate report on S. 1695 did not specify funding for specific diseases but included a $350,971,000 increase for NIA, with a focus on Alzheimer's research. NIH aimed to allocate $461 million in FY2016 for combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria, a $100 million increase from FY2015. The FY2016 budget proposed a $100 million increase for the Precision Medicine Initiative, with allocations for FDA, ONC, and NIH. $130 million was designated for a national research cohort of 1 million volunteers to study novel therapeutics and prevention strategies. The FY2016 budget proposed a $100 million increase for the Precision Medicine Initiative, with allocations for FDA, ONC, and NIH. The proposal would use existing smaller research cohorts rather than recruiting 1 million new participants. The National Cancer Institute would use the remaining $70 million of NIH funds to explore the genetics of tumor cells that are resistant to therapy and for research on non-invasive methods to track response to cancer treatment. Both House and Senate appropriation committees indicated support for PMI, with $200 million allocated in FY2016. The explanatory statement accompanying H.R. 2029 (P.L. 114-113) expects NIH to support Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Awards and other training grants in proportion to funding increases. Funding is provided to NLM for NCBI to handle data related to molecular biology and genomics research. NIH estimated over $3.6 billion for pediatric research in FY2016. In FY2016, NIH planned to spend $3.6 billion on pediatric research, with an increase of $75 million from FY2015. The Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act authorized $13 million for pediatric research, allocated by both the House and Senate appropriation committees. They also addressed the cancellation of the National Children's Study, with the House committee directing funding for its continuation in an alternative form. The explanatory statement accompanying H.R. 2029 ( P.L. 114-113 ) provides funding to the NIH Office of the Director for the follow-on to the NCS and urges NIH to recalibrate and realign investments for new longitudinal studies. NIH is expected to continue based on directions from the Committees on Appropriations. Research Project Grants (RPGs) are the main funding mechanism for NIH extramural research, with a proposed budget of $17.2 billion for FY2016 to support approximately 35,447 RPG awards, including 10,000 competing RPGs. The Department of Energy (DOE) was established in 1977 by the Department of Energy Organization Act (P.L. 95-91) to conduct basic scientific research in various fields, including energy production, nuclear physics, and environmental sciences. It operates 17 national laboratories, accounting for 40% of all DOE expenditures. The Department of Energy (DOE) operates 17 national laboratories, accounting for 40% of all DOE expenditures. The Administration requested $14.178 billion in FY2016 for DOE R&D and related activities, with the enacted omnibus bill providing $13.680 billion. The request for the DOE Office of Science was $5.340 billion, a 5.4% increase from the previous year. The FY2016 budget request for the Department of Energy's Office of Science did not mention the previous goal of doubling funding. The final bill provided $5.350 billion, 47% above the baseline, with the largest program, Basic Energy Sciences, receiving a 6.7% increase. The FY2016 budget for the Department of Energy's Office of Science was $5.350 billion, with Basic Energy Sciences (BES) receiving a 6.7% increase to $1.849 billion. The increase in BES included funding for the Linac Coherent Light Source II (LCLS-II) construction, Scientific User Facilities, and Energy Frontier Research Centers. The final bill provided the requested amount for BES, despite the House and Senate bills proposing lower funding levels. The final bill provided $1.849 billion for Basic Energy Sciences (BES), including funding for LCLS-II construction and Scientific User Facilities. The request for High Energy Physics was $788 million, with a proposed increase for the Muon to Electron Conversion Experiment (Mu2e). Proposed increases for cosmic frontier physics and energy frontier physics were offset by a decrease for physics at the intensity frontier. The House bill would have provided $12 million less than the request. The House bill would have provided $12 million less than the request, including $9 million less for accelerator stewardship. The Senate bill would have provided approximately the requested amount overall, with $10 million more for construction of the Long Baseline Neutrino Facility offset by $10 million less for research. The final bill provided $795 million, an increase of $7 million above the request, including the requested amount for Mu2e construction and $10 million more than the request for construction of the Long Baseline Neutrino Facility. The request for Nuclear Physics was $625 million, an increase of 4.9%. The proposed increases were to be spread across most areas of research and operations. The House bill would have provided $8 million less than the request, including $6 million less for operations at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and $2 million less for construction of the Facility. The final appropriation for the Department of Energy was $617 million, $8 million less than the request. The Biological and Environmental Research program received $612 million, a 3.4% increase, with a focus on Biological Systems Science and Climate and Environmental Sciences. The request included a $31 million increase for climate and Earth system modeling. The House bill proposed $12 million less than the request, while the Senate bill provided approximately the requested amount. The final bill for the Department of Energy allocated $609 million, $3 million less than the request. The House bill proposed $74 million less for climate and Earth system modeling. The Senate bill suggested $2 million less, with the reduction going to Climate and Environmental Sciences. The final bill included funds for Bioenergy Research Centers and urged prioritizing the operation of BER user facilities. The request for Advanced Scientific Computing Research was $621 million, an increase of 14.8%, with the majority allocated to the Research and Evaluation Prototypes program. This program supports R&D partnerships with vendors for next-generation systems. The House bill proposed $83 million less than the request for this program, stating a recommendation of $99 million for exascale computing activities. The Senate bill supported the exascale initiative with $158 million in the Office of Science, while the final bill provided $621 million, including $158 million for the initiative. Fusion Energy Sciences saw a 10.2% decrease in funding to $420 million, with ITER construction funding remaining at $150 million. The U.S. share of ITER was estimated to be between $1.45 billion and $2.2 billion in 2008, but delays have hindered a revised cost estimate approval. The revised cost estimate for ITER construction in the U.S. is between $4 billion and $6.5 billion. The Government Accountability Office found cost increases and schedule delays for ITER. Fusion Energy Sciences funding decreased under the Administration's request, with the Alcator C-MOD facility set to cease operations. The House bill proposed $48 million more funding, while the Senate bill provided no funding for ITER. The Senate bill provided $438 million, with $35 million less for ITER and $53 million more for the domestic program. The Secretary of Energy was directed to consider withdrawing from the ITER project. The bill required a report by May 2, 2016, on whether the US should remain in the project or terminate participation. The request for DOE national security R&D was $4.488 billion, a 9.0% increase. The request for DOE national security R&D was $4.488 billion, a 9.0% increase. Funding for the Naval Reactors program was to rise by 11.5%, and Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation R&D was to increase by $26 million. The House bill proposed $109 million less than the request for R&D in Weapons Activities. The Senate bill proposed funding cuts for R&D in Weapons Activities, Advanced Simulation and Computing, and Advanced Manufacturing Development. It also provided less funding for Naval Reactors and two construction projects. The final bill allocated $4.451 billion, $37 million less than the request, but maintained funding for Naval Reactors and Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation R&D. The FY2016 DOE energy R&D request was $4.350 billion, a 26.0% increase from FY2015. Funding for R&D in EERE was proposed to increase by 43.9%, with significant increases for Advanced Manufacturing, Vehicle Technologies, Solar Energy, and Building Technologies. The request for Advanced Manufacturing aimed to establish two additional Clean Energy Manufacturing Innovation Institutes. The FY2016 DOE energy R&D request included increases for Nuclear Energy, Electricity Delivery, Energy Reliability R&D, and ARPA-E. The House and Senate bills rejected large increases in EERE programs but provided more funding for Fossil Energy R&D and Nuclear Energy. The final bill provided $3.879 billion for energy R&D, with more funding for EERE, Fossil Energy R&D, and Nuclear Energy. ARPA-E received $291 million. The National Science Foundation (NSF) supports basic research and education in non-medical sciences and engineering, established in 1950 by Congress. The National Science Foundation (NSF) receives federal support for university research in mathematics and computer science, as well as STEM education programs and student aid. NSF has six major appropriations accounts and was allocated $7.463 billion for FY2016, slightly less than the requested amount of $7.724 billion by the Obama Administration. The Obama Administration requested $7.724 billion for the NSF in FY2016, with priorities including Cyber-enabled Materials, Manufacturing, and Smart Systems, Cyberinfrastructure Framework, Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability, and Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace. New priorities for FY2016 included Clean Energy Technology and Innovation Corps. NSF funding priorities for FY2016 included Technology, Innovation Corps, NSF Research Traineeships, and Research at the Interface of Biological, Mathematical, and Physical Sciences. The House bill proposed $7.394 billion for NSF in FY2016, a $50 million increase from FY2015 levels. The House report directed NSF to comply with Section 106 of H.R. 1806, requiring NSF to articulate how each award serves the national interest. The Obama Administration threatened to veto H.R. 2578 for various reasons. The Senate Committee on Appropriations proposed funding levels close to FY2015 estimates for major NSF accounts in FY2016. RRA and MREFC would receive slightly less funding, while OIG would receive slightly more. P.L. 114-113 provides $6.034 billion for RRA for FY2016, $100 million more than in FY2015 and $153 million less than requested by the President. RRA directorate funding levels are not specified in the act and an NSF spending plan had not been submitted to the Appropriations committees at the time of this report's publication. The act provides no less than $160.0 million for the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) program, $10 million less than requested. The FY2016 budget provides $147 million for neuroscience and cognitive science research under the NSF's Understanding the Brain activity, part of the BRAIN initiative. The Obama Administration had requested a $253 million increase for RRA funding, but the final amount allocated was $6.034 billion. The House report directed NSF to allocate any additional appropriations to specific RRA subaccounts. The NSF received $126 million more than requested for RRA in FY2015, with additional funding allocated to major RRA subaccounts BIO, CISE, ENG, and MPS. The FY2016 request sought increases ranging from 2% to 8% for all major RRA subaccounts, with more than half of the total requested increase going to BIO, CISE, ENG, and MPS. H.R. 2578 would have provided $5.984 billion to RRA in FY2016, slightly more than the FY2015 estimate. In FY2016, the NSF received $50 million more than in FY2015 for RRA funding. The House report directed that 70% of the funding go to BIO, CISE, ENG, and MPS, totaling $4.189 billion, an 8% increase from FY2015. The remaining subaccounts would split $1.795 billion, $257 million less than in FY2015. OISE, IA, and USARC were to receive at least FY2015 levels of funding, totaling at least $475 million, while GEO and SBE would split $1.320 billion. In FY2016, NSF received $50 million more for RRA funding. The House report allocated $4.189 billion to BIO, CISE, ENG, and MPS, an 8% increase from FY2015. The remaining subaccounts split $1.795 billion, $257 million less than in FY2015. GEO and SBE received $1.577 billion in FY2015, $257 million more than they would have received in FY2016 under the House report. If funds were distributed proportionally, GEO would have received $212 million less and SBE $44 million less in FY2016. Other provisions included $147 million for the BRAIN initiative, $177 million for Advanced Manufacturing, and $50 million for the International Ocean Drilling Program. The Senate Committee on Appropriations proposed $5.934 billion for RRA in FY2016, the same as the FY2015 estimate. In FY2016, the Senate proposed $5.934 billion for RRA, $253 million less than the request. The Senate report included funding for biomanufacturing research, cybersecurity research, and a pilot program for Historically Black Colleges and Universities. The House report allocated $160 million for the EPSCoR program, slightly less than the Senate proposal. The Administration requested $170 million for EPSCoR in FY2016. Additionally, P.L. 114-113 provided $880 million for EHR, a $14 million increase from FY2015. In FY2016, P.L. 114-113 allocated $880 million for EHR, which is $14 million more than in FY2015. The funding includes $35 million for the HBCU-UP program, $46 million for LSAMP, $14 million for T-CUP, $63 million for AISL, and $50 million for CyberCorps. In FY2016, the President's request for EHR was $963 million, with a significant portion allocated to R&D activities. This marked a shift from previous years, with R&D activities now constituting 49% of EHR funding compared to 11% in FY2008. The nature of EHR's R&D funding has also evolved, moving from primarily basic research to a more balanced mix. The reasons behind these changes and their impact on program activities and stakeholders remain unclear. In FY2016, the EHR request included significant increases for programs like Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) and EHR Core Research (ECR): STEM Learning. The request for IUSE was $121 million, a $36 million increase from FY2015, while ECR: STEM Learning saw a $24 million increase to $49 million. Other tracked programs like Graduate Research Fellowship (GRF) also received funding increases. In FY2016, the GRF funding was split equally between RRA and EHR, with each contributing $169 million. The NRT request was $62 million, the same as FY2015. EHR provided the majority of NRT program funding for the first time in five years. Both the House and Senate agreed on $866 million for EHR in FY2016, $97 million below the request. The House report recommended $66 million for the ATE program, $65 million for AISL, and $35 million for HBCU-UP. The Senate report recommended $61 million for the Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, $45 million for Cybercorps, and $52 million for STEM+C Partnerships. The House report recommended $35 million for HBCU-UP, $46 million for LSAMP, and $14 million for T-CUP. The Senate report recommended $8 million for AGEP and $24 million for CREST. For Hispanic Serving Institutions, the Senate report proposed $5 million for an HSI program, while the House report required NSF to report on funding opportunities for HSIs. The budget request includes targeted funding opportunities for Hispanic-serving two-year colleges through existing programs like ATE, IUSE, and LSAMP. The MREFC account supports large construction projects and scientific instruments, with a proposed funding of $200.3 million for FY2016. This funding would support projects like the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), and Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST). The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 provides $330 million for AOAM, $5 million more than FY2015 and $25 million less than the request; $4 million for NSB, equal to FY2015 and request levels; and $15 million for OIG, $1 million above FY2015 and equal to the request. Funding for AOAM would have been $30 million or 9% greater in FY2016 than FY2015. Funding for NSB would not have changed significantly between FY2015 and FY2016 under the request. The House and Senate agreed on funding for AOAM and NSB in FY2016, with a slight difference in funding for OIG. The NSF budget request for FY2016 included funding for three multi-agency initiatives: NNI, NITRD, and USGCRP. Funding for NITRD would increase by $31 million, while USGCRP would receive an additional $10 million in FY2016. NASA was created in 1958 to conduct civilian space and aeronautics activities. It has research programs in planetary science, Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, and aeronautics. The Administration requested $17.282 billion for NASA R&D in FY2016, with the final appropriation being $18.094 billion. In FY2016, NASA's R&D funding totaled $18.094 billion, with allocations for Science, Aeronautics, Space Technology, Exploration, and the International Space Station. The Science budget request was $5.289 billion, with the final appropriation at $5.589 billion. Funding for Planetary Science included $30 million for a potential mission to Jupiter's moon Europa, building on previous allocations for this high-priority project. The National Research Council (NRC) identified a Europa mission as a high priority in planetary science. NASA sought Europa mission concepts costing less than $1 billion. The House bill allocated $140 million for a Europa mission and increased funding for Mars Exploration, plutonium-238 production, and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. The Senate bill provided $40 million less than the requested amount for Planetary Science. The final bill included $175 million for a Europa mission, which will include an orbiter with a lander and competitively selected instruments. The total funding for Planetary Science was $270 million more than the Administration's request. Additionally, there was a 9.9% increase in funding for Earth Science to support initiatives like the Sustainable Land Imaging program and the development of Landsat 9. The budget request included funding for the Landsat 9 land imaging satellite and a Thermal Infrared Free Flyer satellite. The House bill proposed less funding for Earth Science, with no funds for the Free Flyer and $33 million for Landsat 9. The Senate bill also provided less funding for Earth Science, with $100 million for Landsat 9. The final bill included $26 million less than the request for Earth Science, with $100 million for Landsat 9 but no funds for the Free Flyer. The budget included $100 million for Landsat 9 in Astrophysics, $85.2 million for SOFIA. Congress provided $70 million for SOFIA in FY2015 and directed NASA to seek partners to restore it. The final bill supported NASA's decision not to include SOFIA in its FY2016 senior review. In FY2016, NASA's Aeronautics budget request was $571 million, a 12.3% decrease from FY2015. The House bill proposed $600 million, the Senate bill $525 million, and the final appropriation was $640 million. For Space Technology, the FY2016 request was $725 million, a 21.6% increase, with additional funding for in-space technology demonstrations and early-stage transformational technologies. In FY2016, NASA's Space Technology budget request was $725 million, with increases proposed by the Administration each year. The final bill provided $687 million, with funding allocated for icy satellite surface technology, nuclear propulsion, on-orbit satellite servicing, and the Flight Opportunities program. The FY2016 budget for NASA's Exploration account was $4.506 billion, with funding for the Orion Multipurpose Crew Vehicle and the Space Launch System. The final bill provided $4.030 billion, excluding up to $1.244 billion for commercial crew. The FY2016 budget for NASA's Exploration account was $4.506 billion, with funding for Orion, the SLS, and related ground systems. The request for Exploration Systems Development decreased by 11.8%, while the request for commercial crew increased by 54.5%. Congress has typically allocated less for commercial crew and more for Exploration Systems Development compared to the Administration's proposals. The final bill provided $3.680 billion for Exploration Systems Development and \"up to\" the requested amount for commercial crew. NASA argued that the funding for commercial crew was necessary to maintain scheduled availability of transportation to the International Space Station starting in 2017. Without U.S. commercial capability, NASA would need to pay Russia for additional Soyuz flights. The Administration's FY2016 request included funding for the ISS, with the House bill providing $3.076 billion and the Senate bill providing $3.952 billion. The Senate provision allocated $900 million for the commercial crew program, which was funded under Exploration in previous years. In the final bill, up to $1.244 billion was designated for commercial crew. The Department of Commerce engages in various policy and programmatic activities, including trade, technology, telecommunications, data analysis, and the environment. Its R&D activities are primarily conducted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). NIST aims to enhance U.S. companies' competitiveness by supporting industrial development and disseminating government-developed technological advances. NIST research supports the American economy by providing measurement, calibration, and quality assurance methods. It develops and maintains national standards of measurement and ensures compatibility with other nations. NIST was funded at $964 million for FY2016, $100.1 million more than FY2015 but $155.7 million below the request. The President's budget request would have provided $1.120 billion for NIST in FY2016. The House approved the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016, providing $855.0 million for NIST, $8.9 million less than FY2015. The Senate Committee recommended $893.0 million for NIST, $29.1 million less than FY2015. NIST funding is divided into three accounts: Scientific and Technical Research and Services, Industrial Technology Services, and Construction of Research Facilities. The STRS account under P.L. 114-113 received $690.0 million for FY2016, $14.5 million more than FY2015. The President's request included $754.7 million for R&D in the STRS account for FY2016, with increased funding for activities like advanced manufacturing, neutron research, disaster resilient buildings, cybersecurity, and quantum information science. The House-passed bill allocated funding for various initiatives including $10 million for the Manufacturing Genome Initiative, $5 million for advanced sensing, $5 million for manufacturing entrepreneurship, and $4 million for biomanufacturing. The bill recommended $603.5 million for laboratory programs, $55.0 million for standards coordination and special programs, and no funding for the lab-to-market program. The House committee encouraged NIST to continue work in retail cybersecurity, supply chain management, and cybersecurity-related measurement science. The Senate committee report recommended $684.7 million for the STRS account, expressing support for cybersecurity funding, including $15.0 million for the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence, $16.5 million for the NSTIC, $4.4 million for the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education, and $72.7 million for cybersecurity R&D. The Senate committee report recommended $72.7 million for cybersecurity R&D and $2.0 million more than FY2015 funding for NIST's Urban Dome program. It also encouraged NIST to propose funding for additional centers of excellence in fields like regenerative medicine and advanced photonics. Industrial Technology Services received $155.0 million for FY2016, $16.9 million more than FY2015. The FY2016 budget for NIST included $141.0 million for the MEP program, $15.0 million for AMTech, and $150.0 million for the NNMI. The President's request for the ITS account was $306.0 million, with significant increases from FY2015 funding. The RAMIA authorized the NMI with provisions similar to the NNMI. The RAMIA authorized the NMI program with $5 million per year from FY2015-FY2024. DOE could transfer up to $250 million to NIST for advanced manufacturing R&D. The President's FY2016 budget requested $1.9 billion for NIST to establish 29 additional centers by FY2024. The House-passed bill allocated $130.0 million for the ITS account for FY2016. The House-passed bill allocated $130.0 million for the MEP program, which is $11.0 million below the request. No funding was provided for the AmTech program or the Network for Manufacturing Innovation. NIST was authorized under RAMI to seek unobligated balances for manufacturing innovation institutes. The Senate committee recommended funding of $145.0 million for the ITS in FY2016, including $130.0 million for the MEP program and $15.0 million for the AmTech program. Within the AmTech funds, $5.0 million was recommended for R&D and workforce training for additive manufacturing of metals. The Senate committee also allocated $119.0 million for the Construction of Research Facilities in FY2016. The Construction of Research Facilities (CRF) received $119.0 million for FY2016, an increase of $68.7 million from FY2015. NIST is allocated $60.0 million for renovating its radiation physics infrastructure. The President requested $59.0 million for NIST CRF, while the House bill proposed $50.0 million. The Senate recommended $63.3 million for CRF in FY2016. NIST's extramural programs, aimed at private-sector commercialization, have faced skepticism from some Members of Congress due to concerns about funding high-risk technologies. Previous proposals to eliminate NIST extramural activities have been made, with the Technology Innovation Program being terminated in FY2012. Supporters argue that some technologies are too costly for individual companies to develop independently. The American Competitiveness Initiative, announced in 2006, aimed to double funding for innovation-enabling research at NIST over 10 years. President Obama later planned to double the budget for key science agencies, including NIST, over the next decade. The FY2012 budget did not specify a time frame for doubling funding, and the FY2016 budget request also did not mention doubling or a time frame. The Commerce Department's NOAA conducts scientific research on various environmental areas and was created in 1970 to unify environmental activities. NOAA faces challenges due to its diverse mission of science, service, and stewardship. NOAA's Research Council has developed a five-year plan (2013-2017) to guide the agency's R&D efforts, supporting the long-term goals of NOAA's Next Generation Strategic Plan. The strategic plan focuses on climate adaptation, a weather-ready nation, healthy oceans, and resilient coastal communities. To achieve these goals, NOAA has identified gaps in knowledge and capabilities, addressed through key questions in their R&D plan. The R&D plan aims to address gaps in knowledge and capabilities by framing objectives with key questions and prioritizing tasks due to limited funding. It highlights the challenge of integrating diverse perspectives and expertise to understand the earth system holistically. In FY2016, President Obama requested $911.7 million in R&D funding for NOAA, an increase of $219.8 million (31.8%) above the FY2015 enacted level. P.L. 114-113 funds NOAA R&D at $806.4 million, $105.3 million (11.5%) less than the FY2016 request. R&D funding consists of $478.7 million for research, $81.3 million for development, and $246.3 million for R&D equipment, with a focus on vessel construction and fleet improvements. NOAA's administrative structure is organized by five line offices reflecting its diverse mission. In FY2016, the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) received $441.4 million for R&D, accounting for 54.7% of NOAA's total R&D funding. This marked an increase of $29.9 million (7.3%) from the FY2015 enacted level of $411.5 million. NOAA's R&D funding is distributed among its five line offices, with OAR being the primary center for R&D activities. The Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) received $441.4 million for R&D in FY2016, representing 54.7% of NOAA's total R&D funding. OAR conducts research in weather, climate, and oceans through partnerships with research institutes and the National Sea Grant College Program. The President's FY2016 request included $165.6 million for cooperative institutes, an increase from the previous year. The House-passed bill allocated $155.0 million for cooperative institutes, $10.6 million less than the FY2016 request. The Senate committee-reported bill proposed $162.0 million, $7.0 million more than the House-passed bill. P.L. 114-113 provided $168.0 million for cooperative institutes, $6.0 million more than the Senate committee-reported bill. The National Sea Grant College Program consists of 33 university-based state programs supporting scientific research. The National Sea Grant College Program supports scientific research and coastal communities. The FY2016 funding levels varied, with the Senate bill allocating the highest amount at $72.8 million, $8.0 million more than the House bill and $5.5 million more than the FY2015 level. P.L. 114-113 ultimately funded Sea Grant at $73.0 million. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) receives funding that is higher than previous years, supporting agricultural research. USDA conducts research at federal facilities and universities on various topics including agricultural production, bioenergy, nutrition, food safety, and social sciences. The USDA's research and education activities are carried out by four agencies under the Research, Education, and Economics (REE) mission area. These agencies include the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), and Economic Research Service (ERS). In FY2016, the USDA research mission area receives $2.936 billion in funding, with increases for ARS buildings and facilities and the NIFA competitive grant program. The enacted appropriation does not align with the proposed changes in priorities in the Administration's request. The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is USDA's research agency with 90 laboratories nationwide and 7,400 employees. ARS focuses on food and fiber production, pest management, and new agricultural products. The FY2016 appropriation for ARS is $1.144 billion, a 1% increase from FY2015. The President requested a 5% increase. ARS proposed increases for research projects and reductions in funding for some programs. The House and Senate committees rejected reductions in funding for existing programs and addressed deficient animal welfare conditions at ARS research facilities. Congress instructed ARS to comply with Animal Welfare Act standards, allow inspections by APHIS, review and update animal care policies, and certify progress with the committees. House report language withholds 5% of the ARS appropriation until USDA certifies updates. The enacted appropriation for the ARS buildings and facilities account is $212 million, an increase of $167 million over FY2015. Funding is to be used for priorities identified in the \"USDA ARS Capital Investment Strategy,\" including construction projects such as a biocontainment laboratory in Athens, GA, a foreign disease-weed science facility in Frederick, MD, and an animal science, human nutrition, and bee research center in Beltsville, MD. In FY2016, NIFA received $1.327 billion in federal funds for research, education, and extension projects in partnership with various institutions, including land-grant universities and Hispanic-serving institutions. This funding includes statutory formula funding, competitive awards, and grants. The President's request was $1.503 billion, but Congress rejected a proposal to merge NIFA's primary accounts. The omnibus bill for FY2016 rejected the proposal to merge NIFA's primary accounts and instead continued to fund each account separately. The Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) received a $25 million increase to $350 million, but fell short of the $125 million increase requested by the President. Formula-funded programs remained constant, except for a $1.7 million increase for historically black colleges and universities. The omnibus also rejected a proposal to add a competitive portion to capacity awards programs. The House report highlighted the lack of state matching funding for some historically black colleges and universities and directed USDA to develop a plan to address this issue. The omnibus bill for FY2016 rejected the proposal to merge NIFA's primary accounts and instead continued to fund each account separately. The Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) received a $25 million increase to $350 million, falling short of the $125 million increase requested by the President. The enacted appropriation ignored the proposal to establish two new \"Innovation Institutes\" at USDA for biomanufacturing and nanocellulosics research. The President's request aimed to consolidate federal STEM education funding, eliminating various USDA programs like Higher Education Challenge Grants and Women and Minorities in STEM Program. The FY2016 omnibus bill rejected the proposal to merge NIFA's primary accounts and continued to fund each account separately. The appropriation for FY2016 provides $168 million for the National Agricultural Statistics Service, a decrease of $4 million from FY2015. The Economic Research Service supports economic and social science analysis on agriculture and rural development. The FY2016 appropriation provides $85 million for ERS, the same as FY2015, with a requested $86 million. DOI is responsible for protecting natural resources and cultural heritage, with a requested $1.075 billion in R&D funding for FY2016, a 15.0% increase from FY2015. Activities supported by this funding range from scientific observations to applied field research. The FY2016 appropriation for DOI includes $963.5 million, with 5.6% for basic research, 81.4% for applied research, and 13.0% for development. USGS is the only DOI component conducting basic research. Funding for DOI R&D is included in appropriations line items that also cover non-R&D activities. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) was established in 1879 to support the Department of the Interior's science mission. It collaborates with federal, state, and tribal partners to conduct research, provide scientific data, and manage resources. USGS funding, including for research and non-research activities, comes from a single account called Surveys, Investigations, and Research (SIR). The USGS Surveys, Investigations, and Research (SIR) account provides funding for R&D and non-R&D activities. In FY2016, USGS received $676.9 million, $11.1 million more than FY2015 and $84.2 million less than the requested amount of $1.104 billion. The requested R&D funding of $761.1 million included increases for Ecosystems, Climate and Land Use Change, and Energy, Minerals, and Environmental Health. In FY2016, the USGS received funding increases for Energy, Minerals, and Environmental Health, Natural Hazards, Water Resources, Core Science Systems, and Science Support. The House Committee on Appropriations and the Senate Committee on Appropriations reported different funding levels for USGS, with the Senate recommending $1.058.5 billion, $13.5 million more than FY2015. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 provided R&D funding for various DOI components, including the Bureau of Reclamation, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Land Management for FY2016. Funding levels varied for each component compared to FY2015 and the FY2016 request. In FY2016, R&D funding for various DOI components varied compared to FY2015 and the FY2016 request. The National Park Service received $27.0 million, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement received $26.7 million, Bureau of Indian Affairs received $9.5 million, Wildland Fire Management received $6.0 million, and Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement received no funding for R&D in FY2016. Obama requested $4.4 million for applied research in FY2016. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency funds a broad range of R&D activities to support decisions on environmental pollution control laws. Congress has funded EPA through appropriations since FY2006, with R&D funding included in line items that also cover non-R&D activities. It is challenging to determine the exact allocation of R&D funding unless it matches the request level. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency funds R&D activities through its Science and Technology (S&T) account, which includes research conducted by the agency and external entities receiving EPA grants. The S&T account receives funding from a base appropriation and a transfer from the Hazardous Substance Superfund for research on cleaning up contaminated sites. In FY2016, $753.5 million was allocated to the EPA S&T account. The EPA S&T account received $753.5 million for FY2016, with $18.8 million transferred from the Superfund account. This amount is $31.8 million less than the requested $785.3 million. The House Appropriations Committee proposed $721.1 million for the S&T account in H.R. 2822, but the bill was not passed. The Senate Committee on Appropriations' reported bill, S. 1645, would have provided $720.2 million for EPA's S&T account, including transfers from the Superfund account. However, S. 1645 was not considered on the floor. The enacted FY2016 base amount for the S&T account includes mostly decreases for individual EPA program and activity line items compared to the FY2016 request. The FY2016 enacted amount for the S&T account remained the same as the FY2015 level, with a $10.0 million increase for \"Research: National Priorities\" offset by a reduction for \"Research: Sustainable and Healthy Communities.\" The additional funding for National Priorities includes $4.1 million for water quality research grants, with $3.0 million allocated for EPA research on oil and gas development. The President's FY2016 budget request did not include funding for national priorities such as research on oil and gas development in the Appalachian Basin and certification and compliance activities related to vehicle emissions. The House and Senate committee-reported bills proposed less funding overall compared to the President's request and FY2015 enacted levels for EPA's S&T account. The House committee-reported bill was $64.2 million less than the President's request, while the Senate committee-reported bill was 8.3% less. The President's FY2016 budget request for EPA's S&T account was 8.3% less than the appropriated amount for FY2015. Title IV of Division G contains provisions restricting the use of funds for regulatory actions. The House and Senate proposed additional administrative provisions not included in the FY2016 consolidated appropriations. EPA's Office of Research and Development manages R&D at headquarters and laboratories. The EPA's Office of Research and Development manages R&D activities at headquarters and laboratories, as well as external R&D. The S&T account funds EPA R&D activities, including research laboratories and grants. Other EPA offices have research components in their programs, but it is not always the primary focus. The Department of Transportation aims to ensure a safe, efficient transportation system and improve public health and safety. The Department of Transportation aims to integrate transportation policies with housing and economic development policies, advance environmentally sustainable investments, and reduce harmful emissions. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 provides $883.1 million for R&D and R&D facilities for FY2016, with the Federal Highway Administration and Federal Aviation Administration receiving the majority of the funding. The Department of Transportation received $883.1 million for R&D and R&D facilities in FY2016. The Federal Highway Administration and Federal Aviation Administration accounted for over three-fourths of the funding. President Obama requested $1,045.6 million for DOT R&D in FY2016, an increase of $281.2 million from the previous year. The FAA received $379.2 million for R&D in FY2016, a significant increase from the previous year. The FAA's R&D funding for FY2016 was $137.2 million above the FY2015 enacted level and $27.3 million below the requested level. The FY2016 request included $342.0 million for research and development and $32.3 million for R&D facilities. $166.0 million was allocated to the FAA's Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D) account, supporting research in various areas including NextGen-specific technologies. The House-passed version of H.R. 2577 allocated $156.8 million for RE&D, $9.3 million less than the request. The Senate Committee recommended $163.3 million, $6.6 million more than FY2015. P.L. 114-113 provided $322.4 million for FHWA R&D, $130.9 million less than the requested level. The President's request included $453.3 million for FHWA R&D, an increase of $88.7 million from FY2015. The President's request included increased funding for highway R&D, Intelligent Transportation Systems R&D, State Planning and Research, and R&D-related administrative expenses. P.L. 114-113 provided increased funding for National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) R&D and R&D facilities, but decreased funding for Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) R&D and R&D facilities. The FY2016 budget for various transportation agencies allocated funds for R&D and facilities. PHMSA received $21.5 million, OST received $13.9 million, FMCSA received $8.9 million, and FTA received $7.5 million, all below requested levels. The FY2016 budget allocated funds for R&D facilities, with the Department of Veterans Affairs seeking to advance medical research for veterans. The President requested $1.147 billion for VA R&D, including funding for medical and prosthetic research. The VA Office of Research and Development receives increased funding for four main research services: biomedical laboratory R&D, clinical science R&D, health services R&D, and rehabilitation R&D. These services support various research studies to improve healthcare for veterans with physical and cognitive impairments. The Department of Veterans Affairs receives appropriations for FY2016, including funding for VA R&D. The exact allocation for R&D is unknown until the VA reports specific figures after allocating appropriations. H.R. 2577 was passed by the House and reported by the Senate committee, but the level of R&D funding in the bill is unclear. Funding for VA's Research and Medical Care Support accounts is summarized in tables. The Department of Veterans Affairs receives appropriations for FY2016, including funding for VA R&D. H.R. 2577 was passed by the House and reported by the Senate committee, but the level of R&D funding in the bill is unclear. Table 20 summarizes R&D funding for VA's Research account and Medical Care Support account. Table 21 provides amounts to be spent in Designated Research Areas (DRAs), which VA describes as \"areas of particular importance to our veteran patient population.\" Funding for research projects that span multiple areas may be included in several DRAs."
