Congress finds that methamphetamine is a highly addictive drug that contributes to violent crimes, environmental damage, and hazardous conditions in meth labs. Federal funding has been provided since 2001 to address these issues through Department of Justice programs. Since 2002, COPS funding for methamphetamine enforcement has decreased annually, despite the growing problem across the US. States need more Federal support and a permanent funding solution to combat meth abuse effectively. Permanent Federal funding is crucial for State and local law enforcement to reduce methamphetamine-related crime. The Federal Government needs to establish a long-term commitment to combat methamphetamine use by creating a permanent funding mechanism to assist States. The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended to address public safety and methamphetamine manufacturing, sale, and use through grants. The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended to provide grants to States for programs addressing methamphetamine manufacture, sale, and use to enhance public safety.

Grants can be used for supporting State and local health departments, prosecuting violations of methamphetamine laws, and procuring equipment to reduce methamphetamine use.

The curr_chunk discusses various components of a program aimed at addressing methamphetamine issues, including arrest, training for emergency services, intervention, treatment, drug court, health department support, prosecution, and program evaluation. The program aims to establish best practices for addressing methamphetamine issues, incorporating Indian Tribal participation where appropriate. It also involves identifying related governmental and community initiatives, coordinating with affected State and local government institutions, and involving counties and other units of local government in program development. The State must certify sharing funds with local governments to address methamphetamine issues, assess the impact on police resources, explain grant utilization, demonstrate a public safety need, show inability to address without Federal assistance, and specify plans for ongoing support. The State must certify that funds received will supplement, not supplant, other Federal, State, and local funds. SEC. 2993. PLANNING GRANTS. The Attorney General may provide grants to eligible entities to develop a strategy addressing methamphetamine issues for public safety, with a maximum grant of $100,000 per entity. This includes defining the problem, involving public and private organizations, and outlining their participation in a comprehensive approach.

ENFORCEMENT GRANTS: Funds allocated to States based on population ratios. SEC. 2995. NATIONAL ACTIVITIES. The Attorney General is authorized to collect data on the effectiveness of programs in reducing methamphetamine use, establish a national clearinghouse of information on effective programs, and disseminate research results and information on best practices to address methamphetamine-related issues. The program aims to address family problems caused by methamphetamine use through intervention, treatment, drug courts, and family drug courts. It also seeks to facilitate knowledge sharing among states and provide technical assistance to reduce methamphetamine use, manufacture, and sale. Funding for confronting methamphetamine use is authorized with specific amounts allocated for fiscal years 2006 to 2010. Additionally, Congress addresses the availability and illegal importation of pseudoephedrine from Canada. Congress acknowledges the abuse of pseudoephedrine in methamphetamine production and the tightening of control measures in the United States. Despite stricter laws in many states, large containers of pseudoephedrine from Canada still contribute to the methamphetamine problem. Congress urges Canada to take immediate action to address the trafficking of pseudoephedrine, as the flow of containers from Canada into the United States continues despite efforts to control it. Canada lacks a comprehensive legislative framework to tackle this issue."
