The eighth year of a presidency is crucial as it is the last chance for a President to appoint U.S. circuit and district court judges with life tenure. This report provides statistics on Senate actions on judicial nominations during the eighth year of the George W. Bush, Clinton, and Reagan presidencies. The report provides statistics on Senate actions on judicial nominations during the final year of a presidency, focusing on the number and percentage of U.S. circuit and district court nominees confirmed or returned, as well as the timing of confirmations during a President's eighth year. The report presents statistics on Senate actions regarding judicial nominations in a President's final year, specifically focusing on the confirmation dates of U.S. circuit and district court nominees during the eighth year of a presidency. The data is based on an internal CRS judicial nominations database and only includes nominations for U.S. circuit and district court judgeships. The report does not analyze the appropriate number or percentage of judicial nominations for Senate approval in a President's final year. The statistics in Table 1 show the final Senate action on U.S. circuit court nominations pending during a President's eighth year, with confirmation numbers varying among recent Presidents. During the eighth year of a presidency, the number of circuit court nominations not approved by the Senate ranged from 9 to 18. Less than half of all circuit court nominations were confirmed by the Senate during this time, with percentages varying among different presidencies. More than half of the pending circuit court nominations were not confirmed by the Senate in each President's final year in office. During the final year of a presidency, the Senate returned a significant percentage of circuit court nominations. Each President had at least one circuit court nomination approved during their eighth year in office. George W. Bush had 6 circuit court nominations in his final year, with 2 confirmed and 4 returned. During the final year of a presidency, a significant percentage of circuit court nominations were returned by the Senate. For Presidents Clinton and Reagan, more than half of the confirmed circuit court nominees were first nominated at some point prior to their eighth year in office. During a President's final year in office, the number and percentage of confirmed circuit court nominees who were first nominated prior to, or during, the eighth year might be influenced by factors such as how many nominees are \"held over\" from the previous year. During a President's eighth year in office, there is variation in the timing of Senate approval for circuit court nominations. For the three most recent Presidents with a full eighth year, no common months had at least one circuit court nominee confirmed. However, there were four months where two out of the three Presidents had nominees confirmed. During the eighth year in office, Senate approval for circuit court nominations varied. Common months with multiple nominees confirmed were February, March, April, and May. Clinton and Reagan had most confirmations in the first quarter, while Bush had them in the second quarter. During the second quarter of their eighth year in office, George W. Bush and Clinton did not have any circuit court nominees approved by the Senate. Table 3 shows the final date of Senate approval for circuit court nominations. George W. Bush and Reagan had multiple circuit court nominees approved on the same date. Table 4 displays the final Senate action on U.S. district court nominations during a President's eighth year in office. During the final year of their presidency, the number of U.S. district court nominees confirmed ranged from 24 to 33. The majority of district court nominations that received final action were confirmed by the Senate. During the final year of the George W. Bush, Clinton, and Reagan presidencies, the confirmation rates for district court nominations were 54.5%, 55.4%, and 73.3% respectively. In contrast to U.S. circuit court nominations, a majority of new district court nominations made during each President's final year were confirmed by the Senate. Of the 44 district court nominations that received final Senate action during the final year of the George W. Bush presidency, 57.7% were confirmed. During the final year of the Clinton presidency, 38 district court nominations were first submitted to the Senate, with 24 (63.2%) confirmed and 14 (36.8%) returned. For Reagan, 26 nominations were first submitted, with 19 (73.1%) confirmed and 7 (26.9%) returned. The statistics in Table 5 show the number and percentage of district court nominees confirmed during a President's eighth year, whether nominated before or during that year. During the final year of the Clinton presidency, 63.2% of 38 district court nominations were confirmed, while for Reagan, 73.1% of 26 nominations were confirmed. There is variation in the timing of Senate approval for district court nominations during a President's eighth year, with confirmations extending into the final months. During the eighth year of each presidency, there were common months where district court nominees were confirmed. In some cases, more than five nominees were confirmed in certain months. Clinton and Reagan had a majority of confirmations in the second quarter of their final year, while George W. Bush had confirmations spread out over different months. During the eighth year of each presidency, district court nominees were confirmed in specific months. George W. Bush had the most nominees approved on September 26, 2008, while Clinton had 4 on October 3, 2000, and Reagan had 8 on October 14, 1988."
