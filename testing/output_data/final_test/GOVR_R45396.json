    "content": "President Donald Trump emphasized the importance of a \"Free and Open Indo-Pacific\" (FOIP) during his speech at the APEC CEO Summit in Vietnam. Congress plays a significant role in overseeing the FOIP initiative and determining resource levels for its policies. Key considerations for Congress include the priority of the Indo-Pacific region in U.S. strategy, managing China's global influence, and the long-term U.S. role in the region. Congress has the opportunity to evaluate resource allocation for military activities, State Department operations, foreign assistance, and public diplomacy to ensure the effectiveness of the FOIP strategy. The report discusses the development and critique of the FOIP initiative, as well as the response of key regional states like India, Japan, Australia, and China. It also highlights issues for Congress, policy documents, and legislation related to the strategy. The Trump Administration aims to promote a \"free and open Indo-Pacific\" region through integrating U.S. strategy towards East Asia and South Asia. The 2017 National Security Strategy defines the Indo-Pacific region from the west coast of India to the western shores of the United States. The free and open Indo-Pacific concept responds to challenges from China's economic growth and military modernization. The Administration aims to promote a geopolitical competition between free and repressive forces in the region. The Administration's National Security Strategy (NSS) highlights a geopolitical competition in the Indo-Pacific region, with China using economic inducements, influence operations, and military threats to advance its agenda. This risks diminishing the sovereignty of states in the region. The NSS echoes previous policies aimed at promoting rules-based regimes in Asia. The Trump Administration has pursued various initiatives in the Indo-Pacific region, including agreements with Australia and the Philippines for U.S. troop rotations, shifting naval posture to the Asia-Pacific, and negotiating trade agreements. Notably, the administration withdrew from the TPP but continued other initiatives such as diplomacy with North Korea and imposing tariffs on Chinese goods. They also negotiated modifications to the Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement and called on allies to share more of the costs of stationing U.S. troops in Asia. The relationship between these initiatives and the FOIP concept is unclear. The Trump Administration has pursued various initiatives in the Indo-Pacific region, including agreements with Australia and the Philippines for U.S. troop rotations, shifting naval posture to the Asia-Pacific, and negotiating trade agreements. Efforts have been made to bring India more directly into regional initiatives, including reviving the concept of forming closer cooperation with Japan, Australia, and India as a four-member group called the \"Quad.\" The Administration's commitment to having a significant economic component to the FOIP is questioned, especially after withdrawing from the TPP. The State Department official described the rationale for the \"Quad,\" emphasizing India's key role in the Pacific and Southeast Asia. It is in the U.S. interest for India to play a weighty role in the region as a democracy that supports a free and open order. India is seen as a nation that can anchor the free and open order in the Indo-Pacific region. The NSS focuses on new security challenges in the East China Sea, South China Sea, and China-India border, along with existing tensions in the Korean Peninsula, India-Pakistan relations, and Taiwan. Analysts believe the US alliance system needs to be strengthened to address China's growing influence. The NSS marks a shift in US policy towards China, acknowledging that previous support for China's rise did not lead to liberalization but rather increased Chinese power at the expense of others' sovereignty. China expanded its power at the expense of others' sovereignty, seeking to displace the United States in the Indo-Pacific region. The NSS outlines US efforts to counter China's aims, including competing with all tools of national power, working with partners to contest unfair trade practices, and helping South Asian nations maintain sovereignty. Former Secretary of State Tillerson provided insight into the Administration's views on China in the context of the Indo-Pacific strategy. Former Secretary of State Tillerson highlighted China's rise as undermining the international rules-based order and challenging norms in the South China Sea. The United States seeks constructive relations with China but will not tolerate actions that subvert sovereignty. India needs a reliable partner on the world stage, and the US is that partner with shared values for global stability and prosperity. The Administration's development of the Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) strategy is in line with the U.S. strategic thinking to prevent any one power from dominating the Eurasian landmass. This is a response to challenges such as China's Belt and Road Initiative, military modernization, and militarization of the South China Sea. The expansion of China's naval activities in the Indian Ocean Region and strategic mistrust between China and India, China's growing influence in trade and investment in East Asia and South Asia, concerns about U.S. commitment to the Indo-Pacific region, the withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, and China's challenge to Western democratic values are key factors shaping the strategic landscape of East Asia. The National Security Strategy (NSS) highlights China's challenge to Western democratic values and the United States' alliances in the Indo-Pacific, as well as Russia's efforts to undermine the international order. There are concerns about increasing cooperation between China and Russia, with joint investment projects and military exercises like Vostok-2018. China's Ministry of National Defense has emphasized the drills aim to strengthen the China-Russia partnership. The Vostok-2018 military exercise highlights the growing partnership between China and Russia, challenging US dominance in the international world order. This deepening relationship is driven by common objectives, perceived vulnerabilities, and opportunities to expand influence. Chinese participation in the exercise signals a closer partnership between the two powers. The Vostok-2018 military exercise showcases the strengthening partnership between China and Russia, challenging US dominance. The relationship is described as an entente, with mutual suspicions still present. The Indo-Pacific region's economy is crucial to the US, with the Trump Administration prioritizing trade imbalances. The Indo-Pacific region accounts for a significant portion of the global population and GDP. The US has provided billions in grants and investments in the region, with a need for trillions in capital for energy and infrastructure. The OECD predicts a significant rise in the middle-class population in Asia. China's Belt and Road Initiative poses a new economic challenge in the region. President Trump's FOIP responds to China's Belt and Road Initiative by offering a renewed partnership with America to strengthen bonds of friendship and commerce in the Indo-Pacific region, emphasizing fair trade relationships based on reciprocity and open markets directed by private industry. The Trump administration's trade strategy focuses on bilateral trade agreements with Indo-Pacific nations based on fair and reciprocal trade principles. They aim to avoid large agreements that limit sovereignty and enforcement. The strategy also includes promoting regional cooperation for free and open seaways, transparent infrastructure financing, and resolving disputes peacefully. The goal is to establish a network of states dedicated to free markets and protected from subversive forces. The Trump administration aims to strengthen cooperation with allies on high-quality infrastructure and support fragile partner states in the Pacific Islands region. The trade war between the United States and China has raised concerns among regional states tied to trade with both countries, potentially leading to a new economic Cold War. The administration supports entering into bilateral free trade agreements with countries in the region. The Trump administration aims to strengthen cooperation with allies in the Indo-Pacific region through bilateral free trade agreements. Despite initial resistance from Japan to enter FTA negotiations, the United States and Japan announced their intent to negotiate a trade agreement focusing on goods and services. Market access for agricultural products will be limited, while the US will prioritize market access for motor vehicles. The U.S. and Japan aim to negotiate a trade agreement focusing on market access for motor vehicles. Japan may be exempt from tariff increases under the Section 232 Trade Act. The Philippines could be next in line for FTA negotiations with the U.S. The United States is interested in a bilateral free trade agreement with the Philippines, as stated by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. The U.S. withdrawal from the TPP has affected its credibility in Asia, while China is pursuing multiple FTAs in the region. China is negotiating a Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) with 15 countries in the Indo-Pacific region. The United States' ability to pursue FTAs in the region may be hindered by the Trump Administration's focus on bilateral FTAs and trade conflicts with China. The Trump Administration's focus on U.S. imports from China and concerns over China's financial support for infrastructure projects in the Indo-Pacific region have raised worries among Asian countries. Some analysts praise the administration's efforts to offer alternative options to China's Belt and Road initiative. The Trump Administration is seeking to counter Beijing's economic influence in the region by offering alternative infrastructure financing options through cooperation with countries like Japan. This initiative aims to provide Asian countries with the choice to do business with the United States instead of solely relying on Chinese government funding. The Trump Administration is aiming to counter Beijing's economic influence in the region by providing alternative infrastructure financing options through cooperation with countries like Japan. There are doubts about whether the United States can offer a viable alternative to Chinese financing, with concerns about its trustworthiness and commitment. President Trump outlined his vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO Summit in Vietnam in November 2017. The Trump Administration aims to articulate the Indo-Pacific strategy through the Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) initiatives, focusing on economic and security cooperation. Secretary of State Pompeo emphasized the goals of protecting sovereignty, promoting good governance, ensuring open access to seas and airways, and advocating for fair and reciprocal trade. The 2017 National Security Strategy (NSS) of the Trump Administration emphasizes the Indo-Pacific region as a key focus, highlighting China and Russia as competitors challenging American power and interests. The NSS welcomes India as a leading global power and strategic partner. The 2018 National Defense Strategy emphasizes the reemergence of strategic competition with revisionist powers, accusing China of coercive tactics in the Indo-Pacific region. China is seeking regional hegemony and aims to displace the United States for global preeminence in the future. The United States will deepen security cooperation with India and increase quadrilateral cooperation with Japan and Australia. The National Defense Strategy prioritizes expanding Indo-Pacific alliances and partnerships to achieve a networked security architecture capable of deterring aggression and maintaining stability. The Administration has increased Freedom of Navigation Operations in the South China Sea to challenge Chinese maritime claims and deepen regional partnerships. President Trump has supported significant increases in maritime security efforts. President Trump has significantly increased defense spending, adding over $200 billion for fiscal years 2017 through 2019. He added $15 billion to the FY 2017 budget and proposed a $639 billion budget for FY 2018, a $56 billion increase. The 2019 National Defense Authorization Act authorizes $717 billion in defense spending, with significant amounts allocated for defense operations in Australia, the British Indian Ocean Territory, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore. In FY2019, the Trump Administration allocated $77.5 million for Defense operations in the Republic of Korea and Singapore. The FOIP initiative, though vague, saw actions such as restarting the \"Quad\" concept, renaming the US Pacific Command to Indo-Pacific Command, and increasing security assistance by $300 million. Other initiatives included challenging Chinese sovereignty in the South China Sea and promoting digital connectivity and infrastructure with $113 million in economic initiatives. The Trump Administration allocated funds for Defense operations in the Republic of Korea and Singapore in FY2019. They also revived the \"Quad\" concept, forming closer cooperation with Japan, Australia, and India to counter China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region. The Quad was first convened in 2007 but faced a 10-year hiatus due to concerns about antagonizing China. The Quad, consisting of Australia, India, Japan, and the United States, was revived by the Trump Administration to counter China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region. The group emphasizes shared values in regional security and offers an alternative for countries seeking infrastructure investment. In May 2018, Defense Secretary Mattis renamed the former U.S. Pacific Command to the Indo-Pacific Command, covering 50% of the world's population. Concerns have been raised about the Administration's geographic definition of the Indo-Pacific, which excludes the western reaches. The Indo-Pacific Command, covering 50% of the world's population, excludes the western Indian Ocean falling within other command areas. Secretary of Defense Mattis emphasized the importance of the Indo-Pacific, ASEAN centrality, cooperation with China, deepening alliances, and practicing consistent principles in his 2018 speech. During his remarks, Secretary of Defense Mattis emphasized key themes such as expanding attention to the maritime space, interoperability, strengthening the rule of law, civil society, transparent governance, and private sector-led economic development. Secretary of State Pompeo announced the Trump Administration's intent to provide $300 million in security assistance for projects related to maritime security, humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, peacekeeping operations, and countering transnational crime in the Indo-Pacific region. Mike Pompeo announced $113.5 million in new U.S. initiatives to support the digital economy, energy, and infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific region. The initiatives include the Digital Connectivity and Cybersecurity Partnership, Enhancing Development and Growth through Energy, and Infrastructure Transaction and Assistance Network. The United States, Japan, and Australia have formed a trilateral partnership to mobilize investment for a prosperous Indo-Pacific. Additionally, legislation in Congress, such as the BUILD Act, aims to reorganize and expand U.S. trade and development programs. The BUILD Act aims to double the U.S. government's development finance capacity to $60 billion. However, there are concerns about the lack of clarity on funding for the Indo-Pacific region. Observers question the implementation of the Free and Open Indo-Pacific initiative, with doubts about the U.S.'s commitment and resources to make it a reality. Some experts criticize the lack of strategy, policy implementation, and funding for the Free and Open Indo-Pacific initiative. Concerns are raised about the insufficient economic initiatives compared to China's commitments in the region. Critics also point out the withdrawal from the Trans Pacific Partnership and the lack of a comprehensive economic component in the strategy. Analysts argue that regional states underestimate the value of U.S. economic engagement compared to China's Belt and Road Initiatives. The FOIP concept's focus on India, Japan, and Australia raises questions about ASEAN centrality and South Korea's role. The Trump Administration emphasizes an open system beyond the Quad countries, but India's reluctance to fully engage may limit the strategy's effectiveness. The Trump Administration's Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy focuses on India, Japan, and Australia, with New Delhi welcoming the recognition of its growing role in the region. Despite some divergent views, these potential partners generally support the strategy. India, along with the U.S. and Japan, is working to counter China's Belt and Road Initiative by developing regional alternatives. New Delhi aims to enhance its connectivity with Afghanistan and Central Asia through Iran, while also supporting the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy for peace and prosperity in the region. India is looking to benefit from the expanding U.S.-India defense partnership and its Major Defense Partner status with the U.S. The Indian navy participates in joint exercises with the U.S. and Japan, but remains cautious not to antagonize China. India's approach limits its involvement in security arrangements perceived as targeting China. The concept of an \"Indo-Pacific region\" ending at the western coast of India is controversial among analysts due to India's significant interests in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) to its west, including relations with Iran, the Persian Gulf, and eastern Africa. Some Indian analysts criticize New Delhi's perceived alignment with the United States as unproductive and potentially harmful to India-China relations, especially as India defies potential U.S. backlash over its plans to purchase Russia's S-400 system. The United States threatens India with sanctions for purchasing Russia's S-400 system and continuing to import oil from Iran, fueling Indian arguments about U.S. reliability. Japan has been promoting Indo-Pacific cooperation with the U.S., India, and Australia since 2007. Japan is eager to pursue the Quad with India and Australia due to concerns over China's increasing power and influence in the region. Prime Minister Abe aims to establish a regional order not dominated by China, especially after tensions escalated over territorial disputes. The concept of a free and open Indo-Pacific is appealing to Japan, given its strong relationships with India and Australia. India and Japan have been keen to develop stronger ties under the leadership of Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Abe. Abe pursued tighter relations with India during his first stint as Prime Minister in 2006-2007. Deepening engagement with Japan is a major aspect of India's \"Act East\" policy. The two countries have developed more bilateral dialogues, supported each other on mutual concerns, and bolstered educational and cultural exchanges. Modi and Abe share a forceful leadership style and have established a strong personal rapport, benefiting from the lack of historical baggage, mutual respect for democratic institutions, and shared cultural ties in Buddhism. India and Japan have a long history of friendship rooted in spiritual affinity and cultural ties. Both countries have no disputes and have been increasing bilateral cooperation, especially in response to China's assertive actions. Japan has also been strengthening defense relations with Australia. Japan has been developing defense relations with Australia over the past decade, signing economic and security pacts under Abe. In 2017, an updated acquisition and cross-servicing agreement (ACSA) was signed, and negotiations for a visiting forces agreement are ongoing. Abe has made efforts to overcome historical obstacles, referencing World War II atrocities during a speech to the Australian parliament in 2014. Cooperation between Japan and Australia is facilitated by their use of similar practices and equipment. Abe has accelerated reforms to Japan's Self Defense Forces (SDF) to create a more advanced military, despite public concerns. Japan aims to ensure US dominance in the region, with defense analysts referring to closer relationships among allies as \"mini-laterals.\" The Quad formulation requires US leadership and engagement in the region. Security cooperation, termed \"mini-laterals,\" has expanded with the US facilitating exercises involving aircraft carriers from Japan, India, and the US focusing on anti-submarine warfare. The Malabar exercises are seen as a platform for boosting interoperability in the maritime domain in the Indo-Pacific. Australia is debating its response to China's rising influence in the region. Australia is concerned about China's influence in politics and society, while also uncertain about President Trump's stance on their alliance. Strategic geography considerations in Australia include both the Pacific and Indian Oceans, impacting resource allocation and high-level attention. The term Indo-Pacific is increasingly used, affecting how countries approach security competition in maritime Asia. The Indo-Pacific region involves recognizing growing economic, geopolitical, and security connections between the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean regions, creating a single 'strategic system.' Australia emphasizes values, a rules-based order, and collective leadership with trusted partners for security and prosperity in the region. The White Paper emphasizes the strategic transition in the Indo-Pacific region and the importance of the alliance between the United States and Australia for security and defense planning. Former Prime Minister Turnbull and President Trump reaffirmed the strength of the alliance and the alignment of interests and values in the region. They agreed on the need to defend common values and foster a stable Indo-Pacific region. The July 2018 Australia-U.S. Ministerial Consultations Joint statement highlighted a shared commitment to shaping an Indo-Pacific region based on international law and common values. China downplayed the significance of the Trump Administration's Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy, calling it a \"headline-grabbing idea.\" China welcomes development of U.S.-India relations and infrastructure investment pledges from the United States, Japan, and Australia, but questions if they will follow through on their promises. China emphasizes the importance of actions matching rhetoric and warns against inciting bloc confrontation. In June 2018, China expressed concern about a joint U.S.-Japan-India naval exercise off the coast of Guam, stating that military cooperation should promote regional peace and stability. Chinese scholars criticized the U.S. strategy as inherently anti-China, marking a shift in China-U.S. relations. In August 2018, a Chinese research fellow proposed counter-measures to blunt the impact of the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy. Suggestions included constructing an Indo-Pacific discourse system, avoiding direct military confrontation with the U.S., and focusing on non-war military operations. Trade strategies were also discussed. In response to the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy, China aims to negotiate with the U.S. through targeted counterattacks and limited concessions in the short to medium term. Long-term goals include internal reforms and demonstrating goodwill through initiatives like the 'Belt and Road Initiative' to strengthen relationships with major Asian nations and weaken their motivation to contain China. Additionally, China plans to focus on ASEAN to counter the Indo-Pacific strategy. China aims to negotiate with the U.S. through targeted counterattacks and limited concessions in response to the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy. Long-term goals include internal reforms and demonstrating goodwill through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative to strengthen relationships with major Asian nations and weaken their motivation to contain China. Additionally, China plans to focus on ASEAN to counter the Indo-Pacific strategy by improving relations with Vietnam and the Philippines, strengthening economic and trade cooperation, and enhancing security cooperation. China also seeks to strengthen strategic cooperation with Russia, Iran, and other countries to reduce pressure from the U.S. in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Pragmatic cooperation with mutual benefit and win-win results is emphasized to counter the negative impact of U.S. policies on the world order and globalization. The Belt and Road Initiative, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the BRICS, and the AIIB are highlighted as tools to build a community of shared future for mankind. The Trump Administration's FOIP initiative raises policy and oversight issues for Congress regarding the Indo-Pacific strategy. Key questions include the Administration's priorities, development of a strategy for a free and open Indo-Pacific, implementation of the Quad concept, and potential effects on trade policies. The initiative's relationship with other Administration initiatives is also a concern. The Administration's priorities towards the Indo-Pacific region are questioned, including the consideration of trade policies on allies' attitudes and the funding of new initiatives. The geographic scope of the region, specifically the definition of the western edge as the west coast of India, raises concerns about India's involvement and strategic linkages with the Persian Gulf and western Indian Ocean. The State Department's staffing situation and its impact on developing a whole-of-government strategy for the Indo-Pacific, economic elements of the FOIP strategy post-U.S. withdrawal from the TPP, potential perceptions of the FOIP as overly militarized, implications for U.S. relations with China and other regional countries. The Indo-Pacific strategy raises questions about U.S. relations with China and other regional countries, the sustainability of initiatives like the Quad, implications for defense programs and spending levels, reliance on allies to counter China's military presence, and implications for U.S. arms sales in the region. The Indo-Pacific strategy raises questions about U.S. relations with China and other regional countries, defense programs, spending levels, reliance on allies to counter China's military presence, and implications for U.S. arms sales in the region. The evolving strategy towards the Indo-Pacific may be overly reliant on military tools following the United States' withdrawal from the TPP. Should the Trump Administration seek to further develop an economic architecture for the Indo-Pacific to promote peace, stability, and enhance U.S. interests through economic interdependencies between regional states? The challenges facing the Trump Administration in establishing a Free and Open Indo-Pacific will likely persist for years. Questions include U.S. reentry into the TPP, role of allies in infrastructure financing, and policies on trade with the Indo-Pacific region. China's strategic position in the region and the importance of institutions like the Export Import Bank and Overseas Private Investment Corporation are key considerations. China's strategic position in the Indo-Pacific, defined by the Belt and Road Initiative and military power, is shifting power dynamics in the region. Regional states like India, Japan, and Australia seek stability from the US while building their own security relationships. Congress can support efforts to shape the Indo-Pacific strategically to protect American interests. The White House, U.S. Department of Defense, and U.S. Department of State have all released strategic documents regarding the United States' position in the Indo-Pacific region. These documents outline the importance of the region and the need to protect American interests. The U.S. Department of State and Department of Defense have released strategic documents on the Indo-Pacific region, emphasizing the importance of protecting American interests. The U.S. Department of State and Department of Defense have released strategic documents on the Indo-Pacific region, emphasizing the importance of protecting American interests. Additionally, key officials such as International Development Administrator Mark Green, Acting President Jeffrey D. Gerrish of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross have made announcements and remarks at the Indo-Pacific Business Forum regarding programs to increase U.S. commercial engagement in the region. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) has also announced a trilateral partnership with Japan and Australia for Indo-Pacific infrastructure.

Additionally, key officials such as International Development Administrator Mark Green, Acting President Jeffrey D. Gerrish of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross have made announcements and remarks at the Indo-Pacific Business Forum regarding programs to increase U.S. commercial engagement in the region. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) has announced a trilateral partnership with Japan and Australia for Indo-Pacific infrastructure. Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo also discussed U.S. security cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region. The Trump Administration has supported legislative initiatives related to its FOIP strategy, including provisions in the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for FY2019. Section 1251 of the law changes the name of U.S. Pacific Command. Section 1251 of the law changes the name of U.S. Pacific Command to \"United States Indo-Pacific Command\" as part of the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018. The bill aims to demonstrate U.S. commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific region and authorize $1.5 billion annually for five years to enhance U.S. presence, advance foreign policy interests, improve defense capacity of partner nations, and build new counter-terrorism partnerships in Southeast Asia. The legislation aims to enhance U.S. presence in the Indo-Pacific region, counter China's influence, and promote democracy and human rights. It authorizes $210 million annually for five years for various programs. Additionally, the BUILD Act of 2018 establishes the United States International Development Finance Corporation to facilitate private sector involvement in economic development. The BUILD Act aims to complement development assistance objectives and advance US foreign policy interests by incentivizing private sector involvement in emerging markets. It is seen as a response to China's activities in the developing world, with sponsors highlighting the need to provide countries with alternatives to Chinese investment. Senator Chris Coons believes the Act will help reduce poverty in critical areas and compete with Chinese influence. The White House Press Secretary stated that the passage of the BUILD Act is a crucial step in reforming US development finance institutions to encourage private sector investment in emerging economies and counter Chinese influence in the developing world. This is in response to China's Belt and Road Initiative."
