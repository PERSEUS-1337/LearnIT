    "content": "At the APEC Forum in November 2011, leaders from various countries outlined the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, aiming to eliminate tariffs and potentially serve as a trade pact template for APEC states. Japan, Canada, and Mexico expressed interest in joining the negotiations. The TPP was initially proposed in 2003 by Singapore, New Zealand, and Chile, with Brunei joining in 2005 and the agreement coming into force in 2006. The United States joined the negotiations in March 2008. The United States joined TPP negotiations in March 2008, expanding the group to include countries like Singapore, Chile, Australia, Peru, and Vietnam. President Obama committed to shaping a high-standard regional agreement in 2009. Malaysia joined as the ninth negotiating partner in 2010, leading to further negotiations in New Zealand. President Obama emphasized the importance of the United States being actively involved in shaping the future of the Asia-Pacific region through organizations like the TPP. U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk notified Congress of the intention to enter into negotiations with TPP countries in December 2009, setting off a 90-day timeline for congressional consultations. The TPP negotiating partners held four rounds of negotiations in 2010 in Melbourne, San Francisco, Brunei, and Auckland. Malaysia was approved as a negotiating partner in Brunei. Market access offers were exchanged in January 2011, with sessions in Santiago, Singapore, Hanoi, Chicago, and Lima. The agreement framework was announced in time for the 2011 APEC Ministerial in Honolulu, with the United States seen as a catalyst for other Asia-Pacific states to join, potentially leading to a larger Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific (FTAAP). The United States is using the TPP as a way to integrate into the Asia-Pacific region and expand its trade with Asian countries. This move is seen as a response to the increasing economic and strategic ties among Asian states. Despite being a leading trade partner for many Asian countries, the U.S. aims to strengthen its relationships in the region through the TPP. The United States is using the TPP to integrate into the Asia-Pacific region and expand trade with Asian countries. The U.S. aims to strengthen its relationships in the region through the TPP, as its importance as a trading partner for many Asian states is declining. The fear of being marginalized by not responding to the proliferation of trade agreements in Asia has led to increased engagement in the TPP negotiations. Negotiations for pending FTAs with Colombia, Panama, and Korea are facing difficulties, delaying their consideration by Congress. The Administration may use the TPP agreement to pursue a new trade strategy without current controversies. Critics are concerned that bilateral and regional agreements undermine the WTO and increase the risk of trade diversion. The TPP aims to expand membership and create a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific, focusing on intellectual property rights, standards, transparency, labor rights, and the environment. The agreement may help the US pursue a new trade strategy amid difficulties with pending FTAs with Colombia, Panama, and Korea. Critics fear that bilateral and regional agreements could undermine the WTO and lead to trade diversion. The TPP aims to expand membership and create a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific, focusing on intellectual property rights, standards, transparency, labor rights, and the environment. Australia, Peru, and Vietnam are potential negotiating partners. Chile, New Zealand, and Singapore have also expressed interest in joining. The incremental approach to negotiations may make the entry of additional members more manageable. Congress may consider the entry of future members. Chile, New Zealand, and Singapore support the inclusion of the United States in the TPP to expand trade opportunities. Chile sees TPP as a way to navigate globalization and access Asian markets. New Zealand seeks trade liberalization and views TPP as a momentum for APEC countries. New Zealand supports the inclusion of the United States in the TPP for strategic and economic reasons. Former Prime Minister Helen Clarke believes that New Zealand's focus on environment and labor agreements aligns well with U.S. Democrats. New Zealand hopes that its advanced country status and free trade credentials will help in expanding trade. Trade Minister Tim Groser welcomed President Obama's announcement of the U.S. intention to proceed with the TPP. Singapore supports the United States' involvement in the TPP to keep them engaged in the Asia-Pacific region. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong welcomed the U.S.'s decision to engage with the TPP. Vietnam's potential participation in the negotiations is more controversial as the least-developed participant. Vietnam will need to make a final decision before the fourth round in December 2010. Vietnam, the least-developed participant in the TPP negotiations, faces criticism on labor rights, intellectual property protection, and corruption. U.S. textile and apparel groups oppose Vietnam's inclusion due to barriers to U.S. exports like poor IP protection and lack of transparency. However, Vietnam's willingness to reform could inspire other developing countries in the region. The U.S. Trade Representative notified Congress of the intention to negotiate with Malaysia in the TPP after unanimous agreement. Previous FTA negotiations with Malaysia failed over issues like government procurement preferences. Malaysia is now prepared to conclude a high standards agreement and sees the TPP as a step towards regional integration. Malaysia sees the TPP as a step towards regional integration and market opening opportunities in various sectors. Participation in the TPP could help promote domestic economic reforms in Malaysia. U.S. involvement in the TPP could lead to expansion to other countries and shape regional economic standards. The TPP and U.S. FTAs are important for regional economic architecture in Asia. Exclusion could divert trade from the U.S. and weaken strategic relationships. The TPP, along with other diplomatic efforts, can improve trans-Pacific trade and perceptions of U.S. commitment to Asia. Clinton's presence, U.S. signing of the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, and Obama's interest in engaging in multilateral groupings have positively reshaped the region. President Obama's speech in Tokyo in 2009 highlighted his Asia-Pacific ties and reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to strengthen alliances in the region. There are competing regional architectures in Asia, some Asia-centric and others trans-Pacific including the U.S. and Western Hemispheric nations. U.S. policy aims to involve the U.S. in these architectures. The U.S. aims to participate in Asia-centric groups to enhance regional engagement. This includes the ASEAN + 3 and ASEAN + 6 groups, with key states seeking to balance China's influence by including Australia, India, and New Zealand. The U.S. is seeking membership in the East Asia Summit (EAS), with Secretary of State Clinton attending the October 2010 meeting as an observer. President Obama also plans to travel to the region. The U.S. aims to participate in Asia-centric groups to enhance regional engagement, including the ASEAN + 3 and ASEAN + 6 groups. President Obama plans to travel to the East Asia Summit (EAS) meeting in Jakarta in 2011. The Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific (FTAAP) proposed at the 2006 APEC meeting is being considered by APEC as a whole, with hopes that the TPP will promote trade liberalization among APEC states. The United States traditionally plays a central role in developing Asian strategic and economic architectures. The United States has key bilateral treaty relationships with Australia, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand, known as the San Francisco system. Trilateral security discussions with Australia and Japan, and a strategic opening to India have been made. Other regional states like Singapore also have close bilateral strategic ties with the U.S. New multilateral initiatives are likely to be pursued alongside bilateral ties. The U.S. aims to negotiate comprehensive free trade agreements in partner countries. The United States aims to negotiate comprehensive free trade agreements with partner countries, following provisions of the WTO General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade. The TPP among the P-4 countries includes complete elimination of tariff lines among Chile, New Zealand, and Singapore, with 99% liberalization with Brunei. Services schedules in the agreement follow a negative-list approach, representing a significant expansion on the parties' services commitments. The TPP agreement includes chapters addressing nontariff barriers, competition policy, intellectual property rights, and dispute settlement. Memoranda of understanding on labor and environmental cooperation are also included. Negotiations are ongoing for chapters on financial services and investments. The focus of the negotiations is on the \"architecture\" of the new TPP agreement, building on existing agreements among the P-4 countries and other parties. The discussion on market access schedules in the TPP agreement involves parties like the United States negotiating existing schedules for sensitive sectors. The US prefers maintaining current schedules with TPP partners without FTAs, while other countries favor a common market access schedule. The advantage of a regional agreement like TPP is to simplify trade negotiations. The TPP negotiations aim to simplify trade by reducing the \"spaghetti bowl\" effect of different rules. Countries can choose to make offers bilaterally or to the TPP as a whole. The US will make bilateral offers, while other countries can make common offers to all TPP participants. This approach avoids getting stuck in modalities discussions but raises questions about reopening provisions in existing bilateral FTAs. Provisions in existing bilateral FTAs among TPP participants may be reopened to establish a common schedule for all countries. U.S. negotiators could face pressure to revisit sensitive agricultural provisions with Australia, Chile, and Peru. Negotiators aim to include new areas for discussion to align with TPP's modern trade agreement status, including topics from APEC's nonbinding principles. The TPP prohibits local presence requirements for cross-border service providers and aims to address issues such as rules of origin, supply chain management, competition policy, trade facilitation, and technical barriers to trade. Regulatory coherence is a key focus to eliminate non-tariff barriers and enhance regulatory systems compatibility and transparency among TPP partner countries. The TPP aims to create a regulatory coordinating body similar to the U.S. Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. Competitiveness and Connectivity focus on supply chain management and trade facilitation. The World Bank's \"Doing Business\" survey ranks TPP countries on import and export procedures. There is potential for improvement among TPP participants, especially in areas like SME participation in trade. TPP partners are exploring ways for SMEs to participate in trade and access international markets. The negotiations also address how other nations can join the agreement, potentially leading to trans-Pacific economic integration. Countries may join before decisions are made, after benchmarks are agreed upon, or after a final agreement is reached, presenting challenges and opportunities for the talks. At the 2011 APEC summit, Japan, Canada, and Mexico announced plans to join TPP negotiations, potentially bringing economic benefits. However, challenges exist in convincing existing parties of their commitment without appearing to pre-negotiate. Japan's entry as the world's third-largest economy could transform the agreement. Japan, Canada, and Mexico announced plans to join TPP negotiations at the 2011 APEC summit. Japan's entry as the world's third-largest economy could transform the agreement. The United States ran a merchandise trade deficit with Malaysia, New Zealand, and Vietnam in 2010, while running surpluses with Australia, Brunei, Chile, Peru, and Singapore within the potential TPP bloc. The United States had a trade deficit with Chile, Peru, and Singapore within the potential TPP bloc, amounting to $463.2 million. Trade with the TPP-8 partner countries is the fifth-largest trading partner of the United States. Negotiating a TPP agreement would involve FTAs with New Zealand, Brunei, Malaysia, and Vietnam, with potential challenges in sensitive U.S. agriculture sectors. U.S. goods trade with New Zealand is relatively small, with two-way trade of $5.4 billion in 2010. The United States has significant trade relationships with New Zealand, Brunei, and Malaysia. In 2010, U.S. exports to New Zealand included aircraft, parts, and instruments, while imports consisted of services totaling $1.6 billion. Brunei had a minor trade partnership with the U.S., with total trade of $138.4 million. Malaysia was the 19th largest trading partner of the U.S., with two-way trade totaling $37.8 billion in 2010, including electronic circuitry and machinery exports. The United States has significant trade relationships with Malaysia, Vietnam, and other TPP countries. In 2010, U.S. imports from Malaysia included computers, electrical machinery, and furniture, while exports to Vietnam included motor vehicles and computing equipment. The U.S. also conducted $3.3 billion in services trade with Malaysia, with a $853 million surplus. The United States has the largest trade deficit among TPP participants with Vietnam. Major U.S. imports from Vietnam include clothing, footwear, and digital video cameras. The United States maintains extensive services trade with TPP countries, with consistent surpluses except for New Zealand. Services trade with Australia grew at 11.75% annually post-FTA, with faster export growth. Chile and Singapore also saw growth in services trade. Potential controversies in TPP agreement negotiations include country-specific issues like agriculture with New Zealand, and issues related to existing FTAs with Chile, Singapore, Australia, and Peru. The National Milk Producer's Federation seeks exclusion for the dairy industry. The National Milk Producer's Federation (NMPF) is seeking an exclusion for the dairy industry in potential FTA negotiations with New Zealand due to concerns about Fonterra acting as a monopoly. New Zealand officials argue that Fonterra does not have monopoly powers and producers are free to sell their products to anyone. Fonterra no longer holds a statutory monopoly, but had exclusive export licenses until 2010. Dairy products were included in the U.S.-Australian FTA with an 18-year phase-out period. New Zealand dairy products were included in the U.S.-Australian FTA with an 18-year phase-out period. Ambassador Roy Ferguson highlighted limited import penetration of dairy products into the U.S. due to pastureland constraints. He also mentioned potential benefits for the U.S. dairy industry in accessing the Asia-Pacific market through the TPP. Concerns were raised by 30 Senators about potential losses to U.S. dairy producers reaching $20 billion over 10 years if tariff-rate quotas are phased out under the TPP. The U.S. is concerned about the impact of an FTA with New Zealand on dairy and beef imports. U.S. beef cattle producers fear the removal of tariff rate quotas on imported beef. The U.S. Cattleman's Association suggests safeguards and tariff snapback measures. A broad framework for an agreement was released at the APEC summit in 2011. The United States is seeking increased intellectual property rights protection in its Free Trade Agreements, with negotiating objectives outlined in the last U.S. trade promotion authority. Reported provisions in the negotiations have sparked controversy, covering various areas such as competition, cooperation, customs, e-commerce, environment, investment, labor, and more. The U.S. trade promotion authority sought to enhance IPR protection in trade agreements, aiming for standards similar to U.S. law. This included negotiating provisions beyond the WTO TRIPS agreement, such as joining WIPO treaties. New Zealand's involvement in international IPR enforcement efforts was highlighted in the USTR's 2010 Foreign Trade Barriers Report. The U.S. trade promotion authority aimed to enhance IPR protection in trade agreements, negotiating provisions beyond the WTO TRIPS agreement. Chile, Brunei, Malaysia, Peru, and Vietnam were on the U.S. \"Special 301\" watch list for IPR issues. New Zealand favored a \"TRIPS-aligned\" position in the TPP discussions, while U.S. business groups preferred TRIPS+ provisions. The debate over IPR provisions in the TPP, particularly regarding pharmaceuticals and access to medicines, was contentious. The U.S. is negotiating IPR provisions in FTAs, balancing stronger protections from the U.S.-Korea FTA with greater access to medicines from the \"May 10\" agreement. The Trade Enhancing Access to Medicines (TEAM) initiative proposes patent extensions and data exclusivity for firms applying for marketing approval through a \"TPP Access Window.\" This aims to encourage quicker marketing of innovations in TPP countries. To expedite the marketing of innovations in TPP countries, companies would receive a Korea-FTA standard of five years of data exclusivity, mandatory patent linkage, and patent term extension provisions. This provision aims to allow for the faster introduction of generic medicines, but opponents fear it may delay the entry of generic drugs by prolonging the marketing approval process. Peru has publicly stated its opposition to the proposed IPR provisions. Peru opposes proposed IPR provisions beyond U.S.-Peru FTA. TEAM initiative aims to eliminate tariffs on medicines, reduce distribution barriers, and curb counterfeit medicine trade. New Zealand administers a national formulary for medicines. U.S. expresses concern over Pharmac's practices disadvantaging innovative pharmaceutical products. The United States and Australia agreed on consultation and transparency mechanisms for inclusion in the formulary. New Zealand ruled out changes to PHARMAC without reciprocal concessions. The U.S. proposed measures related to State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) at the Lima round, addressing competitive advantages and overseas competition. The proposal builds on the U.S.-Singapore FTA language. The U.S. proposal for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) includes provisions on State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) addressing noncompetitive financing, transparency, regulatory favoritism, and preferential purchases in government procurement. Vietnam may need to adjust its state-controlled capitalism model to comply with the agreement. The U.S. submission has been criticized by Vietnam, claiming their SOEs follow WTO rules. U.S. SOEs like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could be affected by the agreement. The United States is part of the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) and aims to include government procurement provisions in its FTAs. Singapore is the only other TPP partner country in the GPA, while New Zealand maintains a more liberalized procurement regime. New Zealand maintains government procurement preferences for its Maori population under the Treaty of Waitangi. U.S. FTAs with various countries include sections on government procurement, allowing firms to bid on contracts over a monetary threshold. Some members of Congress push for expanded labor and environmental provisions in FTAs. The existing TPP among P-4 countries includes a labor MOU and environmental cooperation agreement. The parties pledge to promote labor and environmental practices, while respecting each other's laws. They agree not to use laws for trade protection or weaken them for trade purposes. The U.S. strengthened environmental and labor provisions in trade agreements, seen in the U.S.-Peru FTA. All TPP participants, regardless of development levels, agreed to certain provisions. The TPP participants agreed to meet the same labor and environmental conditions, with the U.S. proposing specific provisions on conservation, core commitments, and public participation. Stakeholders can challenge member states' adherence to these provisions. The TPP participants agreed to meet labor and environmental conditions, with the U.S. proposing specific provisions. New Zealand, Chile, and Australia have also tabled trade and climate change submissions. Legislation implementing the TPP agreement must be passed by Congress, typically under \"fast-track\" procedures. TPA allows Congress to exercise its constitutional authority over trade, giving the President leverage to negotiate trade agreements swiftly. Concerns have been raised about the difficulty of negotiating future trade agreements without TPA."
