    "content": "The \"American Family Business Preservation Act\" establishes a reduced estate tax rate on family-owned business interests under section 2003 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The estate tax for a decedent's estate under this section is limited to a tax calculated based on certain conditions, including a reduced rate for qualified family-owned business interests. This applies to estates where the decedent was a U.S. citizen at the time of death. The estate tax for a decedent's estate is limited to a tax calculated based on certain conditions, including a reduced rate for qualified family-owned business interests. This applies to estates where the decedent was a U.S. citizen at the time of death, and if the value of these interests exceeds 50 percent of the adjusted gross estate, and if these interests were owned by the decedent or a family member for at least 5 years within an 8-year period before the decedent's death. The estate tax for a decedent's estate is limited to a tax calculated based on certain conditions, including a reduced rate for qualified family-owned business interests. This rate is 15 percent if a family member participated in the business operation, and 20 percent otherwise. A qualified family-owned business interest includes ownership as a proprietor or partner in a business entity. The term \"qualified family-owned business interest\" excludes interests readily tradable on the market. Rules similar to section 6166(b) apply for determining eligibility. Recapture of tax benefits occurs if interests are not held for 10 years post decedent's death. The additional estate tax is imposed if a qualified family-owned business interest is distributed, sold, exchanged, or withdrawn in amounts exceeding 20 percent of its value. The tax amount is based on the excess of the estate tax liability without this provision. The adjusted estate tax liability is determined by subtracting the applicable percentage from the estate tax liability. The applicable percentage is calculated by reducing 100 percent by 10 percentage points multiplied by the number of years after the decedent's death that the additional estate tax is imposed. The estate tax liability is defined as the tax imposed by section 2001 reduced by allowable credits. Rules similar to section 6166(g)(1) apply. If heirs cease to participate within 10 years, a portion of the tax benefit may be recaptured. If the applicable rate was 15 percent, this provision applies. The additional estate tax is imposed if, within a 10-year period after the decedent's death, no qualified heir materially participates in the family-owned business. The tax amount is based on the excess of the estate tax liability without the provision over the actual estate tax liability. The text discusses definitions related to estate tax liability and terms such as 'applicable percentage', 'estate tax liability', 'qualified heir', and 'member of the family'. It also includes a clerical amendment to the tax code. Reduced rate on family-owned business interests effective for estates of decedents dying after enactment. Limitation on 4 percent interest rate on estate tax extended under Section 6166 does not apply to estate tax from qualified family-owned business interests. The amendment exempts qualified family-owned business interests from the 4 percent interest rate under Section 6601(j) of the Internal Revenue Code, unless an election is made under section 2032A. This change applies to estates of decedents dying after the enactment date. Additionally, the extension of the alternate valuation date to 40 months is granted for estates primarily consisting of qualified family-owned business interests. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to extend the alternate valuation date to 40 months for estates largely consisting of qualified family-owned business interests. Additionally, the time for filing estate tax return is extended to 43 months for these estates. This amendment applies to estates of decedents dying after the enactment date. SEC. 5.
