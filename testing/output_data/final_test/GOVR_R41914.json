    "content": "The Edison Electric Institute (EEI) prepared a chart in 2010 outlining the timeline for environmental regulatory requirements for coal-fired power plants. The chart identified rules under development at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) between 2008 and 2017, including the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule and the Clean Air Interstate Rule. The EEI outlined environmental regulatory requirements for coal-fired power plants, including cap-and-trade programs, emission standards for mercury and hazardous air pollutants, NAAQS for various pollutants, greenhouse gas regulations, cooling water intake regulations, clean water effluent guidelines, and coal combustion waste management rules. EEI's report predicted that new EPA regulations could lead to the unplanned retirement of 17 to 59 power plants. The EPA regulations could lead to the retirement of 17 to 59 gigawatts of coal-fired electric capacity by 2015, requiring $85 billion to $129 billion in capital expenditures. Various groups, including EEI, ALEC, and NERC, have expressed concerns about the impact of EPA rules on the coal industry. The EPA regulations could lead to the retirement of 17 to 59 gigawatts of coal-fired electric capacity by 2015, requiring significant capital expenditures. Various groups have expressed concerns about the impact of EPA rules on the coal industry, with many reports critical of the potential system reliability issues. Multiple bills have been introduced to reduce regulatory burden or delay implementation of specific EPA rules, sparking debate in Capitol Hill. Coal-fired power plants, a major source of pollution, are aging and have lagged in emissions regulation compared to other industries. Despite a decline in coal's share of electric power generation, it still dominates the industry. These plants provide base-load power, running 24/7 to supply cheap electricity. The average coal-fired plant is over 40 years old, contributing to its cost-effectiveness. The average coal-fired power plant is over 40 years old and fully amortized in capital cost. Natural gas plants, the second largest source of electricity, have been built more recently. Coal is abundant and cheap compared to natural gas, costing less over a 12-year period. Other factors affecting power prices include plant efficiency, maintenance costs, and ash removal expenses. Coal-fired power plants have a cost advantage due to older plants operating without pollution control equipment, despite being major sources of air pollutants. The Clean Air Act focuses on new sources of pollution, allowing older coal plants to operate with minimal controls. The Clean Air Act requires new plants and major modifications to install Best Available Control Technology (BACT) for operating permits. Grandfathered plants, mainly coal-fired, are exempt unless state or local regulations apply. Existing power plants must comply with cap-and-trade programs like the acid rain program and NOx control program. Companies can meet emission caps by various means such as using lower sulfur fuels or purchasing allowances. Burning coal for electricity production can lead to environmental impacts such as air pollution, water pollution, and solid waste residuals. EPA's regulatory activities, as shown in the EEI timeline, address these issues, with a focus on air pollution. The timeline covers actions from 2008-2017, including court decisions and rules from both the Obama and Bush administrations. The Bush Administration's Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) faced court decisions and was designed to be implemented in phases, with multiple entries for different caps. CAIR and its replacement rules account for a significant portion of the regulatory burden on the \"train wreck\" charts. The timeline also includes rules that may not be imminent, such as the coal combustion waste rule authorized in 1980. The EPA has been conducting studies on whether coal combustion waste should be considered hazardous waste since 1980. Despite proposing regulations in 2010, the agency has not set a timeline for finalizing the rules. Several major rules affecting coal-fired power plants are expected to be promulgated within the next 18 months, with varying costs. The EPA has been studying coal combustion waste since 1980, with proposed regulations in 2010. Various rules affecting coal-fired power plants are expected to be finalized soon, with costs varying. The regulatory inaction over the years has led to multiple actions being taken simultaneously by the EPA. The Solid Waste Disposal Act required special studies and reports to Congress before EPA could set standards for certain pollutants emitted or wastes disposed by electric utilities. Other industries have been subject to more stringent emission controls or waste management standards for a decade or more. The rules discussed began development under the Bush Administration or earlier. The EPA rules, including the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule and the Utility MACT rule, have been vacated or remanded by the courts. Critics are concerned about the cumulative impact of multiple requirements and the lack of analysis on jobs and economic impacts. The Obama Administration's reconsideration of the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard has delayed the implementation of Bush Administration rules. The report discusses the potential economic impacts of multiple EPA rules on power plant operators, including the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. Critics are worried about the cumulative effects of these rules on jobs and the economy. The Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (Cross-State Rule) replaced the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) to control emissions of air pollution from coal-fired power plants in 28 Eastern states. Both rules aim to address air quality issues in downwind states. The Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (Cross-State Rule) replaced the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) to control emissions of air pollution from coal-fired power plants in 28 Eastern states. The rule allows unlimited trading of allowances within states and limits interstate trading to address legal issues. Compliance costs are estimated at $3.0 billion in 2012 and $2.4 billion in 2014. The Cross-State Rule replaces CAIR to control emissions from coal-fired power plants in 28 Eastern states. Compliance costs estimated at $3.0 billion in 2012 and $2.4 billion in 2014. The rule sets new limits for SO2 emissions, with a focus on reducing emissions to 2.4 million tons in 2014. EPA is implementing a Federal Implementation Plan for states to control emissions from power plants. States can develop their own plans, but the federal plan will take effect until replaced. Phase 1 rules have led to significant reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions from fossil-fueled power plants. Emissions were 44% and 45% below 2005 levels in 2009, respectively. Compliance with the Cross-State Rule is estimated to cost the power sector $2.4 billion annually, with expected benefits of $120 billion to $280 billion annually. The Cross-State Rule is estimated to cost the power sector $2.4 billion annually, with benefits ranging from $120 billion to $280 billion. It would result in 13,000 to 34,000 fewer premature deaths annually, with Ohio and Pennsylvania benefiting the most. Both EEI and NERC included the rule in their analyses, with projections of deratings or retirements of coal-fired capacity. EEI's analysis projected compliance costs to align with EPA's assumptions until 2017, but differed post-2017 by assuming SCR installation on all units for NOx reduction. This would incur additional costs as many coal-fired units lack SCR. EPA has not proposed post-2014 requirements, so compliance costs and implementation schedules for future pollution regulations remain uncertain. The Cross-State Air Pollution Rule and its predecessor, CAIR, would cost the coal-fired electric generating industry $2-3 billion annually. The industry has already complied with Phase 1 of the regulations ahead of schedule, thanks to tradable allowances. The final Cross-State Rule allows more allowance trading, giving EGUs flexibility and lowering compliance costs. In 2005, EPA established a cap-and-trade system to reduce mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants, which account for half of U.S. mercury emissions. Electric generating units (EGUs) contribute significantly to U.S. mercury emissions, posing health risks such as neurological defects and lower IQ in fetuses and children. In 2005, the EPA implemented cap-and-trade rules specifically targeting mercury emissions from power plants, allowing for trading of allowances to meet pollution control requirements. This was a departure from previous regulations under the Clean Air Act, which mandated plant-specific Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards for various hazardous air pollutants. The EPA implemented cap-and-trade rules in 2005 for mercury emissions from power plants, allowing trading of allowances to meet pollution control requirements. Plants could avoid emission control by purchasing allowances, leading to \"hot spots\" of high mercury concentrations. The MACT standards require existing plants to meet emission limits of the best performing 12% in the industry subcategory, known as the \"MACT floor.\" The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the cap-and-trade option challenged by the State of New Jersey. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the cap-and-trade rules in 2008, requiring coal-fired power plants to achieve a 91% reduction in emissions under the proposed Utility MACT. EPA proposed the Utility MACT in response to the court's ruling, with final standards to be promulgated by November 16, 2011. The Utility MACT aims to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants by 91% for mercury and other toxic metals, as well as acid gases listed as hazardous air pollutants. Power plants are major emitters of these pollutants, with significant reductions expected to prevent premature deaths. EPA noted that 56% of existing coal-fired power plants are already in compliance with the standards, leveling the playing field for older, poorly controlled plants. The proposed standards aim to bring older, poorly controlled coal-fired plants up to the emissions standards achieved by the majority of existing units. EPA projected that some plants, representing less than 10 GW of capacity, will be retired by 2015 instead of investing in control technologies. Compliance with the rule is estimated to cost $10.9 billion in 2015, with an average increase of $3-$4 per month in electricity costs for consumers. These costs will mainly go towards installing scrubbers and fabric filters. The EPA estimates that compliance with the rule will cost $10.9 billion in 2015, with costs mainly going towards installing scrubbers and fabric filters. About 26 GW of coal-fired units are expected to install scrubbers, while more than half of the coal-fired EGU capacity (166 GW) are expected to add fabric filters. Activated carbon or dry sorbent injection will be coupled with fabric filters to remove mercury and other HAPs from plant emissions. EPA estimates that 62 GW of coal-fired capacity would have either injection method. The EPA rule requires coal-fired power plants to install activated carbon or dry sorbent injection technology to reduce emissions. This technology has been used successfully in other facilities for 15 years. The rule is estimated to provide annual benefits of $59 billion to $140 billion, primarily from avoiding premature deaths. Other benefits include reducing heart attacks, asthma cases, and developmental effects on children. The EPA's Utility MACT rule is costly and likely to impact older coal-fired plants without current pollution control technology. The proposal allows some units to average emissions but most will still need to comply with strict requirements, including installing scrubbers, activated carbon injection, and fabric filters. The rule goes beyond EPA's initial proposal, requiring more extensive measures for compliance. The EPA's Utility MACT rule is projected to require significantly more pollution control equipment than initially estimated, making compliance more costly and challenging. NERC's analysis suggests a need for five times more scrubber capacity, three times more ACI, and one and a half times more baghouse capacity than EPA's projections. The report assumes the addition of wet scrubbers, SCR, and baghouses to coal-fired plants, exceeding EPA's anticipated requirements. NERC's analysis indicates that the EPA's Utility MACT rule will likely result in higher costs and more retirements or deratings of capacity. The rule mandates existing power plants to meet standards within a three-to-four-year timeframe, which some in the industry argue is insufficient for installing required pollution control equipment and could impact the reliability of the nation's electric power supply. The Utility MACT rule could impact power supply by driving Planning Reserve Margins below standards, leading to the retirement of existing coal capacity. Retrofitting units with environmental controls is necessary to comply with the rule's 2015 deadline, posing challenges for electric system reliability. EPA, EEI, and NERC have analyzed the proposal, highlighting potential issues with implementation. EPA proposed New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) to address greenhouse gas emissions from power plants by July 26, 2011, with final action expected by May 26, 2012. Electric generating units are the largest U.S. source of greenhouse gas emissions. Electric generating units are the largest U.S. source of greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for about one-third of total U.S. emissions. Coal-fired plants accounted for 81% of the electric power industry's total GHG emissions in 2009 and are expected to be the main focus of EPA's NSPS rules. NSPS are emission limitations imposed on major new stationary sources of air pollution, including greenhouse gases. EPA has the authority to set NSPS for emissions of air pollutants, regardless of the location of the new or modified sources. EPA can impose standards directly for new sources and through states for existing sources. The EPA has the authority to impose performance standards on new and modified sources of air pollution, including greenhouse gases. Section 111 grants the EPA flexibility in regulating source categories, sizes, gases, timing, and stringency of regulations. This flexibility extends to costs, secondary effects, and energy requirements. The EPA has the authority to impose performance standards on new and modified sources of air pollution, including greenhouse gases, with flexibility in regulating various aspects. The process of applying emission limits for GHGs to existing power plants may take several years due to the need for proposal, guidelines, state implementation plans, and case-by-case determinations. EPA has not yet proposed NSPS for existing sources. EEI's analysis assumed CO2 regulations in place by 2017, estimating a cost of $25 per ton of emissions with annual price escalation. This would impose a significant burden on coal-fired power plants, with a projected cost of $43.7 billion in 2017 and increasing annually. The analysis of legislation not enacted in the 111th Congress shows that CO2 regulation would lead to significant retirements of power plant capacity. The EPA is required to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for pollutants that endanger public health or welfare, but NERC did not include CO2 regulation in its study. NAAQS do not directly regulate emissions but identify pollutant concentrations to protect public health and welfare. The NAAQS set standards to protect public welfare by defining clean air. Once established, EPA monitors areas exceeding standards and requires plans to reduce pollution levels. Nonattainment areas have 3-20 years to meet standards. EPA also controls many NAAQS. The EPA sets NAAQS to control pollution, with Congress requiring regular reviews and revisions of standards. Currently, the agency is reviewing the standards, with some being challenged in court. The EPA is reviewing NAAQS standards, some of which are being challenged in court. The electric power industry is closely monitoring this process as more stringent standards could lead to stricter emission regulations, particularly for SO2, ozone, and particulate matter. In 2010, the EPA revised the NAAQS for SO2, focusing on short-term exposures, after the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals remanded the standard back to the agency in 1998 for inadequate explanation of the public health threat from short-term SO2 exposures. The EPA revised the NAAQS for SO2 in response to a court decision, implementing a more stringent 1-hour standard of 75 ppb. This may lead to an increase in nonattainment areas, requiring additional controls on sources of SO2 emissions, particularly electric generating units. The timing and extent of these controls are uncertain due to incomplete monitoring networks. The EPA needs 41 new monitoring sites to supplement the existing network for a more complete data base on SO2 concentrations. It may take until 2016 for some areas to have enough data to be classified as nonattainment. Compliance with control requirements may not occur until several years later. Despite identifying 59 counties at risk of violating the new SO2 NAAQS, it is uncertain if any will be in nonattainment. Based on 2007-2009 data, it is uncertain if any of the identified counties will be in nonattainment by the time EPA designates nonattainment areas. The agency estimated that reducing 370,000 tons of SO2 by 2020, with two-thirds coming from EGUs, would cost $1.5 billion annually. Benefits could range from $15 billion to $37 billion, not accounting for CAIR, Cross-State Rule, or Utility MACT. The agency assumed none of these rules were in effect, as the baseline for analysis. The baseline for analysis is complicated by expected air quality regulations affecting EGU emissions. Controls attributed to the SO2 NAAQS will likely be needed for compliance with other future rules. EPA's analysis suggests that the SO2 NAAQS has relatively little impact on coal-fired power plants compared to other regulations. The agency's assumptions may overstate the impact of the standard. The EPA's analysis suggests that the SO2 NAAQS has little impact on coal-fired power plants compared to other regulations. The NAAQS for ozone is being revised, with a finalization expected by July 2011. Ozone is formed in the atmosphere from chemical reactions involving nitrogen oxides emitted by power plants. The EPA is revising the ozone standard to potentially tighten controls on NOx emissions from power plants. This change could impact 119 million people living in nonattainment areas. The proposed revision would lower the ozone standard from 0.075 parts per million to 70-60 ppb over 8 hours. At least 515 counties could violate the new standard, compared to 85 under the current standard. Additionally, a separate standard for public welfare would be set for the first time. The EPA is proposing to tighten controls on NOx emissions from power plants by revising the ozone standard to 70-60 ppb over 8 hours. This change could impact 119 million people in nonattainment areas. A separate standard for public welfare would be set for the first time, with estimated costs ranging from $19 billion to $25 billion annually if the standard is set at 70 ppb, or $52 billion to $90 billion if set at 60 ppb. EPA is prohibited from considering costs in setting NAAQS but does prepare cost and benefit estimates for information purposes. The EPA is proposing to tighten controls on NOx emissions from power plants by revising the ozone standard to 70-60 ppb over 8 hours, impacting 119 million people in nonattainment areas. The estimated costs range from $19 billion to $25 billion annually at 70 ppb, or $52 billion to $90 billion at 60 ppb, with benefits of a similar amount. The ozone NAAQS revision is unlikely to have major impacts on electric generating units, as other sources account for most emissions. Utility NOx emissions may be targeted through the Cross-State Rule, with the ozone NAAQS serving as a driver for the development of other rules. The EPA is considering revising the PM NAAQS for particulate matter, including PM 2.5 and PM 10 standards. EPA staff have recommended strengthening the standards, but there is no proposal yet. Fuel combustion by electric utilities contributes to 8.3% of PM 2.5 and 3.5% of PM 10 emissions. The agency expects to propose revised standards by summer 2011, with potential promulgation in 2012. Power plants withdraw large volumes of water for production and cooling, causing environmental harm through impingement and entrainment of aquatic life in cooling water intake structures. Regulatory efforts to protect aquatic organisms from harm in cooling water intake structures under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act have faced legal challenges for over 35 years. New facilities are regulated under 2001 rules, while rules for existing facilities issued in 2004 were challenged and remanded to EPA for revisions. In March 2011, EPA proposed national requirements expected to affect 559 existing electric generators, with fossil-fuel facilities comprising the majority. The EPA proposed regulations for cooling water intake structures (CWIS) at electric generating facilities in the US, triggering a 90-day public comment period. The regulations were controversial, with concerns about the impact on electricity supply reliability and costs. The proposed rule evaluated four regulatory options to minimize harm to aquatic species. The EPA proposed regulations for cooling water intake structures (CWIS) at electric generating facilities in the US, with a focus on minimizing harm to aquatic species. Closed-cycle cooling was found to be the most effective technology but was not mandated universally due to cost considerations. The recommended approach would maintain current permitting procedures based on site-specific determinations. The decision not to mandate closed-cycle cooling was based on factors such as additional energy requirements and threats to energy reliability. The EPA proposed regulations for cooling water intake structures at electric generating facilities in the US to minimize harm to aquatic species. More than 90 of the affected electric generators already have the technology required for compliance with the rule. Compliance deadlines will be set when facilities renew their CWA discharge permits. Permitting agencies allow time for facilities to comply with new requirements. The EPA proposed regulations for cooling water intake structures at electric generating facilities in the US to minimize harm to aquatic species. Compliance deadlines will be set when facilities renew their CWA discharge permits, with a five-year compliance period assumed for facilities already in compliance or needing different technologies. Fossil-fuel electric power generating facilities are expected to achieve compliance from 2018 to 2022. The estimated annual costs of the proposed rule are $319 million, with benefits of $17.6 million annually. Nine generating units are projected to be retired as a result of the rule, with industry groups generally favoring the proposal but seeking more flexibility, while environmental advocates criticize the lack of stricter technological options. The EPA proposal for cooling water intake structures at electric generating facilities in the US does not mandate stricter technological options to protect aquatic resources. States will handle most permitting actions, with some preferring a regulatory approach to reduce administrative costs. Industry expected a more stringent rule with a quicker compliance timeline, including retrofitting power plants with closed-cycle cooling systems. The estimated cost of compliance through 2020 is $16 billion for 400 electric generating units. The rule is projected to affect 314 GW of capacity, but the number of plant retirements is not specified. The NERC analysis anticipated that the CWIS rule would be the costliest of the EPA rules examined, potentially leading to power plant retirements totaling 33 GW of capacity. Only 2.5 GW of that total would be from coal-fired power plants, with older oil- and gas-fired units expected to be most affected. EPA establishes national regulations to reduce pollutant discharges from industries under CWA Section 304. The EPA issues effluent limitation guidelines (ELGs) for industries to reduce pollutant discharges to waterways. Current regulations for steam electric power plants, established in 1982, do not adequately address pollutants being discharged, especially from coal-fired plants with flue gas desulfurization systems. EPA found that these regulations have not kept pace with industry changes over the last three decades. According to EPA, 30% of coal-fired power plants used FGD systems to control SO2 emissions by June 2008, with an expected increase to 80% by 2025. While scrubbers reduce harmful pollutants, they can create a significant liquid waste stream. Concerns about water quality degradation from discharges at power plants have grown, especially after incidents like the collapse of ash impoundment dams at TVA plants. Pollutants of concern include metals like mercury and arsenic. The EPA is concerned about water quality impacts from discharges at power plants, particularly from FGD systems and CCW containing metals like mercury, arsenic, chromium, and selenium. Current CWA permits may not fully address these impacts, leading to a need for revised guidelines every five years. Environmental groups sued EPA in 2009 to push for updated regulations, resulting in a consent decree in 2010 for EPA to propose revised guidelines for power plants. In a decree with environmental litigants, EPA agreed to propose a revised power plant ELG by July 23, 2012, and finalize the rule by January 31, 2014. The rulemaking will address wastewater discharges from CCW ash storage ponds and FGD air pollution controls, as well as other power plant waste streams. Compliance with specific regulations will occur over several years, with full compliance likely not required before 2019 or 2020. EPA has also launched an effort to scrutinize state-issued CWA discharge permits for power plants as an interim measure to address concerns. In a letter to environmental groups, EPA committed to reviewing at least 35 CWA permits for power plants before the end of 2012 and provided interim guidance to assist state and EPA permitting authorities in establishing requirements for power plant wastewater discharges. The agency has not proposed a revised steam electric power ELG rule, so no Regulatory Impact Analysis or cost estimate has been provided. Coal combustion waste (CCW) is the inorganic material left after burning coal for electricity production, with an estimated 135 million tons generated in 2009. In 2009, 135 million tons of coal combustion waste (CCW) were generated in the United States. Disposal of CCW at power plants can lead to long-term accumulation of dry or wet ash, posing risks such as catastrophic releases and contamination of surface or groundwater with heavy metals. The 2008 breach at TVA's Kingston plant highlighted the dangers of managing large volumes of waste. The Kingston release in 2008 raised concerns about the management and regulation of coal combustion waste (CCW). CCW management is primarily regulated by individual states, with inconsistencies and deficiencies identified by the EPA. National standards are needed to address potential threats to human health and the environment. EPA proposed two national standards on June 21, 2010. In 2010, EPA proposed two regulatory options for coal combustion waste (CCW) due to concerns about its impact on human health and the environment. The evolution of CCW regulation began in 1978 under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, with Congress excluding CCW from hazardous waste regulation in 1980. EPA published regulatory determinations in 1993 and 2000, exempting CCW from hazardous waste regulation but stating that national regulations under Subtitle D were warranted for CCW disposal in landfills and surface impoundments. In October 2009, EPA developed a draft regulatory proposal to list coal combustion waste (CCW) as hazardous waste under Subtitle C of RCRA due to risks to human health and the environment from inadequate disposal methods. EPA cited new data showing the need for regulation under Subtitle C, including the substantial risks posed by disposal in unlined landfills and surface impoundments. The final proposal, published on June 21, 2010, stated that the determination to revise the regulatory determination had not yet been made. It proposed two regulatory options for consideration: one to list waste as hazardous and regulate it, and the other to establish national criteria for non-hazardous waste under Subtitle D. EPA would rely on states or citizen suits to enforce the new standards. EPA considered two regulatory options for coal combustion waste (CCW) - one to label it as hazardous waste and regulate it, and the other to set national criteria for non-hazardous waste under Subtitle D. Industry's concern was that labeling CCW as hazardous waste would stigmatize its beneficial uses and increase disposal amounts. EPA's public comment period ended on November 19, 2010, with uncertainty on when a final rule will be issued. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson stated in March 2011 that a final rule in 2011 was unlikely due to the high number of public comments. Congressional hearings expressed concerns about potential impacts of Subtitle C regulations on coal-producing states, regulatory agencies, energy prices, and CCW recycling opportunities. Concerns were raised by Members regarding the Subtitle D option, citing worries about insufficient protection for human health and the environment due to EPA's limited enforcement authority. EPA's Regulatory Impact Analysis estimated annualized regulatory costs to be around $1.5 billion under the Subtitle C option and $587 million under the Subtitle D option. Regulatory benefits were also estimated, with potential variations depending on recycling behavior in response to disposal costs or stigma effects. EPA anticipated a decrease in recycling under the Subtitle C option. The EPA estimated regulatory costs and benefits of the Subtitle C and Subtitle D options for regulating materials. The EEI report suggested higher costs for the Subtitle C option due to retrofitting existing disposal units and sending waste to offsite hazardous waste facilities. EPA's options do not require existing landfills to be retrofitted as long as they implement groundwater monitoring systems. The EPA assumes facilities will choose to close rather than retrofit existing surface impoundments. EEI believes some facilities will retrofit. EEI also assumes siting restrictions and local ordinances may impact the decision to open new CCW landfills. However, industry statements suggest new landfills can meet proposed regulations. According to industry statements, new CCW landfills are built with liners and monitoring systems, suggesting that new Subtitle C standards may not differ significantly from current industry practices. EPA and other federal agencies are working on regulatory proposals to address environmental impacts of surface coal mining, including mountaintop removal in Appalachia. These actions do not directly impact power plants and are not covered in studies by EEI or NERC. Critics have labeled these actions as part of a \"War on Coal.\" The EPA, Corps, and Interior are taking actions related to mountaintop removal mining in Appalachia, labeled as a \"War on Coal.\" Coal is projected to continue playing a significant role in electricity generation, with estimates ranging from 36% to 46% by 2020. Despite some coal-fired capacity retirements, coal is expected to still power a substantial portion of the nation's electricity by 2030. The impact of EPA regulations on these retirements is a matter of debate. The EPA regulations are causing disputes over coal-fired capacity retirements, with older plants without scrubbers being prime candidates for retirement. About 110 GW of coal-fired plants from 1940-1969 are at risk, as they are less economic and lack pollution controls. The EPA regulations are leading to disputes over coal-fired capacity retirements, with older plants without emission controls being targeted for retirement. Data shows that these pre-1970 units are only in use 41% of the time. The average unit to be retired under the MACT rule will be 51 years old with an average capacity of 109 Mw, and has operated only 56% of the time. Most replacements for these retired units are likely to be natural gas combined cycle units. Since 1990, over 80% of new capacity has been natural gas-fired. Natural gas-fired power plants are highly efficient, cost-competitive with coal, and emit no hazardous air pollutants. They emit only half the greenhouse gases of coal-fired units and have enjoyed a price advantage in recent years. Utilities have been increasing natural gas consumption and reducing coal usage due to this price advantage. The recent study by Credit Suisse indicates that natural gas prices would need to rise to $6.30 per mcf for coal and natural gas to trade at parity for electricity generation. Older, less efficient coal-fired power plants are facing retirements as utilities weigh the cost of retrofitting and operating them. The newer coal-fired facilities with pollution controls may not be shuttered, as they already comply with proposed rules or can easily make modifications. Some facilities may justify retrofitting due to efficiency or regional demand, but timing and grid reliability issues remain uncertain. Utilities are concerned about meeting deadlines for modifications. In congressional testimony, Thomas A. Fanning, Chairman of The Southern Company, expressed concerns about the impact of new regulations on the reliability of the electric generating system. He highlighted the risk posed by compliance schedules and accelerated plant retirements. American Electric Power's CEO also announced the retirement of coal-fired generation in support of regulations. Power's Chairman and CEO, Michael G. Morris, expressed concerns about the EPA's regulatory path, stating that compliance timelines are unrealistic and will result in the premature shutdown of coal-fueled generating capacity, job cuts, and significant capital investment. Others argue that timing and system reliability will not be an issue. The Clean Energy Group and the Institute of Clean Air Companies argue that timing and system reliability will not be a problem for compliance with the Utility Toxics Rule. They state that the electric sector is well positioned to comply and that the Clean Air Act provides sufficient time and authority for compliance. The Institute of Clean Air Companies reports that utilities have already installed scrubbers and selective catalytic reduction systems to meet regulations. The electric sector installed 96 GW of SCR in response to the NOx SIP Call between 2008 and 2010. The industry is capable of adding new generating capacity quickly if needed, as seen from the addition of over 200 GW from 2000-2003. An analysis by FBR Capital Markets in December 2010 concluded that even with the retirement of 45 GW by 2014, electricity reserve margins would only decline slightly. FBR analysis shows U.S. electricity reserve margins at 26%, likely to decrease to 24% by 2014 with 45 GW generation retirement. Regional studies indicate reserve margins of 16.8% to 37.8% under a \"draconian\" scenario. Proper planning can prevent resource gaps, but action needs to be taken soon according to analysts like Sue Tierney. Several studies, including NERC's, highlight resource gaps and the need for action to ensure Planning Reserve Margins amid forthcoming EPA regulations. NERC recommends utilizing available tools and reassessing implications of EPA regulations for industry obligations. Senator Lisa Murkowski received a response on August 1, 2011, regarding these concerns. On August 1, 2011, FERC responded to Senator Lisa Murkowski's concerns about coal-fired generating capacity retirements. FERC's preliminary assessment indicated that 40 GW of capacity was 'likely' to retire, with another 41 GW 'very likely' to retire. FERC did not determine if these retirements would impact reliability and emphasized the limitations of its analysis. The analysis did not consider EPA regulations, such as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule finalized in July 2011. The Chairman's letter highlighted the increased flexibility of the rule compared to the earlier version. Reports from EEI and NERC suggested that EPA rules would lead to more expensive coal-fired power, resulting in the retirement of additional coal-burning units. This could lead to a shift towards natural gas generation. The debate is not solely about coal vs. natural gas, as gas-burning power plants will also be affected by the new rules. The new rules may disproportionately impact coal-fired power plants over 40 years old without modern pollution controls. The price of natural gas is a key factor, remaining below $6.00 per MMBtu until 2035. This could lead to the replacement of inefficient coal plants with more efficient natural gas plants. The price of natural gas is projected to remain low until 2035, below $6.00 per MMBtu. This could result in the retirement or conversion of coal-powered units to natural gas due to EPA regulations. Two of EEI's scenarios show that utilities will base their decisions on impending regulations on their assumptions about gas prices. Higher gas prices result in fewer coal plant retirements, with natural gas being a primary alternative. If gas prices remain low or other alternatives are competitive, utilities will likely retire old coal plants and switch to gas or renewables. Utilities will invest in retrofitting coal plants to reduce emissions if they expect high gas prices or other alternatives. The decision to retire coal plants is based on whether the cost of compliance with environmental regulations exceeds the cost of replacement power, typically new natural gas generation capacity. Retrofitting is chosen if costs are lower than replacement power, making the unit economically viable for upgrades. Utilities forecast gas prices based on assumptions about availability to meet electric power generation demands. Natural gas production is increasing from unconventional sources like shale through hydraulic fracturing. Concerns about gas availability have decreased as North American production rises. The Potential Gas Committee raised U.S. natural gas resources by 45% to 1,836 TCF due to unconventional gas growth. The coal-fired electric generating industry is facing challenges due to cheap, abundant natural gas and EPA regulations. Pipeline and storage capacity have increased, with a significant rise in unconventional gas production. Congress is closely monitoring EPA power plant rules and related activities. Proponents and opponents of EPA action are actively engaging in legislative efforts to prevent or delay EPA regulations. Legislation such as H.R. 2401 and S. 609 aim to assess the economic impact of various EPA rules and actions. The House Energy and Commerce Committee approved H.R. 2401, while similar legislation is introduced in the Senate. S. 609, the Comprehensive Assessment of Regulations on the Economy Act of 2011, would direct the Department of Commerce to form a panel to review the cumulative energy and economic impacts of specific rules proposed or finalized by EPA. H.R. 1872, the Employment Protection Act of 2011, would require EPA to consider the impact on employment levels and economic activity before issuing regulations. Companion Senate legislation is S. 1292. House Republican leaders indicated early on in the 112th Congress that they would closely examine EPA's rulemaking decisions by restricting funding for future rules and revoking funding for existing rules. This was evident when the House passed H.R. 1, a spending bill for FY2011, with provisions limiting EPA's regulatory activities. The Senate did not approve this bill, leading to the passage of a different appropriations bill (P.L. 112-10) that did not include these restrictions. The House passed legislation (H.R. 2584) with provisions restricting EPA's regulatory activities, including prohibiting spending on certain rulemaking activities. This bill also includes provisions similar to previous legislation (H.R. 2401) aimed at limiting EPA authority. The House approved legislation (H.R. 910) to restrict EPA authority and repeal EPA regulatory actions on greenhouse gases. In the Senate, a similar amendment (S.Amdt. 183) failed. Controversy arose over EPA's veto of a CWA permit for a coal mining project, leading to bills like H.R. 517 to remove EPA's veto authority. Hearings were held on these issues, and H.R. 2018 was passed by the House. In May, hearings were held on EPA oversight issues, and on July 13, the House passed H.R. 2018. The bill limits EPA's authority over states' implementation of the Clean Water Act, requiring state concurrence for vetoing a Section 404 permit. Other bills proposed in the 112th Congress aim to prohibit coal combustion waste regulation under RCRA. State legislatures have also shown interest in EPA's regulatory activities. State legislatures have shown interest in opposing EPA's regulatory actions by adopting resolutions, conducting enhanced legislative reviews, and asserting state sovereignty. Resolutions critical of EPA have been introduced in several states. Reports by EEI, NERC, and others highlight potential impacts of EPA rules, such as the need for additional power plant capacity or reliability issues, based on different assumptions from what EPA has proposed. The EPA rules may have varying impacts on power plants and electricity supply nationwide or regionally. Evaluating regulatory impacts and compliance costs depends on facility-specific considerations. Technology options and compliance costs may differ from projections, leading to different investment or retirement decisions for utilities and states. The EPA rules may have varying impacts on power plants and electricity supply nationwide or regionally. Many utilities have already installed technology needed to comply with new rules, minimizing costs. Compliance costs may be lower due to investments in pollution control equipment. EPA estimates benefits of individual rules, with challenging quantification due to data limitations. Costs may be large, but benefits, especially public health benefits, are larger. The EPA rules have varying impacts on power plants and electricity supply. Compliance costs may be lower due to prior investments in pollution control equipment. Concerns about impacts of EPA rules have been raised by various industries beyond the electric utility sector. The studies sponsored by industry groups (EEI and NERC) assumed more stringent rules than EPA proposed. The Utility MACT is expected to be the most expensive, with annual costs of $10-11 billion. Other rules may have lower costs than anticipated, such as the Cooling Water Intake rule. The Coal Combustion Waste Rule has been delayed with no deadline. The proposed rules will primarily impact older coal-fired plants over 40 years old without modern pollution controls. Many of these inefficient plants are being replaced by more efficient natural gas plants due to lower prices and increased availability of natural gas. Excess generation capacity, caused by the recession and new natural gas plants, may mitigate reliability concerns. Implementation of EPA rules, including the Utility MACT, is delayed with no set deadline. Many proposed EPA rules may not be finalized or take effect for some time, as they can be altered before becoming final. Delays in proposal and promulgation are common, even with court-ordered deadlines. EPA often requests extensions to analyze comments, and regulatory actions are frequently challenged in court. Many EPA regulatory actions face court challenges, leading to delays in implementation. States can adopt more stringent regulations than EPA, such as mandating costly cooling systems at power plants. EPA rules may be remanded or vacated by courts, requiring states to review and adopt new regulations before they take effect. The road to EPA regulation is often delayed due to court challenges and the possibility of states adopting more stringent regulations. Permits for stationary sources are issued by state authorities after standards take effect, with compliance schedules allowing several years for installation of control equipment. Existing facilities typically have several years to comply with new standards. The EPA regulation process is often delayed by court challenges and state regulations. Compliance timelines for existing facilities are typically several years. Regulatory actions are being developed to reduce environmental impacts of mountaintop removal mining in Appalachia, not directly affecting power plants. In June 2009, EPA and the Army Corps signed an agreement to coordinate and expedite review of CWA permit applications for surface coal mining operations in Appalachia. The agencies are reviewing 79 permit applications to limit environmental impacts, but the process is slow. In June 2010, the Army Corps suspended a CWA general permit for surface coal mining in Appalachia and proposed a rule to prohibit its use entirely. EPA released interim guidance in April 2010 to clarify tightened requirements for coal mining in Appalachia, including strict numeric limits on conductivity levels in affected waters. The EPA released interim guidance in April 2010 to address the impact of coal mining on water quality in Appalachia, focusing on conductivity levels that could harm stream biota. Environmental groups support the guidance, while industry groups criticize it, claiming the science linking conductivity to water quality impairment is uncertain. Lawsuits have been filed challenging the guidance. In January 2011, lawsuits challenging EPA's coal mining guidance were brought by Kentucky, West Virginia, coal companies, and trade associations. A federal judge denied industry's request to block the guidance but also denied the government's request to dismiss the case. EPA is revising the guidance based on public comments and scientific reviews, with a delayed release expected. In November 2009, the Department of the Interior's Office of Surface Mining issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to revise the stream buffer zone rule. The Obama Administration is considering revisions to the 2008 rule exempting valley fills and mining waste disposal from buffer zone requirements around streams in Appalachia. Options range from reinstating the previous rule with minor changes to stricter buffer zone requirements for mountaintop mining. OSM officials aim to release a proposal by early 2011. EPA and OSM plan to enhance oversight of state permitting and enforcement. EPA vetoed a permit for a coal mining operation in West Virginia under CWA authority. The EPA vetoed a surface coal mining operation in West Virginia due to its unacceptable adverse effect on wildlife and fishery resources, causing controversy and criticism from coal industry groups and other sectors. The Administration's actions on surface coal mining have displeased both industry and environmental advocates. The coal industry is angered by stringent requirements and EPA's veto of a project. Environmental groups support the veto but want even tougher requirements. Critics argue that the Administration's actions on surface coal mining in Appalachia are causing delays and harming energy security. These actions could indirectly affect power plants by limiting coal supplies. The impact of EPA regulations on coal-fired power plants has generated numerous analytic reports. Analytic reports by policy and advocacy groups analyze the potential impacts of environmental regulations on the U.S. generation fleet, including the possibility of coal plant retirements. These reports use varying assumptions and approaches, leading to different conclusions. The impact of EPA regulations on coal-fired power plants has been a subject of debate and analysis. Several reports by economic research associations and financial institutions analyze the effects of EPA regulations on power markets and coal plants. These reports highlight the potential risks faced by U.S. coal plants due to environmental regulations.
