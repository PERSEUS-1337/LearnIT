    "content": "Wilson et al. (2017) found that stochastic gradient generalizes better than ADAM. Recent work on hypergradient methods (Baydin et al., 2018) prompts a reevaluation of optimizer performance. Hypergradient methods offer marginal benefits due to hyperparameter tuning challenges. Sensitivity analysis of gradient-based optimizers highlights the importance of robustness in optimization algorithms for deep neural networks. The stepsize is a critical parameter in optimization methods for deep neural networks. Poor choices can result in slow training or divergence. ADAM has become a popular choice due to its normalized stepsize, which helps with convergence across datasets and architectures. However, BID12's analysis shows that adaptive methods can impact both training and generalization. The impact of adaptive methods on training and generalization was analyzed, showing that stochastic gradient methods with a well-tuned stepsize can achieve lower generalization error. Hypergradient descent (HD) was proposed as a method for online learning rate tuning, potentially removing the advantage of easier tuning in adaptive methods. This paper aims to extend the analysis of BID12 and reconsider the value of adaptive gradient methods compared to non-adaptive counterparts. The paper aims to extend the analysis of BID12 by comparing the competitive nature of the recent online hypergradient scheme proposed by BID2 to the offline scheme of BID12. It also questions if the online scheme alters the conclusions of BID12 and if it eliminates the need for fine-tuning optimizer hyperparameters, potentially removing the advantage of ADAM over stochastic gradient with momentum. Additionally, it explores the sensitivity of the learning rate schedule to suboptimal hyperparameter choices, an aspect often overlooked in optimization method studies. In this work, the value of tuning for gradient-based methods is emphasized, along with various techniques for stepsize selection. Adaptive methods compute parameter updates by multiplying the gradient with a matrix, with some methods using a distinctive stepsize per parameter. Newton's method and Amari (1998) leveraged different matrices to precondition the gradient, while BID7 used the covariance of gradients to move less in uncertain directions. In this work, various techniques for stepsize selection in gradient-based methods are discussed. Adaptive methods adjust the learning rate per parameter, with some methods like ADAGRAD proposed by BID4. Other methods such as RMSprop, ADADELTA, and ADAM aim to improve upon ADAGRAD. Different stepsize schedules, offline and online, are distinguished, with offline schedules setting the stepsize ahead of time. BID8 proposed a slow decay schedule, while BID3 suggested halving the stepsize. In contrast to offline schedules, online schedules tune the stepsize based on optimization dynamics. BID2 rediscovered the hypergradient update rule for stepsize optimization, originally suggested by BID0. The stepsize can be iteratively optimized using lr-decay, halving it every 25 epochs. The optimization of stepsize can be framed as an iterative process that increases when the last two gradients are aligned, suggesting acceleration, and decreases otherwise. It requires no extra gradient computation and only needs a copy of the current gradient in memory for the next iteration. The goal is to minimize a parametric function with a gradient descent update rule and a learning rate update rule based on the derivative with respect to alpha. The authors observed that hypergradient descent decreases sensitivity to the initial learning rate. The authors observed that hypergradient descent decreases sensitivity to the initial learning rate. Hypergradient can significantly benefit from fine tuning of hyperparameters, replicating training performance of the best offline learning rate adaptation scheme. Stochastic gradient with hypergradient generalizes better than ADAM, extending previous conclusions. Three gradient methods were considered: SGD, SGD with Nesterov momentum, and ADAM, with both hypergradient and offline fixed decay schemes tested. The study compared the performance of six optimization algorithms on three tasks: MNIST classification, CIFAR-10 with VGG16, and CIFAR-10 with ResNet18. A grid search was conducted to optimize learning rates for each method, with different grids for SGD, SGDN, and ADAM. Hypergradient method involved a search over initial learning rate and hypergradient learning rate, while fixed decay method kept values constant. The study compared six optimization algorithms on MNIST and CIFAR-10 tasks. Hyperparameters were optimized through grid search. Hypergradient method involved initial learning rate search, while fixed decay method kept values constant. Experiments were conducted multiple times with consistent random initialization. CIFAR-10 trained for 250 epochs, MNIST for 200 epochs. Results will be compared between hypergradient and lr-decay methods. The study compared optimization algorithms on MNIST and CIFAR-10 tasks, optimizing hyperparameters through grid search. Hypergradient method improved loss trajectory with better tuning, showing comparable performance to lr-decay. SGD-decay consistently performed best on CIFAR-10, with hypergradient matching lr-decay on VGG net. Hypergradient method shows comparable performance to lr-decay on VGG net, but generalizes worse. SGD-HD and SGDN-HD outperform ADAM-HD for better generalization on VGG network. The recurrent pattern of adaptive gradient methods suggests they may not benefit from learning rate decay schedules, limiting their competitiveness. It is advised to combine stochastic gradient with a well-designed learning rate decay and momentum for optimal performance. Tuning hyperparameters reveals the potential and limitations of different gradient methods with online and offline learning rate schedules. In the next section, the sensitivity of tuning optimizers with different learning rate adaptation methods is analyzed. Performance is compared based on minimal cross-entropy loss, showing that ADAM and stochastic gradient are equally difficult to tune. However, lr-decay allows for better generalization with SGD and AGDN, making ADAM easier to tune. The focus is on CIFAR-10 classification using VGG and ResNet18 architectures to highlight optimizer behavior differences. In this section, the sensitivity of different optimizers with constant stepsize versions is studied. The performance of SGD, SGDN, and ADAM is compared based on their behavior with varying learning rates. Figures 4 and 5 show the training and test errors for VGG net and ResNet18, respectively. SGD and SGDN exhibit faster performance degradation with increasing learning rates for VGG net, while ADAM shows a more symmetric behavior. The aim is to find the highest step size that does not diverge, following the theory on quadratic bowls. The architecture choice influences the tuning of learning rate, with ResNet18 showing a wider valley for optimal values compared to VGG16. The lr-decay scheme improves training and generalization performance of gradient methods. The importance of architecture in learning rate tuning is often overlooked in comparisons. The lr-decay scheme affects the tuning sensitivity of gradient methods like ADAM and SGD on VGG net and ResNet18 architectures. It shifts the optimal learning rate to a higher value, improving performance but also increasing sensitivity in some cases. The lr-decay scheme reduces tuning effort for ADAM by flattening its sensitivity curve, making it less challenging compared to SGD. It shows robustness for smaller learning rate scales and ResNet18, maintaining performance levels over a wider range of learning rates. Hypergradient methods on VGG net also demonstrate decreased sensitivity to stepsize variations. The effect of hypergradient on learning rate sensitivity for VGG net and ResNet18 on CIFAR-10 is shown. Tuning the hypergradient parameter \u03b2 is crucial for reaching higher performance. Hypergradient methods have low sensitivity to the choice of stepsize \u03b1 0. Some \u03b2 settings show high sensitivity to certain ranges of \u03b1 0 values. SGD-HD with \u03b2 = 10 \u22125 improves drastically above a certain stepsize scale and outperforms other configurations. The study found that stochastic gradient with nesterov momentum benefits the most from hypergradient in terms of performance and generalization. Hypergradient methods do not outperform fixed exponential decay, but can still benefit from fine tuning of hyperparameters. SGD and SGDN with tuned hypergradient perform better than ADAM. The study raises questions about deriving an automatic stepsize tuner that works consistently well across datasets and architectures. The study raises questions about deriving an automatic stepsize tuner that works consistently well across datasets and architectures, suggesting that current adaptive methods may not be the best candidates for building such an optimizer. It is recommended to augment stochastic gradient with more promising learning rate schedules for better performance."
