    "content": "This report simplifies the concept of \"tax basis\" for individual taxpayers and small businesses. It does not cover tax basis for corporate assets or stock received in exchange for property. Tax basis is the cost of property that is sold, abandoned, or given away, as outlined in the Internal Revenue Code. Taxpayers must report gain if the amount received for the property exceeds its tax basis, even if the property was only used for personal purposes. Losses cannot be claimed on a tax return if the property was solely for personal use. When property is abandoned, the taxpayer may deduct the basis on the tax return. The donor's basis is crucial when giving property as a gift, affecting the recipient's basis. Property can be acquired through purchase, inheritance, or gift, with the basis depending on the acquisition method. Initial basis for purchased property is the purchase price, including sales tax, with any rebates reducing the basis. The initial basis of inherited property is determined by its value on the date of death, unless the estate chooses an alternative valuation date. Generally, the recipient's basis in inherited property is the fair market value on the date of death, with some exceptions for special cases like family farm property or minority shares of stock. The \"step-up\" in basis was eliminated for one year in 2010. The basis of inherited property is determined by its value on the date of death, with exceptions for special cases. Laws introduced in the 110th Congress may affect the \"step-up\" in basis. Determining the basis of gifts can be complex, with factors like gift tax affecting the recipient's basis. The recipient's basis of gifts may be the same as the donor's adjusted basis. When determining the basis of a gift, the recipient's basis may be the same as the donor's adjusted basis. If the fair market value of the gift is lower than the donor's adjusted basis, the donor's adjusted basis is used to calculate gain when the property is sold. If the sales price is lower than the donor's adjusted basis, the FMV at the time of the gift becomes the recipient's initial basis for calculating loss. In some cases, there may be no gain or loss. When a gift's FMV is less than the donor's basis, the recipient's basis is the donor's adjusted basis. For example, if a desk worth $300 is given with a $400 basis, the recipient's basis for loss is $300. If the desk is sold for $425, the basis for gain is $400. When a son sells a desk for $425, his basis for determining gain would be $400, which is his mom's basis in the desk. The basis of property can be increased or decreased after acquisition, with common decreases occurring when the property is used for work or business and deductions are taken. Increases in basis happen when the owner makes improvements to the property. Tax deductions are available for business-use property, which must be reduced by allowed deductions. Property expected to last more than a year must be depreciated over its useful life. Property expected to last more than a year must be depreciated over its useful life, with a portion of its cost deducted each year on the taxpayer's return. This includes equipment, automobiles, and buildings. The original basis of business-use property is reduced annually by allowable depreciation, even if not claimed on the tax return. If more depreciation was claimed than allowable, the larger amount is used to reduce the basis. When calculating gain on the sale of property, the basis must be reduced even if depreciation was not claimed on tax returns. This applies to residential property rented out or damaged property with insurance settlements. Personal-use property basis may also be reduced if the buyer benefited from the purchase. The buyer can reduce tax liability by deducting points paid by the seller on Form 1040 Schedule A for the purchase of a principal residence. Tax credits for distressed property purchases require basis reduction. The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act allows exclusion of debt cancellation income, but basis in the residence must be reduced by the excluded amount. The Housing Assistance Tax Act of 2008 provides a refundable tax credit to first-time homebuyers who purchase a principal residence. The credit is repaid over 15 years, and if the property is sold before fully repaid, the remaining amount must be repaid in the year of the sale, unless the gain is less than the outstanding credit. Adjusted basis of the property is reduced by the outstanding credit for repayment purposes only. The basis in personal-use property can be reduced in certain situations, such as when an easement is granted or when a severance award is received for an involuntary conversion or condemnation. This reduction in basis is not used to determine the gain for tax purposes. When receiving a severance award for an involuntary conversion or condemnation, the basis on the remaining property is reduced. However, the basis can be increased by spending money on improvements, not repairs. Improvements include adding a room, replacing a roof, or restoring damaged property. In the case of a casualty loss, basis is reduced by the insurance settlement, but restoring the property increases the basis by the amount spent on restoration. For example, if a car's adjusted basis was $11,000 before hail damage, receiving a $1,000 insurance check reduces the basis to $10,000. Spending $1,200 on restoration then increases the basis to $11,200. The basis of damaged property is reduced by insurance settlements, but restoring it increases the basis by the amount spent on restoration. Free labor does not increase basis, only out-of-pocket expenses do. Basis determines gains or losses when property is sold. The basis of property is crucial for determining depreciation and gains or losses upon sale. Improvements to the property are depreciated separately, but increase the adjusted basis. The gain or loss upon sale is calculated by subtracting the adjusted basis from the sales price. Taxable gain is the difference between the two, which can be reduced by selling expenses. The gain on the sale of property can be reduced by expenses incurred. This applies to both business-use and personal-use property. For example, a man sold a rare toy for $150, with an adjusted basis of $2, resulting in a gain of $128 after deducting expenses. Losses on business or investment property can reduce taxable income, while losses on personal property cannot be deducted. Sales expenses can increase the amount of loss. The adjusted basis for a landscaper's mower was $775, sold for $500, resulting in a $325 loss. A couple sold a gravy boat for $100, incurring fees of $10 for the auction site and $15 for shipping. The couple incurred a $75 loss on the sale of a gravy boat, with fees for the auction site and shipping. The $100 received is not included in gross income for tax purposes. Gifts may result in no gain or loss when sold if the sale price is between the FMV at the time of the gift and the donor's basis. Son will have no gain or loss if he sells the desk for $325, as the donor's basis is used to calculate gain and the FMV at the time of the gift is used to calculate loss."
