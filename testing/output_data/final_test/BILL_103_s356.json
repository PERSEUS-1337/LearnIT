    "content": "The \"Possessions Wage Credit Act of 1993\" is cited as the Act. It replaces the possession tax credit with a wage-based employment credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This new section is called the \"Possessions Employment Credit.\" The Possessions Employment Credit provides eligible employers with a credit of 40% of qualified possession wages, which are wages paid to qualified possession employees up to $20,000. A qualified possession employee is defined as an employee of an eligible employer who performs services while in a designated possession. The term 'qualified possession employee' excludes certain individuals, such as those described in section 51(i)(1), 5-percent owners, and individuals not meeting specific criteria. The term 'eligible employer' refers to a domestic corporation that elects the application of specific conditions, including a 3-year period and meeting certain gross income criteria. The term 'possession of the United States' includes Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands for tax purposes if a domestic corporation derives 75% or more of its gross income from active business conducted within these territories. The term 'States' includes Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. 'Wages' have the same meaning as in section 51. Foreign taxes paid by an eligible employer are not treated as income. Controlled groups are also addressed. Controlled groups of employers treated as a single entity for tax credit purposes. Each employer's share of the credit is based on their proportionate wages. No double benefits allowed for the same wages. Other applicable rules are also mentioned. Transition rules apply for taxpayers who received a credit under section 936 before February 16, 1993. The credit for the transition period will not be less than the old section 936 amount or the adjusted wage credit. The applicable percentage for determining the credit under section 936 is based on the lesser of the credit amount under section 936 or 115 percent of the average credit amount for the 3-taxable-year period before February 16, 1993. The adjusted wage credit for any taxable year is determined by substituting the applicable percentage for 40 percent. The applicable percentage is based on specific percentages for each year in the transition period: 100% for the 1st and 2nd year, 75% for the 3rd year, 50% for the 4th year, and 25% for the 5th year. The applicable percentage for determining the adjusted wage credit is based on specific percentages for each year in the transition period. \"In the transition period, the applicable percentages for the adjusted wage credit are as follows: 1st year - 100%, 2nd year - 100%, 3rd year - 85%, 4th year - 70%, 5th year - 55%. If an additional credit is allowed to a taxpayer, an election under section 936 is considered in effect for that taxpayer.\" The transition period defines a 5-year period starting from February 16, 1993. Section 936 credit termination states that no credit will be allowed after February 16, 1993, except under certain circumstances. The transition period starting from February 16, 1993, prohibits the allowance of Section 936 credit after that date, except under specific circumstances. Additionally, the possessions employment credit under section 45A(a) is allowed as a business credit. No carryback of possessions employment credit under section 45A to taxable years before February 16, 1993. Conforming amendments to various sections of the Code to include reference to section 45A. \"Subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code is amended by adding a new item at the end.\" The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years ending on or after February 16, 1993. The amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 include an 18-month extension for health insurance costs of self-employed individuals, an increase in the deduction amount, and a repeal of a conforming amendment. The effective dates for these changes vary, with some applying to taxable years ending after June 30, 1992, and others applying to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1992."
