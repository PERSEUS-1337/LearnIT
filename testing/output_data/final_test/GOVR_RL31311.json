    "content": "Congress approved H.J.Res. 2, a continuing appropriations measure including Foreign Operations and other FY2003 appropriations bills. The omnibus spending measure was signed into law as P.L. 108-7 on February 20. Foreign Operations is funded at $16.3 billion for FY2003, slightly less than requested. The bill also includes an across-the-board rescission of 0.65% of discretionary budget authority, reducing total funding to approximately $16.18 billion. Notably, Child Survival programs received a $242 million increase to $1.8 billion. The enacted Foreign Operations appropriation under P.L. 108-7 includes increased funding for Child Survival programs to $1.8 billion, $242 million higher than the request. It also allocates $880 million for international HIV/AIDS programs, $140 million more than proposed. Additionally, $446.5 million is provided for bilateral family planning activities, with $34 million allocated to UNFPA subject to conditions regarding coercive family planning programs. The enacted Foreign Operations appropriation provides $700 million for the Andean Regional counternarcotics initiative, with $295 million allocated for Afghanistan. Full funding is included for regular aid to Israel ($2.7 billion), but additional funding for Israeli anti-terrorism aid was not included. Funding for North Korean heavy fuel oil was cut, but $5 million was retained for administrative costs of KEDO. The annual Foreign Operations appropriations bill is crucial for U.S. foreign assistance budget and policy making. It funds bilateral development programs managed by USAID and other foreign aid agencies. This legislation accounts for two-thirds of total international affairs spending by the United States. The Foreign Operations appropriations bill funds humanitarian aid activities, security assistance for Israel and Egypt, contributions to international organizations, and regional development banks. It also includes aid programs in the former Soviet Union and Central/Eastern Europe. The Foreign Operations bill, managed by the State Department, funds various organizations and export promotion agencies. It serves as a key legislative tool for congressional oversight of foreign affairs and policy-making. Congress has not passed a comprehensive foreign aid authorization bill since 1985, leading to appropriations committees expanding their role in shaping foreign aid and policy initiatives. The Foreign Operations bill, managed by the State Department, guides executive and congressional foreign aid and policy initiatives. It has been a key tool for Congress to apply restrictions on foreign assistance management, leading to clashes over presidential prerogatives in foreign policy making. President Bush submitted his FY2003 budget request to Congress, including funding proposals for Foreign Operations programs. On March 21, the White House requested emergency funds for homeland security and combating terrorism overseas, including assistance to \"front-line\" states. House and Senate Appropriations Committees approved the supplemental (P.L. 107-206) on July 24, 2002. The Senate reported a bill for FY2003 on July 24 (S. 2779), and the House approved its bill on September 19 (H.R. 5410). The Senate passed H.J.Res. 2 on January 23, 2003, containing 11 FY2003 appropriation bills. Congress approved the Omnibus Appropriation on February 13. The Omnibus Appropriation was signed by the President on February 20 (P.L.108-7). Foreign Operations funding levels have fluctuated over the past 25 years, peaking in FY1985 at over $33 billion in constant FY2003 dollars. There was a period of decline to $13.8 billion in FY1997, with brief increases in the early 1990s due to special supplementals for various countries. In FY2003, foreign aid funding reached $16.54 billion, the highest in nominal terms since FY1985. Despite recent increases, funding levels between FY2000 and FY2003 are relatively low historically. In FY2003, foreign aid funding reached $16.54 billion, the highest since FY1985. Funding levels between FY2000 and FY2003 are historically low. Foreign Operations represents 0.76% of the $2.15 trillion U.S. budget for FY2003. Under the Section 302(a) allocation process, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees decide how to distribute funds among their subcommittees within budget guidelines. Foreign Operations funds are part of the International Affairs budget function, with decisions on allocation left to the Appropriations Committees. Overall budget ceilings can impact the allocation of funds. Ceilings set in the budget resolution can impact the budget limitations for the House and Senate Foreign Operations subcommittees. The House approved a budget resolution recommending $759 billion in total discretionary budget authority, including $10 billion for defense. The Senate Budget Committee reported a budget resolution increasing total discretionary budget authority to $768 billion, with $25.8 billion for International Affairs. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees had sufficient funds for foreign policy in the budget resolution. Congress did not reach a consensus on a budget framework for FY2003. There were discussions about including a \"deeming resolution\" in the FY2002 supplemental appropriation to establish a budget ceiling. Members were divided over which budget resolution level to use during the 107th Congress. The House and Senate Appropriation Committees issued different allocations for spending bills in 2002. The House approved $759 billion while the Senate distributed $768 billion, with Foreign Operations receiving $16.35 billion from each Committee. President Bush later proposed an additional $350 million for Foreign Operations. The House Foreign Operations Subcommittee approved a $16.55 billion measure, exceeding its previous allocation by $200 million. At the full Committee markup of the Foreign Operations bill, the allocation was increased to $16.55 billion, with a corresponding reduction in defense funding. Congress later restored the defense money before enacting the FY2003 Defense Appropriations bill. The Senate Appropriations Committee issued new 302(b) figures, providing Foreign Operations with $16.25 billion, slightly less than the President's revised request. The Senate approved a floor amendment adding $180 million in additional international HIV/AIDS spending, exceeding the 302(b) allocation. Foreign Operations received $16.3 billion in the enacted Omnibus appropriation bill. President Bush initially requested $16.1 billion for FY2003, which was later raised to $16.45 billion. The amended budget proposal was 7% higher than FY2002 appropriations. The FY2003 proposal was $95 million less than FY2002 total appropriations when including the supplemental appropriation for foreign assistance. The FY2003 budget proposal included $4 billion to assist \"front-line\" states in the war on terrorism, with uneven increases for different countries compared to FY2002 allocations. Some countries like Jordan, India, Oman, and Yemen received considerably more assistance, while others like the Philippines, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Indonesia saw proposed additional assistance. The FY2003 budget proposal included $4 billion to assist \"front-line\" states in the war on terrorism. Some countries received more assistance compared to FY2002, while others saw modest proposed additional assistance. The absence of a comprehensive plan for Afghanistan and less assistance for key nations led to criticism from Members of Congress. The $1.28 billion FY2002 supplemental Foreign Operations proposal addressed concerns about the adequacy of the FY2003 plan. It included additional aid to 27 nations and sought $250 million more for Afghanistan. However, President Bush's decision not to spend designated \"contingent emergency\" funds meant about $600 million would not be available. The FY2003 Foreign Operations proposal aimed to increase aid activities in various areas, with a $350 million rise in development assistance. Funding for HIV/AIDS, agriculture, environment, and trade programs would grow, while some health activities would see reduced resources. The Andean Regional Initiative would increase by $106 million to combat illegal drug production. Peace Corps funding would also rise by $42 million to open new country programs. The FY2003 Foreign Operations proposal included a $42 million increase in Peace Corps funding to open new country programs and place 8,000 volunteers by the end of the fiscal year. Contributions to the World Bank and other international financial institutions would have grown by $262 million to cover scheduled U.S. payments and arrears. In FY2002, $1.1 billion was provided in emergency supplemental appropriations, with House amounts from H.R. 5410 serving as a reference. Funding reductions were sought in Export-Import Bank funds by $182 million. The Administration proposed significant funding reductions in various areas, including a $182 million drop in Export-Import Bank funds and a $126 million decrease in East European assistance. Debt reduction would receive no funding in FY2003, while aid allocations have shifted post-9/11 attacks. Israel and Egypt remain top aid recipients, but changes have been made in foreign aid distribution. The Administration has changed aid allocations significantly post-9/11 attacks, using economic and military assistance to maintain an international coalition in the war on terrorism. Pakistan, a key coalition partner, received over $1.5 billion in aid since sanctions were lifted in 2001. Other top aid recipients include India, the Philippines, Turkey, Jordan, and Indonesia as part of the \"front-line\" states in the war on terrorism. The FY2003 Iraq War Supplemental Appropriation has also impacted aid distribution. The FY2003 Iraq War Supplemental Appropriation has significantly increased aid to countries supporting the conflict, providing $2.5 billion for relief and reconstruction in Iraq. The Andean region and countries in the Balkans and former Soviet Union also receive substantial aid for counternarcotics initiatives and development programs. Leading recipients of U.S. foreign aid include Pakistan, India, the Philippines, Turkey, Jordan, and Indonesia. The U.S. Department of State provided a table listing countries in order of their combined FY2003 regular appropriation and the FY2003 Iraq War Supplemental Appropriation. Funds were allocated from various sources for different purposes, including Iraqi opposition support and the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund. Additionally, $295 million was earmarked for Afghanistan for economic and humanitarian assistance. Senate Action. The Senate passed a continuing resolution in the 108th Congress, incorporating text of 11 appropriation bills, including Foreign Operations for FY2003. The Senate approved $16.43 billion for Foreign Operations, slightly below the President's request. The Senate passed a continuing resolution for FY2003, including Foreign Operations, with a total of $16.43 billion, slightly below the President's request. The resolution also included a 2.85% rescission, reducing Foreign Operations by $468 million to $15.96 billion. H.J.Res. 2 made key changes to the Administration's proposal, increasing funding for Child Survival and Health programs, HIV/AIDS, and other health programs. During Senate floor debate, additional funding was allocated for HIV/AIDS resources, including $100 million for the Global Fund. Population assistance also saw an increase to $435 million. However, a provision prohibiting the President from denying family planning grants to NGOs engaged in abortion-related advocacy was dropped. UNFPA contributions were reduced to $35 million, conditioned on the President's determination that UNFPA no longer supports abortion activities. The President declared UNFPA ineligible for U.S. support due to programs in China. S. 2779 aimed to make it harder for the President to declare UNFPA ineligible. Andean Regional Initiative funding was reduced to $650 million, with conditions on aid to Colombia. Afghanistan reconstruction aid was set at $220 million in H.J.Res. 2. Administration mentioned $98 million in humanitarian aid for Afghanistan. The Senate measure in H.J.Res. 2 set Peace Corps funding at $285 million, $32 million below the request. North Korea aid was prohibited due to the country's resumed nuclear program. The legislation allowed up to $3.5 million for administrative expenses of the Korean Energy Development Organization. Additionally, $10 million was recommended to assist North Korean refugees and asylum seekers, along with $250,000 for human rights programs. The Senate measure in H.J.Res. 2 included provisions for North Korea aid, Palestinian Statehood, and increased disaster assistance funding. It also mentioned the President's budget amendment for Israeli anti-terrorism aid and Palestinian humanitarian relief. The House Appropriations Committee approved a $16.55 billion Foreign Operations spending measure (H.R. 5410) after receiving a $350 million budget amendment. Congress adjourned without completing action on the bill, and H.R. 5410 expired. The Senate passed a new version of the Foreign Operations spending measure in H.J.Res. 2, but the House did not take up new legislation in the 108th Congress. House and Senate appropriators negotiated a common text of H.J.Res. 2, using H.R. 5410 as the basis for conference negotiations. H.R. 5410, a Foreign Operations spending measure, provided $80 million more than the President's request and $120 million more than the Senate measure. The Committee accommodated additional funding for anti-terrorism aid to Israel, humanitarian aid to Palestinians, and international HIV/AIDS spending. Key elements included increased funding for Child Survival and Health programs, HIV/AIDS, and population assistance. The House Committee measure allocated funds for various health programs, including $425 million for population assistance and $25 million for UNFPA contributions. Despite UNFPA being declared ineligible for U.S. support in FY2002 due to programs in China, the bill conditioned assistance on UNFPA not supporting China's State Planned-Birth Commission. Additionally, the bill allocated $731 million for the Andean Regional Initiative, $296 million for Afghanistan reconstruction aid, and $317 million for Peace Corps funding. The Foreign Operations portion of the spending measure for FY2003 allocated $16.3 billion, $150 million less than requested. A provision regarding Palestinian Statehood conditions was included, barring U.S. assistance unless certain reforms were met. The President signed the spending measure on February 20 (P.L. 108-7). The Senate and House approved a $16.3 billion Foreign Operations budget for FY2003, with a 0.65% rescission to reduce costs. Congress increased funding for international health programs, including $1.84 billion for child survival and health programs and $880 million for HIV/AIDS programs, 19% higher than requested. The Foreign Operations budget for FY2003 includes increased funding for international health programs, with $100 million requested for the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS, $80 million for Tuberculosis activities, $72.5 million for Malaria programs, and $446.5 million for Reproductive health/family planning activities. The conference agreement provides $34 million for UNFPA with conditions attached. The management of a coercive family planning program has been removed. Additional funds were allocated to various accounts and programs in the spending bill, including $295 million for Afghanistan economic aid, $813 million for refugee accounts, $7 million for peacekeeping operations, $250 million for basic education programs, and $175 million for environment projects. In the conference agreement, projects receive special attention with $175 million for energy conservation and efficient energy production, and $145 million for biodiversity. Funding for the Andean Regional counternarcotics initiative is reduced to $700 million, with a $31 million transfer from regular counternarcotics programs. The USAID Capital Investment Fund receives $43 million, including $30 million for a new USAID building in Kenya. The conference agreement includes funding for various projects, such as $30 million for a new USAID building in Kenya. However, there is insufficient funding for construction projects in Guinea, Cambodia, and Georgia. Israel's aid is set at $2.7 billion, with a reduction of $18 million, but an additional $200 million antiterrorism request was not included. The Peace Corps receives $297 million, below the President's request, which will delay the plan to double volunteers by FY2007. Multilateral Development Bank contributions are about $140 million less than requested. The Administration could choose to fully fund current commitments but not pay portions of U.S. arrears, as had been planned. Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO) payment is limited to no more than $5 million for administrative expenses. The United States had planned to make a $75 million contribution, mostly in heavy fuel oil for energy production in North Korea, but President Bush suspended oil transfers in late 2002 after Pyongyang announced its nuclear weapons program. The Administration sought $1.28 billion in additional FY2002 Foreign Operations funding to increase economic, military, and counter-terrorism assistance to \"front-line\" states in the war on terrorism. The United States has placed a growing priority on increasing assistance to 26 nations globally committed to the cause. The Administration received $1.8 billion in foreign aid funding, with about $1.5 billion drawn from the $40 billion emergency terrorism supplemental approved by Congress. President Bush decided not to spend any of the $5.1 billion supplemental designated as \"contingent emergency,\" making one-third of the foreign aid supplemental unavailable. After the White House objected to exceeding the President's $27.1 billion supplemental request, lawmakers agreed to provide $5.1 billion as contingent emergency funding. The President had to designate this as emergency for the money to be available. The enacted supplemental included a provision where the President had to declare the entire $5.1 billion as emergency funds or none of it. President Bush decided not to use the $5.1 billion contingent emergency funds, effectively vetoing them. This decision affected major foreign aid funds, including Israel aid, Palestinian aid, Afghanistan aid, Philippine military aid, and international HIV/AIDS funding. The White House stated that the President still supported aid to these countries and causes and would seek other ways to gain congressional approval. Subsequently, a $996 million budget amendment was submitted, including $350 million for foreign aid. The $996 million budget amendment for FY2003 included $350 million for Foreign Operations, with $200 million for Israel, $50 million for the Palestinians, and $100 million for the International Mother and Child HIV Prevention program. Additional $100 million for HIV/AIDS was requested for the Centers for Disease Control fund. The President's amendment did not include contingent emergency funds for Afghanistan and the Philippines, leading to reduced aid for these countries and others. The State Department allocated Afghanistan $258 million, $75 million less than requested. Aid to Pakistan, African nations, Middle East, Yemen, Nepal, and Colombia was reduced. The Philippines received $37 million, $3 million less than requested. The FY2003 budget amendment proposed no offsets, expecting Congress to absorb the additional funds. The White House expected Congress to absorb additional funds within the original $759 billion appropriation request for all 13 spending bills. The House Committee raised the Foreign Operations bill by $200 million, offset by reductions in defense appropriations and other programs. Enacted amounts include regular FY2002 Foreign Operations Appropriation and funds from the $40 billion emergency terrorism supplemental appropriation. Afghan aid figures for FY2001 and FY2002 are estimates primarily through humanitarian aid accounts. The FY2002 enacted level includes funds for humanitarian aid accounts, such as food, refugee relief, and disaster aid. Congress appropriated funds for Israel, the Palestinians, HIV/AIDS, military aid to the Philippines, refugee relief for Afghanistan, and disaster assistance. These funds were designated as \"contingent emergency\" but were not spent by the Administration. Economic aid for African states was not allocated on a country-by-country basis. The economic aid for African states was not allocated on a country-by-country basis but as a regional program. The $35 million aid request for Africa was reduced to $20 million in the final allocation. Additional amounts for Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Kenya were allocated for military assistance. The President decided not to spend any of the $5.1 billion contingent emergency funds provided. The proposed supplemental set new directions in the distribution of assistance to meet the terrorist threat, focusing on economic support to Afghanistan and neighboring countries. The proposed $1.28 billion supplemental aid package aimed to distribute economic and military assistance among 23 countries worldwide, including Pakistan and Jordan. It included changes in military aid distribution policies and provided support to Central Asian states and other nations outside the region. This supplemental request reflected what many believed should have been included in the FY2003 budget plan. The FY2002 supplemental aid package proposed changes in military aid distribution policies, granting DOD authority to use funds for combating terrorism. The $130 million total would come from defense funds and be directed by the Secretary of Defense. The FY2002 supplemental aid package proposed $420 million in DOD Operation and Maintenance funding for payments to Pakistan, Jordan, and other cooperating states for military support in the war on terrorism. Critics raised concerns about potential infringement on congressional oversight and the State Department's role. The FY2002 supplemental aid package proposed $420 million in DOD Operation and Maintenance funding for military support in the war on terrorism. The request would remove human rights conditions for U.S. security assistance, which raised concerns about infringing on congressional oversight and the State Department's role. Secretary Armitage acknowledged the need to adjust the provisions to protect the Secretary of State's prerogatives in foreign policy and aid oversight. The supplemental aid package included provisions to broaden DOD and State Department authorities to use unspent funds from Plan Colombia for various security threats in Colombia, including counter narcotics operations and military actions against insurgents. This change would allow for expanded intelligence sharing and the use of military equipment provided in previous years for fighting drug production. The Administration did not request Congress to soften other aid restrictions in Colombia. The Administration did not ask Congress to soften aid restrictions in Colombia, including limits on U.S. personnel and aid to units involved in human rights violations. Critics argued that the U.S. focus in Colombia was shifting towards counter-terrorism and insurgency, with a pending military aid request for protecting infrastructure. The Administration requested Congress to provide economic and military aid funds without restrictions, which is usually reserved for situations where aid would be prohibited due to existing legislative restrictions. Congress has been hesitant to enact such waivers without fully understanding the implications. The Administration requested Congress to waive specific legislative constraints for economic and military aid funds in the supplemental. This waiver was needed for countries like Afghanistan, Yemen, Ethiopia, and Cote d'Ivoire due to debt payment violations and military coup issues. The enacted measure increased foreign aid funding but limited policy provisions and waivers sought by the White House. Additionally, funding to fight global HIV/AIDS was added to the supplemental debate. The supplemental debate included additional funding to fight global HIV/AIDS, with $1.818 billion in new Foreign Operations funds passed by Congress. The House and Senate measures differed slightly in funding amounts, with new items added for assistance to Israel, the Palestinians, and combatting HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. Conferees recommended using $100 million for an additional contribution to the Global Fund to Combat HIV/AIDS. The conference agreement included increased aid to Afghanistan for reconstruction and security support, with the Senate adding funds for an international exchange program for students from countries with large Muslim populations. Specific country allocations were left to the discretion of the President, with additional funds added by Congress over the President's request. The President disagreed with the emergency designation for additional foreign aid funds added by Congress, leading to only $1.2 billion out of $1.8 billion being spent. He later amended his request to include funds for Israel, the Palestinians, and international HIV/AIDS programs. The State Department made reductions to allocations for Afghanistan, the Philippines, Pakistan, Nepal, Colombia, Yemen, several African nations, and a Middle East economic initiative. The final bill on foreign aid included provisions for Colombia to use American foreign aid for anti-narcotics efforts and humanitarian rescue operations. Restrictions on Colombian aid remained in place, and additional requirements were added regarding human rights, military reforms, and financial commitments. Congress denied the Department of Defense's request for authority to use $30 million. Congress denied DOD's request for $30 million to support indigenous forces combating terrorism but approved $390 million for payments to Pakistan, Jordan, and other cooperating states for military support. H.R. 4775 approved $100 million for foreign government efforts to fight global terrorism with limitations on transfers for goods and services. The final bill did not include a provision related to this issue. During House Committee markup, another contentious foreign aid policy issue was introduced. Between mid-January and mid-July 2002, the White House withheld U.S. contributions to the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) due to allegations of involvement in coercive family planning practices in China. Congress allocated $34 million for UNFPA in FY2002, with some Members criticizing the delay in determining UNFPA's eligibility. A State Department team investigated in China, leading to a debate in Congress over transferring the funds to UNFPA. The Tiahrt amendment required the President to determine UNFPA's involvement in coercive family planning practices by July 31, 2002. The House-passed measure did not include any language regarding UNFPA, while the Senate bill included language similar to the Lowey/Kolbe text. A determination of UNFPA's involvement in coercive practices would have led to the termination of U.S. support. The President could have reduced the U.S. contribution to less than $34 million under the Tiahrt provision. The President could have reduced the U.S. contribution to less than $34 million to express displeasure over alleged coercive family practices in China and UNFPA's involvement. The White House strongly opposed the Senate language, leading to the decision to drop all UNFPA language from the final bill. Subsequently, on July 23, the White House announced the U.S. would withhold the $34 million transfer. The annual debate on the Foreign Operations appropriations bill usually focuses on major policy and spending issues, including combating global terrorism post-9/11. Foreign aid, totaling over $6 billion in FY2002, aimed at reducing poverty, promoting jobs, and stabilizing conflict-prone nations indirectly combats factors used by terrorists in recruiting individuals. Aid can be used to bolster government efforts in countries like Pakistan and Afghanistan, promoting better healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. Security assistance can also be provided to finance counterterrorism efforts. Some caution is advised in providing security assistance to nations facing terrorist threats, as there are concerns about human rights records, accountability, and corruption within these governments. Critics suggest that aid proposals should not waive existing restrictions on transfers, but instead address specific obstacles and seek congressional waivers for those issues. The Administration sought a congressional waiver to provide Pakistan with $600 million in economic aid, bypassing restrictions on aid to countries involved in missile proliferation, military coups, and debt payments to the US. The Foreign Operations appropriation bill funds global programs for anti-terrorism efforts and security for USAID employees abroad, including the Anti-Terrorism Assistance program since FY1984. The Anti-Terrorism Assistance (ATA) program aims to enhance the anti-terrorism capabilities of foreign law enforcement and security officials through training, equipment transfers, and advice. Between 1984 and 1999, over 23,000 officials from 112 countries participated in ATA programs. Funding for the program is included in the Foreign Operations account of Non-proliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining, and Related Programs (NADR). Following September 11, funding for the $38 million annual ATA program increased significantly, with an additional $45.5 million allocated from the Terrorism Emergency Response Fund. The President requested $64.2 million for FY2003 to finance post-September 11 changes in the ATA program. The Terrorist Interdiction Program (TIP) was launched by the State Department in response to the 1998 bombings of American embassies in East Africa. It aims to restrict terrorists' ability to cross borders, launch attacks, and escape by strengthening border security systems in vulnerable countries. TIP funds are part of the NADR account in the Foreign Operations spending bill. The State Department's Terrorist Interdiction Program (TIP) receives funds from the NADR account in the Foreign Operations spending bill. After September 11, the program expanded to 57 countries to aid in the global counterterrorism campaign. The budget for TIP doubled to $14 million in FY2002 and was $5 million for FY2003. Additionally, a training and technical assistance program was launched in 19 countries with $3 million allocated from the Emergency Response Fund. The Treasury Department manages anti-terrorist financing training. USAID maintains overseas facilities for its workforce, with concerns about security since the 1998 embassy bombings. State Department's Foreign Buildings Operations office funds secure facilities for USAID in co-located missions. Construction delays have been an issue, especially in Uganda, due to competing priorities and conflicting directives. USAID requested a new Capital Investment Fund in FY2003 to address security enhancements at co-located sites. The fund would support information technology and facility construction in Kenya, Guinea, Cambodia, and Georgia. USAID may need to divert resources to Uganda if a lease arrangement cannot be worked out. Security upgrades for overseas missions have been funded through USAID operating expenses, which have been under stress due to agency relocation costs and financial management system replacements. Security upgrades for some USAID missions have been deferred due to funding shortfalls, with USAID requesting $7 million for security needs in FY2003. Aid restrictions for terrorist states are included in foreign operations spending bills, prohibiting U.S. assistance to countries engaged in terrorist activities. Sec. 527 and Sec. 544 imposed restrictions on U.S. aid to countries supporting terrorism or providing lethal military equipment to terrorist governments. However, certain humanitarian assistance programs could still be provided despite these restrictions. The FY2003 Foreign Operations bill, including assistance for demining operations, was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bush to support the war on terrorism. The FY2003 Foreign Operations bill, including assistance for demining operations, was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bush to support the war on terrorism. The Administration allocated roughly $4.1 billion in aid for \"front-line\" states, with India receiving a reduced aid package from $244 million to $186 million. The approved funding bill reduces the military aid program from $50 million to $186 million. It also allocates $306 million for Non-Proliferation, Anti-Terrorism, Demining, and Related Programs, with $5 million more than requested after adjusting for North Korea funding prohibition. Various terrorism-related activities are funded within this account, including ATA, TIP, and non-proliferation programs. The Department of Treasury's terrorist financing program is fully funded. The Capital Investment Fund sees the largest reduction in resources for terrorism-related activities. The FY2003 enacted spending bill provides $43 million for terrorism-related activities in the Capital Investment Fund, below the President's request. USAID plans for FY2003 may be affected by funding shortfalls, with priorities including security upgrades, construction of new missions, and information technology upgrades in various countries. Disagreements between the executive branch and Congress persist over the allocation of the core budget for USAID development assistance programs. Among the top congressional development aid funding priorities in recent years have been programs supporting child survival, basic education, and efforts to combat HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. The Administration also supported these programs, but objected to congressional efforts to increase funding for children and health activities at the expense of other development sectors. When Congress increased appropriations for its priorities without a corresponding boost in the overall development aid budget, resources for other priorities like economic growth and the environment were substantially reduced. In 2001, the Bush Administration set out revised USAID core goals for sustainable development programs focused on Global Health, Economic Growth and Agriculture, and Conflict Prevention and Developmental Relief. The Administration also introduced a new initiative - the Global Development. The Administration introduced the Global Development Alliance (GDA) to expand public/private partnerships in development. USAID would provide financing to leverage resources from private foundations, NGOs, universities, and for-profit organizations. USAID sought $160 million for GDA projects in FY2002 but only $20 million was allocated. A budget of $30 million was proposed for FY2003, with a total request of $2.96 billion for development aid. In FY2003, USAID proposed a budget increase of about $350 million, with specific emphasis on increasing funding for agriculture programs by 30%, environmental activities by 11%, business, trade, and investment by 25%, basic education by 10%, and HIV/AIDS by nearly one-half to $740 million. In FY2003, USAID proposed a budget increase with emphasis on various sectors including agriculture, environmental activities, business, trade, investment, basic education, and HIV/AIDS funding rising by nearly one-half to $740 million. Democracy aid would also increase by 68% to $200 million. The Administration proposed an integrative approach for development strategy, while Congressional proponents argued for a separate Child Survival/Health account. USAID requested $1.59 billion for child survival and health programs in FY2003, facing close congressional scrutiny. Total funding for these projects increased by $155 million compared to FY2002. In FY2003, the total funding for child survival and health projects was $1.77 billion, with an increase of $115 million (7%). Despite a significant rise in HIV/AIDS program funding (+45%), resources for other global health activities would have decreased. USAID justified this by stating that limited resources required a focus on fighting the HIV/AIDS epidemic, leading to reductions in funding for Child Survival and Maternal Health, Vulnerable Children, malaria, and tuberculosis programs. Critics of the Administration's decision to increase HIV/AIDS funding and de-emphasize other health programs aim to fully fund or exceed the HIV/AIDS proposal while restoring funds for areas facing reductions in FY2003. The funding for USAID Global Health Programs is estimated across all Foreign Operations accounts. House, Senate, and enacted levels for Child Survival and Maternal Health, Vulnerable Children, and Other Infectious Diseases are based on directives and estimates, with final allocations likely to be slightly higher. The House, Senate, and conference bills did not specify a level for Child Survival and Maternal Health or Vulnerable Children across all accounts. However, they allocated amounts from the Child Survival and Health account. The House/Senate conferees set HIV/AIDS funding at $800 million, with a portion from the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS activities. The United States contributed $350 million to the Global ATM Fund in FY2003, with $250 million allocated for HIV/AIDS activities. Additionally, $100 million was provided for the International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative. The FY2003 Labor/HHS/Education appropriation included funding for the Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative. The Global ATM Fund contribution for tuberculosis and malaria funding levels in FY2003 Foreign Operations was attributed by House/Senate conferees. The total amount for tuberculosis is $120 million and for malaria is $115 million. Congressional Action involved the expiration of both House and Senate FY2003 Foreign Operations bills, with a revised measure adopted in late January 2003. The FY2003 Foreign Operations measure for global health programs was finalized in February, with funding totaling $2 billion, including $880 million for international HIV/AIDS programs. Congress increased funding for health activities above the President's budget proposal, with earmarks for various programs like polio and micronutrients. The FY2003 Foreign Operations budget proposal includes earmarks for various global health programs such as polio, micronutrients, malaria, tuberculosis, and reproductive health, set at or above FY2002 levels. Controversies surround U.S. population assistance and family planning programs overseas, particularly regarding abortion-related restrictions and funding for the UN Population Fund in China. Allegations of coercive family planning have been widespread for many years, with recent attention focused on the UNFPA and a White House decision in July 2002 to block the $34 million U.S. contribution. Concerns over forced abortions and involuntary sterilizations in China led to the U.S. not contributing to UNFPA during the Reagan and Bush Administrations. The Kemp-Kasten amendment, passed in 1985, bars U.S. funds to any organization involved in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization programs. President Clinton determined in 1993 that UNFPA was not managing a coercive program despite its presence in China. In recent years, Congress has allocated around $25 million for UNFPA, with fluctuations based on spending in China. President Bush requested $25 million for UNFPA in FY2002, but Congress provided a ceiling of $34 million, allowing the President to allocate as he chose. The White House placed a hold on UNFPA funds in January due to new concerns. The White House placed a hold on UNFPA funds in January due to evidence of coercive practices in Chinese counties where UNFPA operates. Investigations found forced abortions and sterilizations in these areas. While some dispute UNFPA's involvement, there are concerns about its operations in China. The State Department sent an investigative team to China to review UNFPA programs. The team found no evidence of UNFPA knowingly supporting coercive practices in China, but noted that China still has coercive elements in its population programs. They recommended releasing $34 million in funds to UNFPA, with the condition that China ends all forms of coercion in its population policies. The State Department recommended releasing $34 million in funds to UNFPA, but Secretary of State Powell decided to withhold the funds due to concerns about China's population control programs. Despite UNFPA not knowingly supporting coercion, funds were redirected to other family planning activities. The State Department analysis found that UNFPA's involvement in China's family planning program enables coercive abortion practices. Critics are concerned about the impact on voluntary family planning programs in 140 countries where UNFPA operates and the potential implications for other international organizations receiving U.S. funds. The President proposed no funding for UNFPA in FY2003, with $25 million in reserve for potential funding if not in violation of Kemp-Kasten. The \"Mexico City\" Policy prohibits the use of U.S. funds for abortion-related activities and coercive family planning programs. Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations restricted funds for NGOs involved in abortions. Several NGOs, including IPPF-London, lost U.S. financial support for involvement in abortion-related activities. President Clinton reversed this policy in 1993, allowing funding for family planning organizations as long as no U.S. money was used for abortion work. The House and Senate have disagreed on the Mexico City policy, delaying the enactment of the Foreign Operations spending measure. The House and Senate disagreed on the Mexico City policy regarding U.S. aid funds for foreign organizations involved in abortions or lobbying. Congress adopted interim arrangements for FY1996-FY1999, removing some restrictions but reducing population assistance to $385 million. In FY2000, President Clinton reluctantly agreed to modified abortion restrictions linked to paying U.S. arrears to the United Nations. The Mexico City conditions were included in legislation, allowing the President to waive restrictions for grants. Congress allowed the new President to set policy in FY2001 under the Foreign Operations measure. President Bush issued a Memorandum on January 22, 2001, reinstating the Mexico City Policy and directing the USAID Administrator to comply with its requirements. He emphasized that taxpayer funds should not be used for abortions or advocacy. The President also committed to maintaining the $425 million funding level for population assistance, citing the importance of quality family planning services in preventing abortions. The press secretary emphasized that restrictions on abortion funding should not limit organizations from providing post-abortion care. USAID issued policy guidelines similar to those from the 1980s and 1990s. Critics oppose the certification requirement, fearing that family planning organizations may reduce services due to uncertainty about the restrictions. President Bush seeks $425 million for USAID population assistance in FY2003. Opponents fear that restrictions on abortion funding may lead to reduced services by family planning organizations, risking eligibility for USAID funding. They argue that the new conditions undermine relations with foreign NGOs and challenge their autonomy in spending. Critics also highlight concerns about a \"gag\" order on promoting changes to abortion laws in developing nations. Supporters of the certification requirement argue that while USAID funds cannot be used for abortions, money is fungible. The certification process aims to prevent organizations from using USAID funds for abortions by closing the fungibility loophole. Congressional action in 2003 resulted in the enactment of the FY2003 Foreign Operations measure (P.L. 108-7). President Bush signed the joint resolution (P.L. 108-7) a week later, providing $446.5 million for bilateral family planning activities in the FY2003 Foreign Operations measure. Conferees allocated $34 million to UNFPA, subject to conditions, including certification that the organization is not involved in coercive family planning programs. Last year, UNFPA was declared ineligible for U.S. support due to its program in China. The Senate made significant changes to international family planning funding and policy issues. H.J.Res. 2, as passed by the Senate, provided $435 million. The Senate passed H.J.Res. 2, providing $435 million for population assistance, with an amendment by Senator Leahy increasing aid to $435 million and earmarking $35 million for UNFPA. Funds for UNFPA were contingent on the President determining the organization no longer supported coercive practices. The legislation did not include changes to Kemp-Kasten language proposed in July 2002. The 2002 House bill (H.R. 5410) proposed $425 million for family planning aid with a $25 million earmark for UNFPA. It included conditions for UNFPA funding, such as no support for the State Planned-Birth Commission in China. Congress debated UNFPA support before the Administration's decision to terminate it in July 2002. The House bill proposed $425 million for family planning aid with a $25 million earmark for UNFPA. An amendment required the President to determine if UNFPA was involved in coercive family planning practices in China. The Senate-passed Supplemental Appropriation included a similar provision. If UNFPA violated Kemp-Kasten, U.S. support would be terminated. The House bill proposed $425 million for family planning aid with a $25 million earmark for UNFPA. The Senate and Lowey/Kolbeamendments would have required the full $34 million contribution to go forward, but the Tiahrt amendment left the decision up to the President. H.R. 4775 dropped all references to UNFPA, leaving the decision to the President. The Andean Regional Initiative (ARI) was launched in April 2001, requesting $882.29 million in FY2002 economic and counternarcotics assistance for Colombia and six regional neighbors. The Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) focuses on training and equipping counternarcotics battalions in Colombia. The program includes economic and social assistance for regional countries affected by drug and insurgency activities. President Bush also sought to extend the Andean Trade Preferences Act (ATPA) to provide trade benefits to Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia. This initiative was discussed during a meeting with Andean leaders at the Summit of the Americas in April 2001. In April 2001, a meeting in Canada discussed the Andean Regional Initiative with three goals: democracy, development, and drugs. The goals included promoting democracy, sustainable economic development, and reducing the supply of illegal drugs to the United States. Critics argued that the initiative focused too much on military and counter-drug assistance, lacking support for human rights and the peace process. The Foreign Operations Appropriations Act approved $625 million for the ACI in 2001, $106 million less than the President's request. Conditions were set regarding human rights and aerial eradication spraying in Colombia. President Bush requested $980 million for the ARI in FY2003, with $731 million for counternarcotics assistance under the ACI. The ACI funds were used for social and economic programs in the Andean region, with over half of the funds targeted at Colombia. The FY2003 request included $98 million for Foreign Military Financing for Colombia, marking a shift in policy towards military assistance. Other countries like Bolivia, Ecuador, Panama, and Peru also received funding. The ACI amounts did not differentiate between interdiction and alternative development. The Administration requested expanded authority to support Colombia in counternarcotics efforts and protect its democracy from terrorist organizations. The House passed a resolution urging the President to propose legislation for this purpose. The request for expanded authority to support Colombia's counternarcotics and counterterrorism activities sparked congressional debate, with critics concerned about potential expansion of the U.S. military role into counterinsurgency operations and human rights violations. The Bush Administration requested $27.1 billion in Emergency FY2002 Supplemental Assistance, including $38 million for Colombia and the Andean Region, raising concerns about U.S. military involvement and the government's ability to effectively wage its own war. The Bush Administration requested $27.1 billion in Emergency FY2002 Supplemental Assistance, including $38 million for Colombia and the Andean Region. This funding includes $4 million for Colombia police post support, $6 million for infrastructure security, $3 million for Ecuador for counter-terrorism equipment and training, and $25 million for a counter-kidnapping program for Colombia's police and armed forces. The proposal aims to broaden the authorities of the Defense and State Departments to utilize assistance to support Colombia's campaign against narcotics trafficking and terrorist activities. The Administration's proposal aims to expand U.S. assistance to Colombia, particularly military aid, to counter threats to national security posed by groups using narcotics trafficking to fund terrorist activities. This would allow for sharing intelligence with Colombian security forces for military operations against guerrillas and paramilitaries, using equipment provided under Plan Colombia. The proposal also includes continuing the \"Leahy Amendment\" provision in foreign operations. The proposal aims to expand U.S. assistance to Colombia, particularly military aid, to counter threats posed by groups using narcotics trafficking to fund terrorist activities. It includes continuing the \"Leahy Amendment\" provision but lifts conditions on funding, except for specific limitations on the number of U.S. civilian contractors and military personnel supporting activities in Colombia. The FY2003 Foreign Operations appropriation bill, signed into law as P.L. 108-7, provides $933 million for the Andean region. It addresses violations by security forces and requires the armed forces to sever ties with illegal paramilitary groups. Congressional action included the adoption of a revised Foreign Operations measure in January 2003 and the passage of a joint resolution in February. The FY2003 Foreign Operations appropriation bill provides $933 million for the Andean region, with $700 million allocated for the Andean Counternarcotics Initiative. Colombia receives less funding than proposed, with increased interdiction funding but reduced amounts for alternative development. The legislation allows for up to $93 million of military aid for the security of the Cano-Limon oil pipeline. Not less than $250 million of the ACI account is to be apportioned directly to USAID for social and economic programs.

Not less than $250 million of the ACI account is to be apportioned directly to USAID for social and economic programs, including earmarks for specific programs in Colombia. The FY2003 Foreign Operations appropriation bill provides funding for a unified campaign in Colombia against narcoticstrafficking and terrorist organizations. The enacted measure allows for the distribution of 75% of funds for Colombia's military, with the possibility of removing this authority if the Colombian military fails to restore government authority and human rights in certain areas. The FY2003 Foreign Operations appropriation bill allows for the distribution of 75% of funds for Colombia's military, with conditions for certification by the Secretary of State regarding human rights violations and ties with paramilitary organizations. The remaining 25% of assistance is contingent on further certifications. The House measure (H.R. 5410) for Colombian aid includes conditions such as a cap on U.S. civilian contractors and military personnel, requirements for helicopter use, a report on chemical safety, and an environmental impact statement for FY2003. The enacted bill prohibits funds for Peruvian air interdiction program without certification from Secretary of State and Director of Central Intelligence. Congress endorsed unified campaign policy for counter-narcotics and terrorism in FY2002 supplemental. President Bush proposed increasing foreign economic assistance by $5 billion in FY2006. American aid would increase by $5 billion over three years through the President's initiative, with the funds allocated to a new Millennium Challenge Account (MCA). The initiative aims to provide economic assistance to developing nations focusing on good governance, healthcare, education, and promoting open markets. This would be one of the largest increases in foreign aid spending in fifty years. The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) represents a significant increase in foreign aid spending, based on the premise of linking economic development to free market and democratic principles. Unlike previous aid programs, the MCA rewards countries for achievements rather than promises, separates funds from U.S. strategic foreign policy objectives, and focuses on soliciting program proposals developed solely by recipient nations. Assuming Congress fully funds the President's aid request, a $5 billion increase by FY2006 would result in a $17.2 billion foreign aid budget. In real terms, U.S. economic assistance in FY2006 would be $16.14 billion, the highest since FY1979. The MCA funding between FY2003 and FY2006 will increase by about 41% nominally and nearly 32% in real terms. The impact on U.S. aid as a percent of GDP is projected to rise from 0.11% to 0.13%. Initially limited to 74 poorest nations, the program will expand to include lower-middle income countries by FY2006 based on performance indicators related to governance, economic freedom, and investment. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) will manage the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) based on indicators of good governance, economic freedom, and investing in people. Countries must score above the median on half of the indicators in each category to qualify, with emphasis on fighting corruption. The MCC will be an independent entity separate from other government departments, with a staff of about 100 led by a CEO confirmed by the Senate. Operations will be overseen by a review board chaired by the Secretary of State. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) will oversee the operations of the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) based on indicators of good governance, economic freedom, and investing in people. Despite discussions to launch an MCA \"pilot\" project in FY2003, it has been deferred as there is no funding in the enacted Foreign Operations for FY2003. The Administration has submitted authorizing legislation and a $1.3 billion FY2004 budget request for the MCA.

Table 9 shows the discretionary budget authority for Foreign Operations in millions of dollars. The 108th Congress enacted FY2003 Foreign Operations appropriations as part of new legislation. The FY2002 supplemental includes funds appropriated for emergency terrorism response. The Administration proposed consolidating Child Survival/Health and Development Assistance accounts into a single account for FY2003. The FY2003 request included $1.474 billion for Child Survival/Health and $1.365 billion for Development Assistance. Additional funds were proposed for HIV/AIDS programs, humanitarian aid for the Palestinians, and anti-terrorism aid to Israel. The Administration proposed consolidating Child Survival/Health and Development Assistance accounts into a single account for FY2003, with additional funds for HIV/AIDS programs, humanitarian aid for the Palestinians, and anti-terrorism aid to Israel. The total across-the-board reduction is currently estimated at 2.852%, calculated by CBO as $11.392 billion. The total across-the-board reduction for FY2003 is estimated at 2.852%, amounting to $11.392 billion. H.J.Res. 2 requires a 0.65% rescission."
