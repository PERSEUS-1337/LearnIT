    "content": "House and Senate rules define an earmark as congressionally directed spending, tax benefit, or tariff benefit that benefits a specific entity or state, locality, or congressional district. In the 112th Congress, an earmark moratorium was observed, enforced by party rules and committee protocols rather than House or Senate rules. In the 112th Congress, an earmark moratorium was enforced by party rules and committee protocols, prohibiting Members from requesting earmarks. This policy was adopted by the House Republican Conference and the Senate Appropriations Committee, with subsequent extensions in later Congresses. The Senate Republican Conference has a policy against requesting earmarks, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits. The earmark moratorium has been in place since the 113th Congress and can be lifted by allowing legislation with earmarks. The House and Senate have formal earmark disclosure requirements. The House and Senate have formal earmark disclosure requirements established since the 110th Congress to bring transparency to earmarking. House Rules require legislation to include a list of earmarks, tax benefits, or tariff benefits, or a statement that there are none. The House earmark disclosure rules apply to earmarks included in bills, committee reports, conference reports, and various types of legislation. Members requesting earmarks must provide a written statement with specific details to the committee of jurisdiction. The House earmark disclosure rules require Members to provide specific details of the intended recipient, purpose, and any financial interests in earmarks. Committees determine earmarks, compile requests, and maintain records. Individual committees may have additional requirements in their rules. House rules require discretion in determining earmarks, with guidelines from past designations. Earmarks must be listed in committee reports or statements, with sponsors identified. Conference reports on appropriations bills must specify any earmarks not initially listed. The House and Senate have rules in place for earmarks, requiring transparency and public inspection of all requests, even those not included in the final legislation. Senate rules mandate that a list of earmarks and their requesting Senators must be available on a public website before any vote related to earmarks. The Senate has rules in place for earmarks, requiring transparency and public inspection of all requests. Earmark certification requirements must be met for floor amendments containing additional earmarks, with items needing to be printed in the Congressional Record. These rules apply to congressional earmarks in bills, joint resolutions, committee reports, and conference reports, including authorizing, appropriations, and tax legislation. The disclosure requirements also apply to unreported measures, amendments, House bills, and conference reports. Under Senate rules, a Senator requesting a congressional earmark must provide a written statement with specific details, including the earmark recipient's name and purpose, and a certification of no financial interest. Senate committees have responsibilities for determining earmarks, compiling requests, and ensuring compliance with the rule. The Senate Rules require earmark requests to be compiled and presented, with committees determining what constitutes an earmark. Before a measure can be considered, a list of earmarks and sponsors must be made public for 48 hours, and certification of compliance is needed. The 116th Congress may review earmark policy changes. The 116th Congress may consider changes to earmark policy, such as keeping the moratorium in place but adding it to formal rules or lifting the moratorium with new restrictions for earmark use. These restrictions could include increased transparency in the earmarking process through various methods. In 2010, the House Appropriations Committee planned to create a centralized online link for earmark requests by Members. Congress could impose restrictions on earmark purposes, entities eligible for earmarks, and the amount spent on each earmark. For instance, earmarks for projects named after the requesting Member were prohibited, and earmarks for for-profit entities were no longer considered. Congress could impose limits on the total cost of earmarks, such as restricting funding for non-project based earmarks to 50% of 2006 levels. They could also involve the executive branch in the earmarking process by seeking advice on suitable fund usage and requiring audits by agency inspectors general. Additionally, Congress may conduct further research on earmarking practices. To address earmarking issues, Congress could consider creating a select committee or requesting research from CRS or the Government Accountability Office."
