    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Integrity in Banking and Money Laundering Prevention Act of 1999\". The Congress finds that money laundering is a serious problem, with billions of dollars being laundered annually. This activity supports illicit trades like drug trafficking, terrorism, and arms smuggling, allowing criminals to hide their profits and undermine financial institutions. Money laundering by international criminal enterprises poses a threat to national governments, corrupts institutions, and violates legal norms and human rights. US financial institutions play a crucial role in combating money laundering, with private banking services estimated to have assets worth billions of dollars. The Act aims to combat money laundering by extending legislation to all financial institutions, including securities brokers. It prioritizes combating money laundering in US financial institutions, closing gaps in the private banking system, targeting high-intensity money laundering areas, and reporting on private banking activities. To prevent abuse in private banking, US financial institutions must maintain documentation of offshore accounts and subject securities brokers to suspicious activities reporting requirements. SEC. 3.

Money laundering is defined as concealing the existence, illegal source, or illegal use of income. Private banking involves the personal delivery of financial products and services to high net worth individuals, including various services like deposits, lending, investing, trust administration, and fund transfers.
