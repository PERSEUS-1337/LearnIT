Government changes and ongoing violence have hindered security and infrastructure development. Despite efforts to achieve stability, global food price increases have impacted the country's food costs. The subsequent 50 percent rise in Haiti's staple food costs since mid-2007 threatens the country's security and economic prosperity. Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, could benefit from technical assistance in healthcare, sanitation, capacity building, and the environment. United States Caribbean nationals have historically supported their home countries through remittances, serving as lobbies and transnational networks for development. Partnering with diaspora resources can aid in public administration, business development, job creation, and migration management. The Haitian diaspora, mainly in the United States and Canada, plays a significant role in supporting Haiti's economy through remittances. Remittances reached 1.83 billion in 2007, accounting for 35% of Haiti's GDP. Diaspora support includes funding small businesses and micro-volunteer projects through hometown associations. Mobilizing Haitians abroad is crucial for state and economic reconstruction in Haiti, aiming to reverse the brain drain and bring skilled expatriates back to expand the nation's workforce and management capacity. The Next Steps for Haiti Act of 2009 focuses on mobilizing Haitians abroad to aid in the state and economic reconstruction efforts in Haiti. The Next Steps for Haiti Act of 2009 authorizes the establishment of the Haiti Professional Exchange Program to provide technical assistance in key areas for Haiti's growth and development, with consultation from the democratically elected Government of Haiti and Haitian civil society organizations. The Haiti Professional Exchange Program aims to provide technical assistance in vital sectors for Haiti's growth and development, in consultation with the democratically elected Government of Haiti and civil society organizations. The Haiti Professional Exchange Program involves civil society organizations and the Government of Haiti in selecting individuals based on specific criteria to provide technical assistance in key sectors for Haiti's development. The Director of Foreign Assistance will establish a selections committee and an outreach program to encourage participation in the Exchange Program. The Director of Foreign Assistance will establish an outreach program for the Exchange Program, targeting individuals who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents, fluent in Kreyol or French, and possess skills to support the program's goals.

Participants in the Exchange Program can extend their participation for one additional year with approval from the Director of Foreign Assistance and the Government of Haiti. They will receive monthly compensation equal to their Haitian counterpart's salary. The Exchange Program participants can extend for an extra year with approval. They will receive a readjustment allowance based on their participation duration. The program must be established within 180 days of the Act's enactment.
