The Act reserves a portion of funds for awards to Bureau of Indian Affairs schools and grants to State educational agencies for subgrants to local educational agencies. The Secretary allocates funds to State educational agencies based on the number of students served by eligible local educational agencies. Specially qualified agencies can apply directly for grants if a State does not participate in the program. Local educational agencies can apply for grants under this Act by meeting specific criteria, including having a certain percentage of students from low-income families and being located in a designated school community. Specially qualified agencies may also receive direct awards from the Secretary on a competitive basis. Grant funds awarded to local educational agencies or schools under this Act can be used for teacher recruitment and retention, professional development, educational technology, and academic enrichment programs.
