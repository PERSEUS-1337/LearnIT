    "content": "The algorithm presented addresses the covariate shift problem in imitation learning by training an ensemble of policies on expert demonstration data. It minimizes the variance of predictions with RL and supervised behavioral cloning, using a fixed reward function. Empirical evaluation shows it outperforms other methods in Atari environments and continuous control tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods are effective for tasks with defined rewards, while imitation learning (IL) is used when behaviors are vaguely specified. IL involves training agents to mimic expert demonstrations rather than optimizing a reward function. Training a policy to predict expert actions from demonstration data using supervised learning can lead to errors due to distribution differences between training and execution states. Early work by Pomerleau (1989) and formalization by Ross & Bagnell (2010) showed a quadratic regret bound, which was improved to linear by Ross et al. (2011) through interaction with the environment and expert queries. DRIL (Disagreement-Regularized Imitation Learning) is a new algorithm proposed to address the covariate shift problem in imitation learning. It trains an ensemble of policies on demonstration data, using disagreement in predictions as a cost optimized through RL and supervised behavioral cloning. The algorithm aims to align the agent's distribution with that of the expert without requiring additional interaction with the expert. The DRIL algorithm aligns the agent's distribution with the expert's, achieving a regret bound for tabular MDPs. It outperforms behavioral cloning and generative adversarial imitation learning in Atari environments and continuous control tasks. The algorithm trains an ensemble of policies on demonstration data, using disagreement in predictions as a cost optimized through RL and supervised behavioral cloning. In imitation learning, the goal is to mimic an expert policy \u03c0 by minimizing a surrogate loss between actions. The total variation distance is used as an upper bound on the loss. By minimizing this distance and satisfying certain smoothness conditions on expected costs C(s, a), the algorithm aims to align the agent's distribution with the expert's in tabular MDPs. Theorem 1 states that minimizing the 0-1 loss within translates into an O(T) regret bound on task cost. It is often not possible to optimize J exp directly, so the supervised behavioral cloning cost J BC is used instead. Minimizing this loss yields a quadratic regret bound on regret, which is tight and matches the worst-case lower bound. The algorithm aims to mimic the expert policy on the expert's data distribution and move towards it if needed. The algorithm combines a standard behavior cloning loss with an uncertainty cost to address data distribution issues. It initializes policies and ensembles, trains them on demonstration data, and minimizes the uncertainty cost to encourage the policy to mimic the expert's distribution. The algorithm minimizes a cost to encourage the policy to mimic the expert's distribution by combining behavior cloning loss with an uncertainty cost. It optimizes the total cost using policy gradient over states generated by the current policy and demonstration data. An ensemble of models trained on demonstration data is used to approximate the posterior distribution of the policy. The algorithm combines supervised behavioral cloning updates with policy gradient updates to minimize posterior variance. Bayesian neural networks and MCdropout are also effective methods for approximating the posterior. The supervised loss optimizes KL divergence between predicted and expert actions, with a clipped uncertainty cost based on demonstration data. Based on demonstration data, RL cost can be optimized using policy gradient methods like advantage actor-critic (A2C). Model-based RL methods can also be used for sample efficiency. DRIL is analyzed for tabular MDPs, showing a regret bound linear in \u03ba T, where \u03ba represents a tradeoff between data concentration and posterior variance. The algorithm aims to minimize cost function J by returning a policy that agrees with the expert's distribution. It defines quantities to measure agreement, such as the maximum probability ratio between state distributions. This helps push the learner back towards the expert's distribution if it strays away.

It defines quantities to measure agreement, such as the maximum probability ratio between state distributions. This helps push the learner back towards the expert's distribution if it strays away. \u03b1(U) will be low if the expert distribution has high mass inside of U, and the states in U are reachable by policies in the policy class. \u03ba coefficient is defined as the minimum ratio of quantities inside and outside of U. Minimizing \u03ba(U) involves a tradeoff between coverage by the expert policy inside U and variance of the posterior outside U. The algorithm aims to minimize cost function J by returning a policy that agrees with the expert's distribution. It defines quantities to measure agreement, such as the maximum probability ratio between state distributions. This helps push the learner back towards the expert's distribution if it strays away. The result shows that minimizing J alg (\u03c0) small ensures J exp (\u03c0) is also small, with a regret bound linear in \u03ba T. DRIL does not require knowledge of \u03ba, which is problem-dependent and depends on environment dynamics, expert policy, and available policies.

We compute \u03ba for a problem where behavioral cloning performs poorly, showing it is independent of T. The algorithm aims to minimize cost function J by returning a policy that agrees with the expert's distribution. It achieves an O(T) regret bound, contrasting with the O(T^2) regret of behavioral cloning. The idea of learning through imitation dates back to Pomerleau's work in 1989, where a neural network imitated a human driver's steering actions. Covariate shift was observed in the network's occasional deviation from the center of the road. The DAGGER algorithm, introduced by Ross et al. in 2011, achieves linear regret by interacting with the environment without querying the expert. Venkatraman et al. extended DAGGER to time series prediction using true targets as expert corrections. Imitation learning in modern RL improves sample efficiency and exploration, assuming known rewards and policies. In the context of imitation learning in modern RL, various methods have been proposed to address the covariate shift problem and improve sample efficiency. These methods include fine-tuning policies with reinforcement learning, extrapolating the value function outside the training distribution, and treating imitation learning within the Q-learning framework. In the context of imitation learning in modern RL, various methods have been proposed to address the covariate shift problem and improve sample efficiency. Zero reward is given for transitions in the replay buffer that are not expert demonstrations. Different approaches like Random Expert Distillation and Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning have been used to guide the agent towards the expert's support. These methods aim to reduce covariate shift and improve the agent's performance. Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) is a state-of-the-art algorithm that trains a discriminator network to distinguish expert states from generated states by the policy. It uses the negative output of the discriminator as a reward signal to train the policy, encouraging it to return to the expert distribution. In contrast to GAIL, our approach uses a simple fixed reward function, which makes the algorithm more stable and easier to tune. In experiments, disagreement between models in an ensemble is used to represent uncertainty. Previous works have explored using disagreement between dynamics models for exploration in model-based RL. Ensembles have also been used to represent uncertainty in model-free RL to encourage exploration. In imitation learning, variance of the ensemble is used with the DAGGER algorithm to minimize unsafe situations. The current study focuses on using disagreement between policies sampled from the posterior to address covariate shift in imitation learning.

DRIL outperforms behavior cloning in terms of regret across all trials in a tabular MDP experiment. Different methods are used to sample policies and define reward functions for optimization. In a study on addressing covariate shift in imitation learning, DRIL outperformed behavior cloning in a tabular MDP experiment. The experiment involved optimizing reward functions using tabular Q-learning and expert demonstration trajectories. Results showed low regret across all trials, even with a single demonstration, outperforming the worst-case linear bound suggested by analysis. The approach was further evaluated on six Atari environments using pretrained PPO agents. DRIL outperforms behavioral cloning in various environments and with different numbers of expert trajectories. Results show significant performance improvements, with the method matching expert performance using a small number of demonstrations. The uncertainty cost decreases throughout training, corresponding to the gap in performance between behavior cloning and DRIL. Our method shows improvements over behavior cloning in MsPacman and Breakout, with a focus on redirecting the policy towards the expert manifold. GAIL did not perform well in these domains despite hyperparameter tuning. These results align with previous findings on GAIL's performance with images. Our method outperformed GAIL on images, using a fixed reward function obtained through supervised learning. Ablation experiments in Appendix D explored different cost function choices and the role of BC loss. Results on 6 continuous control tasks from PyBullet 3 and OpenAI Gym showed behavior cloning as a strong baseline, matching expert performance in many tasks. Our method addresses covariate shift in imitation learning by penalizing disagreement between policies sampled from the posterior. It matches expert performance with few trajectories across various tasks, including Atari games. Our algorithm addresses covariate shift in imitation learning by penalizing policy disagreements. It can match expert performance with few trajectories in various tasks, including Atari games. Future work includes extending analysis to continuous state spaces and applying the method in structured prediction tasks like dialogue and language modeling. Our algorithm addresses covariate shift in imitation learning by penalizing policy disagreements to match expert performance in tasks like Atari games. The uncertainty-based cost function can fine-tune language or translation models after training. Theorem 1 proves the effectiveness of minimizing J alg using an optimization oracle. Our algorithm minimizes J alg using an optimization oracle to address covariate shift in imitation learning. The uncertainty cost function can fine-tune language or translation models. Theorem 1 proves the effectiveness of minimizing J alg. The example demonstrates sub-optimal policies when minimizing uncertainty cost alone without considering the BC cost. The Random Expert Distillation (RED) assigns zero cost to transitions. DRIL without the BC cost (UO-DRIL) also assigns zero cost to transitions. Using bootstrapped samples may result in disagreement among ensemble models. RED and UO-DRIL avoid suboptimal policies at state s0. Policies \u03c01, \u03c02 are considered. Policies \u03c01 and \u03c02, based on demonstration data, may have similar costs under RED and UO-DRIL. However, \u03c01 may get stuck in a loop while \u03c02 can achieve high rewards. Including behavior cloning (BC) cost helps differentiate between policies that stay within the demonstration data but behave differently. For training Atari environments, behavior cloning and ensemble models were trained to minimize classification loss using Adam for 500 epochs. Hyperparameter search was done on Space Invaders, and the best values were used for all other environments. A2C hyperparameters followed default values, with policy networks consisting of 3-layer convolutional networks and a single-layer MLP. GAIL used a CNN discriminator with the same architecture as the policy network. Hyperparameter search was also done on Breakout with 10 demonstrations. The behavior cloning and ensemble models were trained on Breakout with 10 demonstrations using Adam for 500 epochs. Different DRIL agents were tested with various cost functions, but none outperformed behavioral cloning. Switching from clipped cost in {\u22121, +1} to {0, 1} or raw cost causes performance drop in most environments. Optimizing pure BC cost performs better in some environments, while pure uncertainty cost performs better in others. DRIL, which optimizes both, has robust performance and performs the best over most environments and trajectories. The study compares ensembling and MC-dropout approaches for posterior estimation in different environments and trajectories. Results show that MC-dropout performs similarly to ensembling, indicating the versatility of the method with different estimation approaches."
