Congress acknowledges the significant impact of trauma, which is the leading cause of death for soldiers and civilians in the United States. Trauma results in millions of emergency department visits and hospital admissions annually, costing the country billions of dollars. Injuries account for a significant portion of annual health expenditures and are among the top causes of death and disability worldwide. Both military and civilian trauma casualties are treated similarly, highlighting the need for focused trauma research. Despite the alarming statistics, funding for trauma research is significantly lower compared to other health issues like HIV and cancer. The Peer Reviewed Medical Research Program, despite its mandate to focus on military-relevant health issues, lacks adequate support for trauma research. The National Trauma Institute (NTI) in San Antonio, Texas, formed by military-civilian collaboration, aims to fill the gap in trauma research by setting a comprehensive research agenda and awarding grants to top researchers. NTI, as a consortium of civilian and Department of Defense centers, can translate battlefield innovations to civilians at home. The National Trauma Institute (NTI) aims to reduce injuries and deaths for soldiers on the battlefield and civilians at home by coordinating a national trauma research agenda.

The Secretary of Defense will establish a National Trauma Institute Research Program to fund trauma research and develop innovative medical technologies for injury prevention and diagnosis. The program will support a collaborative research effort and offer grants for projects focusing on injury prevention, triage improvement, and trauma research. The National Trauma Institute Research Program will fund trauma research and develop innovative medical technologies for injury prevention and diagnosis, including improved prehospital and inter-hospital triage, resuscitation, treatment of bleeding, burn care, head and spinal cord injury, tissue engineering, orthopedics, intensive care unit treatment, rehabilitation, trauma care systems, and outcomes. Authorization of $25,000,000 for the National Trauma Institute Research Program under the Secretary of Defense for specific activities, excluding general administrative expenses."
