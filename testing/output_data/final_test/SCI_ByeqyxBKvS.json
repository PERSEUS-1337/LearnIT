A quantum machine learning algorithm has been developed for training Semi-Supervised Kernel Support Vector Machines, using quantum speedup for large-scale classification problems. Research is ongoing in the field of quantum machine learning, with a focus on efficient architectures for quantum memory and quantum algorithms for solving large-scale classification problems. Quantum LS-SVM is an example of this approach, achieving exponential speedup compared to classical algorithms by using the HHL algorithm for solving quantum linear systems of equations. In quantum machine learning, research focuses on efficient architectures and algorithms. Semi-supervised learning utilizes additional data points with missing labels to improve classification accuracy. In quantum machine learning, algorithms exploit data distribution to enhance classification accuracy. A quantum algorithm for semi-supervised training of a kernel support vector machine model is introduced, utilizing a graph to capture sample similarity. The algorithm accesses training points and graph connectivity via a quantum oracle, achieving the same quantum speedup as LS-SVM without increased complexity. In quantum machine learning, algorithms use data distribution to improve classification accuracy. A quantum algorithm for semi-supervised training of a kernel support vector machine model is introduced, utilizing a graph to capture sample similarity. Quantum computers operate based on quantum mechanics laws, described in linear algebra. Quantum Systems are fully described by a unit-norm vector in a complex Hilbert space, with Dirac notation used in quantum mechanics and computing. In quantum mechanics and computing, Dirac notation is commonly used for linear algebra. It represents vectors and their complex conjugates as |x (ket) and x| (bra) respectively. A quantum bit, or qubit, is denoted by |\u03b1| 2 + |\u03b2| 2 , where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are complex numbers. Superposition states are described when both \u03b1 and \u03b2 are nonzero. Composite quantum states are represented as tensor products of quantum states. Transforming and measuring quantum states involve quantum operations. Quantum operations manipulate quantum states using unitary operators and measurements. Unitary operators are deterministic, invertible, norm-preserving linear transforms, while measurements stochastically transform the state based on probability amplitudes. In the quantum circuit model, unitary transformations are referred to as quantum gates. In quantum computing, unitary transformations known as quantum gates are used to manipulate quantum states. Input data is typically provided by a unitary operator called an oracle, which transforms the initial state into the desired input state for computation. Quantum random access memory (qRAM) uses log N qubits to address any quantum superposition of N memory cells. Quantum random access memory (qRAM) uses log N qubits to address quantum superposition of memory cells containing quantum or classical information. Various approaches for creating qRAM are being explored, but differences in qRAM architecture can impact computational complexity. Quantum Linear Systems of Equations involve finding solutions for linear equations with input matrix A and vector b, where HHL algorithm is used for Hermitian and full rank matrices. The HHL algorithm in quantum computing replaces A^-1 with the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse. By using quantum subroutines, it estimates eigenvalues to solve linear equations efficiently. The subroutine estimates an approximation of \u03bb i with small error, computes a conditional rotation, and involves inverse phase estimation and quantum measurement to obtain desired state Density Operators. Density operator formalism allows mixtures of pure states, written as a probability distribution \u03c1, a semi-definite positive matrix with Tr(\u03c1) = 1. Unitary operator U maps a quantum state expressed as a density operator \u03c1 to U\u03c1U \u2020. The partial trace of a composite quantum system involves tracing out the second part, leaving the first part in a specific state. Quantum LS-SVM relies on this concept, using a quantum oracle to convert data points into a density matrix. The normalized Kernel matrix is prepared by combining all data points in a quantum state. The normalized Kernel matrix is obtained by combining all data points in quantum state. In HHL-based quantum machine learning algorithms, matrix A for Hamiltonian simulation is based on data, such as the kernel matrix K captured in the quantum system as a density matrix. Efficient computation of e \u2212iK\u2206t is needed, where K is scaled by the trace of kernel matrix. The LMR technique for density operator exponentiation is used for non-sparse density matrices. The LMR technique involves approximating e \u2212iK\u2206t \u03c3e iK\u2206t with error O(\u2206t 2 ) by simulating a swap operator S on the state K \u2297 \u03c3 and discarding the first system. This technique efficiently approximates exponentiation of non-sparse density matrices, as seen in Quantum LS-SVM where the HHL algorithm is used for solving linear equations associated with LS-SVM by applying the LMR technique for density operator exponentiation e \u2212iK\u2206t. The quantum Semi-Supervised Least Square SVM involves generating a linear system of equations using a density matrix K encoding the kernel matrix. To solve this system in a quantum setting, steps include obtaining a scaled graph Laplacian matrix as a density operator and using polynomial Hermitian exponentiation to compute the matrix inverse. The unitary nature of quantum transformations limits the multiplication and addition of matrices, requiring a different approach for quantum LS-SVM. In a quantum semi-supervised model, a graph G with n edges connecting similar training samples is used to construct a quantum density operator for the graph Laplacian matrix L. By preparing quantum states combining rows of the incidence matrix for all vertices, the Laplacian matrix is obtained. The graph Laplacian matrix L is obtained by combining rows of the incidence matrix for all vertices. To compute the matrix inverse on a quantum computer, the generalized LMR technique is adapted for simulating e \u2212i(K+KLK)\u2206t \u03c3e i(K+KLK)\u2206t. The final dynamics can be obtained by sampling from separate output states for e \u2212iKLK\u2206t and e \u2212iK\u2206t. The density operators associated with the kernel matrix and Laplacian are not sparse, so the generalized LMR technique is adapted for simulating Hermitian polynomials. By generating a quantum state and performing controlled partial swaps, the simulation of e \u2212iB\u2206 up to error O(\u2206 2 ) is achieved. By repeating the procedure for t 2 /\u03b4 times, e \u2212iBt can be simulated up to error. The quantum LS-SVM offers exponential speedup over classical time complexity for solving SVM as a quadratic problem. This speedup is due to fast quantum computing of the kernel matrix and efficient oracle access to data. The circuit in Fig.1 creates a quantum state \u03c1 = |0 0| \u2297 \u03c1 + |1 1| \u2297 \u03c1 with Tr(\u03c1 + \u03c1 ) = 1 and B = \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1 = KLK. The cyclic permutation operator P is used in the analysis of the circuit steps. The algorithm for quantum LS-SVM involves preparing Laplacian density matrix and Hamiltonian simulation for KLK. The simulation includes a sparse conditional partial swap operator for efficient application of e \u2212iKLK\u2206t in time\u00d5(log(m)\u2206t). Efforts have been made to design fast classical algorithms for training SVMs, with decomposition-based methods like SMO being efficient for managing problems with a large number of features.
