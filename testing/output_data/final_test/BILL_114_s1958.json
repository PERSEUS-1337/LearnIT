    "content": "SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. The Act may be cited as the \"Christopher Bryski Student Loan Protection Act\" or \"Christopher's Law.\" Congress finds that the CFPB received numerous complaints related to private student loans and debt collection between October 1, 2014, and March 31, 2015, highlighting issues with discharge information and decision-making processes for co-signers. An estimated 1,700,000 people sustain traumatic brain injuries each year, with older adolescents aged 15 to 19 more at risk. The complaints received by the CFPB highlight issues such as improper payment application and difficulty in contacting personnel during hardships. The difference between federal and private student loans in periods of disability was not well-understood. The annual incidence of spinal cord injury in the United States is approximately 40 cases per 1,000,000 people, leading to permanent disability or loss of movement. Private student loans are mostly co-signed, but co-signer release is rare for eligible borrowers. SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL STUDENT LOAN PROTECTIONS. Section 140 of the Truth in Lending Act is amended to include additional protections for borrowers and co-signers of private education loans. Lenders must clearly describe the co-signer's obligations, including the impact of borrower or co-signer death, disability, or inability to work. The amendment to the Truth in Lending Act provides protections for borrowers and co-signers of private education loans. It prohibits adverse actions against the borrower due to the death, disability, or bankruptcy of a co-signer. The amendment to the Truth in Lending Act prohibits adverse actions against co-signers of private education loans based on the borrower's death, disability, or bankruptcy. Additionally, the Bureau will establish criteria for the automatic release of co-signers within 180 days of the enactment of this subsection. The Bureau will establish criteria for the automatic release of co-signers of private education loans without requiring any action from the borrower. Private lenders may have their own criteria for release, as long as they are not more restrictive than the Bureau's criteria. Private educational lenders must disclose the criteria for co-signer release in the promissory note of a private education loan. The criteria for co-signer release must be clearly and conspicuously disclosed to the borrower and any co-signer at the time the loan is consummated. Private educational lenders must disclose criteria for co-signer release in the promissory note of a private education loan. The lender cannot modify release criteria without borrower and co-signer consent. Borrower and co-signers must be promptly notified if a co-signer is released from the loan obligation. Private educational lenders cannot use a more adverse credit evaluation standard for co-signer release on private education loans. The private educational lender must evaluate the creditworthiness of the borrower or co-signer when the private education loan is taken. The lender must offer the borrower the option to designate someone to act on their behalf in case of death, disability, or inability to work. Additionally, the lender must ensure that the borrower and any co-signer receive counseling. The private educational lender must provide comprehensive information on loan terms and borrower responsibilities, including a model form for co-signer obligations. Definitions for death, disability, or inability to work are specified for borrowers and co-signers. The Truth in Lending Act is amended to include definitions for co-signers, ensuring compliance with regulations under the Higher Education Act to prevent fraud and abuse. The Truth in Lending Act is amended to define co-signers as individuals liable for another's obligation without compensation, including those required to sign for credit or collection purposes. The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection must issue regulations within a year to implement this amendment. SEC. 3. FEDERAL STUDENT LOANS. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to include information on loan discharge due to death, disability, or inability to work, repayment options in such cases, and the impact on borrower obligations. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to require borrowers to file a certification stating the educational purpose of the loan, ensuring it is used for attendance expenses only. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to allow students to designate an individual to act on their behalf for loans in case of death, disability, or inability to work. Students must provide their social security number and attendance details. The option to designate someone must be clearly presented to the student. The Act ensures that students remain eligible for financial assistance under the Higher Education Act of 1965 regardless of their designation status under section 484(a)(4)(B)."
