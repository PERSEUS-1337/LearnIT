    "content": "Since the terrorist attacks of 2001, there has been interest in reorganizing House and Senate committees for homeland security. The 9/11 Commission recommended creating standing committees in each chamber for oversight. Congress should establish a single point of oversight for homeland security. Congressional leaders should determine the appropriate committee jurisdiction. Congress should establish a permanent standing committee with nonpartisan staff in both the House and Senate for homeland security oversight. The House initially created a temporary Select Committee on Homeland Security to coordinate recommendations from various committees, leading to the passage of P.L. 107-296. The Select Committee was later abolished, but the new law emphasized the need for each House to review its committee structure in light of the reorganization of responsibilities. The House deferred immediate action and created a new Select Committee on Homeland Security in January 2003 to focus on legislative and oversight coordination for homeland security issues. The Select Committee was tasked with recommending changes to the House committee system by September 30, 2004. The Senate continued to address homeland security within its existing committee structure, including the Appropriations Subcommittee for Homeland Security. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees were adjusted to accommodate the creation of the new department. In early February 2003, the House Appropriations Committee reorganized its subcommittees to include a new Subcommittee on Homeland Security. The Senate Appropriations Committee also adjusted its structure to align with the House. Many members are calling for further changes to the committee system, with proposals for new select or standing committees. Several proposals have been made in the House and Senate to establish new committees on homeland security or make changes to existing ones. Some members believe that reorganizing committee structures is necessary for effective oversight of the new Homeland Security Department. However, there are differing opinions among members on whether such changes are needed. The reduction in committee jurisdiction fragmentation is seen as beneficial for the executive branch. The report discusses options for reorganizing congressional structures dealing with homeland security, considering advantages and disadvantages. There is pressure for timely reform due to the 9/11 Commission's recommendations and a deadline for proposals from the House Homeland Security Committee. Some argue reforms should be adopted before Congress adjourns for the election. Advocates push for timely congressional reforms before election adjournment. House committee reforms in 1974 serve as precedent. Some suggest deferring action until new Congress in January for more comprehensive reform options. House adopts new rules on first session day, potentially changing committee structure. Senate rules automatically in place, but attempts expected to alter Cloture Rule and executive nomination rules. Efforts could impact committee system. Efforts to reform congressional committees and executive nominations could impact the current structure. Historical precedent shows that executive reorganization does not always lead to congressional committee reorganization. The creation of various government departments in the past was not always accompanied by changes in House or Senate committee jurisdictions. Reorganization of the committee system can be undertaken by either chamber or both, with the last comprehensive Senate committee reorganization occurring a quarter century ago. The Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress in the 103rd Congress considered reorganizing committees but did not address terrorism jurisdiction. A comprehensive reorganization could address emerging jurisdiction issues, but it is controversial and rarely done under short deadlines. Realignment of committee jurisdictions within the existing structure is possible but Members are hesitant to overhaul the system during a Congress. Rules changes are typically adopted at the start of a new Congress. At the beginning of a new Congress, committee reorganization may be considered separately in the Senate. Changes to the referral system could allow multiple committees to handle legislative matters. For example, jurisdiction over certain homeland security topics could be added to specific committees without major alterations to existing jurisdictions. Changing the referral system could enable all interested committees to maintain legislative and oversight jurisdiction, such as imposing time limits on referrals for homeland security-related bills. Joint referrals could be allowed in the House, while party leaders in the Senate could recommend referrals to multiple committees. However, major changes to bill referral rules could complicate action on homeland security matters and be as controversial as jurisdictional realignment. A new standing committee could be created in either or both chambers with legislative responsibility over all aspects of the Department of Homeland Security. Questions remain about whether the new committee would absorb jurisdiction from existing panels or overlap with them, and if special oversight authority would be granted to it. Additionally, a select committee with the same or revised jurisdiction could be established in the 109th Congress, potentially with legislative authority. If a joint committee on Homeland Security were created, questions arise about its legislative authority and how its findings would be converted into legislative recommendations. The possibility of sequential referrals to existing standing committees could also be considered, as seen in the 107th Congress with the intelligence committees. In the 107th Congress, there were discussions about creating joint intelligence committees to investigate intelligence failures before terrorist attacks. Some believe joint committees could improve efficiency, while others prefer separate committees for autonomy. A Leadership Committee could coordinate homeland security work among other committees, similar to the House Homeland Security Select Committee. Less formal means could also be used to coordinate policy in both the House and Senate. In the House and Senate, committees use memoranda of understanding to coordinate policy and determine jurisdiction over disputed areas. The Senate also employs temporary standing orders to allocate jurisdiction among committees, which can be converted into permanent changes in procedure if successful. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees made structural changes in 2003, including creating a Subcommittee on Homeland Security. Recommendations from the 9/11 Commission suggest further realignments, such as separating intelligence appropriations or consolidating authorization and appropriations for intelligence activities. Additional adjustments may be needed in the committees' structures and procedures for drafting appropriations bills."
