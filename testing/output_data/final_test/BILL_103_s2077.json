    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Community Improvement Volunteer Act of 1994\". Congress recognizes the importance of volunteerism in addressing pressing public needs and promoting community values and civic responsibility. Expanding opportunities for volunteerism can help communities meet these needs effectively. The Davis-Bacon Act requires prevailing wage-setting provisions for federally-assisted projects to protect labor standards and ensure fair wages for workers. The Davis-Bacon Act's prevailing wage-setting provisions aim to support local working families, provide employment opportunities for women and minorities in construction, and incentivize apprenticeship programs for training. The Davis-Bacon Act ensures that prevailing wages are applied to all laborers and mechanics on federally-assisted public projects, with few exceptions provided by specific Federal laws. The purpose of this Act is to promote volunteer opportunities for construction, repair, and alteration of public buildings and works funded with Federal assistance by waiving prevailing wage-setting provisions for volunteers. The Davis-Bacon Act wage-setting provisions do not apply to individuals who volunteer for civic, charitable, or humanitarian reasons without expecting compensation, solely for personal satisfaction. Volunteers under the Davis-Bacon Act are required to provide services freely without coercion from an employer, not benefit any contractor on the project, and not be otherwise employed on the federally assisted project. Expenses, benefits, or nominal fees may be provided to volunteers if approved by the Secretary of Labor. Volunteers under the Davis-Bacon Act can receive payments for expenses like uniform allowances and transportation, reasonable benefits such as group insurance or pension plans, and nominal fees that are not tied to productivity. The determination of what constitutes a nominal fee is made on a case-by-case basis. The Secretary of Labor determines payments for volunteers under the Davis-Bacon Act based on economic realities to avoid undermining labor standards. Certain contracts are exempted from these regulations. Section 329 and Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254b and 254c) are referenced. The Secretary of Labor must submit a report to Congress by December 31, 1997, identifying projects and the number of volunteers working under this Act. The report should also include recommendations for other Davis-Bacon-related Acts to allow volunteer work."
