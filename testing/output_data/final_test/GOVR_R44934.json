    "content": "This report focuses on FY2019 discretionary appropriations for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies. Congress had to determine funding amounts and terms for agencies and programs. It includes an overview of funded entities, President Trump's FY2019 funding request, a comparison of FY2018 and FY2019 appropriations, and funding comparisons for various agencies and issues of interest to Congress. The FY2019 appropriation for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies was $35.61 billion, with funding allocated to various agencies including the Bureau of Land Management, EPA, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Park Service. This amount was slightly higher than the FY2018 regular appropriation but lower than the total FY2018 appropriation. The FY2019 appropriation for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies was $36.59 billion, including $1.28 billion for disaster relief. It was higher than the President's request and the House level but lower than the Senate level. Continuing appropriations were provided until February 15, 2019, at the FY2018 level. The CR for FY2019 included exceptions that changed fund purposes, extended provisions, and made other law changes. A partial government shutdown occurred from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019, affecting agencies in the Interior bill. Various measures were considered in Congress for FY2019 funding, excluding H.J.Res. 31. The FY2019 appropriations included proposals for short-term and full-year funding, detailed in the CRS Appropriations Status Table. Budget justifications for agencies are extensive, with appropriations laws funding numerous accounts and activities. This report does not provide detailed information on account levels or legislative changes for FY2019. For specific agency or account details, refer to individual sources. The annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill includes funding and provisions for agencies and programs in three federal departments and related agencies. Title I provides funding for most Department of the Interior agencies managing land and other resources. For more information on specific agencies or programs, contact key policy staff listed in the report or visit the \"Interior & Environment Appropriations\" subissue on the CRS website. Title I of the annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill provides funding for Department of the Interior agencies managing land and resources.

The DOI agencies funded in the bill, excluding two broad accounts, include the Bureau of Land Management, which oversees public land for various uses in the Western United States. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service manages federal land for various purposes such as energy development, recreation, and wildlife preservation. They also oversee mineral operations on Indian trust lands and administer the Endangered Species Act. The National Park Service administers federal land within the National Park System, preserving unique resources and promoting public enjoyment. They also support resource conservation activities outside the system through grant programs and partnerships. The U.S. Geological Survey provides information on geological resources, natural hazards, and energy resources. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management oversees offshore energy development in various regions, including the Arctic. The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement regulates resource development on the outer continental shelf. The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement oversees regulatory and safety oversight for resource development in the outer continental shelf, including oil and gas permitting, facility inspections, environmental compliance, and oil spill response planning. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement works with states and tribes to reclaim abandoned coal mining sites and regulates active coal mining sites to minimize environmental impacts. Indian Affairs agencies provide services to federally recognized tribes and their members, including government operations, law enforcement, social programs, economic development, and Indian rights protection. The Bureau of Indian Education funds educational programs from elementary to higher education. The Environmental Protection Agency administers various environmental statutes to protect human health and the environment, including regulating air and water quality, pesticides, hazardous waste management, and pollution control grants to states and local governments.

President Trump allocated funds for FY2019. President Trump requested $28.34 billion for over 30 agencies in the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill for FY2019. He also requested a new adjustment for wildland fire suppression activities, with $1.52 billion available through the cap adjustment. The budget authority designated for these activities would not be subject to spending limits. The request for the 10 major DOI agencies was $10.59 billion, EPA was $6.19 billion, and other entities funded in Title III of the bill was $11.56 billion. In Title III of the bill, the request was $11.56 billion, or 40.8% of the total. Funding for a small subset of agencies accounted for most of the total request, with three agencies - EPA, Forest Service, and Indian Health Service - making up more than half of the total. The requests for DOI agencies ranged from $121.7 million to $2.70 billion. The President's FY2019 budget request for DOI agencies ranged from $121.7 million to $5.42 billion, with the National Park Service and Indian Affairs receiving the highest funding. Other agencies had varying funding levels, with the Forest Service and Indian Health Service also receiving significant amounts. The Smithsonian Institution had a request of $957.4 million, while several entities had requests of $62 million or less. The President's FY2019 budget request for DOI agencies varied from $121.7 million to $5.42 billion, with the National Park Service and Indian Affairs receiving the highest funding. The total enacted appropriation for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies in FY2018 was $36.59 billion, including regular and emergency supplemental appropriations. For FY2019, the President sought $28.34 billion for agencies in the Interior bill and a discretionary cap adjustment of $1.52 billion for wildland fire suppression. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 6147 differed in their proposed funding amounts for FY2019. For FY2019, the enacted appropriation for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies in P.L. 116-6 was $35.61 billion. The President's request, House-passed bill, Senate-passed bill, and FY2019 enacted appropriation contained less overall funding for FY2019 compared to FY2018. The President's request would have reduced funding by $6.98 billion (19.8%), the House-passed bill would have provided nearly level appropriations, with a decrease of $5.5 million (<0.1%), and the Senate-passed bill would have also reduced funding. The Senate-passed bill for FY2019 would have increased funding by $601.0 million (1.7%), while the FY2019 enacted appropriation provided an increase of $300.0 million (0.8%). Figure 2 shows the appropriations enacted for FY2018, requested by the President for FY2019, and passed by the House and Senate for FY2019. Table 1 lists the appropriations for each agency enacted for FY2018 and requested for FY2019. The text discusses the appropriations enacted for FY2018 and FY2019 for various agencies and programs, highlighting the differences between the funding requested by the President, passed by the House and Senate, and enacted. It also includes percentage changes between FY2018 and FY2019 appropriations. The FY2019 appropriations for the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) saw differences in funding requests between the Administration, House, and Senate. The Administration sought a 23.2% decrease from FY2018, while the House and Senate versions included increased appropriations for BLM, with additional funds for Management of Lands and Resources. The Administration also proposed budget restructuring within the Management of Lands and Resources account. The FY2019 enacted appropriation for the Management of Lands and Resources account reflected the President's proposed restructuring, with increased funds for that account and Land Acquisition. The EPA received $8.06 billion in FY2018, with a decrease in funding under the Administration's request and the House-passed bill for FY2019. The Administration's request for FY2019 included decreased funding for various accounts, such as Science and Technology, Environmental Programs, and State and Tribal Assistance Grants. However, there was level funding proposed for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and increased appropriations for Buildings and Facilities and the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Program in both the House and Senate versions of the bill. The FY2019 EPA budget received level funding for most accounts, with some increases and decreases in specific programs. The total appropriation was $8.85 billion, a slight increase from FY2018. In FY2019, the EPA budget saw level funding for most accounts, with some increases and decreases in specific programs. The total appropriation was $8.85 billion, a slight increase from FY2018. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) faced proposed reductions in funding for the Resource Management account, including cuts in ecological services, habitat conservation, and fish and aquatic conservation programs. The House and Senate versions of the bill sought to increase funding for Resource Management and retain funding for cooperative landscape conservation and science support. The FY2019 enacted appropriation for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was $1.58 billion, which was $17.0 million less than the FY2018 appropriation. The Administration proposed eliminating discretionary appropriations for two FWS accounts, but the House and Senate retained funding for them. Additionally, there were proposed reductions for the Land Acquisition and Construction accounts, with the House and Senate supporting smaller reductions. The FY2019 appropriation increased funding for Resource Management and retained funding for cooperative landscape conservation and science support programs. The FY2019 appropriation included funding for landscape conservation and science support programs, the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, and the National Wildlife Refuge Fund. The Administration proposed significant reductions for the Forest Service, including cuts to Capital Improvement and Maintenance, State and Private Forestry, and the National Forest System. Funding was also sought to be eliminated for programs such as Land Acquisition, Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration, and certain cooperative forestry programs. For FY2019, the House and Senate bills proposed increases for the Forest Service (FS) of 3.3% and 6.1% respectively, with differences in appropriations for major FS accounts. The enacted appropriation for FY2019 was $6.09 billion, $152.5 million higher than FY2018, with higher funding for all major accounts except Capital Improvement and Maintenance.

The FY2019 appropriations saw a $17.5 million increase over FY2018, with most programs receiving small dollar increases or stable funding. Public safety and justice had a 1.5% increase, while education programs declined by 1.1% primarily due to one-time increases in FY2018 for specific institutions. The Indian Health Service (IHS) would have received changes under the Administration's FY2019 request. Under the Administration's FY2019 request, the Indian Health Service (IHS) faced a 2.1% decrease in funding compared to FY2018. The proposed cuts included reductions in the Indian Health Facilities account by 41.7% and no funding for programs like the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund and health education. However, additional funding was requested for clinical services such as hospital and health clinics, mental health, and substance abuse programs. The Administration also aimed to fund the Special Diabetes Program for Indians through discretionary appropriations. The House and Senate bills would increase funding for the Indian Health Service (IHS) by 6.7% and 4.2% respectively over FY2018 appropriations. Both chambers supported higher funding for clinical services and agreed on the proposed level for contract support costs. The House included appropriations for the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund, while both chambers retained funding for health education and community health representatives. Additionally, both chambers provided additional funds for facilities and environmental health support. Neither chamber sought to fund the Special Diabetes Program for Indians through discretionary appropriations. The FY2019 enacted appropriation for the Indian Health Service (IHS) was $5.80 billion, an increase of $266.5 million (4.8%) over FY2018. The funding included increases for clinical services and contract support costs, but did not fund the Special Diabetes Program for Indians through discretionary appropriations. Additionally, funding was provided for programs the President sought to eliminate, such as the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund and health education. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) has funded land. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) received an increase in funding for FY2019, with the Administration proposing a reduction of $12.9 million due to rescissions of prior-year funds.

The House and Senate approved slight increases in funding for the NPS for FY2019, with some programs receiving boosts while others faced reductions. For FY2019, the enacted appropriation for the National Park Service was $3.22 billion, a slight increase from FY2018. Some programs saw increases while others faced reductions, with differences between the House and Senate on funding directions. Notably, funds were lower for the Centennial Challenge and Land Acquisition accounts due to decreased land acquisition by the NPS. The Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program (PILT) funding for FY2019 was reduced to $500.0 million, a 9.6% decrease from FY2018. PILT compensates counties for nontaxable lands. The Smithsonian Institution (SI) funding for FY2019 would have been...

The Administration requested a significant decrease, the Senate approved a smaller decrease, and the House approved an increase. Additionally, all three supported an increase for Facilities Services. For FY2019, the enacted appropriation for Facilities Services was $1.04 billion, essentially level with FY2018. There was an increase of 2.2% for Facilities Services, while the Facilities Capital account received a 2.7% decrease. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) would have seen a decrease of 25.1% under the Administration's request, an increase of 2.1% under the House-passed bill, and level funding under the Senate-passed bill compared to FY2018. The request proposed reduced funding for all eight major USGS program areas, including ecosystems, land resources, natural hazards, and water resources. Both chambers would have maintained level funding or increased appropriations for most USGS program areas except natural hazards, which would have declined. USGS received an appropriation of $1.16 billion for FY2019, with increases in five program areas and decreases in two. The largest increase was for energy, minerals, and environmental health, gaining $8.9 million.
