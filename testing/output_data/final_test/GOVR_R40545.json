    "content": "This report provides information on the current status and outlook for U.S. food prices, measuring their changes and how such changes relate to U.S. consumers. It includes sections on consumer demand, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), consumer income and expenditures, and recent food price inflation. The report examines retail food price inflation in the U.S., including the impact on consumer demand and government food programs. It analyzes the level of food price inflation for all-food, at-home-food, and away-from-home-food purchases, as well as major food groups. Each section can be read independently. Consumer behavior is influenced by economic factors like own-price, substitutes, complementary items, and household income, as well as non-economic factors such as tastes, family size, and lifestyle choices. Economists study how consumers respond to price and income changes to understand social welfare outcomes. Policymakers use this information to design policies to mitigate negative effects on consumers. Consumers use less of a good if its price increases relative to others, known as the \"substitution effect.\" Consumers are influenced by economic factors like price, substitutes, and income. The availability of substitutes can make consumers more price-sensitive, while a lack of substitutes may lead to continued purchase even with price increases. Cultural preferences can also impact consumer behavior. Consumers may be reluctant to switch from eating rice to bread or potatoes even if the price of rice rises. Changes in food prices impact consumers differently based on income levels and the importance of the affected food items in their budgets. Basic food staples like bread, potatoes, pasta, and rice take smaller shares of the food budget for the average American consumer, making them less responsive to price changes. In contrast, high-valued food items like expensive cuts of meat or seafood are considered costly delicacies for most households. Households are more responsive to price changes in high-valued products like expensive cuts of meat compared to basic staples. A rise in prices may lead consumers to switch to lower-quality items within the same food category. Changes in food prices affect consumers differently based on income levels and the importance of the affected food items in their budgets. Lower-income households are more sensitive to price changes across all food categories compared to higher-income households. Rising food prices impact lower-income consumers more severely, as they spend a significant portion of their budget on food. Household income directly influences the ability to respond to price changes, with higher incomes leading to more expensive food choices. In contrast, lower incomes result in consumers opting for cheaper options. When incomes decline, consumers tend to cut back on expensive options. Severe and perceived permanent income declines can lead to significant changes in food budget choices. Household consumption behavior in response to income changes can impact a country's agricultural production, trade patterns, or population health. Policymakers should monitor household wealth and income levels for unexpected shifts. Economists use Engel curves to classify goods based on the relationship between consumer income and quantity purchased. Normal goods see increased purchases with higher incomes, but at a decreasing rate. Consumers' purchasing behavior changes with income levels. For normal goods, purchases increase with income but at a decreasing rate. Luxury goods see an increasing rate of purchase with higher incomes, while inferior goods are bought less as incomes rise. Non-economic factors like cultural preferences also influence food budget choices. Dietary needs vary by age and gender, with children and adolescents needing more calories and protein for growth. Consumers' purchasing behavior is influenced by demographic factors such as age, activity levels, and household composition. Shopping habits and geographic location also impact food choices and prices paid. Lifestyle changes in affluent societies further affect consumer preferences. Household food purchases are influenced by various factors such as income levels, lifestyle choices, and price inflation. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a key measure of U.S. price inflation used to adjust values for inflation. Factors like demographic characteristics and geographic location also impact consumer behavior and food prices. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is used to adjust values for inflation and is divided into eight major spending categories, with \"Food and Beverage\" comprising 15.3% of the index. The \"Food and Beverages\" category includes \"All-Food\" and \"Alcoholic Beverages,\" with the All-Food CPI being the principal indicator of consumer food price changes. It can be further divided into \"Food-at-Home\" and \"Food-Away-from-Home\" categories, reflecting changes in retail food prices in the United States. The Food-Away-from-Home CPI tracks price changes for foods purchased and consumed outside the home, including restaurants, hotels, vending machines, and cafeterias. The All-Food CPI has historically shown more variability than the All-Items CPI, with both indexes experiencing higher inflation rates and volatility prior to 1960. During the period from 1917 to 1960, there were significant fluctuations in inflation rates. Food inflation peaked at 28.7% in 1917, followed by overall price inflation reaching 18% a year later. From 1921 to 1941, retail prices experienced a prolonged deflationary period, with prices dropping significantly. This volatility in prices made planning difficult for households, businesses, and government agencies. It wasn't until 1960 that retail prices stabilized with mild inflation. Retail prices stabilized in 1960 with mild inflation, but the 1970s saw sharp price spikes due to an energy crisis and global crop supply shifts. By the early 1980s, inflation was below 5%, with relatively low and stable prices since 1983. The food and energy components of the CPI are volatile, leading to the creation of a \"core\" index to measure underlying trend inflation. The core CPI is a useful measure of trend inflation, with the food component being less volatile than the energy component. Energy prices have been more volatile than food prices since 1960, with energy prices remaining volatile even after 1983. The energy price index has gradually increased its weighted share of the CPI over the past two decades. Energy inflation is more insidious than food inflation as energy costs impact the retail price of most CPI components. Household budget allocation reflects sensitivity to food price changes, while food budget share can indicate welfare at a national level. U.S. consumers have seen improved well-being over the past 80 years based on food budget share. The U.S. food share of real disposable personal income has decreased significantly over the past 80 years, from 25.2% in 1933 to under 10% since 2000. In 2013, average food outlays per household accounted for 13.0% of total consumer expenditures. The share of household food expenditures varies across income quintiles, following Engel's law. Lower income households spend a higher percentage on Food-at-Home compared to higher income households. Food-Away-from-Home budget shares do not fully comply with Engel's law, declining until the third income quintile before increasing again. The data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) shows that lower-income U.S. households spend a larger share of their food budget on Food-at-Home consumption, making them more susceptible to unexpected retail food price increases. Over time, U.S. households have been increasing their annual food consumption outside of the home, with the portion of the national food budget spent on food consumption away from home steadily rising from 12.7% in 1930 to an estimated 43.2% in 2013. This trend is linked to factors such as increasing disposable income, female participation in the labor force, and more two-earner households. The trend of increased Away-from-Home food consumption in the U.S. is influenced by factors such as per-capita disposable income, rising female labor force participation, more two-earner households, increased advertising by food-service chains, time constraints on household members, smaller household sizes, and the availability of low-cost fast-food options. This shift has implications for consumer responsiveness to price and income changes, as well as household nutrition. Households with living-at-home children rely more on Food-at-Home consumption, making them vulnerable to price variability. The United States has a higher level of social welfare based on food budget shares compared to other countries. Even the lowest 20% of U.S. households spent less than 12% of their budgets on at-home food consumption in 2013, indicating relative well-being in food terms. In 2012, an estimated 14.5% of U.S. households experienced food insecurity, with disrupted eating patterns due to lack of resources. The discussion includes food price inflation analysis from both annual and monthly perspectives, comparing Food-at-Home and Food-Away-from-Home prices. From 1991 through 2006, the All-Food CPI and All-Items CPI showed relative stability with average annual inflation rates of 2.5% and 2.7% respectively. However, in late 2005, economic factors such as the growth of the U.S. biofuels sector and increasing global consumer incomes led to higher market prices for raw agricultural commodities and energy costs. This resulted in accelerated general inflation and food price inflation starting in 2007. In 2007, inflation and food prices accelerated, reaching a peak in 2008. The All-Items CPI hit 3.8%, the highest since 1991, and the All-Food CPI peaked at 5.5%, the highest since 1990. Higher prices reduced effective purchasing power, worsened by the 2008 global financial crisis. Real GDP fell by 0.3% and real DPI per capita by 0.2% in 2008. The sharp rise in prices in the first half of 2008 came to a halt when the financial crisis hit the US and global markets, leading to a severe economic recession in 2009. Real GDP declined by 2.8% in 2009, the sharpest drop since 1946. Consumer purchasing power also decreased sharply, along with household wealth due to lower real estate values, tighter credit, stagnant wages, and rising unemployment. Unemployment is a lagging indicator, moving slowly in response to economic downturns. The U.S. unemployment rate peaked at 9.6% in 2010 due to the economic recession of 2008 and 2009. Retail food prices respond slowly to changes in raw commodity markets. Agricultural commodity prices peaked in early 2008 and declined through 2010. Food processors and retailers are slow to pass on price decreases due to market volatility. Retail food prices were slow to reflect farm-level commodity price declines through 2010, with annual food price inflation peaking at 5.5% in 2008 before falling to 1.8% in 2009 and 0.8% in 2010. Monthly price data show strong inflationary and deflationary cycles since 2008, with prices spiking in 2008 before sharply declining in mid-2009 due to lower raw commodity and energy costs. In 2009, farm prices stabilized, but food price inflation continued to fall to 0.8% in 2010. The All-Items CPI experienced stronger deflationary pressures than the All-Food CPI, widening the disparity between the two indexes. Global economies resumed growth in late 2009 and the U.S. economy saw robust growth in 2010, reversing the deflationary price pattern. Price deflation persisted into 2010, providing some budgetary relief for households with employed members. In late 2010, food prices resumed their upward surge into 2011 due to high unemployment and economic weakness. The unemployment rate peaked at 9.6% in 2010, slowly declining to 8.1% in 2012. The sluggish U.S. and global economies were affected by high unemployment and financial turmoil, leading to declining monthly price inflation data into 2013. In early 2014, there was a slight economic rebound in the U.S. with a mild increase in commodity price inflation. In 2014, there was a mild rebound in commodity price inflation, but other major international economies remained weak. U.S. agricultural exports peaked at record value, but by the end of the year, international market prospects dimmed. Food price rises slowed considerably and turned negative in early 2015. U.S. food price inflation is projected to be in the 2% to 3% range in 2015. Retail food prices have been responding to demand driven by the cyclical nature of economic activity. Since 2005, there have been fluctuations in inflation trends, with periods of upward and downward movements influenced by global market demand for agricultural commodities, energy, transportation, and raw materials. The U.S. and global financial crisis of 2008 led to deflationary price patterns, while improvements in economic conditions in late 2010 resulted in another upward trend. However, inflationary pressure decreased in mid-2011 due to sluggish economic growth and high unemployment. Food price inflation returned in 2014 due to a strengthening U.S. economy, but there was an apparent economic downturn in 2015. The economic downturn in 2015 led to volatile At-Home food prices compared to stable Away-from-Home prices. Both types of monthly price inflation showed a downturn from July 2008 to early 2009, followed by a recovery into 2011. However, At-Home prices started declining in mid-2011 and further in early 2015, while Away-from-Home prices remained stable. Food price inflation is influenced by dynamic forces on the supply side, including costs such as handling, transportation, storage, processing, insurance, financing, and advertising. These costs vary for different retail food products depending on the level of processing and transformation. Food price inflation is influenced by various economic forces such as higher energy costs or increased labor rates, impacting different food categories unequally. Highly processed food products are less affected by farm-level price changes compared to products like eggs, fresh meat, and certain fruits and vegetables. In 2008, at-home food prices saw a 6.4% inflation rate, the highest since 1990, while 2009 and 2010 experienced modest price inflation for most food groups. In 2011, food price inflation increased sharply across most categories, returning to a long-run trend of about 2.5% in 2012. Beef, poultry, and fats/oils prices rose significantly due to high feed costs and a severe drought in 2012. Livestock and poultry populations declined, impacting profit margins but not causing shortages at the retail level. Tight animal product supplies in 2011 and 2012 led to above-average price inflation levels. Feed supplies rebounded in 2013, allowing the hog, poultry, and dairy sectors to expand. In 2014, food prices moderated except for dairy and livestock products, particularly beef which surged at a 12.1% rate. Most commodity prices are expected to remain in the 2% to 3% range in 2015. Monthly price indexes show a general pattern of retail food price movements, with a deflationary move in 2008 followed by a slow upward trend since 2010, flattening since 2012 (except for meat). The price movement of food products since 2012 has varied, with meat showing a continued upward trend into 2015. Highly processed foods tend to adhere to steady price trends, while less-processed retail products like eggs, milk, and fresh fruits and vegetables respond quickly to changes in farm commodity prices and economic conditions. Monthly price indexes for cereals, meats, dairy products, and fruits and vegetables reveal different levels of volatility, with meat prices showing the strongest increase. The dairy price index declined sharply from mid-2008 through 2009 before steadily rising until 2015. The fruit and vegetable price index has shown volatility with deflationary movements in 2007, 2009, 2010, late 2011, and heading into 2015. Animal product prices declined between 2008 and 2010 before rising steadily. Beef and pork prices have been strong since early 2010, with pork prices dipping in 2012-2013. Low cattle populations are expected to support beef prices through 2015, while the hog sector expanded rapidly in 2013 and 2014. The dairy price index declined sharply from mid-2008 through 2009 before steadily rising until 2015. Poultry prices have been stable and increased since late 2010, influenced by high beef prices. Egg prices experienced deflation from mid-2008 to 2009, then steadily rose due to stronger production and economic growth. Beef prices are expected to remain strong due to low cattle populations, while the hog sector's rapid expansion has led to lower prices. Fresh milk prices saw deflation from mid-2008 to late 2009 due to tight supplies and high feed costs, followed by increased supplies and decreased demand. The dairy sector slowed down in 2012 and 2013 but surged in 2014 with the overall economy. The dairy index closely mirrors the cheese index, which is a significant factor in dairy price formation. Processed ice cream prices remained stable, reflecting economic conditions, while processed fruits and vegetables prices followed general economic trends. Fresh fruit and vegetable prices showed more volatility, influenced by various factors. The ongoing drought in California is likely to impact the state's agricultural production, affecting U.S. supplies and prices of fruit, vegetables, tree nuts, and dairy products. USDA projects a 2% to 3% increase in fruit and vegetable prices in 2015, with fresh fruits expected to rise by 2.5% to 3.5%.Processed snacks, sugar, sweets, and fats prices follow general economic conditions. The prepared-food group and carbonated beverages prices are influenced by consumer demand and the economy. Coffee prices are volatile due to international supply and demand. Rising food prices impact lower-income consumers more severely, forcing difficult budgetary tradeoffs. The U.S. has programs to help consumers meet food and nutrition needs during tough times. The United States provides domestic and international food assistance programs to help consumers during economic downturns and famine. These programs are influenced by food price inflation, impacting purchasing power for households. Income adjustments for inflation may have a time lag, affecting households differently. The U.S. Department of Agriculture administers food and nutrition programs for low-income households, schoolchildren, and vulnerable groups. Expenditures for these programs have tripled since FY2000, providing a nutritional safety net. Expenditures for food and nutrition assistance programs have more than tripled since FY2000, reaching $109.2 billion in FY2013. The main categories of USDA's expenditures include SNAP, school food programs, WIC, Child and Adult Care Food Program, and food distribution programs. Total outlays slightly declined to $103.6 billion in FY2014. The largest federal food and nutrition assistance program is SNAP, which accounted for 73% of spending in FY2014. SNAP provides monthly benefits for eligible participants to buy food at authorized stores. Mandatory spending on these programs increases with food price inflation, leading to higher benefit payments and subsidies. Many programs also have discretionary components that determine annual outlays. The 2008-2009 global economic crisis led to higher participation rates and costs for domestic food aid programs like SNAP, with monthly benefit costs increasing from $2.4 billion in May 2006 to $6.5 billion in November 2012. Unemployment rates remained high, contributing to SNAP participation levels reaching an all-time high of 47.8 million in December 2012. Per-person monthly benefit spending for domestic food assistance programs, including SNAP, increased from $93 to $135.73. SNAP benefits are adjusted annually based on the Thrifty Food Plan, with a three-month lag in reflecting rising food costs. The 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provided additional support for food assistance programs in response to increased food needs and reduced income. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA; P.L. 111-5) provided extra funding for domestic food assistance programs, with SNAP receiving the majority of the funds for increased benefits and administrative costs. However, these benefits were later reduced by other legislation, leading to SNAP benefits returning to basic levels in November 2013. Additionally, federally supported child nutrition programs and initiatives were affected by these cuts. Federal child nutrition programs (including the National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program, Child and Adult Care Food Program, and Summer Food Service Program) reach over 30 million children annually with nearly $20 billion in federal spending in FY2014. The goals are to improve children's nutrition, increase access to nutritious meals for lower-income children, and support the agricultural economy through indexed payments for meals and snacks served to children. Commodity support is also indexed annually based on food price changes. The WIC program is funded from discretionary sources and spending depends on annual appropriations. In FY2014, $6.2 billion was spent on WIC, with $4.3 billion on food costs and $1.9 billion on nutrition service and administrative costs. The average monthly food cost per participant was $43.65, and WIC vouchers are redeemable at the retailer's prices for specific food items. The value of benefits is not indexed to inflation, but reflects food price changes without a time lag. The WIC program provides highly specific food vouchers with a focus on dairy items and infant formula. The cost of vouchers has varied due to changes in food prices, ranging from $33.06 to $46.69 per participant monthly. Congress is willing to appropriate necessary funds for increased participation or food costs. The USDA operates various food assistance programs targeting low-income or vulnerable populations, such as TEFAP, meal service programs under the Older Americans Act, CSFP, and SFMNP. These programs provide key food assistance support for different groups, including infants, children, pregnant women, seniors, and low-income individuals. Rising need and higher food prices have put pressure on these discretionary programs. USDA's international food and nutritional assistance programs are funded by discretionary appropriations, primarily under the Food for Peace Act. Average annual spending on these programs has been around $2.6 billion since FY2006. Rising food prices and energy costs have increased pressure on appropriators to add to federal funding for food aid, affecting the purchase power of U.S. agricultural commodities for foreign countries. Higher energy costs increase shipping costs for food aid to foreign countries, limiting budgetary purchase power. Foreign food aid lacks an escalation clause to adjust for changing costs and has delivery requirements vulnerable to price inflation. The Cargo Preference Act mandates that 50% of U.S. food aid shipments use U.S.-flag vessels, leading to higher freight rates. There is growing interest in addressing these issues from the Administration, Congress, and the international development community. The international development community and some Members of Congress are advocating for the United States to switch its food assistance program from in-kind to cash. This change would help avoid the costly effects of domestic food price inflation on the food aid budget and eliminate the need to ship aid on expensive U.S.-flagged vessels."
