    "content": "The \"Child Support Enforcement Act of 2005\" ensures the right to receive child support payments and the obligation to pay child support. It also introduces a refundable credit for unpaid child support payments in the Internal Revenue Code. The \"Child Support Enforcement Act of 2005\" introduces a tax credit for custodial parents owed child support. Unpaid child support can be credited against the tax owed for the year. Subsequent payments of child support are not taxable income for the custodial parent and cannot be deducted by the delinquent debtor. No amended returns are required for subsequent payments. The IRS requires custodial parents to provide the name, age, and TIN of the qualifying child on their tax return to claim the child support tax credit. The Secretary may prescribe alternative methods for providing this information. Additionally, Form 1099-CS must be completed and provided to the IRS and the delinquent debtor within 45 days after the end of the taxable year to claim the credit. The Form 1099-CS must contain the total amount of child support owed, unpaid child support as of the last day of the taxable year, delinquent debtor's information, and notice to include unpaid child support in gross income. If the debtor's address is unknown, alternative methods may be prescribed by the Secretary. The Form 1099-CS must include the total amount of child support owed, unpaid child support as of the last day of the taxable year, delinquent debtor's information, and notice to include unpaid child support in gross income. The Secretary may send notice if the address is available, and child support is considered paid if recorded by the State office of child support enforcement. Late payments received after the custodial parent's taxable year are still considered timely. The custodial parent's taxable year is considered paid if the postmark date falls on or before the last day of the year. Unpaid child support is defined as child support payable during the taxable year and unpaid as of the last day, equal to or exceeding half of the total amount due. Child support includes periodic fixed payments or medical education expenses. The term 'child support' includes payments for medical education expenses, insurance premiums, or similar items required to be paid to a custodial parent under a support instrument for the support of a qualifying child. A custodial parent is defined as an individual entitled to receive child support. A delinquent debtor is a taxpayer who owes unpaid child support to a custodial parent. The term 'qualifying child' refers to a child of a custodial parent for whom a dependent deduction is allowed under section 151. A 'support instrument' includes a divorce decree, separation agreement, or court order mandating support payments for a parent's child. The text chunk discusses amendments to section 1324(b) of title 31, United States Code, and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 related to qualifying children and support instruments. Section 36 addresses unpaid child support, with amendments applying to taxable years starting after December 31, 2005. Section 4 involves the inclusion in income of unpaid child support amounts. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new subsection (h) regarding unpaid child support. Any unpaid child support of a delinquent debtor for a taxable year is treated as gross income. Child support is considered paid if recorded by the State office of child support enforcement where the custodial parent is registered. Child support received by the State office is treated as paid if the postmark date is on or before the last day of the custodial parent's taxable year. Definitions include periodic payments and medical expenses. Child support is an expense paid to a custodial parent for the support of a qualifying child. The custodial parent is entitled to receive child support and has registered with the state office of child support enforcement. Delinquent debtor refers to an individual who has not paid child support. The terms defined in the Security Act include 'delinquent debtor' as a taxpayer who owes unpaid child support to a custodial parent, 'qualifying child' as a child for whom a dependent deduction is allowable, and 'support instrument' as a legal document related to divorce or separation. The term 'unpaid child support' refers to payments owed by a parent for the support of their child, which must be one-half or more of the total amount due by the end of the taxable year. These unpaid amounts are not considered as income for tax purposes under certain laws. The term 'unpaid child support' does not count as income for tax purposes under certain laws. The IRS cannot use discrepancies in child support payments between tax returns of a custodial parent and a delinquent debtor to select an individual's tax return for audit. The amendments in the Act apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2004, with the Secretary of the Treasury required to publish necessary regulations within 90 days of the Act's enactment."
