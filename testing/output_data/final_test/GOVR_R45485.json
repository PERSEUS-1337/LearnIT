Factors affecting 5G deployment include international standards, spectrum management, availability of equipment, and installation of small cells. Developing standards is crucial for technology companies to bring products to market faster and reduce costs. The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and the United Nations International Telecommunications Union (ITU) are key organizations working on 5G technology standards. 3GPP, with over 370 members, collaborates on technical specifications for mobile communications, including 5G. They approved two 5G technical specifications in 2018. In 2017, 3GPP approved the \"Non-Standalone version of the New Radio standard\" for 5G, enhancing mobile broadband. In June 2018, they completed the \"Stand-Alone version of the New Radio standard\" for independent 5G deployment with advanced IoT support. These specifications are crucial for designing and deploying 5G networks and equipment, with plans to submit them to the ITU in June 2019 for global standardization. 3GPP is the major standards contributor for 5G technology, with specifications expected to be finalized in 2019. Advanced 5G functions are not expected until 2020 or later. China previously adopted its own standards for 3G technologies, which were not globally accepted. By participating in standards development organizations (SDOs), companies can shape standards to align with their product specifications, gaining a competitive advantage in bringing products to market. Industry efforts to participate in standards development are supported by many countries, promoting investment, revenues, and job creation. China's involvement in 5G technology standards is significant. China's involvement in 5G technology standards is significant as it plays a cooperative role in standards development, leading to potential dominance in the global 5G market. China supports the 5G Stand-Alone standard, which would require operators to rebuild core networks and buy new equipment, aligning with its focus on advanced IoT devices. However, SDO members also support the Non-Stand-Alone standard, allowing network operators to leverage their existing 4G networks for 5G deployment. China supports the 5G Stand-Alone standard, requiring operators to rebuild core networks for advanced IoT devices. SDO members also back the Non-Stand-Alone standard, allowing 4G networks to be leveraged for 5G deployment. Some companies and countries have already started 5G plans and services before final specifications were approved, posing risks of last-minute upgrades. Companies need 5G phones for mobile technologies, leading to delays in network deployment. Most major carriers in leading countries announced launch dates for mobile 5G services within months of each other, with South Korea, T-Mobile, Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, and China Mobile all planning to roll out 5G services in 2019. Approval of technical specifications is crucial for the race to 5G, allowing technology companies to manufacture equipment and devices, and telecommunication companies to build out networks. The deployment of 5G services is driven by the availability of equipment and spectrum. Spectrum refers to radio frequencies used for communication, managed by agencies like the FCC and NTIA in the US. Companies deploy infrastructure to enable communication on assigned frequencies. In 2008, U.S. spectrum allocations were outlined for various communications and wireless uses. Most mobile devices operate below 6 GHz for better coverage and building penetration. However, increased usage has led to congestion, resulting in slower speeds and dropped calls. Companies are now exploring new spectrum bands between 30 GHz and 300 GHz to support mobile communications. Industry researchers have identified millimeter waves (MMW) between 30 GHz and 300 GHz for mobile communications, offering greater bandwidth and increased speeds. To overcome limitations such as shorter wave travel distance and absorption by obstacles, researchers propose using small cells placed close together to relay waves across longer distances. Telecommunications equipment is designed to function on specific frequencies, with 5G leveraging multiple spectrum bands. 5G technology utilizes low-band, mid-band, and high-band spectrum for various benefits. Deployment in high-band spectrum provides ultra-fast services in high-density areas, mid-band spectrum offers improved capacity and coverage, while low-band spectrum enables widespread coverage for IoT applications. Delays in spectrum allocation can hinder deployments and put countries at a disadvantage in technology markets. Countries are working to identify spectrum in all three bands and harmonize frequencies to reduce costs and create economies of scale. Companies worldwide are seeking common spectrum for 5G deployment to reduce costs, promote compatibility, and optimize resources. Harmonized global spectrum is crucial for achieving economies of scale and rapid adoption. Flexibility in frequency ranges allows for accommodating existing users, such as military agencies.

Stakeholders agree on the need for spectrum in three key frequency ranges: sub-1 GHz for widespread coverage, 1-6 GHz for additional capacity, and above 6 GHz for ultra-high broadband speeds. The FCC has previously auctioned spectrum for telecommunication providers. The FCC has auctioned spectrum for 5G, with telecommunication providers holding substantial spectrum in various bands. T-Mobile and Verizon are deploying 5G using their respective spectrum bands. Congress passed the RAY BAUM'S Act and MOBILE NOW Act to identify additional spectrum for 5G. The FCC initiated an auction of the 28 GHz band in 2018. The FCC has auctioned high-band spectrum for 5G, with plans for more auctions. They have released almost 5 GHz of high-band spectrum for 5G and are ahead of China in high-band spectrum allocation. The FCC is also looking into mid-band spectrum for 5G use, including sharing with educational, satellite, and federal users. They are working with the NTIA to repurpose federal mid-band spectrum for commercial 5G use. The FCC is working to free up spectrum for 5G use, including low band (600 MHz) and targeted changes for 800 MHz and 900 MHz bands. Additional spectrum for unlicensed use is also being identified. The United States' spectrum allocation process is complex and time-consuming, requiring rulemaking, auctions, and relocation. Industry advocates are urging policymakers to expedite spectrum availability and coordinate auctions for faster deployment. The Trump Administration has focused on 5G planning, holding a \"5G Summit\" in September 2018 to discuss policies for faster deployment. President Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum for a National Spectrum Strategy to support 5G deployment through incentives and reduced regulations. U.S. telecom executives are advocating for more mid-band spectrum. Some policymakers call for additional spectrum and reduced regulations to accelerate 5G deployment. South Korea completed auctions for high-band and mid-band spectrum in 2018, allowing operators to use 5G frequencies by December. China began using 5G frequencies in December 2018 in preparation for the launch of mobile 5G in March 2019. The country reserved spectrum for 5G in 2017 and sought public input on the use of mid-band and millimeter wave spectrum. China has an advantage in freeing spectrum for 5G due to stronger control over existing users and streamlined regulatory processes. In December 2018, China allocated mid-band spectrum to state-owned mobile operators, paving the way for large-scale networks. China allocated spectrum to state-owned mobile operators, preparing for large-scale networks testing in 2019 and commercial 5G services by 2020. U.S. equipment manufacturers are developing 5G equipment and devices, with Qualcomm aiming to launch 5G data-only devices by the end of 2018 and smartphones in the first half of 2019. American companies are supplying 5G technologies to other countries, including China. Intel is collaborating with Chinese telecom providers, while other technology suppliers are supporting U.S. deployments. T-Mobile signed a $3.5 billion agreement with Ericsson for 5G support. Most device makers plan to release 5G phones in 2019. Verizon and AT&T have launched 5G networks but do not offer access on smartphones yet. 5G devices are in production and expected to be available in 2019. Providers are planning to launch 5G services after the release of 5G devices. Verizon and AT&T will launch new Samsung 5G devices in the first half of 2019, and LG is also expected to release a 5G smartphone. LG announced its 5G smartphone will be available in the first half of 2019 as a Sprint exclusive. Experts caution that initial 5G phones may be carrier exclusive due to different spectrum bands. The telecommunications industry relies on global partnerships for 5G deployment, with device availability driving adoption and revenues for providers. The availability of equipment and devices is crucial for the race to 5G deployment. Different bands of spectrum are utilized, with low- to mid-band spectrum enhancing existing 4G networks, while higher bands require a denser network of small cells for signal relay over shorter distances and around obstacles. Small cell nodes, ranging from 10 meters to two kilometers, are smaller than macro cell towers and can be installed on existing structures like buildings or poles. They require a power source, backhaul connection, and permits for operation. In areas without existing infrastructure, new poles with power and backhaul connections are needed for installation. In the United States, constructing new wireless towers or attaching equipment to pre-existing structures generally requires approval from federal, state, or local governmental bodies. The FCC has rules to ensure access to communication services and guide approval processes, including regulating pole attachments and prohibiting entities from restricting telecommunications services. State and local entities have authority to manage rights-of-way and charge fees for access. 5G small cell installation has raised concerns. The FCC approved new rules to facilitate 5G wireless infrastructure deployment, addressing concerns over local regulations and approvals that add time and cost to deployment. Industry executives claim these regulations put U.S. carriers at a disadvantage. Local governments and residents have raised concerns about rights-of-way management, fees, and the impact of small cells on property values and health. The FCC declared that state and local regulations should not prohibit wireless infrastructure deployment, set guidelines for reasonable fees for 5G deployments, and established shot clocks for small wireless facilities. The FCC established new shot clocks for small wireless facilities, requiring localities to make decisions within 60 days for collocation and 90 days for new builds. State and local government authorizations for wireless infrastructure deployment are subject to these shot clocks. Failure to act within the new shot clocks can result in a prohibition on telecommunication services. These regulations aim to speed up 5G deployment and encourage private sector investment. The FCC's new rules aim to speed up 5G deployment and encourage private sector investment, giving the US an advantage in the global race for 5G dominance. FCC Commissioner Carr highlighted the competition with China in deploying 5G infrastructure. Industry officials praised the FCC's rules for 5G deployment, citing reduced government red tape. High fees and long approval processes were noted to hinder infrastructure deployment and investment in communities. FCC Commissioner Rosenworcel criticized the rules as federal overreach, potentially slowing down 5G progress. The FCC's ruling in San Jose, CA led to 4,000 small cells on city-owned light poles and $500 million of private investment for broadband deployment. Local governments opposed the ruling, stating it exceeds FCC's authority and hinders their ability to manage public property and safety. The National Association of Counties and the National League of Cities criticized the impractical actions, transferring public resources to private companies without guaranteeing public benefit. The FCC's small cell rules went into effect on January 14, 2019, and are being challenged in federal court. The FCC's small cell rules, which went into effect on January 14, 2019, are being challenged in federal court. Small cell siting is a key issue in U.S. 5G deployment, with conflicting interests between advancing 5G technologies and protecting public safety and equal access. Policies enabling U.S. companies to deploy 5G infrastructure and allowing state and local entities to manage small cell placement could accelerate 5G deployment and bring broader consumer and economic benefits. The Trump Administration's National Security Strategy emphasizes rejuvenating domestic economic competitiveness as crucial for U.S. national security. The Trump Administration prioritized enhancing American infrastructure, including deploying secure 5G nationwide, to boost domestic economic competitiveness as a pillar of U.S. national security. Concerns over 5G technology focus on market diversity risks and vulnerability to foreign intelligence services, as highlighted by Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats in a Senate hearing. ICT technologies will test U.S. competitiveness as global suppliers develop new technologies like 5G, IoT, financial tech, AI, and big data. Differences in regulatory approaches could hinder growth. Concerns arise over Chinese companies like ZTE and Huawei investing in 5G, raising questions about China's dominance in network development. FBI Director Christopher Wray has expressed concerns about the risks of Chinese-made or designed devices and 5G network equipment being integrated into the US telecommunications network, citing potential threats to national security and the risk of foreign influence over critical infrastructure. The Chinese intelligence services could exploit Huawei or ZTE's 5G equipment for espionage due to legal leverage and unfettered access to networks. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence investigated the national security threats posed by Huawei and ZTE, highlighting the potential security risks associated with Chinese telecommunications companies linked to the Chinese government or military. The report warned of economic and foreign espionage opportunities if these companies are influenced by the state or provide access to telecommunication networks for Chinese intelligence services. The committee made recommendations for the intelligence community to remain vigilant against these threats. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence investigated national security threats posed by Chinese telecommunications companies like Huawei and ZTE, emphasizing risks associated with their links to the Chinese government or military. Recommendations included the intelligence community focusing on the threat of Chinese companies penetrating the U.S. telecommunications market and CFIUS blocking acquisitions involving Huawei and ZTE. In a specific case, CFIUS blocked Broadcom's takeover of Qualcomm due to national security concerns. The U.S. has national security concerns about Huawei and other Chinese telecom companies dominating 5G, leading to negative consequences. The NDAA prohibits federal agencies from using equipment from Huawei and ZTE due to security threats. Criminal charges have been filed against Huawei. There are worries about 5G networks being exploited by foreign intelligence services. The potential exploitation of 5G technology by foreign intelligence services includes manipulating perceptions, overloading with irrelevant information, spreading misinformation, and exploiting personal information. This could lead to confusion, division among Americans, and misperception of reality. The expansion of personal information available for exploitation with 5G technology raises concerns among privacy advocates and national security professionals. There are challenges for U.S. intelligence, military, and diplomatic communities in interacting with foreign nationals due to security threats. Some analysts argue that discouraging Chinese investment in the U.S. may be counterproductive and could encourage China to create national standards in 5G technology. The critics argue that security measures could lead China to establish technical barriers to trade, impacting U.S. national security. They warn that Trump's trade policy, including tariffs on Chinese telecom equipment, may hinder 5G innovation and increase costs. Fencing off the U.S. tech sector from China could benefit Chinese competitors, raise costs for consumers, and reduce U.S. tech companies' competitiveness. Policymakers must address promoting U.S. competitiveness while considering these challenges. Congress may need to consider the federal government's role in promoting U.S. competitiveness in the global race to 5G and efficient domestic deployment. Monitoring progress on 5G deployment, planning, and coordination with industry may be necessary to keep up with other countries' centralized approaches. In terms of domestic deployment, Congress may need to consider the benefits and risks of 5G technologies, including national security and privacy concerns. Policies to protect U.S. telecommunications networks and limit foreign participation in 5G build-outs may be considered to address threats to national security. Congress may need to consider the benefits and risks of 5G technologies, including national security, privacy concerns, and trade policies affecting U.S. companies. Localities have raised concerns about the siting of 5G small cells, while stakeholders have differing views on government support for deployment. Congress may need to weigh these competing interests and concerns, as well as allocate additional spectrum for 5G technologies. Congress may need to consider policies for allocating additional spectrum for future 5G use, including the spectrum needs of essential users and advanced technologies. Privacy and security policies for data transmitted through IoT devices and 5G networks should also be considered to ensure U.S. leadership in these technologies. To maintain U.S. leadership in telecommunications technologies, Congress may need to support investment in research and development of new technologies like IoT applications and 6G. Global standards for 5G supply chains should be assessed to enhance network security. Deployment of 5G is just beginning, with countries competing to be first to market. The U.S. is striving to lead in 5G technologies, with private industry leading deployment efforts. The government supports deployment by allocating spectrum and streamlining rules. However, challenges like complex spectrum allocation and local resistance may hinder deployment. Policy decisions made now could impact the U.S. position in the race to 5G. Deployment of 5G technologies is expected to continue through 2035. The 115th Congress enacted legislation related to 5G spectrum, including the RAY BAUM'S Act of 2018 and the MOBILE NOW Act. These laws aim to improve and accelerate the spectrum auction process and require federal agencies to make decisions on wireless infrastructure applications. These policy decisions could impact the U.S. position in the race to 5G. The 115th Congress considered legislation to allocate additional spectrum for mobile communications and expand wireless services in rural areas through the Advancing Innovation and Reinvigorating Widespread Access to Viable Electromagnetic Spectrum (AIRWAVES) Act (S. 1682). This act aimed to create a national pipeline of spectrum for commercial use and incentivize industry to expand wireless services. The bill aimed to allocate additional spectrum for commercial licensed and unlicensed use, including 5G, with 10% of proceeds going towards expanding wireless infrastructure in rural areas. It was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, but no further action was taken. Related bills were introduced in the House, but also saw no further action. Resolutions in support of 5G technologies and services were introduced in 2017. Legislation was introduced to address challenges in small site deployment and cybersecurity issues, aiming to promote economic development and digital innovation in the United States. The Streamlining the Rapid Evolution and Modernization of Leading-edge Infrastructure Necessary to Enhance (STREAMLINE) Small Cell Deployment Act (S. 3157) set criteria for state and local review of cell siting applications, but no further action was taken on the bill. Four bills addressing cybersecurity issues were introduced, including the Securing IoT Act of 2017 (H.R. 1324) and the SMART IoT Act (H.R. 6032). The Interagency Cybersecurity Cooperation Act (H.R. 1340) aimed to require the FCC to take action on cybersecurity. The Cooperation Act (H.R. 1340) introduced in 2017 aimed to create an interagency committee to address security reports in telecommunications and define communications networks as critical infrastructure. The Cyber Security Responsibility Act (H.R. 1335) would have required rules for securing communications networks. Congress also addressed national security concerns. Congress addressed national security concerns related to telecommunications by enacting the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2019, which prohibited federal agencies from procuring telecommunications equipment from certain Chinese companies. Hearings during the 115th Congress discussed 5G and related topics, including spectrum needs and rural broadband challenges. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Subcommittee on Communications and Technology held hearings on various topics including oversight of the Federal Communications Commission, the race to 5G, and cybersecurity of the Internet of Things."
