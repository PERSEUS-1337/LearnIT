The NPT is crucial for international nuclear nonproliferation efforts, and the upcoming conference is seen as having significant implications for the future. The success of past review conferences has varied, with the 2010 conference being a critical opportunity to strengthen the treaty and address concerns about nuclear proliferation. The Obama Administration has highlighted the importance of the NPT in nonproliferation efforts. The Obama Administration views the NPT as central to nonproliferation efforts and aims to strengthen the treaty by linking arms control and disarmament policies. Progress on arms control is seen as crucial for gaining international support to reinforce non-proliferation measures. Lack of progress on disarmament has been a concern for NPT states without nuclear weapons, hindering further tightening of nonproliferation rules. The Obama Administration aims to strengthen the NPT by linking arms control and disarmament policies to garner international support. The 2010 NPT Review Conference will test the Administration's ability to strengthen the nonproliferation regime. The NPT, in force since 1970 and extended indefinitely in 1995, is complemented by various measures such as IAEA safeguards, national export control laws, and UN Security Council resolutions. Key issues likely to be addressed at the conference include arms control, disarmament, and nonproliferation measures. The NPT recognizes five nuclear-weapon states and has 189 member countries. India, Israel, and Pakistan have not signed the treaty and possess nuclear weapons. North Korea withdrew from the NPT in 2003. Several countries suspended their nuclear weapons programs and joined the NPT in the 1990s. Iraq and Libya are now in compliance with the NPT after dismantling their nuclear weapons programs. Iran was found in noncompliance in 2005. The NPT has three key dimensions: nuclear nonproliferation, nuclear disarmament, and peaceful use of nuclear energy. Non-nuclear-weapon states pledge not to acquire nuclear weapons in exchange for access to nuclear technology. Nuclear-weapon states commit to negotiations for disarmament. Syria has not fully cooperated with an investigation into its nuclear activities. The NPT requires non-nuclear-weapon states to declare and submit nuclear materials for IAEA inspections to prevent diversion to military use. The IAEA also supports peaceful nuclear technology applications. Recent events like the A.Q. Khan network, India and Pakistan's arsenals, North Korea's tests, Iran's defiance, and Syria's nuclear program have challenged the nonproliferation regime. The future of the regime is uncertain due to various factors such as increased interest in nuclear power, demands on IAEA safeguards resources, efforts to interdict WMD transfers, and US-Russia nuclear arsenal reduction. The 2010 NPT Review Conference is seen as a crucial test for the treaty's evolution to meet new challenges, with the US playing a key role in nonproliferation efforts. The Obama Administration has prioritized nuclear nonproliferation in its foreign policy, with President Obama chairing a UN Security Council Summit in 2009 focusing on this issue. Security Council Resolution 1887 was adopted unanimously to strengthen the NPT and related measures. The US is the largest contributor to the IAEA. U.S. leadership in nuclear nonproliferation is crucial, as highlighted by the Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States. The upcoming 2010 NPT Review Conference aims to strengthen all three pillars of the NPT, with U.S. priorities outlined by Ambassador Susan Burk. The U.S. priorities for the 2010 NPT Review Conference include addressing noncompliance, preventing abuse of withdrawal provisions, garnering resources for the IAEA, and improving safeguards. The Obama Administration emphasizes the responsibility of all states in strengthening the nonproliferation regime. Ambassador Burk aims for the conference to provide momentum for disarmament efforts. The 2010 NPT Review Conference aims to strengthen the nonproliferation regime, with a focus on compliance measures and addressing Iranian non-compliance with NPT requirements. The U.S. emphasizes the need for Iran's agreement for a consensus document to be adopted, but some are skeptical due to potential Iranian objections. NPT Member States are to review the Treaty's operation every five years. The NPT Review Conference, as required by Article VIII of the Treaty, is the eighth meeting to review implementation every five years since 1970. Consensus final declarations were adopted in previous conferences, with some exceptions due to disagreements between non-aligned movement states and nuclear-weapon states. Adoption of a final document is not required, nor is it necessary to be adopted by consensus. The NPT Review Conferences, held every five years since 1970, aim to review implementation of the treaty. The 1995 conference led to the indefinite extension of the NPT and established PrepComs for recommendations. Main Committees focus on nonproliferation, disarmament, safeguards compliance, and peaceful use of nuclear energy. Subsidiary bodies within each Main Committee address specific issues. In 1995, NPT members approved the indefinite extension of the treaty and adopted decisions to strengthen the review process, outline nonproliferation and disarmament steps, and promote universality. A Resolution supporting a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East was crucial in gaining support from non-nuclear-weapon states like Indonesia, Mexico, and Egypt. The 1995 NPT Review Conference approved the indefinite extension of the treaty and outlined nonproliferation and disarmament steps. At the 2000 Review Conference, two main blocs negotiated \"13 Practical Steps\" to reduce nuclear weapons. The 2000 Review Conference addressed treaty compliance questions in Iraq and North Korea, condemned the 1998 nuclear tests by India and Pakistan, and reached agreement on language regarding disarmament. The 2005 Review Conference did not reach consensus due to issues with Iranian noncompliance and Egypt's stance on Middle East Nuclear-Weapon-Free zone. The Bush Administration's position on the \"13 Steps\" agreed to in 2000 was also a point of contention. The 2010 NPT Review Conference, scheduled from May 3 to 28 at the United Nations in New York, will be led by Ambassador Libran Cabactulan of the Philippines. The skepticism of non-nuclear-weapon states towards the commitment of weapon states to the treaty persists, despite progress made by the Obama Administration on arms reductions. The NPT does not have its own Secretariat, but UN staff support the meeting. The PrepCom agreed on an agenda for the upcoming NPT Review Conference, discussing the establishment of subsidiary bodies on nuclear disarmament, regional issues, and treaty withdrawal. Key controversies for U.S. policy makers include disarmament, nonproliferation, and peaceful use of nuclear energy, with a focus on non-NPT parties and a weapons-free zone in the Middle East. The Nuclear Suppliers Group's 2008 decision exempted India from certain guidelines, raising concerns about fairness in nonproliferation demands. Article VI of the NPT outlines disarmament obligations for treaty parties. The Nuclear Suppliers Group exempted India from guidelines in 2008, sparking concerns about fairness in nonproliferation demands. Article VI of the NPT outlines disarmament obligations for treaty parties, which have been a point of contention over the years. The United States, for example, has not ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) despite past agreements on its importance in meeting Article VI obligations. The United States and Soviet Union have taken steps to reduce nonstrategic nuclear weapons, seen as effective measures to cease the arms race. However, some question if more should be done for disarmament. Calls have been made for a new treaty to replace the 1991 START Treaty and for reductions in deployed nuclear weapons. Compliance with Article VI of the NPT is linked to reductions in deployed and stored nuclear weapons. The 1991 START Treaty expired in 2009, leading to the signing of a new treaty between the United States and Russia in 2010. President Obama emphasized the importance of upholding commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and expressed support for further reductions in both strategic and tactical nuclear weapons. He also pledged to work towards the eventual elimination of all nuclear weapons. Some parties have criticized the U.S. for undermining nonproliferation goals and disarmament objectives. The Bush Administration's Nuclear Posture Review in 2002 proposed new programs that could lead to the development of new nuclear weapons and invested heavily in the U.S. nuclear weapons infrastructure. Critics argued that the administration increased U.S. reliance on nuclear weapons by threatening their use in response to chemical or biological attacks. The Obama Administration addressed these concerns in its Nuclear Posture Review, highlighting nuclear proliferation and terrorism as primary security threats and adjusting the nuclear posture accordingly. The Obama Administration adjusted the U.S. nuclear posture by pledging not to design or develop new nuclear weapons and reaffirming the negative security assurance. They stated that the U.S. will not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapons states that are party to the NPT and in compliance with their obligations. This revised assurance aims to strengthen the NPT and persuade non-nuclear-weapon states to comply with it. The Obama Administration adjusted the U.S. nuclear posture by pledging not to design or develop new nuclear weapons and reaffirming the negative security assurance. This new assurance aims to strengthen the NPT and reduce the role of nuclear weapons in U.S. national security strategy. The nuclear-weapon states are moving towards nuclear disarmament by banning future nuclear testing, which fulfills disarmament and nonproliferation goals. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) is considered part of implementing Article VI commitments under the NPT. Three of the five NPT nuclear-weapon states have ratified the CTBT. Three of the five NPT nuclear-weapon states (Britain, France, and Russia) have ratified the CTBT, while China and the United States have not. The Obama Administration supports CTBT ratification, a change from the previous U.S. policy under President George W. Bush. The NPR released in April 2010 states that the U.S. will not conduct nuclear testing and will pursue ratification of the CTBT to encourage other states to do the same. International community sees U.S. ratification of the CTBT as crucial for compliance with Article VI. The international community views U.S. ratification of the CTBT as crucial for compliance with Article VI, with potential positive ramifications for arms control and disarmament. Analysts believe that U.S. ratification could persuade other countries to support nonproliferation measures and pressure states outside the regime. However, it remains unclear which specific steps other nations would support only if the U.S. ratifies the CTBT. The United States has taken steps towards nuclear disarmament and proposed a ban on fissile material production over 50 years ago. The FMCT has been endorsed by past NPT review conferences and remains on the negotiating agenda at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. The FMCT has been endorsed by past NPT review conferences and remains on the negotiating agenda at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. The Bush Administration supported a ban on fissile material production for weapons but argued it is unverifiable. The Obama Administration supports negotiating an FMCT with verification measures. Pakistan's opposition is currently blocking the start of FMCT negotiations. The NPT review conference is likely to repeat calls to start negotiations on a verifiable treaty soon. The FMCT, like the CTBT, is seen as beneficial for disarmament and nonproliferation. The potential inclusion of non-NPT nuclear-weapon states in a major disarmament measure is debated, particularly regarding the disposal of existing fissile material stocks. The United States opposes this approach, while some non-nuclear-weapon states support it. Non-NPT states must have comprehensive safeguards agreements with the IAEA to verify compliance with nuclear material use for peaceful purposes and prevent diversion to weapons. Comprehensive safeguards enable the IAEA to detect any such diversion. The IAEA uses safeguards to detect diversion of nuclear material for weapons purposes and undeclared nuclear activities. Inspections are limited to declared facilities, but Additional Protocols increase authority to investigate clandestine facilities. NPT articles require compliance with safeguards agreements and prohibit non-nuclear-weapon states from acquiring nuclear weapons. The IAEA ensures compliance with safeguards agreements and prohibits non-nuclear-weapon states from acquiring nuclear weapons. If noncompliance is found, the IAEA reports to the UN General Assembly and Security Council for action. The IAEA ensures compliance with safeguards agreements and prohibits non-nuclear-weapon states from acquiring nuclear weapons. If noncompliance is found, the agency's Director-General reports to the IAEA Board of Governors, who then call upon the recipient State to remedy any non-compliance. Past cases of noncompliance have been resolved by the IAEA, such as monitoring Iraq and Libya's nuclear programs and verifying the dismantling of South Africa's nuclear weapons program. The IAEA reported concerns about undeclared nuclear activities in Egypt and South Korea, but no determination of non-compliance was made by the Board of Governors. South Korea resolved questions with full cooperation, confirming no undeclared nuclear activities. Egypt, although cooperative, does not have an Additional Protocol in force. The IAEA has raised concerns about undeclared nuclear activities in Egypt due to the absence of an Additional Protocol. Noncompliance issues have been identified in Iran, North Korea, and Syria, with unresolved concerns in Iran and ongoing noncompliance in North Korea. Syria is urged to cooperate with the IAEA's investigation into possible nuclear activities. Governors have not found Syria to be in noncompliance with its safeguards agreement. Some NPT states parties, including the United States, may address concerns by calling for the conclusion of safeguards agreements and Additional Protocols. Resolution 1887 urges states without comprehensive safeguards agreements to conclude them immediately and implement additional protocols. Concerns have been raised about potential NPT withdrawals after North Korea's 2003 announcement, although its withdrawal is not formally recognized. Several countries have proposed ways to address the issue of withdrawal from the NPT, without amending the treaty. UN Security Council Resolution 1887 emphasizes the need to address withdrawal promptly and holds states accountable for treaty violations even after withdrawal. The United States and others aim to establish immediate consequences for countries that withdraw from the NPT without justification. The European Union proposed consequences for countries withdrawing from the NPT, requiring them to return nuclear materials. Nuclear-weapon-free zones reinforce NPT obligations, with regions like Latin America, Central Asia, the South Pacific, Africa, and Southeast Asia having treaties banning nuclear weapons. The Treaty of Antarctica ensures peaceful use of the continent, while international treaties ban nuclear weapons in various regions like Asia, the South Pacific, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Interest in nuclear energy has increased globally, with the US promoting civilian nuclear cooperation cautiously due to proliferation risks. President Obama proposed a new framework for civil nuclear cooperation, including international fuel banks and increased resources for the IAEA. The exemption of India from full-scope IAEA safeguards by the Nuclear Suppliers Group in 2008 has raised concerns about maintaining nuclear weapons capability while accessing peaceful nuclear trade. This issue is likely to be debated at the review conference. The IAEA Technical Cooperation program, funded by the United States, provides peaceful nuclear applications to NPT countries under safeguards. Article IV of the NPT guarantees the right to peaceful use of nuclear energy, sparking debate on whether this right is upheld for states not meeting safeguards obligations. Some argue that states should access peaceful technology only when in full compliance with safeguards obligations. The 2000 NPT Review Conference Final Document states that parties have the right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. UN Security Council Resolution 1887 emphasizes compliance with NPT obligations for enjoying its benefits. Non-nuclear-weapon states believe the right to peaceful nuclear energy should not be affected by unresolved safeguards issues. Technical cooperation programs to Iran continue despite this debate. Some non-nuclear-weapon states, like Brazil, Egypt, Indonesia, Malaysia, and South Africa, are hesitant to accept limitations on access to fuel cycle activities or enhanced safeguards under the Additional Protocol. The NPT allows access to enrichment and reprocessing technologies under IAEA safeguards, but efforts are being made to restrict their spread. These issues are likely to be discussed at the upcoming review conference. The upcoming review conference will likely debate restrictions on the spread of enrichment and reprocessing technology, with the US seeking to limit their military potential. The Nuclear Suppliers Group is negotiating criteria for future transfers, which has faced resistance from developing countries fearing limitations on economic benefits from nuclear energy. The Non-Aligned Movement is critical of potential restrictions on technology transfers and international fuel cycle initiatives. Some developing countries also resist adopting the IAEA Additional Protocol. The debate over access to fuel cycle technology is complicated by Iran's noncompliance with safeguards agreements. Despite this, the majority of states support the IAEA Additional Protocol, with 139 approved and 96 in force. The upcoming NPT review conference will likely focus on universalizing adherence to the Additional Protocol. At the upcoming NPT review conference, discussions will likely include proposals for multilateral solutions to ensure fuel supply, such as a fuel bank under IAEA auspices or multilateral ownership in a uranium enrichment facility. Some non-nuclear-weapon states are skeptical of these proposals, arguing they are unnecessary and could limit future technology acquisition, while others, including the United States, see them as an additional layer of assurance. Some countries, including the United States, support multilateral solutions like a fuel bank or shared ownership of enrichment facilities to enhance nuclear nonproliferation. The NPT Review Conference may address the refusal of India, Israel, and Pakistan to sign the NPT, emphasizing the importance of universal adherence to the treaty. Security Council Resolution 1887 urges non-signatories to join the NPT as non-nuclear-weapon states. The NPT Review Conference may address the refusal of India, Israel, and Pakistan to sign the NPT, emphasizing universal adherence to the treaty. India and Pakistan acknowledge possessing nuclear weapons but claim willingness to pursue nuclear disarmament without joining the NPT. India, Pakistan, and Israel have all refused to sign the NPT and possess nuclear weapons. India stated it would only disarm when other nuclear states do so in a binding framework. Pakistan is unwilling to join the NPT as a non-nuclear-weapon state. Israel, though not officially acknowledging it, is believed to have nuclear weapons. Israeli Prime Minister reiterated their policy of not adhering to the NPT in 2010. The Middle East is urged to establish a verifiable zone free of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. NPT states parties, including nuclear-weapon states, are called upon to cooperate for the early establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region. This concept has been supported by many NPT states parties and has been included in various UN resolutions since 1974. The 2000 conference reaffirmed the importance of the 1995 resolution for establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. However, there has been no significant progress on this issue, as noted in working papers from March 2010 and May 2009. Concerns have been raised that the lack of progress could weaken support for the NPT. The resolution is seen as crucial for extending the NPT indefinitely. The 1995 resolution on establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East is crucial for extending the NPT indefinitely. The Obama Administration supports this resolution and is working with partners to implement concrete measures. Supporters focus on different aspects of nuclear proliferation in the region, including Israel's nuclear program and potential threats from Iran and Syria. The Arms Control Association report highlights differing views on nuclear disarmament in the Middle East. Arab states, Iran, and Non-Aligned States focus on Israel's nuclear status, while the EU, Japan, and the US emphasize general disarmament. Egypt's stance on the 1995 resolution is crucial for the upcoming Review Conference. Egypt's opposition at the 2005 conference was due to dissatisfaction with the lack of progress on the nuclear-weapon-free zone. In April 2010, Egypt emphasized the need for specific measures to implement the zone. Bilateral discussions with the United States have taken place, but no public agreement has been reached. Egypt has submitted proposals, including calling for reaffirmation of the 1995 Resolution and urging Israel to join the NPT as a non-nuclear-weapon state. The NPT resolution calls for an international conference by 2011 to negotiate a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. A standing committee is to monitor progress and prepare for the conference. Countries are urged to disclose information on Israeli nuclear facilities. Russia supports a conference to address all WMD, while the EU has also shown interest. Israel supports a WMD-free zone in the Middle East, emphasizing the need for confidence-building measures and regional reconciliation before negotiations. Sha'ul Horev of Israel's Atomic Energy Commission stated the goal is to establish a verifiable zone free of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems. Israel supports a WMD-free zone in the Middle East, emphasizing the need for confidence-building measures and regional reconciliation before negotiations. The vision requires a fundamental change in regional attitudes towards Israel, with many experts viewing the NPT 2010 Review Conference as an opportunity to renew treaty obligations for both non-nuclear-weapons states and nuclear-weapon states. The pursuit of consensus is debated, with some questioning the value of a consensus outcome that governments barely accept. Countries may be skeptical of new promises at the NPT Review Conference due to unfulfilled pledges from previous conferences. The United States may face a cynical NPT membership, defensive of its right to nuclear energy. Despite progress in the political climate, optimism has waned in the international diplomatic arena. The CTBT has not been submitted to the Senate, and the new START treaty is pending. The CTBT has not been submitted to the Senate, and the new START treaty is pending. More states may take noncompliance by Iran and Syria more seriously following revelations in 2009 about undisclosed nuclear activities. However, reaching a consensus on these issues at the Review Conference may be difficult. Dr. William Potter has expressed concerns about prioritizing consensus over addressing serious proliferation challenges. The Review Conference may address various nuclear proliferation challenges, including DPRK and Iranian nuclear brinkmanship, the Indian and Pakistani nuclear arms race, and the threat of non-state actors and nuclear terrorism. Analysts suggest focusing on forward-looking nonproliferation and disarmament proposals rather than measuring treaty implementation. Recommendations include an action plan to strengthen the NPT and a forward-looking document to regain confidence in the treaty's core bargains. Agreement on proposals like those in UN Security Council Resolution 1887 may be challenging to reach. Ambassador Susan Burk is prepared for a consensus document at the NPT Review Conference to identify areas of agreement on nuclear nonproliferation measures. Some aspects of the regime were discussed at the Global Nuclear Security Summit, but the NPT does not cover nuclear weapons proliferation to non-state actors. Some states suggest including nuclear security issues in NPT discussions. UK Foreign Minister Millibrand proposed that nuclear security become the \"fourth pillar\" of the NPT, while EU nonproliferation representative Annalisa Giannella argued that the NPT's obligation to prevent proliferation implies the obligation to protect nuclear material. IAEA safeguards agreements require physical protection measures at declared facilities, and efforts to detect illicit transfers may be discussed at the Review Conference. Some developing states prefer to address these issues in other fora such as IAEA meetings. Senate Resolution 446, \"Commemorating the 40th Anniversary of the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons,\" was reported out of the Foreign Relations Committee. The Senate Resolution 446, reported out of the Foreign Relations Committee on April 13, 2010, reaffirms support for the NPT, urges universality of the Treaty, calls for the Additional Protocol as the global standard for safeguards, and emphasizes the need for IAEA oversight and enforcement mechanisms. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons aims to prevent nuclear war and emphasizes the importance of averting the danger of proliferation. The curr_chunk emphasizes the need to prevent nuclear war and the proliferation of nuclear weapons through cooperation, safeguards, and support for peaceful applications of nuclear energy. The curr_chunk emphasizes the importance of peaceful applications of nuclear technology and the need for all Parties to the Treaty to have access to scientific information for the development of atomic energy. It also highlights the intention to achieve nuclear disarmament and urges cooperation from all States towards this goal. The curr_chunk emphasizes the commitment to achieving nuclear disarmament and promoting trust between States to facilitate the elimination of nuclear weapons. The Treaty prohibits the transfer of nuclear weapons or control over them to any recipient, and prohibits assisting non-nuclear-weapon States in acquiring such weapons. The Treaty prohibits the transfer of nuclear weapons or control over them to any recipient, and prohibits assisting non-nuclear-weapon States in acquiring such weapons. Non-nuclear-weapon States must accept safeguards for verification of their obligations under the Treaty to prevent diversion of nuclear energy to weapons. The Treaty prohibits the transfer of nuclear weapons or control over them to any recipient and prohibits assisting non-nuclear-weapon States in acquiring such weapons. Non-nuclear-weapon States must accept safeguards for verification of their obligations under the Treaty to prevent diversion of nuclear energy to weapons. Procedures for safeguards on source or special fissionable material in peaceful nuclear activities are required, with restrictions on providing such material or equipment to non-nuclear-weapon States without safeguards. Non-nuclear-weapon States Party to the Treaty must implement safeguards to comply with Article IV and avoid hindering economic or technological development. Agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency are required to meet these obligations within 180 days of the Treaty's entry into force. Negotiation of agreements under the Treaty must start within 180 days of entry into force. For states joining later, negotiations must begin upon depositing their instruments. Agreements should be in force within eighteen months of negotiation initiation. The Treaty upholds the right of all parties to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Parties commit to facilitating exchanges of equipment and information for peaceful nuclear energy use. Parties to the Treaty commit to cooperating in developing peaceful uses of nuclear energy, ensuring non-nuclear-weapon states have access to benefits without discrimination or high costs. Non-nuclear-weapon States Party to the Treaty can access benefits without discrimination or high costs through international agreements. Negotiations for disarmament and control of nuclear arms are also emphasized. Article VIII of the Treaty allows for proposed amendments to be submitted and considered by all Parties, with approval required by a majority of votes including nuclear-weapon States. The Treaty allows for proposed amendments to be considered by all Parties, with approval required by a majority of votes including nuclear-weapon States. The amendment shall enter into force for each Party upon depositing its instrument of ratification, followed by a review conference every five years to ensure the Treaty's purposes are being realized. The Treaty allows for proposed amendments to be considered by all Parties, with approval required by a majority of votes including nuclear-weapon States. A majority of the Parties may convene further conferences to review the Treaty's operation. The Treaty is open to all States for signature and shall enter into force after ratification by signatory States. Instruments of ratification and accession shall be deposited with the designated Depositary Governments. The Treaty defines a nuclear-weapon State as one that has tested a nuclear weapon before January 1, 1967. It will enter into force upon deposit of ratification or accession instruments. Depositary Governments will inform all States of important dates and events related to the Treaty. The Treaty allows Parties to withdraw if extraordinary events jeopardize their supreme interests, with a notice period of three months. A conference will be held 25 years after the Treaty's entry into force to decide its continuation. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, signed by various countries, shall be deposited in the archives of Depositary Governments. Certified copies will be sent to signatory and acceding States. The establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones strengthens the international non-proliferation regime, as affirmed by the Security Council. The curr_chunk discusses the threat of weapons of mass destruction to international peace and security, recalling resolutions supporting a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. It also mentions the danger of nuclear proliferation in areas of tension and references relevant Security Council resolutions and decisions on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. The curr_chunk from 11 May 1995 endorses the aims of the Middle East peace process, notes satisfaction with recommendations for non-proliferation, and expresses concern about unsafeguarded nuclear facilities in the region. The curr_chunk from 11 May 1995 emphasizes the importance of universal adherence to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, urging all States in the Middle East to join the Treaty and place their nuclear facilities under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. It also calls for practical steps towards establishing a verifiable Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction. The curr_chunk from 11 May 1995 emphasizes the importance of universal adherence to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, urging all States in the Middle East to join the Treaty and place their nuclear facilities under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. It also calls for practical steps towards establishing a verifiable Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction, including biological and delivery systems. Calls upon all States party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to cooperate for the establishment of a nuclear-free Middle East zone. The curr_chunk emphasizes the need for early entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, a moratorium on nuclear explosions, and negotiations for a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons. It also urges the Conference on Disarmament to agree on a program of work for immediate negotiations on the treaty within five years. The curr_chunk calls for the establishment of a subsidiary body in the Conference on Disarmament to address nuclear disarmament, the principle of irreversibility in disarmament measures, and an unequivocal commitment by nuclear-weapon States to eliminate their arsenals. It also emphasizes the need for the early implementation of START II and III, while preserving the ABM Treaty. The curr_chunk emphasizes reductions of strategic offensive weapons, completion of the Trilateral Initiative, steps towards nuclear disarmament by nuclear-weapon States, including unilateral reductions, increased transparency, and further reduction of non-strategic nuclear weapons. The curr_chunk highlights concrete measures for reducing the operational status of nuclear weapons systems, diminishing the role of nuclear weapons in security policies, engaging all nuclear-weapon States in the process of eliminating their nuclear weapons, placing fissile material under international verification for peaceful purposes, and reaffirming the ultimate goal of general and complete disarmament. The objective of States in the disarmament process is general and complete disarmament under effective international control. Regular reports by all States parties on the implementation of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament agreements are required. The development of verification capabilities is necessary for compliance with nuclear disarmament agreements."
