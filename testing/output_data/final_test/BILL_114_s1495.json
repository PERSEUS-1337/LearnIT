    "content": "The \"Fairness for Crime Victims Act of 2015\" may be cited as the short title. Point of order against certain changes in mandatory programs affecting the Crime Victims Fund. The Crime Victims Fund, created in 1984, is funded by fines, penalties, forfeited bonds, and private donations, not taxpayer dollars. It provides services to victims using funds collected from those convicted of crimes. The Crime Victims Fund, established in 1984, is used to provide services to crime victims as per the Victims of Crime Act of 1984. However, Congress has been withholding over $10 billion from victims of various crimes, including child abuse, sexual assault, and domestic violence, by not disbursing the full amount collected from the fund. From 2010 to 2014, only 30 percent of the $12 billion collected was distributed to crime victims, despite budget rules indicating that the remaining funds are still available. Congress concludes that funds collected by the Crime Victims Fund should be used for services to crime victims in accordance with the Victims of Crime Act of 1984. \"Part C introduces limitations on budgetary and appropriations legislation, specifically regarding changes in mandatory programs affecting the Crime Victims Fund.\" In this section, the term 'CHIMP' refers to provisions that would impact direct spending or receipts under the Balanced Budget Act, resulting in a net decrease in budget authority. The term 'Crime Victims Fund' is defined as the fund for crime victims. The term 'Crime Victims Fund' refers to the fund established under the Victims of Crime Act of 1984. The term '3-year average amount' is the annual average deposited into the fund over a 3-fiscal-year period. In the Senate, a point of order can be raised against a provision containing a CHIMP that would decrease budget authority in appropriations bills. If a provision in a bill would reduce the amount available from the Crime Victims Fund below the 3-year average, a point of order can be raised in the Senate. If sustained, the provision will be removed and cannot be offered as an amendment. This also applies to conference reports or amendments between Houses. In the Senate, a point of order can be raised against a conference report or House amendment. If sustained, further amendments are not allowed unless waived by a supermajority vote. In the Senate, a three-fifths vote is required to waive or suspend a subsection, and to sustain an appeal of the Chair's ruling on a point of order. Budgetary levels are determined based on estimates provided by the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget. In the House of Representatives, a provision in a bill proposing appropriations that would reduce the amount available from the Crime Victims Fund below the 3-year average amount can be subject to a point of order. The House of Representatives will not consider amendments or conference reports on bills that propose reducing the Crime Victims Fund below the 3-year average amount. Budgetary levels are determined based on estimates provided by the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget. The table of contents in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended by inserting a new item after section 428. \"Section 441 imposes limitations on changes to mandatory programs affecting the Crime Victims Fund.\""
