Congress acknowledges the importance of the United States' economic, security, and national defense interests in the Arctic region. The government has issued key reports and strategies on the Arctic over the past four years to protect national security interests. The United States recognizes the strategic importance of the Arctic region due to its rapid warming, which poses threats to fisheries, wildlife, infrastructure, and communities in Alaska. To safeguard its interests, the US needs to enhance its infrastructure and assets in the region. To safeguard its strategic interests, the United States must defend its national borders, protect the environment, and maintain its scientific and technological leadership in the Arctic region. The sense of Congress is that the President should continue convening the Arctic Executive Steering Committee and the US should ratify the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea to secure offshore resources in the Arctic. The President must develop a strategy within 180 days to protect US interests in the Arctic, focusing on improving infrastructure, security measures, climate resilience, and research funding in the region. The strategy required under subsection (a) of the Act must sustain robust research funding to understand ongoing climate changes in the Arctic region and their global impact. It should also be informed by prior reports and strategies related to the Arctic region. The Comptroller General of the United States is required to submit a report to relevant committees within 45 days of the Act's enactment. The House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure is assessing the cost and procurement schedule for new US icebreakers. The report will analyze the Coast Guard's efforts to acquire new icebreaking capability, actions to incorporate practices from other nations, and differences in cost and schedule compared to other countries. The report will assess innovative acquisition practices for icebreaker procurement, a capacity replacement plan for potential capability gaps, and any other relevant matters identified by the Comptroller General. SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION TO PROCURE COAST GUARD ICEBREAKERS. Authorization for the procurement of up to three Coast Guard heavy icebreakers to defend U.S. interests in the Arctic Region starting in fiscal year 2018. Any contract entered into is subject to appropriations and limits the government's liability for termination. The Secretary is required to report on the procurement plan. The Secretary is required to report on plans to procure and sustain additional icebreakers for the Coast Guard, ensuring that at least three icebreakers are operational at all times."
