    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Welfare Dependency Act of 1993\". It includes findings and policy statements. The Congress finds that since 1960, the AFDC program caseload has quintupled, with nearly one-quarter of children born in the late 1960s on welfare. Additionally, one-quarter of school children are from single-parent households. The National Assessment of Educational Progress highlights the impact of single parent or no parent households on educational outcomes. Only a quarter of father-absent families receive full child support, and over half receive none. The average AFDC benefit has decreased by more than a third since 1960. Welfare dependency is a significant concern for women, who are predominantly the heads of single parent families. The rate of welfare dependency may be increasing, but there is a lack of adequate statistical data to assess this issue accurately. The Congress declares the policy to reduce welfare dependency, strengthen families for self-sufficiency, and assist individuals in improving education and job skills. The purpose of this Act is to lower welfare dependency by providing measures for tracking progress and enabling families to be self-sufficient. The Act aims to reduce welfare dependency by implementing measures to track progress and promote self-sufficiency. The Act aims to reduce welfare dependency by developing indicators, rates, and predictors of welfare dependency in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture. The Secretary will assess data needed to report annually on these measures. The Act requires the development of indicators for welfare dependency and an assessment of data collection needs. An interim report with conclusions must be provided to specific committees within 2 years. The Act establishes committees in the Senate to oversee welfare dependency indicators and predictors. An Advisory Board on Welfare Dependency is also established to assess data collection needs. The Advisory Board on Welfare Dependency, composed of 12 members appointed by the House of Representatives, Senate, and President, includes experts in welfare research, representatives of welfare agencies, and organizations. Vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment, and the Board's duties include providing advice and recommendations to the Secretary on indicators and rates development. The Advisory Board on Welfare Dependency, composed of 12 members appointed by the House of Representatives, Senate, and President, includes experts in welfare research, representatives of welfare agencies, and organizations. The Board's duties involve advising the Secretary on indicators, rates, and predictors of welfare dependency, as well as providing advice on the annual report presentation. Members of the Board receive travel expenses but not compensation for their duties. The Secretary can detail Department of Health and Human Services personnel to assist the Board without reimbursement. The Board may accept voluntary services from its members. The Board will be terminated once its duties are completed, but before the first report submission. The Secretary is required to prepare an annual report on welfare dependency in the United States, analyzing indicators, rates, and predictors of dependency. The report covers individuals receiving assistance from means-tested benefit programs and must provide information on the causes of dependency. The annual report on welfare dependency in the United States analyzes indicators, rates, and predictors of dependency for individuals receiving means-tested benefit programs. It includes current trends in recipients, total expenditures, population proportions, program characteristics, and recipiency duration. The annual report on welfare dependency in the United States includes total expenditures, income limits, need standards, maximum benefits by State, program interactions, changes from previous years, trends in participation, and numerical goals for recipients and expenditures. The annual report on welfare dependency in the United States includes programs and policies determined by the Secretary to reduce welfare dependency and increase family self-sufficiency. The report also includes recommendations for legislation to achieve these goals without reducing eligibility levels or imposing barriers to program access. The Secretary is required to submit a report annually on reducing welfare dependency and setting interim goals for aid recipients. The amendment made by this section will be effective upon enactment of the Act."
