    "title": "AB 707",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 51203 of the Government Code is amended to require the assessor to determine the fair market value of land without contractual restrictions. The Department of Conservation or the landowner can provide information to assist in this determination. Within 45 days of receiving the assessor's notice, the Department of Conservation or the landowner can request a formal review if they believe the fair market valuation is inaccurate. They must provide reasons and additional information for the review. The assessor may recover reasonable costs from the requesting party. The city or county can deduct costs from cancellation fees before depositing in the Soil Conservation Fund. A deposit may be required from the landowner for cancellation fee contingencies. Assessor costs for formal reviews shall not be borne by the nonrequesting party. If no request is made within 45 days of receiving notice by certified mail of the valuation, the assessor\u2019s valuation will be used to calculate the fee. Upon receiving a request for formal review, the assessor will review the valuation if it may impact the property's value. Parties must submit information within 30 days, with responses allowed within 30 days. Any new information must be responded to within 20 days. All submissions and responses must be served to the other party. The assessor must avoid ex parte contacts and report any such contacts to the department. The assessor must avoid ex parte contacts during the formal review and report any such contacts to the department and landowner upon completion. The review must be completed within 120 days of receiving the request. At the end of the formal review, the assessor will either adjust the cancellation valuation or confirm its accuracy. The assessor will notify the department, landowner, and relevant board or council of the revised valuation or decision. A summary of the considerations and responses related to the cancellation value will be included. Any information or response not shared with both parties will not be considered. If a formal review is denied, a brief explanation will be provided upon request. (c) The valuation date for any revised valuation after formal review or judicial challenge remains the date of the assessor's initial valuation. A cancellation value is considered current for one year after certification by the assessor. (d) The department and landowner can agree on a cancellation valuation, which will serve as the official valuation for cancellation. The agreement must be submitted to the board or council handling the cancellation petition. (e) The department must provide a preliminary valuation to the county assessor and the board of supervisors or city council 60 days before the final cancellation valuation. The preliminary valuation includes the rationale and facts considered, with opportunities for feedback from the assessor and the board or council before the final valuation is determined. The Department of Conservation handles appeals for cancellation valuations, representing the state's interests in administrative and judicial processes."
