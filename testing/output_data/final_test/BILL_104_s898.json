Within three years of the Helium Disposal Act of 1995, the Secretary must stop producing, refining, and marketing refined helium. Within two years of this cessation, excess property related to helium production must be designated and disposed of according to the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. Proceeds from the asset sale will go to the general fund of the Treasury, with the option for inclusion in the budget baseline if designated by the President.

Sales must be equivalent to refined helium purchased by the Federal Government, unless disrupting markets. The Helium Production Fund is abolished.

Upon completion, the fund will be abolished, and remaining funds transferred to the US Treasury.

The Act allows for the disposal of crude helium reserves, with proceeds going to the Helium Reserve Management. The President can designate asset sale proceeds to be included in the budget baseline and counted as an offset to direct spending. Upon abolishment of the Helium Production Fund, a report on disposal costs and receipts must be submitted to Congress. The Secretary of the Treasury will cancel all outstanding helium debt, including interest and principal, as well as eliminate the cooperative authority and stockpile according to the Helium Act Amendments of 1960. The Secretary will start selling crude helium from US reserves stored in the Bureau of Mines Cliffside Field by January 1, 1996, to dispose of excess reserves by January 1, 2020. Sales will be determined in consultation with the helium industry, with prices comparable to private industry sales and subject to annual price reviews. The Secretary will continue to sell helium reserves regardless of any new discoveries, to fulfill the duty of making sales as outlined in the section. SEC. 8.
