    "content": "The \"Homecoming Enhancement Research and Oversight (HERO) Act\" is a study on the physical and mental health needs of members and former members of the Armed Forces who deployed in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, as well as their families. The findings by Congress highlight the strain on the wellness of Army members and their families due to extended tours of duty in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. It is noted that a significant number of troops have been deployed multiple times, with a majority having family responsibilities. Over 500,000 children have parents deployed in support of the Global War on Terror, and over 2,700 children in the US have lost a parent in these operations. Operation Enduring Freedom has led to an increase in female military personnel, but there is a lack of research on their psychological needs. Members of the Armed Forces with mental health disorders face barriers to accessing care and only a small percentage seek help. A quarter of returning troops have less visible psychological injuries, and over 20% of wounded members require care. The impacts of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan on Armed Forces members and their families must be researched and addressed promptly. A study on the physical and mental health needs of deployed members is required by the Secretary of Defense in consultation with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the National Academy of Sciences. Former members of the Armed Forces deployed in Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom and their families will undergo a two-phase study to identify physical and mental health needs and gaps in care. The preliminary phase will be completed within 180 days, while the second phase will be finished within three years of the enactment of the Act. The Act requires a comprehensive assessment of the physical and mental health needs of Armed Forces members deployed in Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom and their families, including the impacts of deployment and multiple deployments on them. The Act mandates an assessment of the neurological, psychiatric, and psychological effects of Traumatic Brain Injury on Armed Forces members and their families, including the efficacy of current treatment approaches within the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The assessment mandated by the Act includes evaluating the needs of female and minority members of the Armed Forces, as well as their educational and vocational needs and the development of recommendations for programs and policies to address identified gaps and needs. The study will focus on the readjustment needs of various populations, including members of the Armed Forces, National Guard, Reserve, veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom, and their family members. The National Academy of Sciences will have access to necessary information from the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs for the study. They must maintain privacy of personally identifiable information and provide reports upon completion of each study phase. The National Academy of Sciences will submit reports to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs upon completion of each study phase. The Secretary of Defense will then provide comprehensive reports to Congress within 30 days of each phase's completion, including information from the National Academy of Sciences. Reports will be made publicly available by the Secretary of Defense. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs will jointly develop a preliminary plan within 45 days of receiving a report from the National Academy of Sciences. This plan will address the findings and recommendations of the report, with a final response due within 90 days. The Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs will develop a final joint plan within 90 days of receiving a report from the National Academy of Sciences to address gaps in care and make necessary policy modifications. The Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs will jointly submit reports to Congress on necessary policy modifications and estimated costs for implementing recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences. The Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs will submit a report to Congress on joint plans developed for policy modifications and estimated costs. The report will be made publicly available online, and a GAO audit will assess the contents of the final joint plan. The report to Congress will include an assessment of the adequacy and feasibility of policy modifications proposed in the joint Department of Defense-Department of Veterans Affairs plan, as well as an evaluation of cost estimates. The report to Congress will include an assessment of the adequacy and feasibility of policy modifications proposed in the final joint Department of Defense-Department of Veterans Affairs plan, along with cost estimates and comments from the National Academy of Sciences. Authorization of appropriations is also provided for the Department of Defense to carry out this section."
