    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Holocaust Insurance Accountability Act of 2010\" and includes findings related to the Holocaust. The Holocaust, a horrific event where millions suffered through torture and violence, including the murder of 6,000,000 Jews and others, was one of the worst crimes in history. Many people had insurance policies before and during World War II for various purposes. After the war, Holocaust survivors faced challenges in claiming insurance due to missing documents confiscated by Nazis or lost in the devastation. Holocaust survivors and heirs have struggled for decades to settle unpaid insurance claims. In 1998, the International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims (ICHEIC) was established to address the issue of unpaid insurance policies issued to Holocaust victims. The United States and Germany signed an executive agreement in 2000 supporting the German Foundation for Holocaust victims. In 2001, a similar agreement was signed with Austria. The ICHEIC process ended in 2007, but companies still withhold information on insurance policies sold to Jewish customers before World War II. Experts estimate that only a small fraction of Holocaust-era insurance policies sold to Jews in Europe have been paid through ICHEIC. The Supreme Court ruled in American Insurance Association, Inc., v. Garamendi that executive agreements and Federal Government policy preempt State laws regarding insurance claims against German and Austrian companies. Congress was noted to have the power to regulate international commerce and Federal court jurisdiction in the Garamendi case. Congress supports Holocaust survivors and their heirs in obtaining information from insurers and pursuing legal action to recover unpaid funds from entities involved in the theft of family insurance assets. The Act allows for State causes of action and disclosure requirements. This Act expresses Congress's intent to validate State laws protecting Holocaust survivors and heirs in obtaining information and pursuing legal action to recover unpaid funds from entities involved in the theft of family insurance assets. It aims to expedite insurance payments to victims and enable them to receive compensation reflecting the true value of their losses. Courts should be open to Holocaust victims and their families for a reasonable number of years after the enactment of this Act, without regard to any other statutes of limitation. SEC. 3. VALIDITY OF STATE LAWS. State laws creating a cause of action against insurers based on covered policies are not invalidated by executive agreements. Laws requiring insurers to disclose policy information are valid and not preempted by such agreements. The President can waive these provisions for specific executive agreements. The President can determine the vital national security interests of the US for executive agreements involving covered policies, with a report to Congress. No funds can be used to issue statements of interest to dismiss claims related to covered policies. The statute of limitations for claims under State laws related to covered policies cannot be used to dismiss a claim within 10 years of the enactment of this Act. This Act applies to claims under State laws described in subsections (a) or (b), including claims dismissed on the ground of executive preemption or released due to settlement of a class action without payment to the claimant. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refer to specific committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The term \"covered policy\" includes insurance policies issued to individuals in areas occupied or controlled by Nazi Germany between January 30, 1933, and December 31, 1945. In this paragraph, \"Nazi Germany\" refers to the Nazi government of Germany and any government in areas occupied by its military forces. An \"insurer\" is defined as a person engaged in the insurance business. \"Legislative days\" are days when both Houses of Congress are in session. A \"related company\" is an affiliate as defined in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act."
