    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Food Security and Land Stewardship Act of 2001\" and includes a Flexible Fallow Program. The \"Food Security and Land Stewardship Act of 2001\" includes a Flexible Fallow Program allowing producers to participate in a fallow program instead of receiving a loan rate for eligible production. The \"Food Security and Land Stewardship Act of 2001\" offers a Flexible Fallow Program for producers to choose acres for specific loan commodities and set aside acreage for reduced production rates. The Flexible Fallow Program allows producers to select loan commodities, set aside acreage for reduced production rates, and receive loan rates based on projected reduction rates. The acreage planted for loan commodities is limited to the total planted acreage of the producer. Loan rates are determined for producers participating in the program. Loan assistance for a crop under section 131 is based on the projected reduction rate of production determined by the producer. Projected Corn, Wheat, Soybean, Upland Cotton, and Rice Loan Rates are shown with percentage reduction rates ranging from 0% to 5%. Projected loan rates for Corn, Wheat, Soybean, Upland Cotton, and Rice are displayed with percentage reductions from 6% to 14%. Projected loan rates for Corn, Wheat, Soybean, Upland Cotton, and Rice show reductions from 15% to 23%. Loan rates for various crops have decreased by 24% to 30% with corresponding values ranging from 2.54 to 9.50. The loan rate for a marketing assistance loan is based on the producer's crop production not exceeding the historical county average yield for the loan commodity, adjusted for long-term trends. The loan rate for a crop of a loan commodity exceeding the historical county average yield will be equal to the loan rate for a 0% reduction rate. If a producer's crop production is below the historical county average yield, specific provisions apply for disasters. In case of damaging weather or insurable peril, the producer may receive a payment for lost production equal to the difference between the maximum loan commodity designated for the loan rate and the actual quantity produced. The producer may receive a payment for lost production equal to the loan deficiency payment on the commodity, selected by the producer, when a loan deficiency payment was available. The flexible fallow program allows producers to participate in the program and receive a marketing assistance loan based on fair and reasonable rates determined by the Secretary for different commodities. The Secretary determines fair loan rates for oilseeds other than soybeans, ensuring they are not lower than soybean rates on a per-pound basis. Producers must dedicate acreage to approved conservation uses to be eligible for the loan rate. To be eligible for the flexible fallow program, producers must dedicate acreage to conservation uses approved by the Secretary, including soil conservation, wildlife habitat enhancement, limited grazing, carbon sequestration, and recreational uses. Certification by farm serial number is required for participation in the program for the 2001 or 2002 crops. Producers must certify total planted acreage by farm serial number for the 2001 and 2002 crops of a loan commodity. Amendments to the Agricultural Market Transition Act include changes in payment rates per bushel."
