    "content": "The Act titled \"High Technology Indexation Act of 1993\" establishes indexing standards. Section 5(g) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 is amended to establish indexing standards for the removal of obsolete requirements for validated licenses and other licenses authorizing multiple exports. Indexing standards are required for increasing performance levels of goods or technology subject to licensing requirements. The emphasis should be on technical specifications below which no export permission is needed. Controls on exports of goods or technology that no longer require licensing under the new standards will be removed. Controls on exports of goods or technology to controlled countries will be included in US proposals to multilateral regimes. Export controls to non-controlled countries will be lifted after consultations, unless specific conditions are met. The Secretary can make a determination under section 101 of title 5, United States Code, that removing controls on goods or technology may harm national security or US policies. The Secretary must report this determination in writing, along with the anticipated impact, to the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives. The Secretary may consider eliminating site visitation requirements for goods and technology where export controls have been removed. The technical advisory committees will recommend indexing standards for goods eligible for export under a distribution license. The technical advisory committees recommend indexing standards for goods eligible for export under a distribution license, which may not require authority or permission for export under certain conditions. The Secretary will determine acceptance within a specified timeframe after each submission. The technical advisory committees recommend indexing standards for exportable goods under a distribution license. The Secretary must decide within 30 days of submission, or 45 days if there is an objection from another executive department. Proposals must be made at the next meeting after applying the standards to the goods. \"Policies of the United States\" refer to foreign policy. The curr_chunk states that 'policies of the United States' refer to foreign policy and non-proliferation policies. The curr_chunk focuses on supercomputer exports. The Export Administration Act of 1979 is amended to include a new paragraph defining supercomputers and outlining security procedures for exports and reexports. The Secretary is required to establish a performance-based indexing system to keep up with technological advancements in the supercomputer industry. The Export Administration Act of 1979 is amended to include security procedures for exporting supercomputers to countries adhering to nuclear non-proliferation treaties. No security safeguard procedures are needed for supercomputers with performance below 15% of the top 2 supercomputers. The Export Administration Act of 1979 is amended to include security procedures for exporting powerful supercomputers commercially. Before publishing the performance-based indexing system, the Secretary must seek advisory committee input and submit reports to Congress. The Export Administration Act of 1979 is amended to include security safeguard procedures for exporting supercomputers. The Secretary must gather input from advisory committees and report on the performance-based indexing system to Congress. The Export Administration Act of 1979 is amended to include security measures for exporting supercomputers to restrict access and resale."
