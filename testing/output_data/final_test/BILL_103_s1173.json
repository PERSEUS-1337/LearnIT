    "content": "The Act is titled the \"United States-Japan Trade Equalizing Act of 1993\". It includes findings, purpose, and disclaimers. The Congress finds that the United States trade deficit with Japan has significantly increased, reaching $49.4 billion by the end of 1992. The domestic motor vehicle sector employs over 1 million workers and contributes about 12 percent to the economy. The domestic motor vehicle sector contributes about 12 percent to the economy, generating over $200 billion in revenue annually. Japan has a voluntary export restraint arrangement since 1981, and the US has been negotiating for fair market access for motor vehicle parts and manufacturers since 1986. In 1992, the US had a $49.4 billion trade deficit with Japan, with over $30 billion from the automotive sector. Despite negotiations, the Japanese government has not made serious efforts to eliminate these deficits, which harm the US economy and jobs. Japanese motor vehicles and parts are being imported in large quantities, causing potential harm to domestic manufacturers. Transplant assembly facilities in the US owned by Japanese entities have not significantly increased procurement from US motor vehicle parts producers in the last 5 years. This is evident from the growing US automotive parts trade deficit with Japan, reaching $9.8 billion in 1992, and only 12.5% of parts used in vehicles manufactured at these facilities are from traditional US suppliers. The United States motor vehicle parts trade deficit with Japan is significantly influenced by procurement practices, with a large percentage of value coming from imports and purchases from Japanese-affiliated producers. This pattern is projected to lead to a substantial increase in the trade deficit by 1994. Aftermarket parts are expected to play a significant role in this scenario. Aftermarket parts are projected to contribute to 50 percent of the motor vehicle parts trade deficit with Japan by 1994 due to transplant facilities not buying enough original equipment from US suppliers. Traditional US motor vehicle parts manufacturers are notably lacking in producing key vehicle systems like engines, transmissions, and body structures for transplant facilities. The 1991 National Trade Estimates Report highlighted the strong relationships between Japanese motor vehicle makers and suppliers as a barrier to US motor vehicle parts sales in Japan. The European Community has limited Japanese motor vehicle manufacturers' market share to less than 16 percent until 2000. Japan's home market for motor vehicles and parts remains closed to foreign manufacturers with a combined market share of no more than 3 percent. Japan's nontariff market barriers discriminate against foreign-made motor vehicles and parts through inspection systems, taxes, closed distribution networks, and \"Keiretsu\" relationships. The purpose of this Act is to reduce the US trade deficit with Japan over 5 years without modifying existing terms. This Act does not change international treaties related to motor vehicles and parts, including conflict resolution terms. It does not give US courts jurisdiction over these conflicts or alter existing laws that do. SEC. 102. DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this Act, \"motor vehicle\" refers to articles described in heading 8703 or 8704 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, while \"motor vehicle parts\" include articles suitable for use in manufacturing or repairing motor vehicles as specified in certain subheadings of the Schedule. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States categorizes motor vehicle parts into specific subheadings, including parts for engines, transmission shafts, chassis with engines, motor vehicle bodies, and various components like bumpers, brakes, and radiators. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule categorizes motor vehicle parts, including suspension shock absorbers, radiators, mufflers, clutches, steering wheels, and other accessories. The term \"Japanese motor vehicle\" refers to vehicles from Japan, and \"Japanese motor vehicle part\" refers to parts from Japan. The term \"entered\" means imported or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption. The term \"import restriction implementation period\" refers to a calendar year after 1994 but before 2001, following a year where the trade deficit reduction target was not met. \"Interstate sale\" means sale or distribution within the United States. The \"baseline deficit\" is the average monthly trade deficit with Japan in 1993. During calendar year 1993, the value of bilateral trade between the United States and Japan in crude petroleum and nonmonetary gold shall not be included in computing merchandise trade deficits. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Commerce, and \"Trade Representative\" refers to the United States Trade Representative. TITLE II--MERCHANDISE TRADE DEFICIT REDUCTION\n\nSEC. 201. STAGED TRADE DEFICIT REDUCTION.\n\nTrade deficit reduction targets are set for each calendar year to limit the average monthly merchandise trade deficit between the United States and Japan. In 1994, the applicable percentage of baseline deficit was 80 percent, decreasing to 60 percent in 1995, 40 percent in 1996, 20 percent in 1997, and 0 percent in 1998. A special rule for 1998 stated that the 0 percent trade deficit reduction target would be met if the merchandise trade deficit with Japan did not exceed 5 percent of the bilateral trade value or $5 billion. The Secretary computes if the trade deficit reduction target was met each year. If not met, import restrictions are announced for the following year. SEC. 202. COMPUTATION OF IMPORT RESTRICTIONS IF TRADE DEFICIT REDUCTION TARGET NOT MET. SEC. 202. COMPUTATION OF IMPORT RESTRICTIONS IF TRADE DEFICIT REDUCTION TARGET NOT MET. On January 1 of each calendar year, the Secretary computes and publishes quantitative import restrictions for Japanese motor vehicles and parts entering the United States. The restrictions are based on aggregate quantities for each calendar year. The import restrictions for Japanese motor vehicles and parts entering the United States are based on aggregate quantities for each calendar year. The restrictions limit the amount of vehicles and parts that can be imported, with a reduction of 20 percent compared to the previous year's imports to prevent import surging. The Secretary may impose temporary import restrictions on Japanese motor vehicles and parts during the first 3 months of a calendar year to prevent import surging or ensure efficient administration of the Act. SEC. 203. REPORTS.\n\nWithin 30 days after a computation is made under section 201 or 202, the Secretary must submit a report to Congress detailing the computation bases.\n\nSEC. 204. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING ACHIEVEMENT OF MERCHANDISE TRADE DEFICIT REDUCTION TARGETS.\n\nCongress believes that the US and Japanese Governments should have ongoing discussions to achieve the trade deficit reduction targets, focusing on market access priorities for US exports to Japan."
