The Congress finds that providing financial resources to Federal agencies is crucial to enforce laws and prevent waste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayer's dollars. Investing in program integrity efforts by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice can result in significant savings, as reported by the Office of Management and Budget. Investing in program integrity efforts in Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program could save $4.47 billion over 5 years and $9.87 billion over 10 years. Additionally, investing in Social Security Administration for disability reviews could save $10 for every $1 invested. Investing in program integrity efforts in the Social Security Administration for disability reviews could save approximately $8 for every $1 invested, according to the Office of Management and Budget. Additional funding for these reviews could result in an estimated savings of $16.1 billion. According to a report by the Office of Management and Budget, investing $3,953,000,000 could save $16,102,000,000 over 5 years, and investing $10,252,000,000 could save $57,838,000,000 over 10 years. The tax gap, the difference between taxes owed and paid, was estimated at $345,000,000,000 in 2005. In 2009, the Internal Revenue Service returned an average of $4 to the Treasury for every $1 invested in enforcing the tax code. Increasing tax enforcement efforts could save $13.87 billion on a $8.87 billion investment over 5 years and $62.22 billion on a $23.27 billion investment over 10 years. According to a report from the Office of Management and Budget, increasing in-person reemployment and eligibility assessments for the Department of Labor's unemployment insurance program could save approximately $3.19 billion over the next 10 years. This investment of $325 million over 5 years and $720 million over 10 years is estimated to save taxpayers nearly $2 billion. The report suggests that increasing in-person reemployment and eligibility assessments for the Department of Labor's unemployment insurance program could save taxpayers nearly $2 billion during fiscal year 2011, with potential savings of over $35 billion in the next 5 years and $132 billion in the next 10 years.
