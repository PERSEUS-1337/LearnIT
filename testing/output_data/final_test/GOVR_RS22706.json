    "content": "The responsibility to protect federal buildings was established in June 1948 under the Federal Works Agency, with special policemen appointed to enforce laws and prevent disturbances. In 1949, these functions were transferred to the General Services Administration (GSA), which later authorized non-uniformed special policemen in 1961 for property protection and investigations. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) was established in January 1971 by the GSA Administrator to protect federal property and buildings. FPS continued its mission under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) within U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after the enactment of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) was established in 1971 to protect federal property and buildings. FPS officers are authorized to enforce federal laws, carry firearms, make arrests, serve warrants, and conduct investigations for homeland security. Contract guard services are a significant part of the FPS operating budget. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) budget for FY2006 is $487 million, with services being the largest expense. FPS utilizes 15,000 contract security guards and 950 law enforcement officers to provide security for GSA federal properties. In the National Capital Region, 54 private security guard companies supply 5,700 guards for 125 federal facilities. Task orders detail the terms for contract security guard services. Task orders for contract security guard services include identifying buildings needing protection, guard post locations, staffing schedules, guard qualifications, performance requirements, training, and required licenses and permits. Companies must comply with guard appearance, work hours, supervision, equipment, and record keeping standards. The contractor provided various training and certifications such as CPR, domestic violence prevention, firearms, first aid, and drug screening. The DHS IG found contract violations including unarmed guards at armed posts, guards with felony convictions, and guards without required security clearances. The DHS IG reported lapses in contractor oversight leading to government payment for services not received, loss of money, and risks to FPS-protected facilities. ICE and FPS will improve monitoring of the contract security guard program by increasing trained employees and implementing tracking mechanisms. Congress enacted P.L. 110 - 356 to address issues with FPS security guard contracts. In response to lapses in contractor oversight, Congress enacted P.L. 110 - 356 to reform the management of FPS security guard contracts. The Act prohibits convicted felons from owning contract security guard businesses that are awarded federal contracts. DHS intends for FPS to maintain security policy, standards, and provide law enforcement services in FY2009. In FY2009, FPS provided law enforcement and security services at NSSE events, including the 2008 Democratic and Republican National Nominating Conventions and President Obama's inauguration. The Administration proposed transferring FPS from ICE to NPPD in the FY2010 budget. FPS workforce was realigned in FY2007, leading to a 20% staff reduction and decreased security at federal facilities according to a GAO report. The reduction in FPS staff led to decreased security at federal facilities, increasing the risk of crime or terrorist attacks. GAO found that eliminating proactive security patrols hindered FPS law enforcement personnel from conducting security operations, such as inspecting suspicious vehicles and monitoring individuals. Additionally, FPS lacked a strategic human capital plan for workforce planning, training, retention, and staff development. NASCO established a Federal Protective Service Working Group in 2007. NASCO established the Federal Protective Service Working Group to address issues with contract security guards and law enforcement officers for federal and commercial markets. The working group aims to define security guard roles, identify security functions, and validate training requirements. The 110th Congress enacted P.L. 110-329 to fully fund FPS operations in response to workforce reductions and security concerns at federal facilities. The Administration proposes transferring the Federal Protective Service (FPS) to the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) to allow ICE to focus on border security and solidify NPPD's role in infrastructure protection. This transfer would be funded through security fees paid by federal departments and agencies to maintain FPS staffing levels. The Administration proposes transferring FPS to NPPD to focus on border security and reinforce NPPD's role in infrastructure protection. This move is supported by increased congressional and national interest in ICE and border security. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 2892 suggests transferring FPS to NPPD."
