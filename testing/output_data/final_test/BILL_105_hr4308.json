The Torture Victims Protection Act of 1998 includes findings that highlight the abhorrence of torture by the American people, the long-term effects of torture on individuals and society, the use of torture by repressive governments to suppress opposition and democracy, and the ongoing threats faced by torture survivors in communities where perpetrators are not held accountable. The Torture Victims Protection Act of 1998 emphasizes the need for justice for torture survivors and their treatment providers, who often face threats of reprisals. Many refugees in the United States have been victims of torture and should receive prompt consideration for asylum. Rehabilitation services are essential for torture survivors to integrate into society. The development of a treatment movement for torture survivors has created new opportunities for action by the United States and other nations to oppose state-sponsored torture. There is a need for a comprehensive strategy to protect and support torture victims and their treatment providers, along with overall efforts to eliminate torture. The United States can help heal the effects of torture and prevent its use worldwide by acting to heal survivors and protect their families. The United States became a party to the Convention Against Torture in 1994 but has not implemented Article 3 of the Convention. The Act defines terms based on the Immigration and Nationality Act and prohibits the involuntary return of individuals fearing torture. The Act prohibits the involuntary return of individuals to a country where they fear torture, regardless of their physical presence in the United States. SEC. 5. IMMIGRATION PROCEDURES FOR TORTURE VICTIMS. An alien described in this section is any alien who presents a claim of having been subjected to torture or whom there is reason to believe has been subjected to torture. When considering an application for refugee status, asylum, or withholding of removal for such aliens, officials must consider the effects of torture on the applicant's responses, the difficulties torture victims face in recounting their suffering, and their fear of returning to their country. Refugees who have been subjected to torture are given priority for resettlement in the United States. Special procedures are in place for aliens who are victims of torture, considering the effects of torture on their application for refugee status, asylum, or withholding of removal. Aliens who claim to have been tortured are given expedited asylum interview or removal proceedings. The removal of an alien under section 241(b)(3) of the Act will not worsen the effects of torture on the alien. Asylum interviews or removal proceedings may be delayed for aliens claiming torture-related symptoms with their consent. The Torture Victims Relief Act provides exemptions for aliens who have suffered torture, allowing for parole instead of detention and exemption from expedited removal. The Torture Victims Relief Act provides exemptions for aliens who have suffered torture, allowing for parole instead of detention and exemption from expedited removal. Congress recommends the Attorney General allocate resources to maintain current information on torture in foreign countries. SEC. 6.

Gender-specific training on interacting with male and female victims of torture by rape or sexual violence is provided during specialized training for immigration and consular officers."
