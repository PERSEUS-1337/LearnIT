    "content": "The Act is titled \"Department of Energy Laboratory Modernization and Technology Transfer Act of 2015\" and includes sections on definitions, savings clause, innovation management at the Department of Energy, technology transfer assessment, nuclear energy innovation, cross-sector partnerships, and grant competitiveness. The Act includes sections on agreements for commercializing technology, public-private partnerships, early-stage technology demonstration, funding competitiveness for institutions of higher education, participation in the Innovation Corps program, and assessment of impact. The Act defines the Department of Energy and National Laboratories, including Ames, Argonne, Brookhaven, Fermi, Idaho, Lawrence Berkeley, National Energy Technology, National Renewable Energy, Oak Ridge, Pacific Northwest, Princeton Plasma Physics, and Savannah River National Laboratories. The curr_chunk mentions specific national laboratories including Savannah River National Laboratory, Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, and Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, as well as any laboratory operated by the National Nuclear Security Administration for civilian energy activities. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. SEC. 3. SAVINGS CLAUSE. This Act does not affect the primary responsibilities of any National Laboratory to the Department. TITLE I--INNOVATION MANAGEMENT AT DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY SEC. 101. TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER AND TRANSITIONS ASSESSMENT. SEC. 101. TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER AND TRANSITIONS ASSESSMENT. The Secretary must provide an annual report to specific committees assessing the Department's ability to achieve the goals of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and recommend policy and legislative changes to improve technology transfer to the private sector. SEC. 102. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The Secretary should encourage National Laboratories and research centers to inform small businesses of opportunities under this Act. SEC. 103. NUCLEAR ENERGY INNOVATION. The Secretary must submit a report within 180 days assessing the Department's capabilities to oversee privately funded fusion and non-light water reactor prototypes at Department-owned sites, considering prototypes up to 20 megawatts thermal output. The report will cover safety review, oversight capabilities, and potential hosting sites for research and development. The Department will assess existing capabilities for overseeing privately funded fusion and non-light water reactor prototypes at Department-owned sites. This includes evaluating technical capabilities, contractual mechanisms, cost structures, and potential challenges identified by the Secretary. Title II focuses on cross-sector partnerships and grant competitiveness. Section 201 introduces the agreements for commercializing technology pilot program. The Secretary will implement the Agreements for Commercializing Technology pilot program of the Department, allowing increased authority for National Laboratory contractors to negotiate contract terms. Eligibility for the program extends to any National Laboratory director, including agreements with non-federal entities. The Secretary will allow National Laboratory directors to enter into agreements with non-Federal entities for funding, as long as the funding is used for the Federal award's purposes. The Bayh-Dole Act applies if the agreement is a funding agreement and at least one party is eligible for rights under that chapter. The affected National Laboratory directors must submit project information, costs, and timelines to the Secretary for each agreement entered into under this section. The contractor must certify that the project activities do not compete with the private sector and minimize conflicts. The pilot program under this section must avoid conflicts of interest and be extended until October 31, 2017. A report assessing its effectiveness and suggesting improvements must be submitted to relevant committees within 60 days after the extension. The pilot program's effectiveness will be assessed, potential interference with National Laboratories' responsibilities will be evaluated, and a recommendation on the program's future will be provided. The Secretary will submit an annual report on non-Federal entities using funds from Federal contracts for program agreements to relevant committees. SEC. 202. PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS FOR COMMERCIALIZATION. The Secretary can delegate signature authority to National Laboratory directors for agreements under $1,000,000 if they align with the lab's strategic plan or Congress-approved budget. This applies to various types of agreements determined appropriate by the Secretary and lab directors. The director of the affected National Laboratory and contractor must ensure agreements align with Department policies to protect national interests. Activities must avoid conflicts of interest. The director of a National Laboratory must submit records for monitoring within 30 days of entering an agreement. Higher rates can be charged for services to support research activities. This section does not apply to agreements with majority foreign-owned companies. The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 is amended to exempt majority foreign-owned companies from requiring approval by the Secretary of Energy for technology transfer. The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 is amended to exempt National Laboratories from Secretary of Energy approval for technology transfer agreements under $1,000,000. Subsection (b) is amended to refer to subsection (a)(1)(A) instead of (a)(1). SEC. 203. INCLUSION OF EARLY-STAGE TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION IN AUTHORIZED TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER ACTIVITIES. The Secretary shall permit National Laboratories to use funds for early-stage technology demonstration to remove barriers and demonstrate commercial applications of research. SEC. 204. FUNDING COMPETITIVENESS FOR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS. Section 988(b) of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include an exemption for research or development activities performed by institutions of higher education or nonprofit institutions. This exemption applies for a 6-year period. The exemption for research or development activities by institutions of higher education or nonprofit institutions applies for a 6-year period from the date of enactment. The Secretary may partner with the National Science Foundation for researchers funded by the Department to join the Innovation Corps program. The Comptroller General of the United States must submit a report to Congress within 3 years of this Act's enactment, detailing the outcomes of projects under sections 201, 202, and 203. This includes information on partnerships formed, potential linkages to national priorities, fiscal savings, National Laboratory capabilities, technology transfers, and overall efficiency improvements. The report to Congress must detail the outcomes of projects under sections 201, 202, and 203, including partnerships formed, linkages to national priorities, fiscal savings, National Laboratory capabilities, technology transfers, and efficiency improvements. It should also assess the Department's efforts to promote technology transfer and private sector engagement at the National Laboratories and make recommendations for improvement. The House of Representatives passed the bill on May 19, 2015. Karen L. Haas is the Clerk."
