    "content": "Congress has the authority to regulate foreign commerce and raise revenue under the Constitution. In the past, Congress set tariff rates directly, but starting in 1934, it delegated authority to the President to negotiate tariff reductions with other countries. However, in the 1970s, Congress became hesitant to allow the President to implement trade agreements dealing with non-tariff barriers on his own. Instead, the Trade Act of 1974 required the President to submit such agreements to Congress for legislative approval. The Trade Act of 1974 required the President to submit covered trade agreements to Congress for legislative approval. Subsequent acts have renewed these arrangements, modifying criteria and mechanisms for Congress to retain control over legislation in this policy area. Initially, covered trade agreements were limited to comprehensive multilateral agreements, but eligibility was extended in 1988. The Trade Act of 1974 established expedited procedures for congressional consideration of trade agreements, known as \"fast track.\" These procedures ensure timely action and provide a means for bringing measures to the floor even without committee approval. The Trade Act of 1974 established expedited procedures for congressional consideration of trade agreements, known as \"fast track.\" These procedures limit time for consideration, specify wording of measures, and restrict congressional discretion. The Trade Act of 1974 established expedited procedures for congressional consideration of trade agreements, known as \"fast track.\" The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 renewed these processes, designating them as \"trade promotion authority\" (TPA). This designation implies that the legislation delegates negotiation authority to the President, potentially constraining Congress. However, the President's constitutional authority in foreign affairs would allow him to negotiate trade agreements even without specific statutory authorization. The Trade Act of 1974 established expedited procedures for congressional consideration of trade agreements, known as \"fast track.\" The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 renewed these processes, designating them as \"trade promotion authority\" (TPA). The \"trade authorities procedures\" of the Trade Act of 1974 limit eligibility for expedited consideration to covered trade agreements meeting specified requirements. The prohibition against amending an implementing bill is justified to assure U.S. negotiating partners that Congress will act on a trade agreement as negotiated. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 renewed the expedited procedures for congressional consideration of trade agreements, known as \"trade promotion authority\" (TPA). The need for restrictions on amending an implementing bill is to ensure that the provisions enacted align with the trade agreement negotiated. The BCTPAA specifies the provisions required in an implementing bill for consideration under the trade authorities procedures. Amendments to the bill could result in it losing its eligibility for expedited consideration. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 renewed expedited procedures for congressional consideration of trade agreements. The BCTPAA addresses constraints on amending implementing bills by establishing mechanisms for Congress to influence legislation before formal introduction. Congress lacks an effective way to compel agreement between House and Senate versions of a bill within a fixed time frame. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 renewed expedited procedures for congressional consideration of trade agreements. It requires the executive to notify Congress of key stages in negotiating a trade agreement and report on various aspects throughout the process. The act also mandates consultation with Congress to influence the content of the agreement and implementing bill before formal introduction. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 sets requirements for trade agreements to be implemented, including notification, submission, and consultation with Congress. Failure to meet these requirements prevents agreements from entering into force under the act. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 establishes procedural mechanisms for Congress to withdraw expedited consideration of trade agreements that do not meet the act's requirements. The revenue committees of the two chambers play a central role in enforcing compliance with these requirements. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 gives revenue committees the primary responsibility for ensuring compliance with the act's requirements for implementing trade agreements. These committees are crucial in receiving reports, conducting consultations, monitoring negotiations, and controlling the use of procedural mechanisms for regulating expedited consideration. Congress can also use general rules to determine the fate of implementing bills. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 gives revenue committees the primary responsibility for ensuring compliance with the act's requirements for implementing trade agreements. These committees have influence over pursuing action under general rules, but the President retains broad constitutional authority to enter into trade agreements outside the act's context. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 grants the President broad constitutional authority to enter into trade agreements with other nations through expedient processes. While Congress would still need to pass legislation for implementation, the act establishes requirements for covered trade agreements to be eligible for expedited consideration. These requirements are related to the substance of the agreement, notifications and reports to Congress, and consultations with Congressional entities. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 grants the President broad authority to enter into trade agreements with other nations. The act outlines provisions for covered trade agreements, including reducing existing duties or barriers to trade that burden US trade or economy. It also directs the President to negotiate agreements that benefit the United States in feasible and timely manners. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 grants the President authority to negotiate trade agreements that benefit the United States. Covered agreements must make progress in meeting the objectives outlined in the act, which include reducing barriers to trade and addressing specific policy areas like agriculture and intellectual property rights. The act also restricts the applicability of trade authorities procedures. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 grants the President authority to negotiate trade agreements that benefit the United States. Covered agreements must make progress in meeting the objectives outlined in the act, which include reducing barriers to trade and addressing specific policy areas like agriculture and intellectual property rights. The BCTPAA restricts the applicability of trade authorities procedures by limiting eligibility for consideration to covered trade agreements entered into before July 1, 2018, and introducing new stipulations for expedited consideration eligibility. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 outlines specific requirements for the implementing bill to enter into force with respect to the United States, including provisions approving the trade agreement and the statement of administrative action proposed by the President. The bill must also contain only necessary provisions to implement the agreement and ensure that benefits and obligations apply only to the parties involved. The BCTPAA establishes requirements for the executive branch to provide information to Congress about covered agreements. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 sets out requirements for the executive branch to inform Congress about covered trade agreements and the negotiation process. The majority of actions required are notifications, reports, or submissions by the President to Congress, aimed at helping Congress assess if a trade agreement aligns with its intentions in establishing TPA. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 outlines the President's obligations to inform Congress about trade agreements. This includes notifying Congress of intent, objectives, and potential changes in U.S. trade laws. Congress must be informed 180 days before signing an agreement, with additional notifications at 90 days and 60 days before signing. The President must provide the final legal text of the agreement and proposed administrative actions to Congress 30 days before submitting the implementing bill. The President must submit the draft implementing bill, final legal text of the agreement, statement of administrative action, and explanations to Congress, asserting that the agreement aligns with U.S. trade priorities and serves the interests of U.S. Commerce. Additionally, a plan for implementation must be reported to Congress simultaneously. The President must report to Congress a plan for implementing and enforcing the agreement, including requirements for personnel and facilities, as well as the impact of trade increases on State and local governments. Additionally, he must report to the revenue committees on environmental reviews, impact on employment, and consultative mechanisms established among parties to promote capacity building for environmental and health issues. The President must report to Congress on labor rights in countries participating in the trade agreement, changes in U.S. labor laws required by the agreement, and measures taken by parties to comply with provisions before the agreement enters into force. Other informational requirements include reports to Congress or other recipients before negotiations for a covered trade agreement. The President must report to Congress on labor rights in countries participating in the trade agreement, changes in U.S. labor laws required by the agreement, and measures taken by parties to comply with provisions before the agreement enters into force. Additionally, the President is required to post a statement of negotiation objectives on the Internet and submit agreement details to the International Trade Commission. The ITC will then report on the agreement's impact on the U.S. economy and specific industry sectors within 105 days, while the Federal Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations will report on the agreement within 30 days of notification to Congress. The BCTPAA requires the President to report to Congress and the USTR on trade agreements, with consultations involving various Congressional committees and advisory groups. The text of the agreement must be posted online at least 60 days before entering into it. The BCTPAA mandates close consultations between the executive branch and Congress on trade agreements, involving designated congressional advisers and members to ensure active engagement and awareness of Congress's concerns. Revenue committees play a central role in these consultations and advisory groups established by the act. The BCTPAA mandates the establishment of Advisory Groups on Negotiations, composed of members from revenue committees and other relevant committees, to advise the United States delegation in trade agreement negotiations. The BCTPAA mandates the USTR to develop guidelines for consultations with Advisory Groups and designated advisers, providing access to classified materials, detailed briefings on negotiating objectives, and coordination during critical negotiation periods. The BCTPAA mandates consultations with designated congressional advisers and revenue committees for ongoing compliance and enforcement after trade agreements are concluded. The Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate designate congressional advisers on trade policy and negotiations, accredited as official advisers to the US delegation in trade agreement meetings. The BCTPAA mandates consultations with congressional advisers and revenue committees for trade agreement negotiations. The Advisory Groups provide advice to the USTR on objectives, strategies, and enforcement. The President must consult with committees before and during negotiations, especially regarding agriculture. The BCTPAA mandates consultations with congressional advisers and revenue committees for trade agreement negotiations, especially regarding agriculture tariffs and negotiations. The USTR is required to consult with committees on further tariff reductions for import-sensitive agricultural products and notify them of any products targeted for tariff reductions during negotiations. The BCTPAA mandates consultations with congressional advisers and revenue committees for trade agreement negotiations, requiring the President to consult with various committees before initiating or continuing negotiations on fishing industry and textiles/apparel. The USTR must also meet with Advisory Groups upon request and consult closely with negotiating partners during the course of negotiations. The BCTPAA mandates consultations with congressional advisers and revenue committees for trade agreement negotiations. The USTR must consult closely with negotiating partners and keep committees fully apprised during negotiations. Before signing an agreement, the President must consult on the nature of the agreement and its implementation with relevant committees and Advisory Groups. The BCTPAA requires the USTR to consult closely with various congressional groups before trade agreements are finalized, keeping them informed of compliance measures. Members of Congress can request briefings on trade negotiations as needed. The BCTPAA directs the USTR to provide timely briefings to Members of Congress on negotiating objectives, status of negotiations, and changes in law for trade agreements. Members can submit comments on trade negotiations to committees and their views on proposed trade agreements to the revenue panel of their chamber. The BCTPAA directs the USTR to provide briefings to Congress on trade negotiations. Within 60 days of a trade agreement, the President must submit changes in U.S. law. Before submitting a draft bill, the final agreement text and SAA must be provided. The revenue committees conduct a \"mock markup\" of the bill during this phase. The revenue committees engage in a mock markup process to develop text for the implementing bill based on the President's submissions, trade agreement text, and consultations. This process concludes with the committees transmitting their proposal to the President. The BCTPAA does not explicitly mention the mock markup process. The revenue committees engage in a mock markup process to develop text for implementing bills for trade agreements. Past committee reports indicate that this practice has been a universal one. The Senate Committee on Finance's report on the BCTPAA describes the origin of this practice during the Tokyo Round of trade agreements. The reports also provide detailed explanations of legislative intent regarding the mock markup process. The President will work closely with Congress to develop the implementing bill for trade agreements. Cooperation between the executive branch and Committees of jurisdiction is crucial for the bill's positive consideration. Past practices such as hearings and informal markups will precede the formal transmittal of the trade agreement. The bill does not set a deadline for these pre-transmittal processes. The bill does not establish a deadline for transmittal of the implementing bill for trade agreements, allowing ample time for consideration by Congress and the Administration. The informal markup process before formal submission provides opportunities for Congress to participate in developing the legislation. The Committee expects the Administration to carefully consider comments and make no changes to legislation beyond Committee recommendations. Deadlines are appropriate after the informal process, and the markup may involve a preliminary draft developed by the Administration or the committee. The mock markup process involves committees recommending terms for implementing bills to the President based on consultations with the executive branch. This allows committees to assess agreements and identify concerns about their content. During the mock markup process, committees consider and adopt amendments to draft bills, with a focus on whether the proposed changes are necessary and appropriate for implementing the agreement. Administration representatives often participate in this process, as seen in committee reports accompanying formal bills. During the mock markup process, committees consider and adopt amendments to draft bills, focusing on the necessity and appropriateness for implementing the agreement. Revenue committees typically hold separate markups, followed by a \"mock conference\" to create a single proposal for the President. However, in recent years, each committee has transmitted its own proposal, expecting the executive to consult with both committees to finalize a version for Congress. The BCTPAA does not require a formal mock markup, allowing the President to submit the draft bill in a different form. If so, revenue committees can still utilize the means available. The mock markup process allows committees to consider and adopt amendments to draft bills for implementing agreements. Revenue committees can propose denying expedited consideration for a covered trade agreement if found unsatisfactory. This process is crucial for Congress to exercise control over the implementation mechanisms provided by the BCTPAA. The Trade Act of 1974 allows Congress, particularly its revenue committees, to control the content of legislation for trade agreements before formal introduction. The expedited procedures in Section 151 provide for the introduction, committee action, consideration, floor conditions, and coordination between chambers. Each house can use alternative procedures for implementing bills. The Trade Act of 1974 allows Congress to control trade agreement legislation before formal introduction. Each chamber can modify procedures under its constitutional power, with the House using special rules and the Senate using unanimous consent agreements. Despite modifications, amendments to the measure are generally prohibited. Section 151 outlines procedures for introducing a draft implementing bill for a trade agreement, requiring formal introduction in each chamber by party floor leaders. The Trade Act of 1974 allows Congress to control trade agreement legislation before formal introduction. Section 151 outlines procedures for introducing a draft implementing bill for a trade agreement, requiring formal introduction in each chamber by party floor leaders. Questions may arise about the floor leaders' compliance with this mandate, but the provision is seen as a ministerial act that must be carried out. If leaders are opposed to the trade agreement, they can view the phrase \"by request\" as accommodating their personal views. The Trade Act of 1974 allows Congress to control trade agreement legislation before formal introduction. The implementing bill starts a statutory timetable for action to ensure timely consideration and voting on the measure. The timetable limits the total time for congressional consideration to 90 days of session in the respective chambers. Congress could adjourn sine die before completing the process. If Congress adjourns sine die before completing action on the implementing bill, the bill remains available for further action in the next session. However, if the adjournment occurs at the end of a two-year term, the bill dies with the adjournment. The Trade Act of 1974 and the BCTPAA do not explicitly provide for the renewal of action in the next Congress. The Senate may allow expedited action on a new implementing bill to proceed, but only if the President initiates it. Section 151 of the BCTPAA allows for expedited action on an implementing bill in the new Congress, with referral to appropriate committees. The bill cannot be amended, and committees can either report it favorably, adversely, or without recommendation. If a committee does not vote to report, the chamber can still proceed with the bill. Even if a committee does not vote to report, it cannot prevent its chamber from considering the measure. If the implementing bill contains revenue provisions, the committee is automatically discharged if it does not report the bill within 45 days. The Senate may refer an implementing revenue bill passed by the House to committee, with an extended period for consideration. The Senate committees must report or be discharged from considering revenue legislation, which must originate in the House. Once the committees report or are discharged, the bill is placed on the chamber's calendar for floor consideration. A final vote on the bill must occur within 15 days, with a privileged, non-debatable motion to proceed. In both chambers, the motion to proceed is privileged and non-debatable. In the House, this means a Member can offer the motion without further authorization, bypassing the Committee on Rules. In the Senate, a privileged motion to proceed is non-debatable, eliminating the need for a 60-vote super-majority for cloture. The motion can be adopted by a majority vote in both chambers, and if rejected, another motion can be offered. During the 15-day session period, a chamber may fail to adopt any motion to proceed. If a chamber votes to consider an implementing bill, debate is limited to 20 hours with no amendments allowed. A motion to recommit is also precluded at this stage. The expedited procedure precludes debate on motions to postpone or proceed to other business, limits debate on debatable motions in the Senate to one hour, and ensures a final vote on the implementing bill within 15 days of session. Passage of the bill requires a majority vote in both chambers. The expedited procedure for passing trade agreements requires a majority vote in both chambers, with the House acting first and the Senate considering the identical text without amendments. This process allows for a quick resolution without the need for reconciling differences between the two chambers' versions, leading to immediate presentation to the President for signature. A statutory limit on debate is a standard component of this expedited process. A statutory limit on debate is a standard component of expedited procedures, but it does not strictly limit total time consumed. In the House, time limits are already imposed under most circumstances. The expedited procedure focuses on automatic discharge and privileged motion to proceed, ensuring floor consideration. However, the House rarely implements bills using the statutory expedited procedure, opting for special rules reported by the Committee on Rules instead. The House usually adopts a special rule from the Committee on Rules to reduce debate time and retain the prohibition on a motion to recommit. In the Senate, the statutory limit on debate is crucial, as it eliminates the need for a 60-vote super-majority for cloture. The Senate often uses the statutory procedure for trade agreement bills, but may modify it by unanimous consent. The Senate frequently modifies the terms for considering trade agreement bills by unanimous consent, often reducing the 20-hour debate time. It typically bypasses committee referral and takes up the House measure directly. Special rules in the House and unanimous consent agreements in the Senate maintain the prohibition on amendments. The BCTPAA does not give the President new negotiating powers for trade agreements, nor does it prevent him from negotiating agreements that do not meet its requirements. The President's constitutional foreign relations powers allow him to negotiate such agreements, while Congress's commerce and revenue powers require covered trade agreements to meet the act's provisions. The BCTPAA requires trade agreements to be implemented by legislation and provides expedited consideration for agreements that meet its requirements. This gives Congress more control over the substance and negotiation process of covered trade agreements. However, these requirements are not self-enforcing. The BCTPAA requires trade agreements to be implemented by legislation and provides expedited consideration for compliant agreements. Compliance mechanisms include procedural disapproval resolution, consultation and compliance resolutions, and addressing provisions affecting trade remedy laws. The BCTPAA allows either house to withdraw eligibility for expedited consideration of trade agreements. The resolution addressing trade remedy laws has an ambiguous effect. The revenue committees have the main role in enforcing compliance with the act and determining if a trade agreement should be covered under its provisions. The revenue committees play a crucial role in enforcing compliance with the BCTPAA, ensuring that trade agreements meet statutory requirements and congressional preferences. Compliance mechanisms are prescribed as remedies for failure to meet specific requirements. The BCTPAA outlines compliance mechanisms as remedies for failing to meet specific requirements in trade agreements. Congress has the discretion to use these mechanisms to withdraw expedited consideration from implementing bills, even if the agreement meets the act's requirements. Congress can use procedural mechanisms to withdraw expedited consideration from trade agreements if they do not meet the requirements of the BCTPAA. Revenue committees are best suited to assess compliance, and general legislative procedures can also be used to maintain Congress's control over implementing legislation. Congress can use procedural mechanisms, such as those outlined in the Trade Act of 1974 and the BCTPAA, to withdraw expedited consideration from trade agreements. The revenue committees are typically responsible for assessing compliance, but any chamber of Congress can override or alter these procedural provisions. Congress can use procedural mechanisms outlined in the Trade Act of 1974 and the BCTPAA to withdraw expedited consideration from trade agreements. If either chamber denies expedited consideration, the bill can still be considered through regular legislative procedures, allowing Congress to amend or decline the proposal. The procedural disapproval resolution (PDR) has evolved as a means for Congress to reject expedited consideration if the trade agreement does not meet BCTPAA requirements. The BCTPAA allows Congress to withdraw expedited consideration of trade agreements through procedural disapproval resolutions (PDRs). A PDR is a simple resolution of either chamber, requiring action only in the chamber of origin. If one chamber adopts a PDR, expedited procedures continue unless the other chamber also adopts a PDR within 60 days. The BCTPAA establishes mechanisms for a single chamber to control expedited trade agreement procedures through procedural disapproval resolutions (PDRs). The text of a PDR must state that the President failed to notify or consult on a specified trade agreement, leading to the trade authorities procedures not applying to any implementing bill. This includes not carrying out required consultations and developing guidelines. The BCTPAA includes provisions for procedural disapproval resolutions (PDRs) to address failures in notifying or consulting on trade agreements. While the act does not explicitly mention certain notification requirements, Congress could still use a PDR for perceived failures to meet statutory requirements. The BCTPAA allows for procedural disapproval resolutions (PDRs) to address failures in notifying or consulting on trade agreements. Congress has the ultimate power to determine if trade agreements meet statutory requirements through the use of PDRs, with the judgment of revenue committees being crucial. Floor consideration of a PDR is out of order unless reported by its committees of referral. The BCTPAA allows for procedural disapproval resolutions (PDRs) to address failures in notifying or consulting on trade agreements. Committees with primary jurisdiction over a bill to implement a trade agreement have the power to judge if consultations and notifications have been carried out adequately. Committees of referral may not amend a PDR. The BCTPAA allows for procedural disapproval resolutions (PDRs) to address failures in notifying or consulting on trade agreements. Committees with primary jurisdiction over a bill to implement a trade agreement have the power to judge if consultations and notifications have been carried out adequately. PDRs reported by committees of referral become eligible for consideration under expedited procedures, but only if it is the first PDR reported with respect to that trade agreement in that chamber. The expedited procedures for PDRs are separate from those for implementing bills under the Trade Act of 1974. Motion to proceed to consideration of a PDR is privileged and not debatable, with limited debate on the resolution itself. The expedited procedure of Section 152 prohibits a motion to reconsider the vote. Debate on the resolution is limited to 20 hours, equally divided between supporters and opponents in the House and majority and minority leaders in the Senate. Amendments and motions to recommit are not allowed. Procedural motions in the House are not debatable, while debate on motions in the Senate is limited to one hour. A PDR can be adopted by majority vote, and cloture is not required for a vote in the Senate. The expedited procedure of Section 152 prohibits a motion to reconsider a final vote on a PDR, allowing only one opportunity per chamber to use the PDR procedure. There is no time limit for submitting a PDR, enabling Members to challenge a trade agreement early on if it does not align with the BCTPAA objectives. If committees agree, the resolution can be reported, considered, and adopted by a majority vote. The BCTPAA provides a trade remedies resolution (TRR) which, like the PDR, can be introduced by any Member of the chamber and is referred to the revenue committee. The TRR can only be considered if reported by the committee and follows expedited procedures outlined in the Trade Act of 1974. The Trade Act of 1974 outlines procedural regulations for the Trade Remedies Resolution (TRR) introduced by any Member of the chamber. The TRR can only be submitted in response to the President's report on trade agreement proposals that may require changes in U.S. trade remedy laws. The TRR must state that the proposed changes are inconsistent with negotiating objectives outlined in the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act (BCTPAA). The TRR, outlined in the Trade Act of 1974, allows revenue committees to warn against unacceptable changes to trade remedy laws in trade agreement negotiations. Expedited procedures apply only if no PDR has been reported by the respective revenue committee for the same trade agreement. The Trade Act of 1974 outlines the TRR, allowing revenue committees to address unacceptable changes in trade remedy laws during trade agreement negotiations. Expedited procedures apply if no PDR has been reported for the same trade agreement, ensuring expedited consideration for measures affecting trade agreements. The revenue committee can immunize the implementing bill against being ineligible for expedited consideration through a PDR by reporting a TRR. This would preclude the use of a PDR and even if the TRR is adopted, it would not affect the expedited procedure for the implementing bill. Each chamber could act under its own rules to preclude the use of the expedited procedure, rendering it ineffective for Congress as a whole. If a chamber declines to use the expedited procedure for an implementing bill, there is no guarantee it will reach a final vote or be considered on the floor. Amendments may be adopted, leading to a process of resolving differences with the other body. This could undermine the purpose of the expedited procedure to ensure timely action on trade agreements. Chambers have the authority to alter rules to deny expedited consideration. The House can alter its rules or override them using special rules, which are resolutions establishing procedural conditions for specific measures. The Committee on Rules, affiliated with the majority party, reports these resolutions, which are privileged for consideration and can be adopted by a majority vote. Typically, implementing bills are considered under special rules that replace or supplement the expedited procedure. The House can establish special rules to prohibit consideration of specific implementing bills, as seen in the case of a trade agreement with Colombia in 2008. The Senate, on the other hand, faces challenges in denying expedited procedures due to its rules allowing for full debate on most questions. The Senate may face challenges in denying expedited procedures for implementing bills, as opponents can filibuster to prevent a vote unless a 60-vote super-majority is obtained for cloture. While the Senate could withdraw expedited consideration with a majority vote, a two-thirds' vote is required for a motion to suspend the rules. The Senate typically alters procedural rules through unanimous consent agreements rather than using other methods. Additionally, a point of order could be raised in either chamber if an implementing bill does not meet statutory requirements for expedited consideration. The Senate may face challenges in denying expedited procedures for implementing bills, as opponents can filibuster to prevent a vote unless a 60-vote super-majority is obtained for cloture. A point of order could be raised in either chamber if an implementing bill does not meet statutory requirements for expedited consideration, rendering the measure ineligible for the expedited procedure. This ruling would not prevent the chamber from considering the bill under regular procedures. The Senate's lack of effective means to deny expedited consideration for implementing bills led to the creation of the \"Consultation and Compliance Resolution\" (CCR) as a new procedural mechanism. Unlike a special rule in the House, the CCR requires a simple majority vote and may still need super-majority support for cloture, making it ineligible for expedited procedures. The Senate created the \"Consultation and Compliance Resolution\" (CCR) as a new procedural mechanism to deny expedited consideration for implementing bills. Unlike the PDR, the CCR does not specify failure to promote statutory objectives. The Senate could use the CCR to object to a trade agreement and deny expedited consideration for the implementing bill. The Senate introduced the \"Consultation and Compliance Resolution\" (CCR) as a new procedural tool to reject expedited consideration for implementing bills related to trade agreements. The CCR gives initial control to the Senate's revenue committee, stating that if the Committee on Finance does not favorably report an implementing bill, a CCR must be reported. The CCR must have specific text and originate from the Committee on Finance, with the Senate following standing rules for its consideration unless taken up by unanimous consent. The BCTPAA establishes conditions for governing consideration of a CCR in the Senate. Opponents of an implementing bill would need a 60-vote super-majority to prevent expedited consideration through a CCR. If cloture is not agreed upon, the resolution is sent to the Committee on Finance. Adoption of the CCR could still require exhausting post-cloture time and adopting the motion to proceed. The BCTPAA establishes conditions for governing consideration of a CCR in the Senate, requiring a 60-vote super-majority to prevent expedited consideration. The CCR allows the Senate to withdraw expedited consideration from an implementing bill through its own unilateral action, but it does not guarantee this without super-majority support. The initiative to deny expedited consideration must come from the Committee on Finance. The House has a parallel mechanism similar to the Senate's CCR for withdrawing expedited consideration from implementing bills. However, it may be more practical for the House to use special rules instead of the CRR. The House's consultation and compliance resolution (H.Res.) mirrors the Senate's CCR in structure and purpose. The House has a procedure similar to the Senate's CCR for withdrawing expedited consideration from implementing bills. The CCR process in the House is initiated if the Committee on Ways and Means reports an implementing bill with an unfavorable recommendation, and a Member of the House introduces a CCR the next legislative day. If the committee does not report the CCR by the sixth legislative day after its introduction, it is automatically discharged. The House has a procedure similar to the Senate's CCR for withdrawing expedited consideration from implementing bills. The CCR process in the House is initiated if the Committee on Ways and Means reports an implementing bill with an unfavorable recommendation. If the committee does not report the CCR by the sixth legislative day after its introduction, it is automatically discharged. The requirements for using a CCR in the House are narrower than in the Senate, and the BCTPAA makes no provision for expedited consideration of a CCR in the House. The House may need to use a special rule to revoke the eligibility of an implementing bill for expedited consideration, as the BCTPAA does not grant privilege to a CCR in the House. This would allow the resolution to be adopted by a simple majority vote."
