    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 6795.2 of the Business and Professions Code requires the board to assess certificate holders on state laws and regulations at renewal. Failure to complete the assessment may lead to disciplinary action. No fee is charged for the assessment. An assessment program for professional engineers includes educational material based on state law and the board's rules. The assessment focuses on the top five violations related to administrative aspects. Geophysicist licensure applicants must meet specific qualifications and not have committed any disqualifying acts or crimes. To qualify for geophysicist licensure, applicants must meet specific educational requirements set by the board, including a major in a geophysical science or relevant discipline, or completion of at least 30 semester hours in relevant courses. At least 24 semester hours must be in third or fourth year, or graduate courses. To qualify for geophysicist licensure, applicants need seven years of professional geophysical work, with specific requirements for supervised experience and responsible charge. Undergraduate and graduate study in geophysical sciences can count towards training. Teaching in geophysical sciences at a college level can be credited towards meeting licensure requirements, with a limit of four years for undergraduate and graduate study combined. The applicant's ability must be demonstrated through work in a responsible position, as defined by the board's regulations. Supervision and experience adequacy will be determined by the board according to set standards. To obtain a geophysicist license, applicants must pass a written exam testing their knowledge of state laws, rules, and geophysics principles. The exam includes a separate section on state laws and board regulations. Section 7881.5 of the Business and Professions Code requires license holders to complete an assessment on state laws and board regulations at the time of renewal. Failure to do so within 60 days may result in disciplinary action, but will not affect license renewal. No fee is charged for the assessment. The assessment required for license renewal must cover state laws and board regulations related to professional land surveyors, focusing on the top violations and any changes to existing laws."
