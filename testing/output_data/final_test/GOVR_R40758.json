The DPJ now holds 308 seats in the 480-seat Lower House chamber and is in coalition with the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the People's New Party (PNP). Prime Minister Taro Aso has resigned, and DPJ leader Yukio Hatoyama is expected to become the next prime minister. The political changeover in Tokyo may impact U.S. interests in Asia, but analysts predict the U.S.-Japan alliance relationship will remain unchanged. The DPJ, now in power, aims to reform Japan's political-bureaucratic structure and stimulate the struggling economy. They have criticized aspects of the U.S.-Japan alliance, such as military realignment and HNS payments. The party also seeks closer relations with Asia and increased participation in UN activities. Despite the change in leadership, analysts believe the U.S.-Japan alliance relationship will not undergo significant changes. The conservative LDP has governed Japan since the 1950s, supporting the U.S.-Japan security treaty and seeking expanded defense cooperation. In 2007, the left-leaning DPJ gained control of the Upper House, leading to legislative gridlock. The DPJ increased popular support by criticizing the LDP's economic management and leadership, eventually defeating them in the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly elections in 2009. In July 2009, the DPJ defeated the LDP in Tokyo elections, leading to nationwide elections. The DPJ won over the LDP in August but fell short of a two-thirds majority in the Lower House. They maintained a coalition with the SDP and PNP to control the Upper House. The DPJ will need to fulfill some of its campaign promises as the main ruling party. The DPJ, as the main ruling party, is expected to focus on implementing domestic programs such as family allowances and reducing highway toll charges. Foreign policy and alliance relations with the United States are not immediate priorities, with the party showing a more pragmatic approach. However, there are divisions within the party on foreign policy issues. The DPJ was formed in 1998 through a merger. The DPJ, formed in 1998 through a merger of smaller parties, has internal contradictions between left and right wings, pacifists, and national security hawks. Issues like deploying Japanese troops abroad and revising Article 9 of the constitution have sparked internal debates, leading to a reputation of failing to agree on coherent alternatives to LDP policies. Leadership battles have also weakened the party. The DPJ, formed in 1998 through a merger of smaller parties, has internal contradictions between left and right wings, pacifists, and national security hawks. Leadership battles have weakened the party. Since winning the Upper House in 2007, the DPJ presented a more unified front in criticizing LDP policies. However, it is uncertain if this unity is sustainable now that the DPJ is the ruling party. Leading up to the August 30 Lower House elections, the DPJ showed resilience in overcoming political challenges and internal strife. Prime Minister Aso and the LDP were emboldened by a fundraising scandal involving Ichiro Ozawa, leading to his resignation as DPJ leader. Yukio Hatoyama succeeded him, resulting in a popular boost for the DPJ.

Prime Minister Aso and the LDP were emboldened by a fundraising scandal involving Ichiro Ozawa, leading to his resignation as DPJ leader. Yukio Hatoyama succeeded him, resulting in a popular boost for the DPJ. Ozawa's departure as party leader was followed by a considerable popular boost for the DPJ. By mid-July, many polls showed the DPJ having double-digit leads over the LDP when voters were asked which party they would support in the Lower House elections. Although Ozawa relinquished his high-profile role in the party, he remained in the DPJ as a behind-the-scenes campaign strategist and top party leader. He is widely credited with recruiting a large number of new party candidates who won in this year's landslide Lower House elections, causing many to speculate that Ozawa will continue to wield considerable influence in the intra-party decision-making process. Ideological divisions within the DPJ have kept the party from reaching a consensus on foreign policy and national security issues. However, the DPJ platform and other policy statements throughout the years consistently raise the following main themes: Adopting a more \"assertive\" foreign policy and enhancing Japan's defense capabilities. The DPJ aims to enhance Japan's defense capabilities and adopt a more assertive foreign policy. They prioritize maintaining the U.S.-Japan alliance while seeking a mature partnership. They advocate for reducing U.S. troops in Japan, maintaining constitutional restrictions on collective self-defense, and increasing contributions to international security. The party also focuses on improving relations with Asian countries, promoting regional economic integration, and supporting global initiatives like overseas economic development and nuclear non-proliferation. The Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) aims to enhance Japan's defense capabilities and foreign policy through various measures such as overseas economic development, environmental conservation, nuclear non-proliferation, and humanitarian relief. The party is divided into a pacifist/leftist wing adhering to Japan's \"peace constitution\" and a hawkish/conservative wing seeking stronger defense capabilities. Former party heads have differing views on Japan's contributions to international security, with the presumed next prime minister supporting a flexible approach to Japan Self-Defense Force deployments not under direct U.N. mandate. The DPJ also promotes a reformist domestic agenda. The DPJ promotes a reformist domestic agenda for Japan, emphasizing government decentralization and a broader social safety net. They aim to improve transparency, efficiency, and accountability in government, and increase the decision-making authority of Japan's Cabinet over the bureaucracy. They also propose creating a National Strategy Bureau under the prime minister's office for top-down direction over the national budget and domestic policies, believing that a \"regime change\" will reduce the influence of vested interests and lead to a more dynamic and decentralized nation. The DPJ's reform agenda aims to transform Japan's economy into a deregulated system driven by consumer-led growth. They propose increasing household disposable income through tax cuts and payment transfers, along with income support for struggling workers and health-care and pension reforms. Critics point out the lack of details on financing and implementation of these proposals.

Critics point out the lack of details on financing and implementation of these proposals. The political changeover in Tokyo following the August 30 elections represents a watershed moment for U.S.-Japan relations, with concerns about Japan's long-term budgetary health due to its high public sector debt. The Koizumi government supported the U.S. in anti-terror operations and sent JSDF units to Iraq for reconstruction. Bilateral agreements in 2005 and 2006 aimed to enhance the U.S.-Japan alliance. The DPJ's skepticism towards these security initiatives raised concerns about the alliance's future impact. The DPJ's stance on the U.S.-Japan alliance has been ambiguous, with conflicting signals and lack of clarity on what an \"independent\" and \"equal\" alliance means. Despite not advocating for disengagement, there are concerns about potential areas of cooperation with the incoming DPJ-led government. The DPJ's stance on the U.S.-Japan alliance suggests apprehension about perceived inequities and a desire for greater independence. This includes avoiding entanglement in U.S. global strategy and taking more initiative in international affairs. The party has opposed certain alliance management issues and U.S.-led operations. The DPJ has opposed various alliance management issues and U.S.-led military operations, including the Guam accord, relocation of U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, and the MSDF deployment to the Indian Ocean. They also promised to review Tokyo's Host Nation Support for U.S. forces in Japan. The DPJ has opposed various alliance management issues and U.S.-led military operations, including the Guam accord, relocation of U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, and the MSDF deployment to the Indian Ocean. They also proposed comprehensive revisions to the U.S.-Japan Status of Forces Agreement to make the alliance more \"equal.\" In February 2009, Ichiro Ozawa suggested reducing the U.S. force presence in Japan to only the U.S. 7th Fleet in Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture, sparking controversy. Despite concerns about their commitment to the alliance, the DPJ has expressed intentions for the SDF to take on greater responsibilities for defending Japan against outside threats. The DPJ has moderated its stance on key alliance issues, such as the Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law and the SOFA and HNS agreements with the United States. Despite past objections, the party appeared to soften its anti-U.S. positions before the Lower House elections. The DPJ is transitioning to take control of the government, raising questions about potential changes in Japan's relations with the United States. Some elements in the DPJ advocate for a UN-centered diplomacy and closer ties with Asia, which could shift Japanese diplomacy away from the US. However, the DPJ still supports a more active international role for Japan through UN-sanctioned activities that align with US foreign policy goals. The party's stance on foreign deployments was tested during the last Diet session. During the last Diet session, the Aso Cabinet introduced bills for Japanese vessels to participate in UN-sanctioned anti-piracy operations. The DPJ opposed the bills but acknowledged the legitimacy of the operations. Debate within the party continues on Japan's role in Afghanistan and its opposition to U.S.-led Operation Enduring Freedom. Experts predict the DPJ may approve similar measures once in power. The DPJ is considering alternative proposals for on-the-ground assistance in Afghanistan, such as vocational training programs and non-combat reconstruction efforts, despite setbacks in momentum for dispatching SDF troops. The party's 2009 \"Policy Index\" focuses on Japan's active role in reconstructing impoverished states to combat terrorist activities. Interest in increasing Japan's participation in Asian regional affairs is also evident. The DPJ is interested in increasing Japan's participation in Asian regional institutions and initiatives for regional cooperation, aiming for a more independent relationship from the United States. They advocate for Japan to play a significant role in creating an \"East Asian Community\" to assert leadership and engage with China. This approach falls short of replacing the U.S.-Japan alliance with a new regional security arrangement. The DPJ aims to enhance Japan's participation in regional meetings like ARF and APEC, with a focus on stronger ties with China and South Korea. They advocate for constructive dialogue to resolve territorial disputes and seek to restore trust by acknowledging Japanese aggression in WWII. The DPJ aims to restore trust with neighbors by acknowledging Japanese aggression in WWII and vows not to visit Yasukuni Shrine. They condemn North Korean nuclear tests and support cooperation in the Six-Party Talks for denuclearization. The DPJ supports cooperation in the Six-Party Talks for denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and backs strict sanctions against North Korea. They also align with the Obama Administration on global initiatives like preventing global warming. The DPJ's 2009 Manifesto emphasizes global warming as a core agenda item, calling for Japan to lead in environmental diplomacy and push for new emissions standards. They aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% below 1990 levels by 2020 and implement a cap-and-trade system for industrial polluters. The party aligns with the Obama Administration on climate change action and nuclear disarmament. The DPJ supports Japan's Three Non-Nuclear Principles and advocates for nuclear disarmament, differing from U.S. policies. Party leaders propose a \"nuclear-free zone\" in Northeast Asia, conflicting with Japan's reliance on the U.S. extended nuclear deterrent. A secret agreement allowing U.S. nuclear-armed vessels into Japanese ports was recently disclosed. The DPJ's response to Washington allowing U.S. nuclear-armed vessels into Japanese ports is under scrutiny as the party maneuvers to take control of the government. There is speculation on whether some DPJ members will adjust their stance on nuclear arms due to regional security threats. The party's economic policy, including a \u00a521 trillion stimulus plan, may lead to cooperation or conflict with U.S. interests. The DPJ aims to shift Japan towards a consumer-oriented economy, aligning with the Obama Administration's efforts to boost domestic consumption and public spending for global financial recovery. The DPJ's plan to shift Japan towards a consumer-oriented economy may boost imports of U.S. goods and services. The party supports free trade agreements but also aims to protect domestic agriculture and labor interests. They have called for bilateral economic partnership agreements and a U.S.-Japan Free Trade Agreement. The DPJ's economic policy agenda includes protectionist measures for domestic agriculture, hindering Japan's participation in trade negotiations. They have proposed severe restrictions on U.S. beef imports due to BSE concerns. The DPJ's victory in the Lower House elections in Japan has significant implications, breaking the long-standing LDP rule and increasing female lawmakers in the chamber. However, the party may face challenges in implementing its campaign promises due to the structural realities of the Japanese political system. The DPJ's victory in the Lower House elections in Japan will force compromises on its bold proposals as it relies on a coalition with the SDP and PNP to control the Upper House. The LDP and New Komeito coalition, now in opposition, may challenge DPJ-led policies. U.S. policymakers should monitor the transition of power and other key developments. The DPJ is finalizing discussions with potential coalition partners, including the SDP and PNP, to form a new government in Japan. Hatoyama is selecting key party posts and Cabinet positions, with top party members like Naoto Kan, Hirohisa Fujii, and Katsuya Okada expected to take on important roles. The Cabinet is set to be officially formed in mid-September during a special session of the Diet. The DPJ is finalizing discussions with potential coalition partners to form a new government in Japan. Hatoyama's appointment as prime minister will be voted on during a special Diet session in September. Ichiro Ozawa, ruled out for health reasons, will serve as DPJ secretary general and campaign strategist for upcoming elections. Party cohesion post-LDP victory is a key trend to monitor. The DPJ's victory over the LDP has removed opposition as a unifying factor, posing a challenge for party cohesion. Party leader Yukio Hatoyama's ability to maintain loyalty among members and manage a coalition with the SDP and PNP is crucial. The role of Ozawa and his followers within the DPJ remains uncertain, potentially leading to intra-party divisions. The DPJ-led government's stance on the U.S.-Japan alliance is a concern for U.S. policymakers due to inconsistent signals from the party. The DPJ-led government's stance on the U.S.-Japan alliance is a concern for U.S. policymakers. Key alliance issues include base realignment plans, Host Nation Support, Status of Forces Agreement, and renewal of the Anti-terrorism Special Measures Law. The DPJ's focus is initially on economic and administrative reforms, delaying addressing alliance-related issues. The DPJ-led government's management of the Japanese economy is a major concern for U.S. policymakers and Japanese voters. Japan is facing its worst recession since World War II, with a projected 6.2% GDP shrinkage this year. The DPJ's \u00a521 trillion stimulus package aims to increase household disposable income, promote domestic consumption, and address the country's growing public debt. Additionally, Japan's trade policy under the DPJ government may shift towards exploring new free trade agreements with the U.S. and other countries. The DPJ-led government in Japan faces challenges in managing the economy during a severe recession. Key concerns include implementing administrative reforms and striking a balance between reform and cooperation with the bureaucracy. The United States must cooperate with the new government in navigating these changes. The political changeover in Japan requires the United States to cooperate with a new government in Tokyo. President Obama may interact with the new Japanese prime minister at upcoming high-level events. The White House expressed confidence in the continued flourishing of the U.S.-Japan alliance under the new leadership."
