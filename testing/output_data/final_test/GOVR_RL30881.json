This led to negotiations for a powersharing agreement and changes in Senate procedures. The report reviews these events and agreements made on organizational and procedural issues. During the 107th Congress, the Senate faced organizational challenges due to a tied Senate after the 2000 elections and Senator James Jeffords switching party affiliation. The issue of Senate organization was further complicated by the election of Richard B. Cheney as Vice President. Negotiations about the organization of the Senate began informally in late November between the Democratic leader, Senator Tom Daschle. Negotiations for Senate organization began in late November between Senator Tom Daschle and Senator Trent Lott. Senator Daschle recognized as majority leader, made no attempt to replace Senate officers with Democratic nominees. The Senate elected Senator Robert C. Byrd as President pro tempore and designated committee chairmen on opening day. At the start of the 107th Congress, Senate committees underwent changes in leadership with the appointment of acting chairs and the adoption of S.Res. 7 to designate Democratic committee chairs until January 20. A powersharing resolution, S.Res. 8, was introduced by Senator Daschle to address party division in the Senate, which was agreed upon and applied for the duration of the Congress. The key provisions of S.Res. 8 included equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats on Senate committees, equal division of budgets and office space, and the ability for a full committee chair to discharge a subcommittee in case of a tie vote. These provisions were to remain in place for the duration of the 107th Congress unless Senate party strength changed. The agreement allowed committee leaders to discharge a measure or nomination from further consideration, with a debatable motion for 4 hours. If discharged by majority vote, the item would be placed on the Senate calendar. The agreement also restricted cloture motions on amendable items for the first 12 hours of debate and emphasized balance in scheduling Senate business. The agreement clarified Senate rules on proceeding to calendar items, with the Majority Leader retaining prerogative. Senator Harry Reid clarified the agreement and announced new procedures, including entering a colloquy into the Congressional Record. Leaders pledged to refrain from using preferential treatment. The two leaders pledged to refrain from using their preferential rights of recognition to \"fill the amendment tree\" in an effort to block consideration of controversial issues. Senator Lott declared the policy in a written colloquy, ensuring full and vigorous debates in the 107th Congress and honoring all Senators' right to have their amendments considered. Neither leader nor their designees will offer consecutive amendments to fill the amendment tree, allowing both sides the right to offer an amendment. This resolution does not limit the majority leader's right to amend a non-relevant amendment. During the powersharing period, minority party Senators were allowed to serve as presiding officers in the Senate, ending a two-decade practice of only majority party Senators serving in that role. Both parties were granted equal access to common space in the Capitol complex for meetings and events. Senator James Jeffords switched to become an Independent, giving Democrats a numerical advantage in the Senate. Senator Jeffords met with Senate Democrats on June 5, 2001, and announced his intention to vote with them on organizational questions. This led to negotiations between the two parties on arrangements under the new party division. Senator Lott appointed a team of Republican Senators to negotiate with Democratic leaders, while the Democrats did not name a comparable team. Discussions continued throughout June as the Senate took actions not directly related to the inter-party discussions. On June 6, the Senate elected Senator Robert C. Byrd as President pro tempore and thanked Senator Thurmond for his service. Party secretaries were also elected to serve as strategy consultants and communication links for senators. On June 6, the Senate elected party secretaries, Martin P. Paone for the majority and Elizabeth Letchworth for the minority. Letchworth later announced her retirement, and David Schiappa was elected as her replacement. Majority Leader Daschle aimed to speed up voting process starting June 7, 2001. On June 7, 2001, Senators would have a maximum of 20 minutes for roll call votes to increase efficiency. Senator Daschle expressed the need to end votes promptly to manage time effectively. Senator Daschle announced a new policy to impose discipline on votes, starting tomorrow. Republican Senators will no longer agree to preside over the Senate, leading to the resignation of the Secretary of the Senate. Gary Sisco resigned as Secretary of the Senate, and Jeri Thomson was elected as his replacement on July 12, 2001. James Ziglar was nominated to become Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, confirmed by the Senate on August 1, 2001. Alfonso Lenhardt was elected as Senate Sergeant at Arms on August 2, 2001. S.Res. 149 elected Lenhardt as Senate Sergeant at Arms effective September 4, 2001. An agreement on committees and organizational issues was reached before the Senate adjourned for the Independence Day recess. S.Res. 120 of June 29, 2001 provided for Democratic majorities on Senate committees, ensuring no loss of current assignments. Section 3 of the resolution stated that existing agreements on committee staff and funds would remain in effect, regardless of party shifts in the Senate. The tradition of \"senatorial courtesy\" allows Senators to block nominees in their state without public disclosure, known as the \"blue slip\" practice. Under a new policy announced by Senators Patrick Leahy and Orrin Hatch, the Senate Judiciary Committee will now treat \"blue slips\" as public information. This change aims to increase transparency in the confirmation process for U.S. Attorneys, U.S. Marshalls, and federal judges, regardless of party affiliation or committee leadership. The Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, with support from former leaders, has made blue slips public, aiming for transparency in nominations. Discussions focused on ensuring Senate floor votes for future Supreme Court vacancies, with Democrats opposing a formal guarantee and Republicans hesitant to make it a rule. Another Dear Colleague letter addressed the issue. The Chairman and Ranking Republican Member of the Judiciary Committee are prepared to carefully examine and assess presidential nominations for the Supreme Court. They intend to follow the Committee and Senate practices when considering nominees, even if there is opposition within the Committee. Discussions have taken place regarding Senate action on future Supreme Court nominations. In negotiations, Republican colleagues raised concerns about how Democrats would handle potential Supreme Court nominations. Senators Leahy and Hatch agreed that all nominees will receive fair consideration, following Judiciary Committee practices. This agreement aims to avoid any issues in the future. The Senate reached an agreement to avoid changes to the Standing Rules and Senate's responsibility in reviewing Supreme Court nominees. Concerns were raised about relocating committee staff due to the shift in political control. The Senate Rules and Administration Committee announced a schedule for moving staff and equipment to new committee rooms. Language in S.Res. 120 addressed the controversy surrounding changes in office space. The Senate Rules and Administration Committee clarified the authority over space allocation in Senate office buildings, with committee chairs responsible for implementing any decisions regarding their panels. The Senate Rules and Administration Committee clarified that the Rules Committee does not intervene in space allocation decisions of committees. The Senate also approved a resolution to rename the Committee on Small Business to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. The Senate approved a resolution to promote economic development by including entrepreneurial companies in the US. S.Res. 123 did not change the committee's jurisdiction. A standing order was agreed upon for future nominations of Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, with specific referral procedures to the Armed Services and Environment and Public Works Committees. The Senate approved a resolution for economic development, with specific referral procedures for nominations. Committees made new assignments for members, with Senator Jeffords as the new chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Some committees revised internal rules, and conferees were not named traditionally during the powersharing period. Senate processes for reaching conference were handled by unanimous consent. During the powersharing period in the Senate, disputes over the ratio of Republicans to Democrats in conference delegations led to only two measures going to conference. The Budget Act governed conference procedures for the budget resolution and reconciliation bill. Despite the shift in party control, there were no public objections to the chair appointing conferees, while private negotiations among Senators and party leaders continued. The powersharing agreement was an experimental departure from established practices, with the success of any Senate organizational settlement depending on adaptability. The success of any Senate organizational settlement depends on adaptability to changing circumstances. Senator Lott's comments on the powersharing agreement apply to S.Res. 120, with potential disagreements on its provisions. Senator Daschle and Senator Lott may need to address issues of good faith or mistakes in the future. The resolution submitted by Mr. Daschle and Mr. Lott in the 107th Congress ensures that Senate committees will be equally composed of members from both parties, with equal budgets and office space allocated. The resolution in the 107th Congress ensures equal composition of Senate committees with balanced budgets and office space allocation. Committee ratios will be adjusted if either party gains a majority of Senators during the Congress. The resolution in the 107th Congress states that members who do not adhere to it will be removed from committees, with chairmanships held by the majority party. Additional Standing Orders allow for discharge of legislative items or nominations in case of tie votes, with limited debate time. In the 107th Congress, a resolution was passed stating that members not following the rules will be removed from committees. Additional Standing Orders allow for discharge of legislative items or nominations in case of tie votes, with limited debate time. During the 107th Congress, a resolution was passed regarding the organization of the Senate, giving the Majority Party a one-seat majority on every committee. The motion to proceed to any Legislative or Executive Calendar item remains the prerogative of the Majority Leader, but other Senators can also make such a motion. The resolution gives the Majority Party a one-seat majority on Senate committees, with the exception of the Select Committee on Ethics. Committee assignments are not affected by the resolution. Majority and Minority Leaders can appoint committee members. Existing agreements on committee funding and space remain unless modified. The resolution will cease to be effective if the Senate ratio changes. The resolution gives the Majority Party a one-seat majority on Senate committees, except for Sec. 3, which may change if the Senate ratio changes."
