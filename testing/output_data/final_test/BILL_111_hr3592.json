    "content": "The \"Plastics Recycling Act of 2009\" may provide a production tax credit for certain recycling activities under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Plastics Recycling Act of 2009\" may offer a tax credit for waste plastic recycling activities, based on the production of qualified synthetic oil from qualified feedstock at a recycling facility. The credit is calculated as 60 cents per gallon of oil used or sold by the taxpayer to an unrelated party. The tax credit for waste plastic recycling activities is based on the production of qualified synthetic oil from eligible feedstocks. The credit is reduced if non-qualifying feedstock is used, and if it exceeds 15%, the credit is zero. Qualified synthetic oil must have a market value of at least 90% of crude oil. A qualified small conversion process recycling facility is owned by the taxpayer, placed in service after the enactment of the section but before January 1, 2015, and has a daily production capacity of up to 2,000 barrels of qualified synthetic oil. Eligible feedstock includes post-consumer and post-industrial waste plastics, and plastic is any material derived from the resin identification system developed by the Society of the Plastics Industry in 1988. The Plastics Industry (SPI) developed the resin identification system in 1988. Rules similar to section 45(e) apply for credits. No double benefit is allowed for fuel credits under sections 40, 40A, or 6426. Coordination with Treasury grants is required for oil credits. No credits are allowed for oil if a grant is received under the Plastics Recycling Act of 2009. The tax credit for oil under section 45(e) will be adjusted if a grant is received before the end of the taxable year. The tax imposed on the taxpayer will be increased by the amount of the credit allowed under section 38. The general business carryforwards under section 39 will be adjusted to recapture any portion of the credit not allowed. The grant amount will be determined without reducing the basis of the property. Grants received will not be included in the taxpayer's gross income. The tax code is amended to include a new waste plastic recycling credit under section 45R(a) as part of the general business credit. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the tax code. The tax code is amended to include a new waste plastic recycling credit under section 45R. Grants for oil produced from certain recycling activities will be provided in lieu of tax credits. Effective date for amendments is after the enactment of this Act. The Secretary of the Treasury will grant waste plastic recycling credits under section 45R of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Grants will be determined in the same manner as the credits for the taxable year. Certain non-taxpayers, such as government entities and certain organizations, are excluded from receiving grants. Entities eligible for waste plastic recycling credits under section 45R of the Internal Revenue Code include organizations exempt from tax, entities referred to in specific sections of the Code, and partnerships where partners meet certain criteria. Grants under this section are treated as credit provisions for appropriation purposes."
