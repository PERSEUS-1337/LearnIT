The Act, titled the \"Empowerment Zone and Renewal Community Enhancement Act of 2006,\" includes amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, extending benefits such as designations for Empowerment Zones, Enterprise Communities, and Renewal Communities until December 31, 2015. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to extend benefits for Empowerment Zones, Enterprise Communities, and Renewal Communities until December 31, 2015. Various sections are amended to update dates to January 1, 2016, December 31, 2016, and December 31, 2020. SEC. 3. REVISION OF BENEFITS. Safe Harbor for Meeting Requirement That 35 Percent of Employees Be Residents of Zone.--Paragraph (2) of section 1394(b) is amended to include an additional safe harbor provision for businesses in enterprise zones. This provision allows businesses to meet the requirement that 35 percent of employees be residents of the zone if certain conditions are met within a specified timeframe. In a business located in a renewal community or rural area in an empowerment zone or enterprise community, there must be 500 full-time employees. For businesses outside a rural area in an empowerment zone or enterprise community, there must be 1,000 full-time employees. Alternatively, 10 percent of the estimated number of full-time employees in the zone or community on the date of its designation must be employed. On the date of its designation, if a business issues bonds, it is expected to increase employment by at least one job for every $150,000 in face amount of the issue within 3 years. Alternatively, the business can enter into an agreement with the local government employment agency to prioritize employment opportunities for qualified individuals. The amendment allows businesses developing intangibles within the empowerment zone to qualify for opportunities. The applicable percentage for qualified zone employees in the empowerment zone is 20 percent. The applicable percentage for qualified zone employees in the empowerment zone is 20 percent for designated employees of enterprise zone businesses and 10 percent for other designated employees. There are limitations on the number of designated employees who qualify. Designations under this subparagraph for empowerment zones are made by the local government or governments that nominated the area. The number of employees designated under this subparagraph cannot exceed 500 for subparagraph (A)(i) and 2,000 for subparagraph (A)(ii). The amendment modifies the qualifications for a zone employee and the carryforward of unallocated state commercial revitalization expenditure ceiling. The amendment adjusts the criteria for zone employees and the carryforward of unallocated state commercial revitalization expenditure ceilings. It also grants authority to expand zone and community boundaries. The amendment allows for the expansion of designated areas for empowerment zones, enterprise communities, and renewal communities at the request of all nominating governments, if the expansion aligns with the original designation purposes. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may expand designated areas for renewal communities to include noncontiguous areas if governments prove it aligns with the original designation purposes. The poverty rate criteria based on 2000 census data for expansion is modified. The exclusion of central business districts is repealed. Repeal of exclusion of central business district from eligibility as designated area and carryover of unused increased section 179 expensing limit. Unused Increased Limitation for section 179(b)(1) allows for excess limitation to be used from previous years, up to $35,000. The ordering rule prioritizes using the limitation from the second preceding year, then the first preceding year, and finally the current year. Additionally, a new subsection allows for an election of a financing arrangement instead of tax benefits under Section 1396. Section 1396 is amended to allow significant empowerment zone businesses to elect a financing arrangement instead of tax benefits. This election means the business will not be treated as an enterprise zone business and will not receive depreciation deductions for qualified zone property. The Secretary will make payments to the holder of the designated debt obligation during the payment period. The Secretary will make payments to the holder of the designated debt obligation at the beginning of each year of the payment period, equal to the value of tax benefits the zone business would be entitled to without the election. The payment period for qualified zone property is 15 years with a 25 percent tax rate. A \"significant empowerment zone business\" is a trade or business operating in an empowerment zone nominated by the State or local government. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development must determine that the business will increase employment in the zone by at least 1,000 full-time employees or 10 percent of the estimated number of full-time employees within the first 3 years of the payment period. (j) Certain Federally Guaranteed Bonds Issued to Provide Investments in Empowerment Zones and Renewal Communities Permitted to Be Tax-Exempt. Subparagraph (A) of section 149(b)(3) is amended to include guarantees by a Federal Home Loan Bank for bonds used to provide property in an empowerment zone or renewal community. (k) Tax-Exempt Interest of Financial Institutions on Zone Facility Bonds Not Subject to Interest Disallowance. Subparagraph (B) addresses the tax-exempt interest of financial institutions on zone facility bonds. The term 'qualified tax-exempt obligation' now includes enterprise zone facility bonds. These amendments apply to taxable years after the enactment of the Act. The Secretary of the Treasury must report annually on tax benefits claimed for each empowerment zone, enterprise community, and renewal community."
