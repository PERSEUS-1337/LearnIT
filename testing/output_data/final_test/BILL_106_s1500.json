    "content": "The Act titled \"Medicare Beneficiary Access to Quality Nursing Home Care Act of 1999\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. Congress finds that Medicare beneficiaries are facing reduced access to skilled nursing facility services due to inadequate reimbursement, which could lead to facility closures and increased hospital stays for beneficiaries. The Health Care Financing Administration and Medicare Payment Advisory Commission have highlighted issues with the payment system for skilled nursing facility services, indicating that it does not accurately cover the costs of medically complex care and non-therapy ancillary services. This could result in inadequate funding for beneficiaries needing high levels of such services. According to MedPAC, inadequate funding for skilled nursing facility services could lead to access problems for beneficiaries with complex medical conditions. The prospective payment system must consider costs for services like ventilator care, tracheostomy care, pressure ulcer care, stroke or hip fracture care, non-vent, non-trach pneumonia care, dialysis, infusion therapy, and deep vein thrombosis care. A temporary legislative solution is needed to ensure Medicare beneficiaries with complex conditions receive skilled nursing facility services. The payment gap between actual costs and reimbursement levels for these services under the prospective payment system is evident. The Health Care Financing Administration did not account for the cost of services in the skilled nursing facility market basket index under the prospective payment system, as required by the Social Security Act. Modification of case mix categories for certain conditions under the Social Security Act to increase adjusted Federal per diem rates for services provided to individuals in RUGS III category. The Social Security Act modifies case mix categories to increase Federal per diem rates for services provided in RUGS III categories, with specific payment add-ons ranging from $17.04 to $76.25. The Secretary will update payment add-ons for fiscal year 2001 based on skilled nursing facility market basket percentage change. The date described is when adjustments for non-therapy ancillary services are implemented. Modification to the SNF update to the first cost reporting period under the Social Security Act includes amendments to reduce percentage points effective from October 1, 1999."
