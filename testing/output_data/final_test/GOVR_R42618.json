    "content": "The term \"conflict minerals\" refers to metal ores like coltan, cassiterite, wolframite, and gold, which are linked to fueling armed conflict and human rights abuses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Efforts have been made to address the connection between these minerals and conflict through investigations, research studies, and policy advocacy campaigns. Efforts to cut links between minerals trade and armed conflict in eastern DRC have led to the implementation of measures by policy makers and industry groups in the US and abroad. Congressional attention has focused on the political instability in Congo since the overthrow of Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997. Multiple resolutions and bills have been introduced to address the conflicts, with Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act being a key US law aimed at halting the trade in conflict minerals. The SEC rule-making process for finalizing Section 1502 implementing rules has faced delays. Congressional efforts to address conflict in the DRC have aligned with executive branch activities. State Department and USAID officials have monitored instability in eastern DRC for nearly two decades, implementing aid programs to break links between conflict, human rights abuses, and minerals. International initiatives and UN sanctions have also aimed to achieve similar goals. The UNSC has imposed sanctions to curb conflict minerals trade in the DRC, with support from donor governments and industry groups implementing certification schemes to track mineral supply chains and prevent funding of armed actors. These efforts aim to promote transparent and conflict-free mineral purchasing and trade in central Africa. Efforts to curb conflict minerals trade in the DRC involve certification schemes to track mineral supply chains and prevent funding of armed actors in the region. Due diligence processes developed by the OECD are a key component of these public and private sector initiatives, particularly in the conflict-affected areas of eastern DRC near Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi. The provinces of North and South Kivu, as well as the district of Ituri, have been persistently affected by conflict, leading to a breakdown of law and order and socioeconomic devastation. The conflict in eastern DRC has led to a breakdown of law and order, causing socioeconomic devastation. Armed militias with various motivations have emerged, resulting in extreme human rights abuses. Factors contributing to the conflicts include inter-ethnic competition, political grievances, and discrimination against ethnic minorities. Integration of non-state armed groups into the national military has been a challenge. The conflict in eastern DRC has led to a breakdown of law and order, causing socioeconomic devastation. Factors contributing to the conflicts include lack of military training, contested command and control, corruption, poverty, unequal resource distribution, criminal opportunism, and foreign state military interventions. Conflict is also fueled by competition and conflict over resources like land rights, timber, agricultural commodities, illicit drugs, and fishing rights. The conflict in eastern DRC is fueled by competition over resources like land rights, timber, agricultural commodities, illicit drugs, and fishing rights. Additionally, there is conflict over mineral reserves, mining, and trade, leading to the exploitation of \"conflict minerals\" under poor labor conditions and benefiting armed groups through black-market trade. The conflict in eastern DRC is fueled by competition over various resources, including conflict minerals like Columbite-tantalite (coltan), which are key components in electronics manufacturing. These minerals benefit armed groups through black-market trade and have drawn international attention due to their role in supplying global commodities trade. In the early 2000s, production and sales of coltan in the eastern DRC rose sharply, leading to increased concern over conflict minerals. Niobium, a highly malleable and heat-resistant metal, is used in various applications such as jet and rocket engines, medical technology, and jewelry. The DRC is a marginal source of niobium but a significant global source of tantalite. The DRC is a significant global source of tantalite, with its share of world supplies rising to 20.5%. Cassiterite is the main ore source of tin, often found with coltan in the DRC. Tin is used in solders, plating, and alloys, with demand increasing due to laws phasing out lead in electronics. Wolframite is the ore of tungsten, used in cemented carbide for various industries. The DRC is a marginal source of wolframite, supplying between .5% and nearly 1% of world supplies between 2006 and 2010. Gold has ornamental, coinage, electronics, and industrial applications. DRC is a relatively minor global gold supplier, contributing 0.2% of annual world gold supplies from 2006 to 2010, but its actual contribution may be as high as 2% annually. Numerous investigations have been conducted on the role of the minerals sector in the war economy of eastern DRC, focusing on factors like trade structures, illicit shipments, market ties, armed groups' earnings, and human rights abuses. Policy recommendations have been made to stop the trade in conflict minerals. Various proposals have been made to address the conflict minerals trade in the DRC, including military or political negotiations, regulatory reforms, and the use of sanctions or international criminal prosecution. Other suggestions focus on streamlining the mineral export sector through reducing red tape and increasing regulatory effectiveness. Certified production and trading partnerships have also been proposed to support legitimate trade. Certified production and trading partnerships have been proposed to support legitimate mineral commerce. One model involves independent monitoring at compliant mines to ensure adherence to national laws and labor standards, free of armed groups, and providing fair wages. Certified ore from these sites would receive a legitimacy certificate. Another model suggests mandatory regulatory schemes with specified criteria, such as conflict-free mineral purchasing, with punitive sanctions for non-compliance. Certificate systems aim to incentivize good behavior and secure monitored supply chains. Certificate systems are proposed to support legitimate mineral commerce by ensuring compliance with national laws and labor standards at mines. These systems may incorporate due diligence efforts and forensic technologies to vet the source supply origins. However, the viability of these proposals is uncertain due to various challenges such as cost, technical complexity, and opposition from interest groups. The conflicts in eastern DRC present a significant obstacle to any interventions aimed at addressing these issues comprehensively. Among the approaches to breaking mineral-conflict linkages, due diligence efforts like the OECD Guidance have gained support from various stakeholders. These initiatives aim to establish conflict-free mineral sourcing standards, with the OECD Guidance being a primary standard proposed for incorporation into SEC rules. The OECD Guidance, developed in 2011 with international support, promotes legal and ethical business conduct in areas with weak rule of law. It is a key standard for chain of custody tracking systems and due diligence efforts like Section 1502 of P.L. 111-203 to break links between mineral trade and conflict in the DRC. SEC-regulated firms using 3TGs in their products report supply sources from DRC and due diligence. Proponents argue Section 1502 mitigates investment risks, while critics see it as non-germane SEC regulation. Some argue that Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which addresses conflict minerals from the DRC, imposes financial and regulatory burdens outside the Act's intended scope. Critics question the legislative process behind its enactment. Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires SEC-regulated entities to report on their activities involving conflict minerals like coltan, cassiterite, gold, and wolframite from the DRC or neighboring countries. Other minerals in the region, such as bauxite, uranium, and cobalt, could also be designated as conflict minerals. This amendment aims to increase transparency in the supply chain. Firms must disclose if they use conflict minerals from the DRC or neighboring countries, submit a report on due diligence measures, and provide an independent audit. Transparency is required to inform investors, businesses, and consumers. The report under Section 1502 requires firms to disclose their use of conflict minerals, provide due diligence measures, and undergo independent audits to inform investors, businesses, and consumers. Non-compliance may result in penalties such as fines and SEC enforcement actions. Public comments on the rule-making have been submitted by various stakeholders with differing interests. International responses to Section 1502 have been positive, with concerns raised about its compatibility with existing due diligence systems. U.S.-listed firms and industry groups have mixed reactions, with some supporting the goal of reducing conflict in the DRC but questioning the high costs and logistical challenges of compliance. Many view the SEC's draft rules for Section 1502 as containing costly provisions that are difficult to meet. Suggestions have been made to phase in the final rules to allow for existing mineral certification projects to mature and build compliance with traceability schemes in the eastern DRC. Supporters of a phase-in argue that existing supply contracts and product supply chains are not compatible with a single deadline. Many U.S. advocates of Section 1502 support rapid adoption of final rules, while some suggest amendments to the SEC's proposed rules. Advocacy groups believe the costs of implementing Section 1502 are justified and not as prohibitive as business groups claim. Arguments for quick rule implementation emphasize the need to break the persistent link between conflict minerals and supply chains. Many advocates urge rapid adoption of final rules for Section 1502, citing delays that undermine efforts to break the link between conflict minerals and human rights abuses. Some firms fear a buyers' boycott due to compliance concerns, leading to decreased mineral procurement from eastern DRC. Critics argue that the effects of Section 1502 have been destructive even before implementation and call for its abandonment. The de facto boycott of minerals from eastern DRC was intensified by delays in issuing rules for Section 1502, leading to decreased purchases. The DRC government's ban on mineral mining in the region from September 2010 to March 2011 aimed to enforce compliance and deploy mining police, but had limited success in curbing illegal mining. The Conflict-Free Smelter program further deepened the boycott by requiring documentation from credible sourcing programs. The Conflict-Free Smelter program, a voluntary industry association-run initiative, set a deadline of April 1, 2011, to ensure conflict-free sourcing of raw materials. This deadline aimed to make the electronics supply chain conflict-free by January 1, 2012. However, delays in implementing related certification programs in eastern DRC hindered sourcing from the region, leading to a rush to sell minerals before the deadline. Since then, eastern DRC exporters have struggled to sell to major buyers like refineries and smelters. The boycott on minerals from eastern DRC has caused economic hardship, increased smuggling, and negatively impacted provincial government revenues. Local effects are described as catastrophic, leading to economic collapse, loss of income for miners, and a decline in local businesses. Unemployed miners and their families are struggling to meet basic needs. The boycott on minerals from eastern DRC has led to economic hardship, increased smuggling, and reduced provincial government revenues. Mineral traders are selling to Chinese companies without requiring due diligence, potentially benefiting armed groups. The boycott has discouraged local miners from implementing due diligence efforts due to lack of buyers. Despite negative consequences, some view Section 1502 as having positive effects, prompting changes in mineral sourcing practices. Efforts to operationalize due diligence systems in mineral sourcing are showing positive results in conflict-free areas like Rwanda and Katanga. These models demonstrate how OECD Guidance-based processes can work in practice, reducing conflict financing and promoting good governance in the mining sector. The Dodd Frank Act has had a positive impact on reducing conflict financing and preserving access to international markets for artisanal miners in the DRC. The Dodd Frank Act has significantly reduced conflict financing in the DRC by shifting mining to less conflict-prone provinces and decreasing demand for conflict minerals. Section 1502 has had a positive impact on due diligence efforts worldwide and should not be weakened. The SEC has faced challenges in implementing Section 1502 of the Dodd Frank Act due to the lack of operational certification systems in conflict-prone areas like the Kivus. Delays in final adoption have been attributed to the large volume of comments and potential court suits, despite criticism from supporters of Section 1502. The extended commentary period on SEC rule-making for Section 1502 of the Dodd Frank Act has sparked constructive debate and allowed parties with differing interests to find solutions and consensus on issues like rules phase-in and complementarity with OECD Guidance. Despite some contention, a phased-in approach is likely to be included in the SEC rules, along with scheduled benchmarks to comply with congressional intent. Various legal, technical, logistical, and human rights issues are being addressed in the rule-making process. Key legal and technical questions in the Section 1502 rule-making process focus on defining Product \"functionality\" and determining the coverage of tools containing conflict minerals. The SEC has proposed that tools used in manufacturing may not be covered under the law. The SEC has proposed that tools used in manufacturing may not be covered under the law, but there is debate over who is required to report under the law and the interpretation of the term \"manufacture.\" Various commentators have suggested including a definition, with proposed definitions ranging from broadly inclusive to quite narrow. There is also debate over whether mining operators should be defined. The debate continues over the definition of \"manufacturers\" and reporting thresholds for firms involved in the production of products. This includes considerations for mining operators, derivatives of minerals, recycled supplies, and credibility standards for mineral country-of-origin inquiries. Uncertainty remains on how to differentiate between state military or armed groups in the supply chain. The challenge lies in distinguishing between state military or police forces and armed groups involved in human rights abuses or criminal activities related to conflict minerals. Uncertainty surrounds the definition of \"indirectly finance or benefit\" and the burden of proving compliance for firms with existing contracts that may not align with Section 1502 requirements. Additionally, questions arise regarding the status of materials already in processing and supply pipelines before the rules were adopted. The challenges in implementing Section 1502 of the law include uncertainties in defining \"persons described,\" compliance standards for accountants and auditors, reporting modalities, determining compliance costs for small manufacturers, and the Department of State's conflict minerals strategy transmitted to Congress in 2011. The U.S. Strategy to Address the Linkages between Human Rights Abuses, Armed Groups, Mining of conflict minerals, and Commercial Products focuses on security force reforms, support for DRC government mineral trade regulatory systems, protection of small-scale miners and local communities, curbing illicit minerals trading, and promoting responsible trade. The strategy also includes views on punitive measures against activities supporting armed groups and human rights violations. The State Department published an initial conflict minerals map, but it lacks sufficient information. An updated conflict minerals map was published in late May 2012, but it lacks sufficient information for companies to conduct effective due diligence on their supply chains. USAID is implementing programs under the Responsible Minerals Trade (RMT) program, funded with $10 million from FY2010 Section 1207 appropriations and $4.78 million from FY2011 Complex Crises Fund (CCF) appropriations. The USAID DRC country mission is directly implementing a three-part RMT component program with $8 million of this funding, supporting field-level infrastructure and training efforts to help the DRC government implement its pilot program. The USAID is supporting field-level infrastructure and training efforts in the DRC to implement a conflict-free mineral supply certification system. This includes rehabilitating trading centers, reducing child labor in mining, and providing technical support to mining authorities. USAID is implementing conflict-free minerals supply chain initiatives and providing capacity-building to help the artisanal mining sector transition to a formal production model. In January 2012, USAID allocated $4.78 million to mitigate consequences of the mineral trade embargo and support mining sector reform. Funding will support the operationalization of the ICGLR Minerals Chain Auditor to scale up validation and traceability systems in conflict zones for economic recovery and job creation. USAID is providing $1.2 million for community mediation, alternative livelihoods, and civil society engagement in conflict-free supply chains in the DRC. The program aims to break links between illegal mineral exploitation, conflict, and human rights abuses by supporting certification implementation and oversight mechanisms for remote militarized mines. The program funded by USAID aims to support certification implementation and oversight mechanisms for remote militarized mines in eastern DRC through local capacity building. It focuses on building local security, human rights abuse, corruption, and mineral traceability capacities, operationalizing mineral trading posts, improving traceability and certified trade, and providing public education on minerals sector governance and reforms. Efforts by USAID and DRL, along with State Department programs, aim to address conflict and human rights abuses in the minerals trade in eastern DRC. These efforts include training mining police, promoting rule of law, workers' rights, and justice goals. The effectiveness of international conflict mineral trade abatement efforts in ending human rights abuses in the region is still debated. However, focusing on ending the conflict mineral trade could help reduce human rights violations in the long run. Efforts to reduce human rights violations and crimes in the mineral trade in eastern DRC may depend on various factors such as security, demobilization of armed groups, accountability for abuses, and enhanced regulatory capacity. It is uncertain if due diligence efforts can be effective in the face of ongoing insecurity. The impact of removing armed groups' access to mineral revenues through conflict-free trading schemes on conflict reduction is also unclear. Efforts to reduce human rights violations and crimes in the mineral trade in eastern DRC may depend on various factors such as security, demobilization of armed groups, accountability for abuses, and enhanced regulatory capacity. The challenge of actors' access to mineral revenues through conflict-free trading schemes is compounded by technical complexity and the need for external assistance. Without substantial support and local buy-in, the credibility and sustainability of these efforts are uncertain. The potential success of such schemes is also hindered by the involvement of state military elements in the mineral sector, which may need substantial reform. State security forces and armed non-state groups in central Africa have been involved in exploitative mining activities, hindering state regulation and security sector reforms. Mineral certification schemes have shown promise but face challenges in conflict-affected eastern DRC. Success depends on overall security, stability, and ending impunity for human rights abuses. Efforts to ensure security, end impunity for human rights abuses, and undertake reforms including military and police training, use of armed force to control mining sites, political agreements over site control, civil society involvement, criminal prosecution, and capacity building for trade regulation and mining are crucial in central Africa to combat exploitative mining activities and promote security sector reforms. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and neighboring countries, efforts are being made to improve institutional capacity for trade regulation, mining, and border control. This includes targeted assistance for artisanal miners affected by due diligence initiatives, reform of mineral tax rates and revenue sharing formulas, increased reporting on mineral sector data, adherence to transparency initiatives, and reform of mining contracts and laws to consider various interest groups. Donor governments and international organizations emphasize the importance of multi-faceted approaches in addressing conflict minerals. Congress is likely to closely monitor the implementation of Section 1502 rules and other conflict mineral-focused programs. SEC rule-making and implementation may present challenges, potentially leading Congress to reconsider the Section 1502 rule. Reactions to potential SEC rules on Section 1502 are expected to be complex. Given substantial opposition to the anticipated rule by some industry actors and Members of Congress, political and legal action may ensue to amend or overturn the rules. However, support for the law from a substantial number of Members of Congress and non-governmental organizations may lead to stiff opposition. Implementation of the law's provisions and other conflict mineral abatement efforts are likely to be complex and draw congressional attention. Substantial financial and applied efforts are being invested in these initiatives. Armed conflict in eastern DRC has long posed security, governance, and human rights challenges, with various armed militias in the region. Some Members of Congress may consider a more comprehensive approach to ending conflict and building peace in the area. The conflict in eastern DRC has roots in two wars that began in Rwanda, leading to the influx of Hutu refugees into eastern Zaire. The exiled Hutu militia forces used refugee camps as a base for cross-border attacks into Rwanda, exacerbating local ethnic tensions and competition over resources. In 1996, an RPF-backed force led by Banyamulenge broke up refugee camps in Zaire, leading to a mass repatriation of refugees to Rwanda. This action sparked a conflict with Hutu elements and the Zairian Armed Forces. Subsequently, the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (AFDL) was formed, which, backed by neighboring governments, overthrew Mobutu Sese Seko's regime in 1997. This led to a second civil war in August 1998. In May 1997, Kinshasa saw a change in state power. A second civil war erupted in August 1998, triggered by a military rebellion in the east due to concerns over corruption and poor governance under Kabila. This war led to the formation of new armed factions and intervention by neighboring states. Kabila was assassinated in 2001, succeeded by his son Joseph Kabila, the recently re-elected president. Peace accords signed from 1999 onwards eventually led to a U.N. peacekeeping mission and the establishment of an interim Congolese government based on a 2002 peace agreement, paving the way for national elections in 2006. The peace process following the second civil war in the DRC led to the emergence of new armed groups in the eastern region. These groups, some with foreign support, evolved into various alliances, including armed Congolese Tutsi factions, Hutu refugee groups, and local defense militias. The situation was further complicated by the integration of former rebel groups into the national military. The integration of former non-state rebel groups into the FARDC has complicated the situation, with some maintaining control outside of national military authorities. Neighboring countries like Rwanda have also intervened in the region, sometimes covertly or openly. In Ituri district, conflicts involving ethnic factions, FARDC troops, peacekeepers, and criminal gangs occurred from 1999 to 2007. In provinces south of the Kivus, Mai-Mai and FARDC elements have been involved in conflicts. In Haut-Katanga and South Kivu provinces, Mai-Mai and FARDC elements have engaged in periodic conflicts and attacks on civilians for criminal reasons. The Regional Certification Mechanism (RCM) of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) aims to coordinate mineral certification efforts and ensure a legal and conflict-free minerals trade. The Regional Certification Mechanism (RCM) aims to facilitate conflict-free mineral trade in the region, providing a mechanism for downstream buyers to ensure ethical purchases. It also serves as an early warning system for monitoring conflict risks in mineral mining and trading. The United States and other donors support the RCM. The United States and other donors support the RCM and DRC Mining Legal Reforms and Minerals Certification Efforts. Inter-agency DRC government working groups, with donor assistance, are promoting legal reforms and developing a national traceability and certified trading chain system. The CN system ensures legal title, work site safety, and environmental practices in line with international standards. Key reforms include traceability, certification, and due diligence legal requirements under the national mining code. Public disclosure of mineral contracts is mandated by DRC government decrees. The DRC government has implemented various reforms in the mining sector, including public disclosure of mineral contracts, mandatory certification for 3T and gold, and compliance with international standards. There is a proposed reform to involve artisanal miners in the legal framework. Concordance between provincial and national laws is also being considered for reform. Additionally, a multi-stakeholder agreement was signed in early 2011 to implement certification systems in certain provinces. The DRC government has implemented reforms in the mining sector, including public disclosure of mineral contracts and mandatory certification for 3T and gold. A multi-stakeholder agreement was signed to implement certification systems in certain provinces, leading to the establishment of Mine Monitoring Commissions. Efforts are underway to establish a national mineral database and categorize mine sites based on ICGLR and OECD guidelines. Several sites in South Kivu and North Kivu have been designated as green-flagged. The government, with donor support, has designated multiple mining sites in South Kivu and North Kivu as green-flagged. Detailed maps show control of these sites by various actors. Efforts include ongoing mapping, technical capacity building, outreach, training, and public education in the mining sector. CdNs act as trading posts for legal minerals under certification systems, with plans to establish more in the Kivus. The initial goal is to establish five CdNs in the Kivus, with plans for 16-17 in each of the Kivus and 72 nationwide. Four CdNs have been completed, with a fifth expected soon. Efforts are being made to rehabilitate roads to the centers and engage local mineral traders. However, some local actors are not conducting required assessments, posing a threat to CN success. Limited state capacity, funding, corruption, and varying political will may also challenge CN implementation. Many key local actors are undergoing CN training. The ITRI Tin Supply Chain Initiative is the main traceability system used in the DRC and Rwanda, supported by Pact, a USAID project implementer. Certified trading is successful in Katanga due to formalization and stable security conditions. iTSCi is a traceability system in the DRC and Rwanda for large-scale mineral traders to undergo risk assessments. It helps businesses comply with OECD Guidance, ICGLR RCM, and national mineral certification requirements. iTSCi aims to enable Section 1502 compliance and has been implemented in Rwanda and Katanga province since 2011. iTSCi, a traceability system in the DRC and Rwanda, was piloted in Kalimbi mining area in South Kivu in 2010 but suspended due to a mining ban. Plans for expansion depend on funding, security, and buyer participation. The program, funded by industry levies, uses mineral tagging and database tracking for compliance with OECD Guidance and ICGLR RCM. Expansion to Burundi and Uganda is possible, with a focus on tax verification that can slow trading. The iTSCi traceability system in the DRC and Rwanda faces challenges such as slow trading due to absent officials, reduced earnings prompting abandonment of participation, illicit tag sales by corrupt officials, and stolen tags leading to acceptance of ore from various sources. Government entities in both countries are responsible for tagging mineral bags, with reports of tag theft and use of falsified tags for smuggling. The Group of Experts found that fraudulent tagging and smuggling of untagged minerals in Rwanda are undermining the credibility of the certification system. Rwandan and DRC border officials seize illicit imports, but the iTSCi model's cumbersome and expensive tagged consignment logbook system poses challenges. The iTSCi system for tracking minerals has a high cost, acting as a disincentive for smaller commercial actors. In contrast, the CTC system in Rwanda is reportedly less expensive. Both systems use tags or RFID chips for tracking consignments, with data uploaded to a server. The Conflict-Free Smelter Program is also mentioned in relation to mineral traceability. The Conflict-Free Smelter (CFS) Program, initiated in 2009 by the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) and Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI), supports conflict-free mineral sourcing through evaluation of smelter mineral input origin and status. It allows smelters to verify to buyers that they produce \"conflict-free\" metals, covering tantalum and gold with plans to include tin and tungsten. The main elements include reviewing firm policies on conflict minerals, assessing smelter input materials for conflict-free status, and vetting compliance with CFS standards. The Conflict-Free Smelter (CFS) Program, initiated in 2009 by EICC/GeSI, covers gold, tin, and tungsten. The CFS protocol is OECD Guidance-compliant and accessible to select actors. There are 17 CFS compliant smelters owned by 11 firms, with a tiered country categorization system. Smelters sourcing from the DRC or adjoining countries must provide verified conflict-free documentation to participate in a CFS assessment. The Conflict-Free Smelter (CFS) Program, aligned with iTSCi, relies on upstream due diligence for traceability documentation in the supply chain. It is supported by the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template and Dashboard for data analysis. The World Gold Council has also introduced conflict-free gold standards to prevent funding armed conflict. The gold industry is in the early stages of developing conflict mineral-related due diligence initiatives. The gold industry is in the early stages of developing conflict mineral-related due diligence. The Responsible Jewellery Council (RJC) launched a voluntary Chain-of-Custody (CoC) Certification for gold and other precious metals to support responsible sourcing and conflict-free due diligence. The London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) also requires third-party audits for accredited refiners of gold bullion. Other standards focus on human rights and social development. Various industry and non-governmental coalitions sponsor standards of practice focused on human rights, social development, good governance, and other issues related to mineral sourcing. The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) promotes sustainability reporting globally, emphasizing disclosure on environmental, social, and governance performance."
