    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United Nations Human Rights Council Accountability Act\". Since its establishment in 2006, the United Nations Human Rights Council has failed to promote internationally recognized human rights effectively due to structural flaws in its membership selection process. More than half of its members are rated as \"Not Free\" or \"Partly Free\" by Freedom House, with some of the world's worst human rights abusers being part of the council. The United Nations Human Rights Council's membership includes some of the world's worst violators, with a disproportionate focus on criticizing Israel since 2006. The United Nations Human Rights Council adopted a resolution criticizing Israel for human rights violations in Gaza and the West Bank, without mentioning Hamas, the terrorist organization responsible for using civilians as shields and launching rockets into Israeli populations. The United Nations Human Rights Council resolution passed with 29 votes in favor, 17 abstentions, and the United States as the lone dissenting vote. Professor William Schabas was appointed to lead a panel of inquiry despite his biased remarks, including a conflict of interest regarding Netanyahu. The Bush Administration expressed skepticism towards the United Nations Human Rights Council's reforms and decided not to seek a seat on the Council. In 2008, they limited engagement with the Council and withheld US funding equivalent to the Council's budget share. In March 2009, the Obama Administration announced the United States would join the United Nations Human Rights Council, winning a seat in May 2009. Despite this, the Council's anti-Israel behavior and lack of reform persist, with numerous resolutions criticizing Israel and leniency towards major violators. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. LIMITATIONS RELATING TO UNITED NATIONS HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL MEMBERSHIP AND FUNDING.\" is about restrictions regarding membership and funding for the United Nations Human Rights Council. For each fiscal year after the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State must withhold a percentage of the United States contribution to the UN regular budget allocated to the UN Human Rights Council until certain requirements are met. Additionally, voluntary contributions to the Council are prohibited, and the US cannot run for a seat on the Council until certification is provided. The Secretary of State must provide a certification to Congress stating that the UN Human Rights Council's mandate prohibits membership for countries under UN Security Council sanctions or investigation for human rights abuses. The Secretary of State must certify to Congress that countries under UN Security Council sanctions or investigation for human rights abuses are prohibited from membership in the UN Human Rights Council. The United Nations Human Rights Council's agenda does not include a permanent item regarding the State of Israel. The Secretary of State will withhold a portion of the United States contribution to the UN budget to protest bias against the US or Israel in UN human rights procedures. The United Nations Member State may be subject to sanctions by the Security Council, under investigation for human rights abuses, determined by the Secretary of State to support terrorism, or designated as a Country of Particular Concern for Religious Freedom by the President. The International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 states that funds withheld from the United Nations contribution will revert to the United States Treasury and not be considered arrears."
