He was a supporter of liberation theology and spoke out against the previous dictatorship and military rulers. Aristide was seen as a martyr by his followers for his defense of the poor. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a populist Roman Catholic priest, was elected as President of Haiti in 1990 but was overthrown in a coup after eight months. He was considered a potentially dangerous demagogue by his detractors, known for his inflammatory oratory that incited violent uprisings against suspected Tontons Macoutes. Despite denying that his book condones violence, Aristide was expelled by the Salesian religious order for preaching politics from the pulpit. He later toned down his rhetoric when he became a candidate, and was the most controversial of 11 candidates ruled eligible to run in the elections. Aristide's presidency in Haiti was marked by controversy, with concerns about his role in polarizing the country and his response to violent acts. He refused to condemn practices like \"Pere Lebrun\" and linked their elimination to corruption eradication. Despite this, he acknowledged the importance of popular pressure in bringing justice to former Tontons Macoutes members. Aristide's presidency in Haiti was controversial, with concerns about polarization and violent acts. He acknowledged popular pressure's role in justice but faced criticism for not condemning practices like \"Pere Lebrun.\" In exile, he condemned necklacing and mentioned the unconstitutional life sentence given under pressure. The coup followed his UN address, and his return speech was seen as threatening the bourgeoisie. The coup resulted in hundreds of deaths, with conflicting reports on the exact number. Aristide faced serious social, economic, and political challenges in Haiti. After eight months in office, President Aristide faced mixed reviews for his actions in curbing crime, reducing state employees, and bringing the military under civilian control. Critics questioned his commitment to democracy due to his lack of political party affiliation and failure to cooperate with other democratic elements. Tensions arose over his unilateral appointments without consulting the Senate as required by the constitution. Relations between the legislature and the president remained strained. Aristide was also criticized for his attitude towards certain issues. President Aristide faced criticism for his handling of the judicial system, particularly in the trial of former Tontons Macoutes chief Roger Lafontant. Despite calls for a life sentence, Lafontant received a sentence exceeding constitutional limits. Concerns were raised over the trial's fairness, with observers noting similarities to trials under the Duvaliers. Additionally, Aristide's government presented a macroeconomic reform and public sector investment plan in July, receiving praise from international representatives and lending institutions. The overthrow of Haiti's first democratically elected president in September 1991 led to a crisis with international sanctions imposed on the coup leaders. Aid from major donors like the United States, France, and Canada was suspended, causing a setback in Haiti's recent efforts to renew international aid. After the 1991 coup in Haiti, international aid was cut off, and the Organization of American States demanded Aristide's reinstatement. The regime resisted calls for Aristide's return, appointing a figurehead president and prime minister. Despite efforts for Aristide's eventual return, the government installed a rival as prime minister in June 1992. After the 1991 coup in Haiti, international aid was cut off, and the Organization of American States demanded Aristide's reinstatement. The regime resisted calls for Aristide's return, appointing a figurehead president and prime minister. Installed Marc Bazin, a conservative economist and Aristide rival, as prime minister, leaving the presidency vacant. The OAS's frustration led to the involvement of the United Nations, with Special Envoy Dante Caputo beginning discussions in December 1991. The U.N. and OAS initiated discussions in December 1991, leading to the deployment of a civilian observer mission in Haiti. Despite resistance from the Haitian government, increased sanctions were imposed. President Clinton imposed targeted sanctions in June 1993, followed by a worldwide oil and arms embargo by the U.N. These actions, along with the resignation of Prime Minister Bazin, set the stage for talks between President Aristide and General Cedras on Governors Island in New York. Although they did not meet face to face, an agreement was signed. After sanctions were suspended, a minority opposed Aristide's return with politically motivated violence, blaming police chief Michel Francois. In October 1993, sanctions were reimposed by the U.N., OAS, and United States. Advocates of Aristide's return acknowledged concerns but argued for restoring a democratically elected leader. Following the 1991 coup in Haiti, the main U.S. foreign policy concern was the restoration of democracy and preventing Haitians from fleeing to the United States. Despite efforts like an expanded embargo and diplomatic measures, the de facto Haitian regime did not allow Aristide's return to office. This led U.S. policymakers to consider options like continuing the embargo, military intervention, or disengagement from Haiti. After failed attempts to restore democracy in Haiti following the 1991 coup, policymakers faced challenges regarding Aristide's return, his security, potential backlash, and his ability to govern effectively. The Bush Administration pressured the regime through a trade embargo, aid cutoff, and diplomatic efforts. President Clinton intensified pressure and advanced negotiations, but after the collapse of the Governors Island accord, a tougher stance was taken, leading to military intervention to remove the regime. The George H. W. Bush Administration imposed a trade embargo on Haiti after Aristide's ouster in 1991, cutting off aid and banning trade. The embargo was tightened in response to the regime's refusal to cooperate with agreements, leading to restrictions on ships from OAS member countries. In response to countries violating the embargo on Haiti, the Bush Administration took action by prohibiting ships from entering the United States without prior authorization. In August 1992, the OAS initiated diplomatic efforts to resolve the political crisis in Haiti, leading to talks between representatives of Aristide and the de facto regime. This resulted in an agreement for an OAS civilian mission to monitor human rights, embargo effects, humanitarian aid delivery, and evaluate prospects for a political settlement. After President Clinton took office, he supported Aristide's return as president but also acknowledged concerns about Aristide's statements causing fear among the military. In December 1992, the U.N. became involved in diplomatic efforts with the OAS to peacefully resolve Haiti's political situation. U.N. Special Envoy Dante Caputo held meetings in Haiti starting in mid-December. After U.N. Special Envoy Dante Caputo's meetings in Haiti, the de facto regime agreed to accept an OAS/U.N. observer mission on February 9, 1993. The mission aimed to monitor human rights, facilitate negotiations for Aristide's return, and potentially lift the embargo against Haiti. However, negotiations stalled in the spring as military leaders doubted international threats and were hesitant to give up their income. President Clinton met with President Aristide in March 1993 and committed the United States to a $1 billion program to rebuild Haiti's economy. The Clinton Administration faced criticism for not acting swiftly enough to ensure Aristide's return to office, with some Members expressing dismay over the lack of strong measures against the Haitian military. The Administration defended its approach of combining pressure with offers of future aid, but ultimately, on June 4, 1993, took a firmer stance. On June 4, 1993, the Clinton Administration imposed sanctions on Haitian leaders, expanding the list over time. The OAS and U.N. called for reinforcement of embargoes and imposed global sanctions on Haiti, freezing government assets worldwide. The U.N. sanctions on Haitian government assets took effect on June 23, leading to General Cedras agreeing to a settlement with Aristide. An agreement was mediated by Caputo on July 3, 1993, outlining a 10-step process for Aristide's return as president on October 30. Cedras was to step down as head of the army, accepting early retirement, while Aristide would appoint a new commander-in-chief. After the reconstituted parliament confirmed Robert Malval as prime minister in late August, international sanctions were suspended. After the international community suspended sanctions, a $1 billion development program was initiated in Haiti, including job-creating programs, army modernization, and support for a new police force. However, violence escalated after sanctions were lifted, with paramilitary forces threatening officials and assassinating Aristide supporters. In October 1993, Haitians protested against a U.S. ship docking and threatened the top U.S. official in Haiti. In October 1993, Haitians refused to allow a U.S. ship to dock, threatening the top U.S. official in Haiti. The ship carried 200 U.S. soldiers and 25 Canadian military trainers for a U.N. military and police team under the Governors Island accord. Pulling the ship out of Haiti damaged U.S. credibility and empowered the Haitian regime. President Aristide's Minister of Justice, Guy Malary, was assassinated, seen as a challenge to President Clinton's warning to the Haitian military. Malary was working on legislation to civilianize the police force when he was killed. The OAS and U.N. withdrew their international civilian mission in Haiti due to security concerns. Trade embargoes were imposed by the OAS and the United States, while the U.N. implemented an oil and arms embargo. U.S. Navy ships were deployed to enforce the embargo and protect U.S. citizens in Haiti. President Clinton reported to Congress on the deployment, stating they would cooperate with the U.S. Coast Guard to intercept Haitian migrants if necessary. The President expressed strong support for the Governors Island Agreement and democracy restoration in Haiti, stating that deploying U.S. forces aligns with U.S. goals. Congress debated U.S. military intervention in Haiti, with some members wanting to restrict it without specific approval, while others supported the President's decision-making authority. On October 21, 1993, the U.S. Senate rejected an amendment to limit U.S. military involvement in Haiti. The Senate approved an amendment urging President Clinton to seek congressional authorization before deploying U.S. troops to Haiti. The deadline for Haiti to meet conditions set by the Governors Island accord passed without compliance, leading to calls for Aristide to appoint a new prime minister. The Senate amendment urged President Clinton to seek congressional authorization before deploying U.S. troops to Haiti. The deadline for Haiti to meet conditions set by the Governors Island accord passed without compliance, leading to calls for Aristide to appoint a new prime minister. Aristide rejected the plan, accusing the international community of complicity with the military regime. The White House shifted to a policy of increasing pressure on the Haitian military without asking Aristide for further compromises. Special Envoy Pezzullo resigned and was replaced by William Gray. Increased sanctions were orchestrated by the White House, with the U.N. Security Council imposing them unanimously on May 6, 1994. On May 6, 1994, the U.N. Security Council imposed increased sanctions on Haiti, including a trade embargo with exceptions for food, medicine, and cooking fuel. Military leaders were given 15 days to step down before the embargo took effect. Sanctions also included travel restrictions for military officers and key civilian supporters, a freeze on assets, and a prohibition on private plane flights. The sanctions were to be lifted once the military leaders left, the army and police commands were reformed, a political amnesty was adopted, and Aristide returned to office. The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions on Haiti, including a trade embargo with exceptions for essential items. President Clinton expanded U.S. sanctions twice, barring most private financial transactions and commercial air travel between the two countries. He also froze the U.S. assets of Haitians in Haiti. Balaguer stationed soldiers along the border to prevent smuggling, leading to concerns about cooperation to reduce fraud investigations. Both governments denied any accommodation. The Administration strengthened its rhetoric, considering the use of force to oust the Haitian military regime. The OAS/U.N. human rights monitoring mission was expelled from Haiti on July 11, 1994. A U.N. resolution was passed on July 31, 1994, authorizing member nations to form a multinational force to facilitate the departure of the military leadership and the return of the elected President. About 20 countries agreed to join the intervention force, with additional support personnel from Jamaica, Barbados, Belize, and Trinidad and Tobago. France and Canada also contributed to the effort. The United States planned to send troops to Haiti to support the return of the Aristide government or remove the military regime. President Clinton urged the Haitian dictators to leave power to stop atrocities and restore democracy. France and Canada declined to participate in the invasion force. The President announced a delegation led by Jimmy Carter, Sam Nunn, and Colin Powell to Haiti to avoid military intervention. Haiti's military leadership agreed to step down voluntarily after hearing about the invasion order. The agreement called for Cedras' resignation and the deployment of a U.S. military mission to restore the democratically elected Aristide government. President Clinton announced the lifting of U.S. sanctions against Haiti, except for those targeting Haitian leaders, restoring commercial air flights and financial transactions. Reports indicated $5 million was approved for covert CIA operations to protect U.S. troops and promote pro-Aristide propaganda. The U.N. lifted sanctions against Haiti upon President Aristide's return, with U.S. forces landing in Haiti on September 19, 1994 to oversee the transition to the democratically elected Aristide government. The U.S. lifted sanctions against Haiti, except for those targeting Haitian leaders, and deployed almost 20,000 troops as part of \"Operation Uphold Democracy.\" Other nations also contributed personnel. Congress approved a measure stating that the president should have sought authorization before sending troops. U.S. forces were criticized for not intervening in Haitian violence. U.S. military leaders changed policy to authorize troops to stop Haitian-on-Haitian violence, disarming powerful army units and violent paramilitary groups. Under U.S. security, the Haitian parliament met for the first time in 18 months and passed a political amnesty for the Haitian army. Aristide stated that army officers would still face charges for crimes against humanity, leading to the departure of the military regime from Haiti. After the departure of the military regime from Haiti, President Aristide returned to office on October 15, 1994, calling for reconciliation and an end to violence. The United States released frozen assets of the Haitian military leaders, allowing them access to millions of dollars accrued during their oppressive tenure. President Clinton oversaw the transfer of responsibility from the U.S.-led multinational force to the U.N. Mission in Haiti on March 31, 1995. During Aristide's exile, human rights deteriorated significantly in Haiti according to reports by human rights groups. The human rights situation in Haiti deteriorated significantly, with Aristide supporters, grassroots organizations, and journalists frequently targeted. Amnesty International reported abuses by security forces and civilians with impunity. The paramilitary group FRAPH was blamed for violence against Aristide supporters. The Tontons Macoutes, a Duvaliers' secret police-type organization, was revived in 1994, leading to further human rights abuses. In 1994, human rights abuses in Haiti escalated, with mutilations and politically motivated rapes. The military regime ousted the UN/OAS's human rights monitoring mission, aiming to eliminate Aristide supporters and terrorize the population. The State Department reported widespread repression, assassination, torture, and rape by the military and de facto government. The Haitian army had a history of human rights violations and impeding democracy. After the fall of the Duvalier dictatorship, there were hopes of a transformation towards democracy. The army initially supported Aristide but later ousted him, citing his interference in army affairs. Brig. General Raoul Cedras led the military regime during its three-year rule. The Aristide government faced resistance from the army for meddling in military affairs. The constitution mandated civilian authority over the military, including separating the police from the army and trying military abuses in civilian courts. Aristide aimed to tackle corruption, reform the army, and establish a civilian police force before being overthrown. These efforts were to be revisited under the Governors Island agreement. The resistance to reform and suppression of resistance led to violence after the Governors Island agreement, impacting the army's opposition to Aristide's return. The U.S. interdiction policy for Haitian migrants on the sea, criticized after the 1991 coup, was based on a 1981 bilateral agreement allowing the Coast Guard to intercept boats and return passengers to Haiti. Haiti was the only country with such an agreement, resulting in 22,651 interdictions from 1981 to 1990 with minimal asylum approvals. After Aristide's ouster in 1991, the number of Haitian refugees intercepted by the U.S. Coast Guard sharply increased. During Aristide's exile, 66,954 Haitians were interdicted, with 30% allowed to seek asylum in the United States after pre-screening interviews in Guantanamo Bay. President Bush later ordered the immediate return of all Haitians intercepted at sea. President Bush ordered the interception and immediate return of Haitians in boats on the high seas without pre-screening for asylum eligibility. President Clinton continued the forced repatriation policy, upheld by the Supreme Court in June 1993. Debate over the interdiction policy focused on the cause of Haitians' flight, with the Bush Administration arguing many were fleeing poverty, while refugee advocates believed many faced political persecution. According to human rights organizations, the human rights situation in Haiti deteriorated significantly following a coup. U.S. officials monitored over 3,000 repatriates in 1992 without finding credible claims of mistreatment. However, human rights groups argued that investigating claims of persecution in Haiti was dangerous and flawed. They also contended that applying for asylum in Haiti was unsafe. In March 1993, a navy deserter granted refugee status by the U.S. embassy was arrested by the Haitian military as he was escorted by U.S. diplomats to a U.S.-bound plane. Haitian authorities released the man after the Administration protested. Some criticized U.S. refugee policy towards Haiti, citing perceived racism and unequal treatment compared to Cubans. Refugee advocates argued that the policy violated a U.N. convention on political persecution. President Aristide ended the forced repatriation policy due to worsening human rights violations in Haiti. Despite this, the U.S. Coast Guard continued to intercept Haitian boats, citing unseaworthiness. The Clinton Administration maintained the policy of intercepting and returning Haitians at sea, increasing officials in Haiti to process asylum applications faster. President Clinton supported efforts to promote a political settlement in Haiti to address the reasons for Haitians fleeing the country. However, criticism of his migration policy grew as violence escalated. Some U.S. Congress members were arrested protesting the forced repatriation policy, and activist Randall Robinson went on a hunger strike. The Administration announced the setup of immigration centers on ships near Haiti or in third countries for Haitians interdicted at sea to apply for asylum. Later, the policy shifted, with Haitian migrants taken to the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, instead of processing for refugee status. The U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, housed Haitian migrants interdicted at sea, with some sent to other regional countries for temporary safe haven. The flow of migrants decreased after the new policy, leaving most Haitians at Guantanamo. Living conditions in Haiti remained dire, with high poverty rates and unemployment. Only 43% of the population had access to basic necessities. Haiti faces challenges such as high illiteracy rates, limited access to safe water, widespread infectious diseases, malnutrition, high infant mortality rate, and low life expectancy. The majority of the population depends on agriculture, but only a third of the soil is cultivable. Peasants engaged in subsistence farming earn an average annual income of $150. Overpopulation and overcultivation have led to deforestation and erosion. Economic deterioration and collapse of the tourism industry have been exacerbated by political disorder and labor strikes. The U.S. and U.N. embargoes devastated Haiti's economy and ecology, leading to job losses, fuel shortages, power blackouts, limited transportation, ecological damage, deteriorating medical care, and worsening child malnutrition. Severe malnutrition in Haiti has worsened since March 1993 in every region except the South. U.S. assistance to the Haitian government was suspended after the 1991 coup, but humanitarian aid continued through Private Voluntary Organizations. Funding for FY1993 totaled $108 million, with $41 million in food aid. FY1994 saw $105.6 million in obligations, including $43 million in food aid. FY1995 estimated obligations were almost $201 million, with $15.5 million for peacekeeping. Humanitarian oil shipments helped PVOs deliver aid under the U.N. embargo. The U.N. oil embargo affected food and services in Haiti, with reports of difficulty reaching services due to reduced public transportation. Haiti is a significant transhipment point for illegal narcotics, especially cocaine. President Aristide prioritized combating drug trafficking, but subsequent regimes had sporadic counternarcotics efforts. U.S. aid cutoff suspended narcotics programs with the Haitian government. The Aristide government had a joint support agreement for counternarcotics projects in Haiti, but it was not implemented due to a coup. Military members were involved in drug trafficking, hindering Aristide's return to power. The U.S. DEA provided intelligence on narcotics trafficking to the Haitian military, including information on drugs seized by the anti-narcotics unit led by Col. Antoine Atouriste. Atouriste's assets were frozen in 1993 for obstructing democracy in Haiti. The anti-narcotics unit had no system for seized drugs, and the fate of these drugs was unknown to U.S. officials. The U.S. embassy received reports of Haitian military involvement in drug trafficking, but they were unverified. The fate of seized drugs by the Haitian military was unknown to U.S. officials."
