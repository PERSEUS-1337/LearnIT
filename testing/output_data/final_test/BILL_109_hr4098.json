    "content": "The \"Community Cancer Care Preservation Act of 2005\" includes provisions for the use of average sales price methodology, improved payment for oncologist services, quality measures for cancer care, enhanced patient participation in clinical trials, and a CBO report. Congress finds that in 2005, Medicare reimbursement for certain outpatient cancer drugs shifted to average sales price from average wholesale price. The average sales price method does not promptly reflect changes in drug prices. The amendment to the Social Security Act includes reconciliation of payments to ensure they align with actual average sales prices on a quarterly basis. The Secretary shall review physician payments quarterly and compare them to verified average sales prices. Amendments to the Social Security Act ensure alignment of payments with actual prices. Improved payment for oncologist services. Congress found in 2005 that a $300 million demonstration project by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services identified and assessed oncology services benefiting oncologists and cancer patients. The project will continue to identify and assess services positively affecting cancer outcomes. The payment policies under the Physician Fee Schedule for Calendar Year 2005 have been extended until December 31, 2006. The Secretary will continue to operate the project in the same manner as originally implemented, with funding consistent with the existing project. A report with recommendations will be submitted to Congress by July 1, 2007. The Secretary will make appropriate determinations regarding adjustments to the Physician Fee Schedule for 2006, with specific amendments to Section 1848(c)(2) of the Social Security Act. This includes changes to subclauses related to drug administration services under the fee schedule for that year. The Secretary will make adjustments to the Physician Fee Schedule for 2006, including a 2 percent additional payment for drug administration services to cover overhead costs. SEC. 4. QUALITY MEASURES FOR CANCER CARE. Congress acknowledges the need for consistent quality indicators in cancer care provided by physicians, aiming for evidence-based standards. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will collaborate with physicians to develop these indicators, ensuring they are assessed by the physician community before implementation. Pilot and demonstration projects may be conducted to test these indicators. Pilot and demonstration projects may be conducted to test quality indicators in cancer care provided by physicians. Improved patient participation in clinical trials is emphasized in Section 5. The President's Cancer Panel report highlights the rising incidence and costs of cancer in the US, along with challenges in translating research into effective care. A strategic plan is being developed to increase patient enrollment in clinical trials, focusing on improving patient education and streamlining the trial process. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will submit a report to Congress by January 1, 2007, on a strategic plan to increase patient enrollment in clinical trials and ensure the viability of conducting research in all treatment settings. Recommendations for legislation and administrative action will be included in the report. The Director of the Congressional Budget Office must submit a report to Congress within one year of the enactment of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. The report will detail the impact of the law on oncologists and other physicians providing cancer care, comparing the actual impact with the Office's pre-enactment estimates."
