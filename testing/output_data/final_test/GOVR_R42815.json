    "content": "Biotechnology involves modifying living organisms for human purposes, with applications in various fields including medicine. The industry is young but shows significant growth potential, with revenue expected to increase to $87 billion in 2012 and a projected annual growth rate of 8.7% from 2012 to 2017. Profitability was first achieved in 2009, driven by rising revenue and cost efficiencies. The biotechnology market is expected to reach nearly $5 billion in profit for 2012, with the three largest companies holding a significant market share. Mergers and acquisitions have been increasing within the industry, leading to a flat number of operators despite projected industry expansion. Human health technologies account for 57% of revenues, with pharmaceuticals expected to remain the most significant component in the future. According to PhRMA, over 900 biotechnology medicines are in development, with personalized medicine being a key growth area. Personalized medicine tailors treatment to individual characteristics and genetic susceptibility, leading to more efficient interventions. An example is Genentech's Herceptin, a targeted breast cancer therapy prescribed based on genetic testing for HER2 protein over-expression. Genetic tests show over-expression of HER2 protein. Herceptin/HER2 \"theranostic\" intervention introduced in 1998, followed by other drug-diagnostic combos. Market for diagnostic and therapeutic treatments to grow by 10% annually, reaching $42 billion by 2015. Biotechnology companies rely on intellectual property rights for protection. Patents crucial for research-intensive sector. Adequate patent protection reduces copying by competitors. Investors in biotech firms value strong intellectual property protection strategy. Venture capital primary funding source for small biotech firms. Venture capital is crucial for small biotechnology firms, with patenting activity increasing chances of funding. The economic value of a company's patent portfolio is carefully considered by VC firms before investing. Changes in patent protection regulations can impact VC investments in biotechnology. The U.S. patent system plays a significant role in biotech innovation by allowing inventors to seek patent grants. The USPTO officials, known as examiners, determine if an invention in a patent application meets patent award criteria. The invention must be novel, nonobvious, and useful to be patentable. Nonobviousness prevents patents for ideas easily implemented by skilled artisans. According to Section 101 of the Patent Act, an invention must be operable and provide a tangible benefit to be patentable. The range of patentable subject matter is broad, but certain things like abstract ideas and laws of nature are not patentable. The USPTO examiner also considers if the application fully discloses and distinctly claims the invention. The USPTO allows patents to be issued, granting the owner the right to exclude others from using the invention. Infringers can be held liable for damages and may be enjoined from further infringement. Patent protection lasts for 20 years, after which others can use the invention freely. Patent owners must actively enforce their rights. Patent owners must enforce their rights through litigation in federal courts. Accused infringers can challenge patent validity. The Federal Circuit handles most patent appeals, with the Supreme Court having discretionary review authority. Process patents claim methods of manufacture or use. Process patents typically claim methods of manufacture or use, but there are limits on what can be patented. Abstract ideas, mathematical algorithms, mental processes, and scientific principles are not considered patentable. The Supreme Court has emphasized that these types of inventions should be free for all to use. In recent cases like Mayo v. Prometheus and Bilski v. Kappos, the court has addressed the patentability of specific methods, such as a risk hedging method for commodities buyers and sellers in the energy market. The Supreme Court affirmed the Federal Circuit's patentability determination of a risk hedging method for commodities buyers and sellers in the energy market, stating that the \"machine-or-transformation\" test should not be the exclusive test for determining patent eligibility. This decision aimed to avoid uncertainty in patentability for technologies like software and advanced diagnostic medicine techniques. The Supreme Court affirmed the Federal Circuit's decision that a claimed hedging method was an \"unpatentable abstract idea\" as it would preempt its use in all fields, granting a monopoly over an abstract idea. The Court's ruling in Bilski v. Kappos left uncertainty on whether diagnostic methods could be patented, with a distinction made between \"advanced diagnostic medicine techniques\" and unpatentable \"laws of nature.\" Two years after Bilski v. Kappos, the Supreme Court addressed the patentability of diagnostic methods in Mayo v. Prometheus. Prometheus Laboratories holds patents for methods involving thiopurine drugs used to treat autoimmune diseases. The patents involve administering the drug, measuring metabolite levels in red blood cells, and adjusting dosage based on the results to enhance treatment effectiveness. Prometheus Laboratories holds patents for methods involving thiopurine drugs used to treat autoimmune diseases. The patents involve administering the drug, measuring metabolite levels in red blood cells, and adjusting dosage based on the results to enhance treatment effectiveness. Claim 1 of the `623 patent outlines a method of optimizing therapeutic efficacy for immune-mediated gastrointestinal disorders by administering 6-thioguanine and adjusting dosage based on the levels detected in red blood cells. Prometheus Laboratories holds patents for methods involving thiopurine drugs used to treat autoimmune diseases. The patents involve administering the drug, measuring metabolite levels in red blood cells, and adjusting dosage based on the results to enhance treatment effectiveness. The District Court initially ruled that the patents did not cover patentable subject matter due to claiming a natural law. However, the Federal Circuit and the Court of Appeals later reversed this decision, stating that the claims involved the transformation of the human body or blood, making them patentable subject matter. The Supreme Court overturned the Federal Circuit's decision in Mayo v. Prometheus, ruling that the claims were directed towards natural laws and therefore unpatentable. The Court emphasized that phenomena of nature and abstract concepts cannot be patented as it may impede innovation. The Supreme Court overturned the Federal Circuit's decision in Mayo v. Prometheus, ruling that inventions embody or apply laws of nature, but processes applying natural laws in a useful way are eligible for patenting. The Court recognized that the claims involved laws of nature but also included steps like administering drugs and determining metabolite levels, making them patent-eligible processes. Justice Breyer questioned whether the claims added enough to qualify as patent-eligible processes applying natural laws. The Supreme Court overturned the Federal Circuit's decision in Mayo v. Prometheus, ruling that inventions embody or apply laws of nature, but processes applying natural laws in a useful way are eligible for patenting. Justice Breyer explained that the additional claimed steps did not suffice to render the inventions patentable subject matter. The \"administering\" step referred to physicians treating patients with thiopurine drugs, while the \"determining\" step advised measuring metabolite levels in a patient's blood, which was routine in the field. Conventional or obvious pre-solution activity did not make an unpatentable law of nature patent-eligible. The Supreme Court in Mayo v. Prometheus ruled that advising physicians to consider natural laws in their practices does not make unpatentable laws of nature patentable. The Court rejected the argument that the Prometheus patents satisfied the machine-or-transformation test, stating that the claims only required measuring metabolite levels, not transforming human blood or the human body. The Supreme Court in Mayo v. Prometheus ruled that the transformation of the human body was not pertinent to patentability, as the claims only required measuring metabolite levels. Justice Breyer rejected the idea that any step beyond a law of nature should fulfill patent standards, emphasizing that Section 101 standards are distinct from novelty and nonobviousness requirements. The Supreme Court decision in Mayo v. Prometheus addressed concerns about discouraging diagnostic research by rejecting patents on natural laws. Some patent lawyers criticized the opinion, with one calling it the worst patent decision in Supreme Court history. The decision has sparked diverse reactions in the biotechnology community. The Supreme Court decision in Mayo v. Prometheus has raised concerns about patenting natural phenomena in diagnostic research. Critics argue that the lack of clarity may hinder firms investing in costly research and development for diagnostics and personalized medicine. The Supreme Court decision in Mayo v. Prometheus has sparked debate over patenting diagnostic methods in personalized medicine. Some experts believe that the ruling may hinder small biotech companies, while others view it as a well-crafted resolution to issues surrounding intellectual property rights. The American Medical Association supports the Supreme Court decision in Mayo v. Prometheus, stating it prevents harm to patient care by keeping scientific data accessible. Some argue that other countries also disallow patents on diagnostic methods, aligning with global norms. Following the Supreme Court's decision in Mayo v. Prometheus, attention has shifted to the Myriad litigation, which may determine the patentability of isolated DNA molecules encoding human genes. Some believe this case could have a significant impact on intellectual property norms in the medical field. Hank Greely from Stanford University believes the medical world may not change much due to these legal decisions. The Myriad litigation, starting in 2009, challenged patents on isolated human genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 owned by Myriad Genetics. These genes are linked to breast and ovarian cancers, and Myriad holds exclusive rights to genetic testing for these conditions. The outcome of this case could impact the patentability of genes following the Mayo v. Prometheus decision. The Myriad Genetics case involved patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which are associated with breast and ovarian cancers. The U.S. District Court initially ruled the gene patents invalid, stating that isolated DNA was not significantly different from natural DNA. However, the Federal Circuit overturned this decision, arguing that isolated DNA is chemically manipulated and therefore patentable. The Supreme Court later agreed to hear the case. The Supreme Court vacated the judgment in the Myriad case and remanded it back to the Federal Circuit to reconsider in light of Mayo v. Prometheus. The Federal Circuit upheld that isolated human genes could be patented as they are nonnaturally occurring compositions of matter. The issue of plaintiffs' standing to pursue the lawsuit has also been raised by Myriad. The Myriad ruling on gene patenting could have significant implications for the biotechnology industry. Dennis Crouch noted that under the District Court's reasoning, most gene patents could be invalidated, impacting a large amount of intellectual property. There may be legislative review on the patentability of diagnostic methods, gene patents, and biotechnology in light of the Mayo v. Prometheus case. One option for potential legislative action is to amend Section 101 of the Patent Act to specify patentable subject matter. Another option is to allow patents on certain inventions but limit the remedies available to patent holders. The Patent Act may be amended to include other categories of inventions, following the Genomic Research and Diagnostic Disability Act of 2002. The Supreme Court's ruling in Mayo v. Prometheus has implications for patentable subject matter, including human genes. Some view narrowing patentable subject matter as beneficial to healthcare and medical research, while others argue that patents incentivize innovation and technology disclosure in these fields. Judicial decisions impacting patent protection in healthcare and biotechnology may prompt calls for legislative clarification on patentable subject matter."
