    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bulk-Power System Reliability Impact Statement Act\". The electric grid in the United States is crucial for providing reliable and affordable power to a large population. It must handle a diverse mix of energy sources, match varying demands, and operate with high reliability 24/7. The complexity of the electric grid is due to its immense diversity and the need to coexist with competing uses. The electric grid in the United States is complex due to diverse ownership and operational structures, adapting to variable energy sources, and managing retiring capacity. Energy systems are critical infrastructure enabling functions across all sectors. The wholesale electric service and bulk-power system in the US should ensure abundant, affordable, clean, diverse, and secure electricity. Federal regulators should support reliability and affordability without hindrance. The burden of maintaining the electric grid should be shared fairly among all users. SEC. 3. RELIABILITY REPORTS. Section 215(g) of the Federal Power Act is amended to require reliability coordinators to submit reports on the state of electricity reliability and affordability in their geographic area to Congress and the Commission every 3 years. The amendment to Section 215(g) of the Federal Power Act now requires reliability coordinators to report on significant risks to the bulk-power system's reliability in their geographic area, including risks from proposed or final Federal regulations. The amendment to Section 215(g) of the Federal Power Act now requires reliability coordinators to report on significant risks to the bulk-power system's reliability in their geographic area, including risks from proposed or final Federal regulations. SEC. 4. RELIABILITY IMPACT STATEMENT. The Federal Power Act's Section 215 is amended to include a requirement for reliability coordinators to provide a reliability impact statement within 15 days of a major rule proposal that could impact the bulk-power system's reliable operation. The Federal Power Act's Section 215 now requires reliability coordinators to submit a reliability impact statement within 15 days of a proposed major Federal rule that could significantly affect the reliable operation of the bulk-power system. If the rule affects multiple jurisdictions, a committee of affected reliability coordinators will produce a single reliability impact statement demonstrating the rule's impact on each area. The statement must detail the proposed rule's impact on the reliable operation of the bulk-power system. The Federal Power Act's Section 215 mandates reliability coordinators to submit a reliability impact statement within 15 days of a proposed major Federal rule that could affect the bulk-power system's reliable operation. The statement must address any adverse effects on system reliability, propose alternatives to mitigate these impacts, and be submitted to the Commission for review. The Commission must transmit the reliability impact statement to the applicable Federal agency for inclusion in the public record. The head of the Federal agency issuing a proposed major rule subject to a reliability impact statement must consider it and provide a detailed response in the final rule."
