    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Humanitarian Exports Leading to Peace Act of 2000\". It includes findings related to humanitarian exports. The Congress finds that the economic sanctions on Iraq have caused hardship, failed to weaken the regime, and undermined civil society. The Oil-for-Food program has also failed to meet the needs of the Iraqi people. Iraq has the potential to be a market for $1 billion in agricultural products from the United States. The economic sanctions on Iraq have caused harm to the population and failed to achieve the goals of punishing Iraq's leaders or disarming weapons of mass destruction. The devastating effects of the sanctions include dramatic increases in malnutrition and disease, leading to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of children under the age of 5 since 1991. Since 1991, hundreds of thousands of children under 5 have died due to malnutrition and disease in Iraq. UNICEF reported that despite the Oil-for-Food Program, infant mortality rates have significantly increased over the years. A report by the United Nations Security Council in 1999 emphasized the severe humanitarian crisis in Iraq, attributing much of the suffering to sanctions and the effects of war. UNICEF and the World Food Program found that 1 in 4 young Iraqi children are malnourished, with over 750,000 children suffering from malnutrition. The Iraq Sanctions Act of 1990 limits prohibitions on trade with Iraq to allow for the export of food, medicines, and certain other products. Exceptions to the restrictions imposed by the Export Administration Act of 1979 and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act include limitations on goods with specific technology and medical instruments or equipment for national security threats. Administration is handled by the Secretary of Commerce. The Secretary of Commerce administers the Export Administration Act of 1979, with exceptions for certain exports under sections 3 and 4. Regulations will be issued as necessary. Sense of Congress: The US Government should ensure the free flow of humanitarian aid to Iraq to alleviate the suffering of innocent populations, especially children and the elderly. This may involve utilizing its position on the UN Security Council to pass necessary measures. The President must report to Congress within 6 months of this Act on sales of food, agricultural products, medicines, and medical supplies to Iraq, their impact on food security, types of goods exported, and any diversion of medical supplies by the Iraqi government or third parties. The United States has taken steps through the United Nations to lift nonmilitary sanctions on Iraq and impose a regional arms control regime in the Middle East."
