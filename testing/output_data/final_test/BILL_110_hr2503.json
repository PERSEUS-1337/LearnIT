    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"FDA Scientific Fairness for Women Act\". The Congress finds that the Office of Women's Health within the FDA has changed in its reporting structure. The FDA requested manufacturers of silicone breast implants to provide information on implant rupture rates in a draft guidance issued in January 2004. The FDA approved silicone gel breast implants in November 2006 despite the lack of data on rupture rates, gel migration, and health consequences. A study in 2001 found that 69% of women with silicone implants had ruptures and 21% experienced gel migration. In April 2005, a study found that 21 percent of women with silicone implants experienced gel migration outside the scar capsule. Another study showed that 90 percent of women with silicone implants had silicone in their lymph nodes, with 95 percent showing abnormal cells in their lymph nodes. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has not provided enforceable conditions to prevent harm from leaking silicone in breast implants. In 2003, the US Government settled with breast implant manufacturers for reimbursement of medical expenses for affected women, but there is no public information on how the funds were used. The FDA rejected the first application for the contraceptive drug Plan B by Barr Laboratories. The FDA rejected the initial Plan B application due to concerns about increased promiscuity among women under 16. Barr Laboratories then submitted a new application for over-the-counter sales to women 16 and older, but the FDA later expressed regulatory concerns about age-based sales. The FDA Commissioner recommended an age restriction of 18 and older for over-the-counter Plan B, citing pressure to appease the administration's constituents. The FDA Commissioner recommended an age restriction of 18 and older for over-the-counter Plan B, which was acknowledged as arbitrary and not supported by scientific data. A former FDA Commissioner delayed approving over-the-counter sales of Plan B to determine how to restrict sales to young teens. A study concluded that young women can use Plan B effectively and safely without healthcare provider intervention. The Government Accountability Office found the decision to deny OTC status to Plan B emergency contraception in 2004 was unusual. The decision to limit over-the-counter access to Plan B to only those over a certain age was made at a higher level within the FDA, overruling recommendations by professional staff and preceding the completion of the regular review process. The creation of the Office of Women's Health within the Food and Drug Administration was outlined in Section 3. The Office of Women's Health is established within the Food and Drug Administration, with a director reporting directly to the Commissioner. The office is responsible for activities related to women's health. The Office of Women's Health within the Food and Drug Administration assesses agency activity, sets goals, and handles prevention, research, education, service delivery, and policy development. Funds allocated to this office cannot be transferred to other agencies or offices. SEC. 4. SCIENCE ON BREAST IMPLANTS. Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to classify breast implants as class III devices requiring premarket approval. Introduces a new section for demonstration of safety for breast implants. The FDA requires premarket approval for breast implants, demonstrating safety for the life of the device is essential. Previously approved implants are deemed unsafe and approval may be withdrawn. The FDA requires premarket approval for breast implants, ensuring safety for the life of the device. Approved implants must have clear guidance for clinical care, removal, and replacement in labeling and marketing materials. The FDA requires clear guidance for breast implants in labeling and marketing materials, including postmarket studies on safety submitted to Congress annually. The FDA mandates postmarket studies on the safety and effectiveness of approved breast implants, including findings on long-term safety. The Secretary must submit the first report within 120 days of approving an implant application or 120 days after the enactment of this section. Additionally, the Breast Implant Advisory Panel reviews 10-year longitudinal studies. The Implant Advisory Panel of the FDA will meet to review 10-year longitudinal studies on saline and silicone gel breast implants approved under section 515 in 2007, 2008, and 2009. Membership on advisory committees considering breast implant issues is specified. The FDA's Implant Advisory Panel will review 10-year studies on saline and silicone breast implants. Membership rules for committees addressing breast implant issues are outlined, including restrictions on financial conflicts and a 30-day waiting period before serving on the committee. Additionally, a study on the ionization of platinum must be completed within 365 days. The Secretary must complete a study on the ionization and levels of platinum in silicone breast implants, analyzing potential risks of platinum presence. An independent panel of scientists will be established to design and conduct the study. The study on silicone breast implants will be conducted by an independent panel of scientists. Scientists with financial ties to breast implant companies, silicone companies, or plastic surgeons are not allowed to participate in the study design or conduct. The term 'breast implant' refers to a device used to augment or reconstruct the female breast, containing filler material other than sterile isotonic saline. Scientific workshop on emergency contraception use by women under age 18. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will convene a scientific workshop to review data on emergency contraception use by females under 18, addressing key scientific questions and including representatives from various medical organizations. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will convene a scientific workshop involving researchers and FDA review divisions to discuss the use of contraceptives, including emergency contraceptives, by women under 18."
