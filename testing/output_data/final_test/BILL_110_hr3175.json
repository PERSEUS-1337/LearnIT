Child marriage is a harmful traditional practice that violates human rights, with an estimated 51 million girls in developing countries married before the age of 18. If current trends continue, over 100 million more girls will be married as children in the next decade. Child marriage is a widespread issue, with approximately one in seven girls marrying before age 15 and one in three before age 18. It is seen as treating young girls as property and poses risks to their rights, health, education, and independence. A global survey in 2005 found child marriage to be a concern in 64 out of 182 countries, with sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East being the most affected regions. In Ethiopia's Amhara region, half of all girls are married by age 14, with high percentages unaware of their husbands or impending marriage, and reporting early sexual initiation. Child marriage is prevalent globally, with many girls marrying before age 18. In Afghanistan, 57% of marriages involve girls under 16, and in northern Nigeria, 45% are married by age 15. In several countries, including Niger, Chad, and India, between half and three-quarters of girls are married before 18. Child marriage perpetuated by poverty, lack of opportunities for girls, parental concerns, dowry system, and devaluation of girls. Negative effects include increased maternal death risk, infant mortality, obstetric fistula, and STDs. Girls aged 10-14 in developing countries face higher pregnancy-related death risk. Child marriage can lead to bonded labor, exploitation, and violence. Out-of-school girls are at risk of child marriage, while those in school face pressure to drop out due to various barriers. The lack of proper sanitation facilities in schools contributes to girls leaving education. Investments in school sanitation have shown to increase girls' enrollment rates in Guinea and Bangladesh. Investments in girls' schooling, safe community spaces, and skills building programs are effective strategies to prevent child marriage and empower girls by addressing poverty, low status, and norms. Despite legally-established minimum age of marriage in most countries, child marriage persists due to strong traditional norms and lack of enforcement of laws. The sense of Congress is that child marriage is a violation of human rights and should be a foreign policy goal of the United States. Child marriage undermines investments in foreign assistance for education, skills building, maternal and child health, HIV/AIDS prevention, gender-based violence, and poverty reduction. Expanding educational and economic opportunities for girls is crucial for achieving global health and development goals. Assistance to prevent childhood marriage in developing countries is a foreign policy goal of the United States, as child marriage undermines investments in education, health, HIV/AIDS prevention, gender-based violence, and poverty reduction. Expanding opportunities for girls' education and economic empowerment is crucial for global health and development goals. The President is authorized to provide assistance to prevent child marriage in developing countries, prioritizing regions with high rates of child marriage. This includes supporting community-based programs that successfully prevent child marriage. The President is authorized to provide assistance to prevent child marriage in developing countries by establishing pilot projects, sharing successful program evaluations, and integrating assistance with existing programs for education, health, and human rights. To prevent child marriage in developing countries, assistance can be provided by enrolling girls in school at the appropriate age, reducing education fees, and creating safe and supportive conditions in schools. This includes access to water and hygiene facilities, female teachers, safe routes to school, and eliminating violence and coercion. Ensuring access to healthcare, nutrition, financial literacy, and education for adolescent girls to promote gender equality and prevent child marriage. To promote gender equality and prevent child marriage, initiatives include creating peer support networks, safe social spaces for girls, and supporting local advocacy work to ensure government obligations are met. SEC. 5. STRATEGY TO PREVENT CHILD MARRIAGE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. The President, through the Administrator of USAID, must establish a multi-year strategy to prevent child marriage and empower girls in developing countries. This strategy should focus on high prevalence areas and involve diplomatic initiatives with developing country governments. Consultation with Congress, federal departments, agencies, and civil society is required. The President must establish a strategy to prevent child marriage and empower girls in developing countries, focusing on high prevalence areas and involving diplomatic initiatives with governments. A report including the strategy, assessment of current efforts, and examples of best practices must be submitted to Congress within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Department of State's country reports on human rights practices are mandated by Section 6 of the Act. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to require reports on child marriage prevalence in countries with rates at or above 40 percent in at least one sub-national region. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 now requires reports on child marriage prevalence in countries with rates at or above 40 percent in at least one sub-national region, including the status of child marriage practices in the country. The term \"child marriage\" is defined as the marriage of a girl or boy below the minimum age for marriage in their country. $25,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2008 to 2012 to implement this Act and its amendments."
