The Act, known as the \"Missouri River Basin, Kansas and Nebraska, Pick-Sloan Project Facilities Transfer Act,\" defines a \"project beneficiary\" as specific irrigation districts in Kansas and Nebraska. The Act defines \"reclamation project property\" as contracts between the United States and project beneficiaries, and the term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of the Army with jurisdiction over project facilities. The Act defines \"reclamation project property\" as contracts between the United States and project beneficiaries related to project facilities, including distribution and drainage facilities, reservoirs, diversion facilities, acquired lands, water rights, and leases. All outstanding leases, contracts, fund accounts, legal obligations, personal property, and reserve funds related to project facilities must be accounted for and may need to be assumed or accepted by the project beneficiary. All funds held in reserve or dedicated accounts for project purposes, paid by project beneficiaries or nonproject revenues, as of the date of enactment of this Act. SEC. 3. TRANSFER OF MISSOURI RIVER BASIN, PICK-SLOAN PROJECTS FACILITIES. Within 180 days of this Act's enactment, the Secretary will transfer project ownership to the beneficiary upon payment. The transfer includes all US rights to the project property, satisfying all prior obligations. The completion of the transfer of project facilities to beneficiaries under this Act fulfills all payment obligations. Transfer costs are the responsibility of the United States, and necessary transfer documents will be executed by the Secretary with assistance from beneficiaries. The transfer of reclamation project property includes various documents like land deeds, court proceedings, bills of sale, and water rights certificates. Project beneficiaries can assume management of leases and revenue from the date of enactment. Further transfers of project facilities require consent from beneficiaries. SEC. 4. LIABILITY. Project beneficiaries assume responsibility and liability for the reclamation project property upon transfer. They hold the United States harmless and indemnify against claims, except for latent defects unless disclosed and accepted in writing. SEC. 5. PROJECT PURPOSES, OPERATIONS, AND COST ALLOCATIONS. (a) All facilities transferred under this Act are committed to their original purposes and subject to state laws. Cost allocations remain due from beneficiaries as originally approved. (b) Project beneficiaries agree to operate, maintain, and repair transferred projects. The Act requires transferred projects to be operated, maintained, repaired, and rehabilitated for their intended purposes. Projects may be redirected if the beneficiary determines a better public purpose. Mandates imposed by previous Acts or regulations will be terminated upon completion of transfers. The transfers directed by this Act are subject to specific requirements, including the use of transferred reclamation project property in accordance with the Act. The Act exempts the transfers from certain federal laws, such as the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the Endangered Species Act of 1973, and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is applicable to certain transfers directed by the Act, subject to specific requirements. SEC. 6. FACILITIES AFFECTED.
