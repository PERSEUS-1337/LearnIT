    "content": "Senate committees have the authority to hold hearings in various locations and for different purposes, following specific procedures outlined in Senate Rule XXVI. Committees must adopt written rules consistent with Senate rules, which may also apply to subcommittees. This report highlights the common elements of preparation and conduct for all types of hearings, with examples from the 109th Congress to illustrate variations in procedures. This report provides illustrative examples to show variations in committee rules for hearings. It does not cover all provisions comprehensively and advises consulting the actual rules for details. The report also includes common practices in planning and conducting hearings, which may differ among committees. Senators and staff are encouraged to contact specific committees for more information. Section two of this report, \"Preparation for Hearings,\" covers the planning process for committee hearings, including deciding on holding a hearing, obtaining supplemental staff, scheduling, selecting witnesses, issuing subpoenas, and media management. Section three, \"Conducting Hearings,\" discusses the process of holding a hearing, including quorum requirements. \"Conducting Hearings\" covers the process of holding a hearing, including quorum requirements, closing a hearing to the public, witness rights, opening statements, witness introduction, oral testimony, and question-and-answer period. \"Post-hearing Activities\" describes tasks committees undertake after a hearing, such as preparing a summary of testimony, additional questions for witnesses, and printing the hearing transcript. Hearings are crucial for gathering information in policymaking and oversight, informing Senators, staff, and the public, monitoring government programs, and attracting visibility for issues. Senate committees hold hearings to monitor government programs, expose problems, and allow citizen participation in the policy process. They act on a small portion of introduced measures, deciding on a limited number within their jurisdiction. Committees may send bills to subcommittees for consideration, but this is not required by Senate rules. When a committee or subcommittee considers a measure, it may take four actions: seeking agency comment, sending the measure to relevant executive departments, soliciting written evaluations, and involving the Office of Management and Budget. The full committee may repeat these steps based on various factors. The agency typically sends the measure and draft comments to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to determine consistency with the President's budget and legislative program. Committees may hold hearings to scrutinize proposals before bringing them to the floor for consideration. Committees play a crucial role in the legislative process by holding hearings to scrutinize proposals and recommending amendments through markup sessions. The full committee may report the legislation to the Senate floor, often issuing a written report to explain the measure's purposes and provisions. Senate rules, particularly Rule XXVI, govern the preparation and conduct of hearings. Committees adopt their own rules of procedure each Congress, which may expand on Senate rules. Customs and practices vary among committees, such as how they recognize Senators during hearings. Hearings serve different purposes, including legislative, oversight, investigative, and confirmation. Hearings provide a forum for presenting facts and opinions from various witnesses, including government officials, interest groups, and citizens. Oversight hearings focus on reviewing laws and government programs to ensure compliance with legislative intent and public interest, aiming to improve government operations. On September 30, 2004, multiple Senate committees held oversight hearings on various topics such as Internet domain names, college savings plans, and low-level radioactive waste. These hearings aim to review existing programs and legislation, ensuring compliance and improving government operations. Investigative hearings are conducted by Congress to investigate suspected wrongdoing by public officials. Congress has broad authority to investigate suspected wrongdoing by public officials or private citizens. Famous inquiries like Credit Mobilier, Teapot Dome, and Watergate have led to legislative remedies. Confirmation hearings for presidential nominations are held by Senate standing committees. Confirmation hearings for presidential nominations and ratification of treaties by the Senate are important aspects of congressional oversight. While most hearings are routine, some can be controversial. Additionally, field hearings held outside Washington also allow the Senate to fulfill its constitutional responsibilities in key areas of public policy. In Washington, field hearings are authorized by Senate Rule XXVI, paragraph 1, allowing committees to hold hearings outside of Washington as needed. These hearings are often held in areas relevant to the subject matter, such as a hearing on youth suicide prevention in North Dakota. While field hearings may differ in some aspects from Washington hearings, most procedural requirements remain the same. Funding for committee travel must adhere to regulations set by the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. The Senate Committee on Rules and Administration establishes the criteria for holding hearings, considering various factors like information needed, policy matters, and political messages. Factors influencing a hearing agenda include national issue salience, committee chair's goals, interest group policies, and matters important to the President and Senate leaders. Committees scrutinize programs for reauthorization and investigate waste, fraud, or abuse. They receive numerous proposals for examination and may study issues not tied to specific legislation, all within the context of their overall workload. Committees must decide if holding a hearing is the best use of resources, considering the agenda and jurisdiction. Approval for a hearing may require a preliminary memorandum outlining scope, purpose, witnesses, and minority party views. Informal discussions with members and staff can also move the hearing forward. Various resources are available to assist with hearings, which typically focus on government programs. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) can assist with hearings by framing the agenda, preparing background studies, evaluating proposals, providing experts as witnesses, suggesting witnesses, drafting questions, preparing documentation, analyzing testimony, and supplying program information. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) assists committees by reviewing executive branch programs through audits, investigations, and evaluations to measure effectiveness. Their reports contribute to oversight hearings by providing information on waste, fraud, and abuse in federal entities. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) provides key information on the U.S. economy to Congress. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) provides Congress with key information on the U.S. economy, federal budget, and programs. It assists committees by preparing cost estimates of legislation and tracking budget actions. CBO also estimates budgetary costs, forecasts economic trends, conducts studies on policy issues, and prepares annual reports on spending and revenue options for reducing the federal budget. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other entities provide resources and assistance to congressional committees, including data, analysis, and testimony. Interest groups and lobbyists play a role in framing issues and influencing legislation through congressional hearings. Committees also seek input from ordinary citizens with direct experience or impacted by proposed policies. Committees may hire consultants or employ staff detailed from any government agency to assist with hearings. Consultants must be selected jointly by the chair and ranking minority member of the committee and have unique qualifications not found in current federal employees. The services of consultants must be intermittent or temporary, not exceeding one year or the end of a Congress. Committees can hire employees detailed from federal agencies by submitting a letter for approval to the Committee on Rules and Administration. The Rules Committee reviews the details including title, salary, and cost-benefit assessment. Detailees can be hired on reimbursable or non-reimbursable basis. Additionally, fellowship, internship, and volunteer programs provide staff with varying levels of expertise. The Senate Office of Legislative Counsel assists in drafting various documents. The Senate Office of Legislative Counsel assists in drafting legislative vehicles and documents, including bills and amendments. Committees have the discretion to hold joint hearings with other committees or subcommittees, where they must agree on common rules and logistical questions. House and Senate panels also sometimes hold joint hearings on specific topics, such as Indian health care improvement or proposed constitutional amendments. The Senate Office of Legislative Counsel assists in drafting legislative vehicles and documents, including bills and amendments. Committees have the discretion to hold joint hearings with other committees or subcommittees, where they must agree on common rules and logistical questions. Joint hearings bring together expertise and differing perspectives, reducing difficulties and delays. Some Members believe separate perspectives provide significant benefits, increasing avenues of access for witnesses and opportunities for influence and exposure for committee members and leaders. Coordinating meeting times between two panels may present scheduling difficulties due to Senate rules. Committees in the Senate are allowed to meet and hold hearings even when the Senate is in session or has recessed. There are restrictions on meeting times to avoid overlap with floor sessions and scheduling conflicts. The Committees on Appropriations and the Budget are exceptions to these restrictions. Waivers for other committees are often granted by unanimous consent or agreement between majority and minority leaders. The majority leader announces any waivers on the floor. Senate rules restrict committees to meeting during specified time periods to avoid conflicts with floor sessions. Committees may meet in the morning until 11:00 a.m. or from 11:00 a.m. until 2:00 p.m. The committee chair controls the schedule, but any Senator can request hearings. Committees use an automated system to coordinate schedules and avoid overlaps. The consolidated hearing schedule is posted on the Senate's website. The Senate's committees must announce hearing details at least one week in advance, except for the Committees on Appropriations and the Budget. The rule can be waived with \"good cause.\" Notices of hearings are published in the Congressional Record and on the Senate's website, with some variations in committee rules. The Senate's committees must announce hearing details at least one week in advance, except for the Committees on Appropriations and the Budget. The rule can be waived with \"good cause.\" Notices of hearings are published in the Congressional Record and on the Senate's website. The Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry permits hearings with less than a week's public notice under certain conditions. The Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions has additional guidelines for hearings. Senate committees must notify the Office of the Senate Daily Digest immediately when scheduling a hearing or meeting. The Senate committees must provide details of hearings at least one week in advance, except for certain committees. Notices are published in the Congressional Record and on the Senate's website. Committees must inform the Daily Digest office immediately when scheduling a hearing or meeting, including any changes or cancellations. When selecting witnesses, committees consider various viewpoints and may invite witnesses with specific perspectives. Minority party members can request witnesses of their choice for at least one day of a hearing. The minority party members can request witnesses of their choice for a hearing day. The Committee on Appropriations is exempt from this rule. Witnesses must be invited by the committee, often after committee staff identify and interview prospective candidates. The committee chair sends a formal invitation letter with details of the hearing. The committee may send the witness additional information, including a list of committee members, rules, and press articles. Staff may meet with witnesses before a hearing. Witnesses may be reimbursed for per diem and travel expenses in hardship circumstances. Witnesses may be reimbursed for transportation expenses in hardship circumstances and are required to file an advance copy of written testimony with the committee before a hearing. The Committee on Appropriations is exempt from this rule, and the committee chair and ranking minority member can waive the requirement for advance copies in certain circumstances. Various committees have rules on when testimony should be filed, usually between 24 and 72 hours before the hearing. Senate committees have specific rules for witnesses to file written testimony in advance of hearings, with the Committee on Foreign Relations requiring 48 hours notice and the Committee on Veterans' Affairs requiring 40 copies to be filed. However, committee leaders can waive this requirement in cases of immediate need for testimony. Committees often summarize testimony, draft tailored questions, and determine the order of witnesses. Witnesses are usually asked to limit their oral remarks. Witnesses are typically asked to provide a brief oral summary of their written testimony during hearings. Committees may use different formats such as panel discussions with multiple witnesses offering varying viewpoints. This format is believed to stimulate debate and gather relevant information effectively. Committees have also experimented with formats like seminars, roundtable debates, video conferencing, and Internet participation. The order in which witnesses testify is determined by the committee's protocol. The order in which witnesses testify is determined by the committee's protocol. Members of Congress, high-ranking executive branch officials, former Representatives or Senators, and other high-level government officials are given priority. Celebrity witnesses are strategically placed for media attention, while academics, government officials, and private citizens are arranged to present information favorably. Witnesses may be positioned to refute or counter arguments made by others. Testifying is seen as an opportunity to communicate views on public policy. Committees have the authority to issue subpoenas to require appearances by witnesses or the production of material. Subpoenas are issued infrequently, mostly during investigative hearings. Each committee's rules outline the procedure for issuing subpoenas, with some delegating authority to the chair or requiring a majority vote. The chair of the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry can issue a subpoena with the approval of the ranking minority. The Committee on Small Business requires consent from the Ranking Minority Member or a majority of committee members to issue a subpoena. The Select Committee on Intelligence mandates that each subpoena be accompanied by specific documentation. Subpoenas can be obtained from the Office of Legal Counsel. Subpoenas are delivered by authorized committee staff or a U.S. Marshal and can be enforced through inherent contempt hearings, resolutions for contempt, or civil contempt resolutions. Committee staff consult with experts for information gathering, and formal means of obtaining information include investigative hearings. Formal means of obtaining information for investigative hearings include depositions, where committee staff take testimony in private, sometimes under oath, with a transcript prepared. Senate rules do not expressly authorize depositions by staff, but specific authority can be granted by resolution. For example, in the investigation of the Whitewater Development Corporation, committee staff were authorized to take depositions. The Committee on Foreign Relations authorizes staff to take depositions from witnesses, while the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs has detailed procedures for depositions due to its broad oversight authority. Staff also prepare briefing books for Senators, including information on the hearing's subject, purpose, and legislative measures under consideration. Briefing books for Senators include information on the hearing's subject, purpose, legislative measures, pertinent statutes, court decisions, press articles, agency reports, academic studies, and a chronology of major events. They also contain a list of witnesses, their order of appearance, written testimony summaries, biographical information, and questions/talking points for Senators. Committee staff may conduct oral briefings to discuss matters of interest to individual members. The goal of holding a hearing is not just to collect information for policy development. The goal of holding a hearing is broader than collecting information for policy development. It includes publicizing an issue to build support, and broadcasting hearings is determined by committee practice and chair decisions. Some committees provide minimal formal guidance on broadcasting. The rules for broadcasting hearings vary among different committees. For example, the Committee on Appropriations refers objections to the full committee, while the Committee on Finance requires approval from the chair for broadcasting equipment and lighting. The Select Committee on Ethics mandates accreditation for personnel providing broadcast coverage. Gallery staff from various media outlets, such as the Senate Daily Press Gallery and the Press Photographers' Gallery, assist in planning media coverage for Senate hearings. They distribute press releases, resolve camera crew disputes, and make pool arrangements to facilitate coverage of Senate activities. The Senate committees use various methods to inform the media of upcoming events, including mailing calendars with details of hearings and press releases. Different media galleries request copies of press releases, meeting notices, and conference announcements. The Periodical Press Gallery requests press releases for drafting letters and statements. Committee staff prepare media packets for hearings with various materials. Reporters seek information from staff on background. Press conferences are used to inform journalists about hearings. Some Senators prefer informal meetings with reporters. Press secretaries are advised to contact the Radio and Television Gallery staff in advance to reserve studio time for formal press conferences in the Capitol. Only members of the press can reserve studio time, and interviews in the studio are typically limited to Members of Congress. Exceptions must be authorized by the executive committees of the congressional galleries. Scheduled studio appearances are posted on the Senate electronic bulletin board and displayed in congressional media galleries. Senators can schedule appearances in the Senate Daily Press Gallery without needing an invitation from the press. Committees often publicize their hearings on their websites, providing information on dates, witnesses, and live webcasts. Some committees, like the Finance Committee, also include statements by Senators and witness testimony on their sites. Before a hearing, administrative arrangements are handled by a committee's staff, including reserving a room and hiring a reporter. Committees can request rooms from other offices and hire stenographic assistance from private firms. The Committee on Rules and Administration determines pay rates and guidelines for these services. Under a new rule in the 110th Congress, all committees and subcommittees must provide a video, audio recording, or transcript of hearings within 21 business days for public access online. Exceptions include closed hearings or waivers for technical reasons. Administrative details for hearings include setting up the room with nameplates, writing materials, and providing necessary items for the chair and members. Transcripts and recordings must be available until the end of the following Congress. Administrative details for hearings include setting up the room with necessary items for the chair and members, such as copies of committee and Senate rules, reserving seats, and arranging audio consoles. Security can be provided by Capitol Police if needed. Sufficient copies of materials should be provided for distribution during the hearing. Field hearings require additional planning considerations, such as identifying the location and layout of tables and chairs for Senators, witnesses, and the public. Staff may need to travel to the field location in advance to ensure arrangements are satisfactory. The administrative details for hearings include setting up the room with necessary items for the chair and members, reserving seats, and arranging audio consoles. Field hearings require additional planning considerations, such as identifying the location and layout of tables and chairs for Senators, witnesses, and the public. Funding for committee travel must meet regulations established by the Rules and Administration Committee, including expenses for official reporters and transportation for committee members and staff. Expenses for Senators and staff attending field hearings are reimbursable by the committee. Regulations for travel expenses can be found in Senate regulations or the Rules and Administration Committee. Hearings require thorough preparation, including meeting Senate rules and making critical decisions on witnesses and briefing materials. The preparation for Senate hearings includes assembling materials in a briefing book, conducting briefings for various parties, and addressing administrative issues. Committees determine the number of members needed for testimony, with most allowing one Senator to take testimony, but some requiring more for sworn testimony. The Senate committees have varying requirements for taking sworn testimony at hearings. The Committee on Armed Services needs three Senators, one from the minority party. The Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions allows one Senator with approval. The Committee on Rules and Administration requires two Senators for sworn testimony. Staff may poll Senators before hearings to determine attendance. The Senate committees have varying requirements for taking sworn testimony at hearings, with staff polling Senators to determine attendance. Committee hearings are mostly open to the public but can be closed for specific reasons outlined in Senate rules, such as national security concerns or privacy issues. The Senate rules allow for closing a hearing temporarily by committee motion and majority vote, lasting up to 14 days. Witnesses cannot refuse to testify based on potential disgrace. Constitutional protections, including the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments, apply to witnesses at Senate hearings. The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable search and seizure for obtaining information from witnesses. The First Amendment protects witnesses' rights to refuse compliance with a committee subpoena. The Fifth Amendment protects witnesses from self-incrimination unless granted immunity. Committee rules provide witnesses with the right to counsel, allowing them to have legal representation. The Senate committees have rules regarding witness representation and confidentiality. Witnesses can request cameras to be turned off during testimony. The chair usually presides over hearings, but in their absence, the ranking member of the majority party can preside. If no majority members are present, the ranking minority member may preside. The Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs has specific rules for chair absences. The Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs has rules for chair absences during hearings. If the chair is absent, the ranking majority member can preside after 10 minutes. If no majority member is present, the ranking minority member can preside with prior approval. The chair typically opens the hearing with an introduction of the subject, key issues, and the committee's approach. The ranking minority member may also make an opening statement, followed by other Senators. In the Senate, opening statements by Senators are generally unrestricted in debate time. The chair may request time limits to be observed. Witnesses are introduced in a specific order, with the possibility of a committee member introducing them. Sworn testimony oaths are not addressed in Senate rules, but any Senator can administer an oath to a witness. Committee rules usually dictate when oaths are necessary, such as in the Select Committee on Intelligence. The Select Committee on Ethics requires witnesses at adjudicatory hearings to be sworn in, unless the presiding Senator decides otherwise. Swearing witnesses is common at investigative and sensitive hearings, as well as confirmation hearings. While Senate rules do not limit oral testimony time, some committees impose a ten-minute cap. It is usually unnecessary for witnesses to read their entire prepared statement, as testimony is typically provided in advance. Some Senate committees impose a ten-minute limit on oral presentations, with guidelines for time management using lights. The question and answer period allows Senators to clarify statements and gather information for future actions. Committee staff prepare questions for leaders and members. Witnesses may be briefed on questioning. Senate rules allow unlimited speaking time. Some committees limit Senators to five minutes per witness. Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs limit to five or ten minutes based on attendance. Chair or presiding Senator decides if rules are silent. Committee leaders set ground rules for questioning during hearings. Committees determine the order of questioning, with some using alternating party seniority or the \"early bird rule\" based on arrival. Chairs can accommodate Senators' schedules. Senate and committee rules do not address the use of staff for questioning. The use of staff to question witnesses during hearings is determined by committee rules, with the chair having the prerogative to decide. Some committees, like the Committee on Small Business, permit staff to question witnesses. The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the Committee on Indian Affairs allow committee leadership to appoint one staff member for questioning. The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs permits \"authorized\" subcommittee staff to question witnesses. Staff can only question witnesses after Senators have completed their questioning. At the end of the question and answer period, the committee chair will close the hearing and may summarize the accomplishments and future schedule. Senate rules allow for daily digests of written statements and summaries of oral testimony to be prepared by staff. Summaries can be included in published hearings, distributed to members and the press. Follow-up questions can be submitted to witnesses for written replies to expand on their testimony or discuss new matters raised during the hearing. After a committee hearing, the chair may leave the record open for additional information. The committee can then prepare a report if the hearing is investigative, or proceed to markup and report a measure if it is legislative. Administrative tasks such as restoring the hearing room and sending thank-you letters to witnesses are attended to. Points of order are ruled upon by the Chairman, and no point of order for a violation of committee hearing rules will be entertained on the Senate floor if a measure has been properly reported. Senate committees are not required to print their hearings, but they are encouraged to do so. Rule XXVI, paragraph 10(a) allows committees to print their hearings and mandates that hearings be kept separate from the committee chairman's personal office. Points of order regarding procedural infractions during a hearing must be raised in committee, as they will not be sustained on the Senate floor once a measure has been properly reported. Senate committees are encouraged to print their hearings and keep them separate from the chairman's personal office. Hearings transcripts and related material become Senate property, with all committee members and Senators entitled to access.

Committees must make efforts to print and provide hearings if held on a reported measure. Witnesses can review their testimony for errors, with changes requiring approval from the committee chair or designated staff member. Senate committees are required to print hearings separately from the chairman's office, with transcripts becoming Senate property. Witnesses can review their testimony for errors, with changes needing approval from the committee chair or designated staff member. The Select Committee on Ethics rules mandate the publication of transcripts promptly, with the chair and vice chair authorized to order printing if review time expires.
