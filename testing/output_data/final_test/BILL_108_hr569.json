The Secretary holds a meeting to receive public comments and recommendations on payment amounts for tests, involving representatives from CMS. Interested parties are encouraged to participate through outreach activities, and interactive dialogue opportunities are provided. Comments and recommendations received are considered in developing and making information available to the public. The Secretary makes proposed determinations for payment amounts for new lab tests under Medicare available to the public. Public meetings may be convened for further comments. Rules and assumptions for consideration are identified under established procedures. The Secretary considers determinations for new lab test payment amounts under Medicare, makes data public, and allows for administrative reviews of adverse determinations. The Secretary revises determinations for new lab test payment amounts under Medicare based on review results. The term 'HCPCS' refers to the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System, and a code is 'substantially revised' if there is a substantive change to the test or procedure definition. The Secretary will pay the same fee schedule amount for a new test that is clinically similar to an established test. If the new test is not clinically similar, payment will be based on the lesser of the actual charge or a percentage of the prevailing charge level. Economic factors cannot be considered in determining clinical similarity. The fee schedule amount for a new test will be based on the prevailing charge level until sufficient claims data is available to establish a fee schedule amount. The fee schedule amount for a clinical diagnostic laboratory test described in clause (i) will be determined based on the national limitation amount adjusted by percentage increase or decrease for the first calendar year after clause (i) ceases to apply, and subsequently by the fee schedule amount determined under this clause. The national limitation amount for a test is set at 100 percent of the median payment amounts for all payment localities in the last calendar year. The Secretary can apply comparability provisions to amounts determined under this clause. The Secretary can set fee schedule amounts for tests, with exceptions, based on median payment amounts from all localities in the previous year. The Secretary can set fee schedule amounts for tests based on median payment amounts from all localities in the previous year. Amendments to the Social Security Act adjust the national limitation amount for tests performed in 2004 and beyond. The Secretary can establish a mechanism for reviewing payment amounts for specific tests under the Social Security Act. Interested parties can request a review of payment adequacy, and new codes for clinical diagnostic tests cannot be assigned by the Secretary. The Secretary cannot assign new codes for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests that differ from the recommended codes by the American Medical Association. Additionally, the Secretary cannot substitute a least costly alternative fee schedule amount for a test under the Social Security Act. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must establish procedures by October 1, 2003, to implement certain sections of the Social Security Act related to code assignment determinations and fee schedule amounts for tests. The Act prohibits code assignment determinations made after its enactment and applies the amendment regarding fee schedule amounts to tests furnished after the enactment date."
