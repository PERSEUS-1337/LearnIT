Its core membership is in Iraq and Syria, supported by foreign fighters and affiliate groups in various countries. The group's apocalyptic ideology and embrace of transnational terrorism have raised concerns globally. As the Islamic State loses territory in Iraq and Syria, policymakers are debating strategies to defeat the group. The Islamic State, also known as ISIL/ISIS, has lost significant territory in Iraq and Syria from 2014 to 2018 due to military operations by the U.S.-led coalition. Despite these losses, Defense Department officials warn that the group is well-positioned to rebuild and potentially re-emerge. They assess that the Islamic State may still be more capable than Al Qaeda in Iraq at its peak in 2006-2007. U.S. officials are concerned about the group's potential to regain strength and pose a threat to security. The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) remains a threat in Iraq and Syria, with an estimated 30,000 current and former members in the region. Some coalition officials believe this estimate is high, suggesting there are over a thousand ISIS fighters in the Middle Euphrates River Valley. Despite fewer active fighters, ISIS retains the ability to draw strength from supporters who have reduced their activity for self-preservation or strategic reasons. The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has seen a decline in morale among supporters, disruption in finances, recruitment streams, communications, and leadership. U.N. estimates show ISIS transitioning from a proto-State structure to a covert network. Official IS media output has fluctuated but remains focused on operations in Syria and Iraq. U.S. officials estimated 40,000 individuals from over 110 countries traveled to Syria and Iraq for combat since 2012. According to the ODNI, over 6,600 Westerners, including Europeans and some U.S. citizens, have engaged in combat in Iraq since 2012. Many of these foreign fighters, including U.S. citizens, joined the Islamic State. Reports indicate a decrease in new foreign fighters traveling to Syria or Iraq, but challenges remain due to the diverse and global nature of the foreign fighter population. The potential challenges associated with returnees and relocators are significant, as noted in a March 2018 United Nations assessment. The Islamic State's affiliate in Afghanistan has a high percentage of foreign fighters, including Europeans, who have returned to their countries of origin. The group's territorial losses since 2017 may affect its ability to carry out attacks outside of Syria and Iraq. The U.S. intelligence community predicts that the Islamic State will continue to prioritize transnational terrorist attacks, while homegrown violent extremists will remain a prevalent threat in the United States. One recent study found that despite a reduction in successful IS attacks in Europe and North America in 2018, the number of attempted IS attacks in Europe has remained unchanged. Analysts assess that there is \"no correlation\" between IS's loss of territory and the threat it poses to the West. The Obama Administration's strategy focused on working with local partners to reduce threats, while the Trump Administration has made some changes, including deploying additional military personnel to Iraq and Syria. The U.S.-led coalition operations in Iraq and Syria enabled the recapture of IS strongholds in Mosul and Raqqah in 2017. Currently, only isolated pockets of IS control remain in eastern Syria. U.S. officials plan a significant military operation in the Middle Euphrates Valley to prevent ISIS resurgence. Challenges now focus on preventing IS remnants from becoming a chronic insurgent threat. Relations with Syria and Iraq remain complex. The Trump Administration and Congress are reviewing U.S. plans for assistance in conflict-affected areas in Syria and Iraq. Funds have been authorized for military operations against ISIS and the training of partner forces. The State Department is committed to defeating ISIS and has made new personnel appointments and funding decisions for stabilization efforts. Congress has requested a new articulation of U.S. strategies towards the region. The 115th Congress is considering a new authorization for military force against ISIS and other terrorist groups. ISIS leaders have endorsed attacks globally since 2014, but their involvement in planning varies. They encourage independent attacks by supporters who cannot travel to Syria or Iraq. ISIS leaders have endorsed attacks globally since 2014, encouraging independent attacks by supporters who are unable to travel to Syria or Iraq. In May 2016, IS spokesman urged supporters in Europe and the United States to carry out individual attacks, providing instructions for improvised attacks. Adnani was killed in a U.S. airstrike in September 2016. In August 2018, IS leader praised individual attackers in Europe, Canada, and other countries, urging others to follow their example using easily obtainable means. The U.S. intelligence community assesses that the Islamic State remains a terrorist threat to U.S. interests worldwide. There is ongoing debate about the group's capability to conduct attacks in the United States. U.S. officials believe attacks by IS supporters are inevitable due to a global network of individuals supporting the group. The Trump Administration continues the partnership-based approach to countering the Islamic State. The global coalition continues efforts to defeat the Islamic State through military action, intelligence sharing, and disrupting the group's activities. Progress has been made in Syria and Iraq, but IS attacks persist in both countries and elsewhere. The U.S. intelligence community warns of long-term challenges in stabilizing the region and the ongoing threat of insurgent and terrorist activities. The Islamic State's loss of ground since 2014 has led to discussions on governance and reconstruction in recaptured areas. U.S. officials aim to consolidate gains and prevent further conflicts. Intelligence estimates warn of insurgent campaigns in Syria and Iraq, reconstruction costs, and complex challenges post-Islamic State. Resurgence concerns persist despite the group's decline. Policy discussions are ongoing regarding the potential resurgence of the Islamic State, even without holding territory. Some believe the group may exploit the failed uprising against the Syrian government to establish a permanent presence in the region. Observers note small-scale attacks in Iraq months after officials declared victory over the group in 2017. The Islamic State thrives in ungoverned areas. State organization and its regional adherents have thrived in ungoverned or under-governed areas of conflict-affected countries, providing resources and safe-haven for IS operations and recruiting disaffected local groups. Efforts to undermine IS supporters depend on restoring security, addressing political grievances, boosting economic growth, and promoting effective governance in places like Iraq, Syria, Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, Libya, Afghanistan, Yemen, the Sahel, the southern Philippines, and the Lake Chad basin. The United States emphasizes supporting inclusive security forces under central government command in Iraq. The United States supports inclusive security forces under central government command in Iraq and seeks a negotiated settlement in Syria to remove President Asad while preserving the country's institutions and security structures. Concerns have been raised about relations between Arabs and Kurds in northern Syria due to U.S. support for a predominantly Kurdish coalition of forces. Parties' concerns about relations between Arabs and Kurds in Syria, U.S. counterterrorism partnerships with national governments, and the risks of working with partners in countries like Libya and Yemen. The U.S. and coalition strategy may involve unpredictable influences on political disputes and empowering local conflicts hostile to U.S. security. The Trump and Obama Administrations have targeted groups associated with the Islamic State under the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force. Military operations have been conducted in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Libya, the Philippines, Niger, and Somalia. The Senate in the 115th Congress has also considered these operations. In the 115th Congress, the Senate has considered legislation (S.J.Res. 59) to replace the 2001 AUMF for military operations in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Libya, the Philippines, Niger, and Somalia. U.S. military operations against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria are under CJTF-OIR, costing $23.5 billion as of March 2018. Operation Freedom's Sentinel in Afghanistan consists of NATO-led missions under Resolute Support. The NATO-led Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan focuses on training Afghan government forces, while U.S. counterterrorism forces target the Islamic State's affiliate and Al Qaeda. The Department of Defense has spent $134.3 billion on Operation Freedom's Sentinel since 2015. In Libya, Operation Odyssey Lightning involved airstrikes and U.S. military assistance to local militia forces against the Islamic State's affiliate. In 2017 and 2018, U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) highlighted the instability in Libya and North Africa as a significant threat to U.S. and allies' interests. They warned of the risk of a full-scale civil war in Libya. Additionally, Operation Pacific Eagle-Philippines (OPE-P) was launched in 2017 to assist the Philippines armed forces in defeating IS affiliates and other extremist groups, with roughly 250 U.S. military advisers providing training and assistance. Operation Pacific Eagle-Philippines (OPE-P) is a short-term, targeted operation by the Department of Defense to assist the Philippines government. The US has committed $89.8 million for OPE-P and provided surveillance aircraft and drones for counterterrorism. Additionally, the US announced $26.5 million in State Department counterterrorism assistance and USAID provided $32 million for humanitarian efforts in IS-affected areas of the Philippines. US military personnel have also deployed to Iraq for various purposes. As of March 2018, over 138,000 Iraqi personnel, including Security Forces, police, Kurdish peshmerga, and Sunni tribal fighters, have received training to combat the Islamic State. Iraqi and U.S. officials are discussing a long-term security partnership that may involve U.S. personnel staying in Iraq to assist in training and advising Iraqi security forces. The U.S. military presence in Iraq is authorized by Iraq's government through diplomatic notes referencing the 2008 Strategic Framework Agreement. U.S. contributions to training efforts in Iraq are facilitated through the Iraq Train and Equip program authorized by Congress in the FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act. The FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act authorized the Iraq training program, extended through December 31, 2020 by the FY2019 NDAA. The Office of Security Cooperation at the U.S. Embassy in Iraq provides assistance to Iraqi military and national security forces. The Trump Administration requested $850 million for the Iraq Train and Equip program in FY2019. Congress also authorized a train and equip program for vetted Syrians in 2014 to combat ISIS and promote a negotiated settlement in Syria. The Obama Administration altered the train and equip program for Syrian rebels in October 2015, shifting towards supporting existing groups fighting ISIS in Syria. The revamped program focuses on equipping and enabling vetted leaders and groups, with U.S.-trained individuals now part of a Kurdish-Arab coalition force in northern Syria. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and other groups in Syria have received equipment and support from the US, with special operations personnel advising and assisting in operations against ISIS. The program is authorized under Section 1209 of the FY2015 defense authorization act, with funds reprogrammed from defense accounts for program activities. The FY2019 NDAA extended the authorization for the Counter-ISIS Train and Equip Fund program through December 31, 2019. The Trump Administration requested $300 million for Syria programs. U.S. officials believe ISIS will evolve into an insurgency force in Syria and Iraq despite coalition efforts to degrade the group. Intelligence assessments indicate ISIS will maintain a robust insurgency in Iraq and Syria to enable the reemergence of its caliphate. In Iraq and Syria, competition and discord among local actors complicate U.S. objectives, with intervention by regional and extra-regional actors adding to the complexity. IS forces have lost territory, leading to struggles over the future of liberated areas. Iraq faces political and fiscal crises, with leaders vying for power amid demands for security, services, and an end to corruption. IS attacks on civilians and security forces persist. In Iraq and Syria, violence attributed to IS fighters continues, resembling the period before the Islamic State's resurgence in 2013 and 2014. The U.S. intelligence community warns that IS remains a terrorist threat, seeking to exploit Sunni discontent and regain Iraqi territory. In Syria, the conflict between the Asad government and armed opposition has shifted in favor of pro-Asad forces, leading to a de facto division of the country. The Trump Administration plans to continue supporting Syrian partner forces for security in areas outside the Syrian government's control, where U.S.-backed Kurdish and Arab groups are located. Pro-Asad forces consolidating security control in western Syria may lead to increased demands for foreign forces to leave Syrian territory. This could complicate U.S. operations in the region and prompt U.S. partners to seek political and security agreements with the Syrian government. The U.S. plans to provide security support to Syrian partner forces in recaptured areas from the Islamic State, but the impact of the Asad government's reassertion of authority on these plans is uncertain. Congress debates the effectiveness of U.S. efforts against the Islamic State and oversees military operations and counter-IS programs. Billions of dollars have been allocated for military operations and assistance in Iraq and Syria since 2014. The ongoing executive and legislative policy debates in the United States focus on balancing diplomatic, military, intelligence, economic, and law enforcement tools in response to IS-related threats. Key questions include how to undermine the appeal of the Islamic State's ideology, prioritize efforts in Syria and other countries, and assess the impact of military operations on recaptured territory. The key questions surrounding future military and counterterrorism operations against the Islamic State include political and military arrangements, stabilization assistance, addressing risks posed by returning foreign fighters, altering political dynamics in affected regions, and shaping overall U.S. policy towards Syria and Iraq. The Islamic State's roots in Iraq and Syria trace back to forces led by Abu Musab al Zarqawi from 2002 to 2006, taking advantage of Sunni resentment towards U.S. forces and disenfranchisement by Iraq's Shia and Kurds. This led to the emergence of Tawhid wal Jihad and Al Qaeda in Iraq, with a sectarian agenda different from Al Qaeda's. Following Zarqawi's death in 2006, AQ-I leaders rebranded as the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI). Despite losing top leaders in 2010, ISI rebuilt under new leadership and began conducting deadly attacks in Iraq and Syria by early 2013. Abu Bakr al Baghdadi announced plans to merge forces in both countries. In April 2013, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi announced the merger of his forces in Iraq and Syria with Jabhat al Nusra to form the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL/ISIS). Al Qaeda leaders rejected the merger, leading to growing tensions among Sunni extremists. Al Qaeda disavowed the Islamic State in early 2014, as IS leaders declared themselves a sovereign political entity separate from Al Qaeda. In June 2014, Islamic State leaders declared the establishment of a Caliphate. In June 2014, Islamic State leaders declared the reestablishment of the caliphate, naming Abu Bakr al Baghdadi as caliph and imam. Baghdadi's reported descent from the Quraysh tribe and religious training were highlighted as qualifications for his position. The group cited historical requirements of the caliphate as grounds for religious legitimacy. The Islamic State organization declared the reestablishment of the caliphate in June 2014 with Abu Bakr al Baghdadi as caliph. While some followers were attracted to the idea, his self-appointment has been rejected by many Islamic scholars and lacks mass political support. Critics question his authority over the Muslim community and condemn the unilateral announcement of the caliphate without consensus. Some jihadist groups, like Al Qaeda, reject Baghdadi's appointment as caliph, pledging loyalty to leaders like Mullah Omar instead. The limited appeal of Al Qaeda and Islamic State demands for leadership recognition suggests their violent agenda is popular only among a small minority of Sunni Muslims. Since 2014, armed groups in various countries have pledged loyalty to the Islamic State caliphate led by Abu Bakr al Baghdadi. The implications of these pledges on groups' objectives, tactics, and leadership structures vary. The Trump and Obama Administrations have considered IS-associated groups as legitimate military targets. The Islamic State in Egypt (IS-SP) is considered the most significant and capable IS adherent group. Designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, IS-SP operates in the Sinai Peninsula, using it as a safe haven to plan attacks in Egypt. The Islamic State in Egypt (IS-SP) operates in the Sinai Peninsula and mainland Egypt, claiming credit for destructive attacks including the downing of Metrojet Flight 9268 and the Al Rawdah mosque massacre. They have targeted Coptic Christians and attempted to assassinate Egyptian Ministers. IS-SP has between 800 and 1,200 fighters in Sinai and affiliated cells in the Nile Valley. In February 2018, the U.S. State Department designated ISIS Egypt as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist group. The State Department designated ISIS-Egypt as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist group (SDGT) under Executive Order 13224. ISIS-Egypt has claimed responsibility for attacks in Egypt, including the bombing of Cairo's Coptic Christian cathedral. In February 2018, the Egyptian military launched \"Operation Sinai 2018\" to combat IS-SP in the Sinai Peninsula. As of late May 2018, the operation had resulted in casualties. The Egyptian military launched \"Operation Sinai 2018\" in February 2018 to combat IS-SP in the Sinai Peninsula. As of late May 2018, over 300 people have been killed, including 37 Egyptian military personnel. The Islamic State in Libya has announced three provinces in 2014 and 2015, but lacks organizational infrastructure. United Nations estimates the group has 3,000 to 4,000 members. The Islamic State in Libya, with an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 members, still poses a threat with the capacity to launch significant attacks within Libya and beyond. The group's presence in Libya was described as one of its most developed branches outside of Syria and Iraq, with the potential to expand territory in 2016. However, their expansion was halted when their stronghold in Sirte came under siege in 2016. IS losses in and around Sirte in 2016 were aided by a U.S. military campaign. By the end of 2017, IS elements in Libya were only capable of local-level operations. IS-Libya had around 500 fighters in May 2017, down from 6,000 in early 2016. Despite this, supporters of the group continue to carry out attacks in eastern and western Libya. Cells persist in various areas according to a July 2018 U.N. report. In November 2015, the U.S. military conducted airstrikes in Libya targeting IS operatives. A February 2016 strike in Sabratha killed many IS fighters. IS supporters in Libya are designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations. Boko Haram, a terrorist group in Nigeria, was formerly known as Jama'a Ahl as-Sunna Li-da'wa. Boko Haram, now known as ISWAP, split into two factions in 2015. The original faction is referred to as Boko Haram, while the offshoot group led by Abu Musab al Barnawi is known as IS-WA. Both factions pose a security threat in Nigeria and the surrounding region, with over 15,800 deaths attributed to Boko Haram since 2011. More than 2 million people have been displaced by the violence, which has spread into neighboring countries. Boko Haram, now known as ISWAP, split into two factions in 2015, posing a security threat in Nigeria and neighboring countries. IS-WA operates near Lake Chad and the Nigeria-Niger border, focusing on military targets. Both groups carried out hundreds of attacks in Nigeria in 2017, using various tactics including suicide bombers and kidnappings. The Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (IS-GS) is an offshoot of the Algerian-led regional network Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), based along the Mali-Niger border. IS-GS was formed in May 2015 when leader Adnan Abu Walid al Sahrawi pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, with the pledge acknowledged in October 2016. Al Sahrawi, born in Western Sahara, was previously a member of AQIM. In 2016, Al Sahrawi, a former member of AQIM, was designated as a Specially-Designated Global Terrorist by the U.S. government along with IS-GS. IS-GS has claimed attacks, including an ambush on U.S. soldiers in Niger. The group is believed to be holding a kidnapped U.S. civilian. IS-GS focuses on local targets driven by grievances among its recruitment base in Mali and Niger. The Islamic State-Khorasan Province (ISKP) is an increasingly prominent actor in the conflict in Afghanistan and a major target of U.S. operations. The group was originally made up of disaffected Taliban and other fighters who declared allegiance to IS as early as 2013. ISKP was officially announced as IS's Afghan affiliate in January 2015. The group's size is estimated to be several hundred combatants, and it shares ties with AQIM's Mali-based network to destabilize the Sahel region. The Islamic State-Khorasan Province (ISKP) was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 2015 and listed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist in 2016. The group has operational capabilities in eastern and northern Afghanistan, with foreign fighters coming from Syria and Iraq. A senior ISKP leader in northern Afghanistan was killed in a U.S. airstrike in 2018. Jowzjan province was described as a conduit for external support and foreign fighters into Afghanistan. ISKP, a designated terrorist organization, has seen a significant increase in militants, now estimated at 3,500 to 4,000. Key leaders have been killed in U.S. strikes, leading to intense fighting in 2017. The Taliban has also targeted ISKP, with many fighters surrendering after being defeated in 2018. ISKP has claimed responsibility for large-scale urban attacks in Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, ISIS-K remains a deadly threat despite US and Afghan military campaigns. In Yemen, ISIS affiliates target government forces and religious factions using suicide bombings and IEDs, particularly attacking mosques frequented by Zaydi Islam worshippers. The Islamic State targets supporters of the Houthi Movement in Yemen, a Zaydi armed militia aiming to restore Zaydi-led rule. Yemen, despite being at war, has not traditionally had the same sectarian animosity as other Arab states. The group was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and listed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist in 2016. In October 2017, the U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on leaders and financiers of Islamic State affiliates in Yemen. U.S. government assessments noted an increase in IS-Y attacks in late 2017. The U.S. military conducted its first air strike against ISIS-Y in Al Bayda governorate. The Islamic State in the Caucasus, recognized in June 2015, consists of commanders previously affiliated with the Al Qaeda-aligned Islamic Emirate of the Caucasus. The group was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and listed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist in September 2015. Russian officials claimed to have killed the emir of Wilayah Kawkaz in December 2016. Foreign fighters from Russia were a significant part of the Islamic State's fighting force in Iraq and Syria. IS leaders in Syria and Iraq have threatened Saudi Arabia's rulers and clerics, urging attacks on Shia Muslims, Saudi security forces, and foreigners. IS supporters have claimed responsibility for attacks in Saudi Arabia since 2014. The Islamic State has been responsible for multiple attacks in Saudi Arabia since 2014, including suicide bombings targeting Shia mosques and Saudi security forces. Saudi officials have arrested over 1,600 suspected IS supporters and thwarted planned attacks. U.S. diplomatic facilities closed temporarily in 2015 due to threats, and an IS suicide bomber attacked the U.S. Consulate in Jeddah in 2016. U.S. officials continue to warn of potential attacks on U.S. and Western targets in the kingdom. The Islamic State in Saudi Arabia is designated as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The Islamic State poses a political threat to Saudi Arabia, challenging the legitimacy of Saudi leaders and calling on Saudis to rise up against the government. Abu Bakr al Baghdadi criticized Saudi social reform plans as a Western plot. The Saudi government's social reform plans are criticized as a Western plot by Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, who alleges it aims to \"Westernize and Germanize\" Muslims. Saudi leaders argue against the Islamic State's lack of legitimacy and its threat of violence to Saudi society. Extremist groups and Islamic State affiliates have found breeding grounds in areas of the southern Philippines due to failed government control and Muslim separatist insurgencies. Islamist militants from Indonesia, Malaysia, and beyond have also been drawn to western Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago, where ISIS-Philippines (ISIS-P) operates, including remnants of the Abu Sayyaf Group. The Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) in the Philippines was weakened by the Philippine Armed Forces with U.S. military assistance, reducing their fighters from 1,000-2,000 in 2002 to 300-400 in 2013. However, a resurgence of Islamist terrorist threats occurred in 2015 due to various factors. In May 2017, the Maute Group and other Filipino Islamist extremist organizations pledged allegiance to IS, leading to a heightened threat in the region. Islamist extremist groups, including foreign fighters, besieged Marawi, the capital of Lanao del Sur province. The conflict resulted in nearly 900 militant deaths, over 150 AFP troops, and around 50 civilians. The Philippine military reclaimed the city after five months in October 2017, with significant destruction. ISIS-P, with an estimated 200 fighters during the battle, continues to engage in \"low-level clashes.\" Islamist extremist groups have regrouped, attracting new followers since late 2017. ASG sustains itself through criminal activities like kidnapping for ransom and drug trafficking. Financing for ISIL-P includes IS funding and looting during the Marawi siege."
