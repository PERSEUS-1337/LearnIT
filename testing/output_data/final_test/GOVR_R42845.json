The federal government plays a role when a state requests assistance. The number and type of actors involved vary depending on the context and severity of the event. The legal framework for emergency management is decentralized and stems from multiple authorities. This report introduces Members of Congress to the principles of federal emergency management in the U.S. The report discusses federal emergency management in the United States, including the roles of various federal agencies like FEMA, National Guard, and others. It covers the four phases of emergency management, the process for requesting federal assistance, types of assistance provided, federal-to-state cost shares, funding for federal assistance, and how FEMA requests assistance. The report outlines how federal assistance is funded and the process through which FEMA requests assistance from other federal entities. It also discusses key federal laws and policies influencing federal emergency management and highlights federal entities that provide assistance to states and localities. The all-hazards model is based on generic processes and capabilities needed to address most emergencies and disasters. Emergency managers can address various emergencies and disasters using similar processes and capabilities, making emergency management activities more flexible and cost-effective. The all-hazards model allows for adaptation and the application of preparations and lessons learned across different types of events. Emergency management functions are guided by the National Incident Management System (NIMS), authorized by Homeland Security Presidential Directive 5 (HSPD-5). NIMS, based on ICS, standardizes response operations for a unified and scalable structure. State and local governments must be NIMS compliant for certain preparedness grants. Emergency management functions are grouped into four phases: Mitigation. The four phases of emergency management are Mitigation, Preparedness, Response, and Recovery. These phases help classify activities, but they often overlap and are cyclical in nature. Federal grant funding does not require states to use the four phases, as the federal government's framework approach differs somewhat. Mitigation activities involve identifying risks and hazards to reduce the impact of incidents through structural measures. Examples include building codes, zoning rules, rebuilding with resilient materials, flood mapping, and dams/levees to prevent flooding. Mitigation often occurs during the recovery stage of a disaster and has a long-term effect on insurance premiums. Preparedness activities focus on enhancing the capacity to respond to incidents through training, planning, resource procurement, intelligence activities, and exercises. Response activities involve immediate actions to save lives, protect property, and meet basic human needs, including evacuations and deployment of response teams and assets. Recovery activities aim to restore essential services and repair damages caused by an event, including reconstituting government operations, providing housing for displaced individuals, and replenishing stockpiles. President Barack Obama issued Presidential Policy Directive 8 (PPD-8) on March 30, 2011, which supersedes Homeland Security Presidential Directive 8 (HSPD-8) signed by President George W. Bush in 2003. PPD-8 provides guidance on how the nation can prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from threats. PPD-8, issued by President Obama in 2011, aims to address threats like terrorism, natural disasters, and human-caused incidents. It establishes preparedness objectives through integrated national planning frameworks for prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery. These frameworks assign roles to federal agencies involved in emergency management. The National Prevention Framework focuses on preventing terrorist threats by assigning roles and coordinating federal agencies for intelligence sharing and surveillance. The National Protection Framework covers a wide range of emergency management and homeland security areas, including cyber security, border security, transportation security, and food security. The National Mitigation Framework focuses on reducing the impact of disasters at the local level, with less federal government involvement compared to other planning frameworks. The National Response Framework (NRF) replaced previous response documents due to their limitations and issues. The NRF guides the federal response to incidents through emergency management principles and three supplemental annexes. ESFs match federal resources with specific incidents, such as oil spills in ESF #10. The National Disaster Recovery Framework (NDRF) coordinates roles and responsibilities for disaster recovery, focusing on restoring health, social, economic, natural, and environmental aspects of impacted states and local jurisdictions. It assigns roles to entities involved in recovery efforts. The National Disaster Recovery Framework (NDRF) focuses on restoring health, social, economic, and environmental aspects of disaster-impacted states and local jurisdictions. The system of emergency management in the United States is scalable, allowing local governments to request assistance from the state or federal government if needed. This scalability is embedded within the federalist system of governance aimed at preserving state autonomy. The Stafford Act allows the President to issue emergency declarations without a gubernatorial request in rare cases involving federal responsibility. Federal disaster assistance is mainly provided after a presidential declaration in response to a governor's request. Declarations include major disaster, emergency, and Fire Management Assistance Grant declarations. The Stafford Act allows the President to issue emergency declarations without a gubernatorial request in rare cases involving federal responsibility. Declarations include major disaster, emergency, and Fire Management Assistance Grant declarations, which are typically declared through FEMA. Major disaster is defined as any natural catastrophe or fire, flood, explosion causing severe damage warranting assistance. FEMA assists state representatives in developing preliminary damage assessments for major disaster declarations. The President may or may not act on FEMA's recommendation. Three types of assistance can be provided: Public Assistance, Individual Assistance, and Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. The President may issue a declaration providing only Public Assistance if dwelling damage is not severe enough for Individual Assistance. The Public Assistance (PA) program provides assistance to state and local governments, nonprofit organizations, and eligible facilities for emergency protective measures, debris removal, and repairs. Hazard mitigation measures are also included. Assistance is determined by FEMA officials for entities in need, with no cap on the amount provided. The Individual Assistance (IA) program offers temporary housing, disaster unemployment, legal services, and other needs assistance to those deemed in need by FEMA officials. The Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) provides grants to states for activities that prevent future disasters or reduce their impact. The maximum grant amount available to an individual household is $31,400. The Post-Katrina Act adjusted the percentage amounts for HMGP awards based on the total Stafford Act assistance provided for major disasters. The Stafford Act defines an emergency as an occasion requiring federal assistance to save lives and protect property. FEMA recommends emergency declarations to the President, which authorize activities to reduce future damage and save lives. Per capita formula is not used for emergency declarations. Emergency declarations are recommended by FEMA to the President to save lives and protect property during disasters. Assistance provided includes debris removal, food distribution, and technical advisory support to state and local governments. Section 420 of the Stafford Act authorizes federal assistance for fire control and mitigation on public or private forest land. FEMA meets with state representatives upon request for Fire Management Assistance Grants (FMAG). FEMA meets with state representatives upon request for Fire Management Assistance Grants (FMAG) to provide essential assistance for disaster relief, including distribution of medicine, food, debris removal, search and rescue, and emergency mass care. FMAG does not offer long-term assistance to individuals and households. The Stafford Act outlines cost-sharing between state and federal government for response and recovery efforts. The federal government must pay at least 75% of eligible repairs, with the option to adjust the cost-share through waivers. Waivers are typically based on FEMA regulatory authority and per capita damage estimates. Congress has started adjusting cost-shares due to concerns about state capacity after the 2005 Gulf Coast storms. The majority of assistance under the Stafford Act comes from FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), used for response activities and ongoing recovery programs. The DRF is funded through regular appropriations and supplemented when needed. When the DRF balance is low, FEMA freezes spending on long-term recovery projects to prioritize immediate needs until the fund is replenished. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is used for response activities and ongoing recovery programs. FEMA freezes spending on long-term recovery projects when the DRF balance is low to prioritize immediate needs. The termination of Stafford Act recovery projects is not subject to strict deadlines, and PA and HMGP projects typically take years to complete. Projects are closed individually by FEMA and the state when all costs are reconciled with supporting documentation. When all projects within a disaster are closed, the disaster can be closed. Funding for recovery projects completed under budget is returned to the DRF. States can appeal for additional federal funding for projects. Major disaster declarations under the Stafford Act can trigger federal programs outside of FEMA, such as the SBA disaster loan program. The Small Business Administration (SBA) disaster loan program can be triggered by major disaster declarations under the Stafford Act. Various federal departments and agencies have separate authorities to respond to disasters and emergencies, which may be coordinated by the Secretary of Homeland Security. These authorities are carried out within the National Response Framework (NRF) or other operational plans. Other federal agencies and departments also have responsibilities for handling incidents and may work together with FEMA. Federal entities responsible for handling incidents may collaborate with other federal agencies when the situation exceeds their normal operations. Support under the Stafford Act is typically done through \"Mission Assignments,\" while non-Stafford incidents are managed through interagency agreements and mutual aid agreements. Even with an emergency or disaster declaration, FEMA does not exclusively handle all response and recovery operations. The President can direct any federal agency to assist state and local efforts under specific sections of the Stafford Act. FEMA coordinates federal entities involved in incidents by assigning missions. Federal entities collaborate with other agencies during incidents, assigning missions to address state requests for assistance. FEMA coordinates these activities, reimbursing agencies through the DRF. Statutory laws and policies supplement the Stafford Act, organizing and defining response efforts. The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 amended the Stafford Act to authorize assistance for pre-disaster hazard mitigation measures. It also established the National Predisaster Mitigation Fund to provide aid to states and local governments. The Post Katrina Act of 2006 provided financial assistance to state and local governments for disaster mitigation partnerships. It introduced reforms in federal emergency management, established new leadership positions within FEMA, and enhanced the agency's authority before and after disasters. The Post Katrina Act of 2006 amended laws such as the Stafford Act and the Homeland Security Act, establishing new preparedness requirements. It authorized the President to set a national preparedness goal, ensure disaster response capabilities, and report to Congress on policy implementation and aid enhancements. President Bush signed Homeland Security Presidential Directives (HSPD) after the September 11th attacks, including HSPD-8 and HSPD-5. HSPD-5 aimed to improve the US's ability to manage domestic incidents by establishing a national incident management system. This directive mandated the development of a national response plan and concept of operations to manage incidents through the implementation of NIMS. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 authorized the reorganization of federal agencies, creating the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and establishing the Directorate of Emergency Preparedness and Response. The Act also made the DHS Secretary responsible for ensuring the effectiveness of emergency response providers in various situations, including terrorist attacks and major disasters. The National Contingency Plan (NCP) is the federal government's main response plan for oil spills and hazardous substance releases. It coordinates federal, state, and local roles in responding to incidents and is enforceable by federal regulation. The National Contingency Plan (NCP) is unique among federal emergency response plans for guiding agency roles and responsibilities. Three federal laws authorize the regulations in the NCP: the Oil Pollution Act (OPA), Section 311 of the Clean Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). OPA and the Clean Water Act cover oil spills into U.S. waters, while CERCLA addresses releases of hazardous substances into the environment. The President's response authorities under three laws are delegated to the EPA and U.S. Coast Guard. The NCP designates these agencies as lead federal agencies and outlines roles for other supporting agencies and state/local governments in response actions. State and local officials are often the first responders under the NCP to protect public safety. Two trust funds, administered by the U.S. Coast Guard and EPA, finance federal response actions for oil spills and hazardous substances. The federal government can recover response costs from responsible parties, with funds deposited back into the trust funds. If responsible parties cannot be found or pay, taxpayers bear the federal response costs. The NCP governs emergency response and long-term environmental remediation, with response costs borne by taxpayers. Remediation can last for years, including restoring natural resources. The NCP can be invoked in coordination with other federal response plans in major disasters or emergencies. ESF#10 of the National Response Framework applies the NCP as the federal response plan for incidents involving oil spills or hazardous materials. The NCP remains the operative federal response plan regardless of how it is applied. FEMA coordinates most emergency assistance, but other federal agencies can also provide assistance under different authorities. The National Guard, with over 450,000 personnel, is a state and federal organization used for emergency response. It operates under state governors' control and can be deployed for \"state active duty\" in disasters and civil disorders. The National Guard, with over 450,000 personnel, can be activated under federal law for additional duties with pay and benefits. This activation allows them to perform law enforcement functions without being subject to the Posse Comitatus Act. The National Guard can be activated in a federal status under the control of the President, receiving federal pay and benefits. The U.S. Department of Agriculture provides emergency and disaster assistance through various agencies without requiring a Stafford declaration. Assistance for agricultural producers includes emergency loans, direct payments, and crop insurance. The Department of Defense (DOD) plays a potentially significant role in supporting domestic response efforts during emergencies. DOD has various capabilities such as transportation assets, medical personnel, security forces, and communications equipment that could be useful to civil authorities. The Department of Defense (DOD) can provide defense support of civil authorities (DSCA) through an \"immediate response\" or a formal \"request for assistance\" (RFA). DOD may preposition assets in anticipation of a request, and certain officials have the authority to act immediately to save lives or prevent human suffering within the United States under \"immediate response\" authority. The Department of Defense can provide defense support of civil authorities (DSCA) through an \"immediate response\" or a formal \"request for assistance\" (RFA). Assistance provided under this authority includes medical care, restoring critical public services, and distributing supplies. Approval from higher authority is required, and the Secretary of Defense has the principal authority for approving DSCA requests. The forces provided in response to an RFA could include units from multiple military services and activated members of the National Guard and Reserve. Members of the federal reserves are always activated after a request for assistance under Title 10 of the U.S. Code. The National Guard operates under the control of the President in a federal capacity, receiving federal pay and benefits. They are subject to the Posse Comitatus Act like active duty military personnel. National Guard forces are under their governors' control unless ordered into federal service. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers performs emergency response actions for disasters under its Civil Works Program. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plans, builds, operates, and maintains water resources facilities, including hurricane protection projects. FEMA can direct the Department of Defense to provide assistance during emergencies. The Corps assists in stabilizing damaged structures, clearing debris, and establishing routes into affected areas after disasters. They also have specific authorities for different types of natural disasters, such as rehabilitating flood control works and hurricane protection projects. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers works on water resources facilities and hurricane protection projects. The Department of Health and Human Services provides grants for public health and medical system capacity in preparedness for health threats. They are the primary agency for responding to public health consequences from disasters. The Secretary has authority to determine a public health emergency and waive administrative requirements for federal aid. HUD may offer waivers for disaster recovery when a major disaster is declared. Congress has provided additional appropriations for programs like the CDBG program in some years. HUD's CDBG program provides grants for disaster assistance and recovery, housing vouchers for survivors, special mortgage insurance, and forbearance for disaster-affected borrowers. Congress has allocated additional CDBG funds to help communities respond to disasters. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) provides transportation support to disaster-affected areas in coordination with FEMA. The Federal Highway Administration's Emergency Relief Program (ER) offers funds for the repair and reconstruction of roads after disasters, administered through state departments of transportation. The decision to seek ER funding is made by the state rather than the federal government. The ER program provides funds for repairing roads on the federal-aid highway system damaged by natural disasters or catastrophic failures. Congress passed the MAP-21 Act in 2012, which included a new disaster relief program for mass transit called the Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program. This program funds operating costs for evacuation services, rescue operations, temporary public transportation, and route services during emergencies. Funding comes from the General Fund as needed and requires appropriations action. The ER program provides funds for repairing roads on the federal-aid highway system damaged by natural disasters or catastrophic failures. The new Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program is expected to be administered by the Federal Transit Administration and focuses on mass transit disaster relief. ER funds have historically been used for natural disaster repair and reconstruction, with over $3 billion allocated for Gulf Coast Hurricane response since 2005. Funding for hurricane relief includes annual highway trust fund authorization and additional appropriations. ER funds are limited to roads and bridges on the federal-aid highway system, while other damaged roads may be reimbursed by FEMA. EPA is also involved in disaster relief efforts. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plays a key role in emergency response, particularly in oil spills and hazardous substance releases. EPA provides support to federal agencies, state, and local governments in addressing threats to human health and the environment, focusing on drinking water, wastewater treatment facilities, and post-disaster cleanup. EPA's involvement is outlined in the National Response Framework and the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides support in emergency response, focusing on drinking water, wastewater treatment facilities, and post-disaster cleanup. EPA may offer guidance and technical assistance to protect water infrastructure, identify critical systems, manage contaminated debris, and ensure safe water supplies for health care facilities. EPA's role is outlined in various response plans and authorities. The EPA is the lead federal agency for the water sector under the National Infrastructure Protection Plan and has emergency powers under the Safe Drinking Water Act to issue orders in case of a contaminant threat to public health. The agency can also respond to potential terrorist attacks or intentional acts that may disrupt safe drinking water provision. EPA may support post-disaster cleanup efforts and work with the Army Corps of Engineers under ESF #3\u2014Public Works. The EPA supports the Army Corps of Engineers in removing disaster debris and hazardous materials under ESF #3 and ESF #10. They provide technical assistance for waste management and may waive environmental requirements for motor vehicle fuel under the Clean Air Act to maintain energy supplies during disaster recovery under ESF #12. The Forest Service (FS) is responsible for protecting federal lands from wildfires, receiving over $2.0 billion annually for wildfire management. Federal policy aims to suppress all wildfires and protect lives, property, and resources. In emergency situations, the FS collaborates with multiple agencies, including the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC). The FS collaborates with multiple agencies, including the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), to coordinate assistance for complex wildfire situations. FEMA provides FMAGs for grants, equipment, and personnel during disasters. If the President declares a disaster, FEMA offers fire management assistance and recovery programs. The FS also participates in site rehabilitation through the Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) program. The Small Business Administration (SBA) Disaster Loan Program offers direct loans to individuals and businesses for repairing and recovering from economic losses after a disaster. The program provides three main types of loans: Home Disaster Loans, Business Disaster Loans, and Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL). Home disaster loans are used by homeowners and renters to repair or replace their disaster-damaged primary residences. Loans are available for homeowners and renters to repair or replace disaster-damaged primary residences or personal property. SBA regulations limit home loans to $200,000 for real estate and $40,000 for personal property. Business disaster loans help businesses and nonprofits repair or replace damaged property, with a limit of $2 million per applicant. EIDLs provide working capital for impacted businesses but cannot be used for restoration. Assistance is also available for small agricultural cooperatives and certain nonprofit organizations affected by disasters."
