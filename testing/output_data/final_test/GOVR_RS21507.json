    "content": "Following the 2001 terrorist attacks, the federal government recognized the need for new medical countermeasures against CBRN agents. The pharmaceutical industry cited the lack of a commercial market as a barrier to developing these countermeasures. In response, President Bush proposed Project BioShield in 2003, leading to the passage of the Project BioShield Act in 2004. This act aimed to encourage the development of new CBRN countermeasures by providing funding and support through the Department of Health and Human Services. The Project BioShield Act of 2004 provides expedited procedures for CBRN terrorism-related spending, creates a government-market guarantee for purchasing countermeasures, allows emergency use of non-FDA approved countermeasures, and relaxes procurement procedures for CBRN countermeasure research and development. It increases the maximum contract amount to $25 million. The Project BioShield Act increases the maximum contract amount to $25 million and allows for simplified acquisition procedures. HHS has used this authority for five contracts totaling $30 million. The Act also authorizes expedited award processes for CBRN countermeasure R&D grants and contracts up to $1.5 million, replacing the normal peer review process. Some scientists are concerned that an expedited peer review process may lower research quality. HHS awarded 14 grants through this process between July 2004 and July 2007, supporting research on medical countermeasures for radiation exposure. The Project BioShield Act ensures government purchase of developed CBRN countermeasures for the Strategic National Stockpile. The Project BioShield Act allows the HHS Secretary to promise to buy a product up to eight years before delivery, with milestone-based payments of up to half the total award before delivery. This reduces market and development risks for the company. The Act also allows HHS to purchase unapproved countermeasures with sufficient clinical data. The Project BioShield Act allows the HHS Secretary to purchase unapproved medical products with clinical data to reduce risks. The Act also permits emergency use of unapproved products and allows for lower-cost purchases of unapproved products to mitigate financial risks. The HHS Secretary can authorize emergency use of unapproved medical products if certain criteria are met, such as the product being effective in treating a serious disease and having benefits that outweigh risks. These authorizations last for one year and can be renewed. Currently, five countermeasures for the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak are permitted under emergency use authorization. The HHS Secretary can authorize emergency use of unapproved medical products if certain criteria are met, such as the product being effective in treating a serious disease and having benefits that outweigh risks. Currently, five countermeasures for the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak are permitted under emergency use authorization, including influenza treatments Tamiflu and Relenza, N95 respirators, diagnostic kits, and antibiotic kits containing doxycycline hyclate for certain individuals. Additionally, the Project BioShield Act of 2004 requires the HHS Secretary to report annually to Congress on the use of expedited procurement and grant procedures for emergency use of unapproved products. The Project BioShield Act of 2004 authorized up to $5.593 billion for countermeasures procurement from FY2004. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) published reports assessing the effectiveness of the act, recommending improvements in internal controls for expedited contracting procedures, and confirming the use of Project BioShield for CBRN medical countermeasures. No funds were appropriated by the act. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2004 (P.L. 108-90) allocated $5.593 billion for countermeasures procurement from FY2004 through FY2013. $3.418 billion was available for obligation from FY2004 to FY2008, with the remaining funds becoming available from FY2009 to FY2013. The funds are designated for CBRN countermeasures procurement under the Project BioShield Act and cannot be used for other purposes. Congress has the authority to adjust the amount in the special reserve fund annually. Congress has the power to adjust the amount in the special reserve fund annually. $25 million was removed from the account through rescissions in 2004 and 2005. In 2009, $412 million was transferred from the fund to HHS, with $275 million for countermeasure research and $137 million for pandemic preparedness. In 2010, the Obama Administration requested a transfer of $305 million for countermeasure development. The House Committee on Appropriations passed H.R. 3293 in 2009, transferring $305 million to BARDA for advanced development activities and $500 million to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease for basic research activities. The President requested the transfer of remaining balances in the special reserve fund to the HHS \"Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund\" account for Project BioShield-related countermeasure purchases. The remaining balance in the Special Reserve Fund for Project BioShield is estimated to be $764 million. The first Project BioShield contract was with VaxGen for 75 million doses of anthrax vaccine, worth $879 million. Subsequent contracts include $690 million for AVA anthrax vaccine, $165 million for Raxibacumab, $144 million for Anthrax Immune Globulin, $505 million for smallpox vaccine, and $416 million for other purposes. Future targets for Project BioShield procurement include countermeasures against anthrax, viral hemorrhagic fevers, and radiation. Congress has scrutinized the implementation and effectiveness of the Project BioShield Act since its enactment. In response to perceived problems with Project BioShield countermeasure procurement, the 109th Congress created the Biodefense Advanced Research and Development. The 109th Congress created the Biodefense Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) in HHS through the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act to address the lack of funding for promising basic research results in pharmaceutical development. BARDA allows milestone payments for BioShield contracts and funds advanced development of CBRN countermeasures. BARDA funding supports the advanced development of CBRN countermeasures, including clinical trials. The Biodefense Medical Countermeasure Development Fund finances these contracts, separate from Project BioShield. Critics argue that government funding of advanced development may lead to unusable products and insert government decision makers into the development process, a role they believe is better suited to industry. Critics argue that government involvement in advanced development of countermeasures may lead to inefficiencies, preferring industry experts to determine product requirements. Project BioShield initially followed this approach but was found insufficient by Congress. BARDA manages HHS' role in BioShield, leading efforts to determine requirements and execute contracts. The 111th Congress is facing policy issues related to BioShield, including the potential transfer of the account from DHS to HHS. In the FY2010 budget request, President Obama proposed transferring the Project BioShield special reserve fund from DHS to HHS. Congress is considering the transfer and potential amendments to the Project BioShield Act to address issues like stockpiled countermeasures and encouraging the development of broad spectrum countermeasures. The House and Senate committees on appropriations have recommended transferring the Project BioShield account to HHS while maintaining current agency roles. The ten-year $5.6 billion advance appropriation was crucial for countermeasure developers, providing assurance of payment for successful developments. However, the advance funding has still been subject to annual appropriations processes. In practice, funds for CBRN countermeasures research have been subject to annual appropriations processes. Congress has removed about 8% of the advance appropriation through rescissions and transfers to other accounts. Transfers have been made for CBRN countermeasure research and development as well as influenza pandemic preparedness. In FY2009, $275 million was transferred to BARDA for CBRN countermeasure research, and a similar transfer of $305 million was proposed for FY2010 by President Obama to support future acquisitions under Project BioShield. These transfers aim to improve the rate of Project BioShield acquisitions. The House Committee on Appropriations proposed transferring $305 million to BARDA and $500 million to NIAID for basic research to support Project BioShield acquisitions. This transfer could reinforce the precedent set in FY2009 linking research and development funding to procurement. However, annual transfers from the special reserve fund may limit funds for acquiring CBRN countermeasures. Congress could appropriate additional money if funding becomes a limitation, but this may make countermeasure developers feel dependent on future appropriations. The special reserve fund was established to minimize government payment for failed countermeasures in Project BioShield. Transferring money from this fund may impact the roles of the federal government and private sector. Industry concerns include weakening private firms' ability to raise capital for long-term research and development. Transferring funds from the Project BioShield special reserve fund to support advanced development may reduce the need for developers to raise capital. This shift from procurement to research and development allows the government to take on more development risk. In FY2009, Congress transferred $137 million from the reserve fund to HHS for pandemic influenza preparedness. President Obama did not request a similar transfer for FY2010. The conferees declined to allow the purchase of influenza countermeasures using the Project BioShield special reserve fund, as critics argued it would harm the biodefense industry and diminish the nation's preparedness efforts for WMD events. The Senate committee strongly advised against using the fund for this purpose. Medicines in the Strategic National Stockpile have expiration dates, requiring HHS to procure additional doses to maintain stockpiles. For example, 29 million doses of anthrax vaccine were purchased to meet this requirement. HHS purchased 29 million doses of anthrax vaccine to maintain a stockpile from 2006 to 2011. The GAO suggested an inventory-sharing agreement between HHS and DOD for vaccine use. Shared stockpile approach implemented for anthrax vaccines and pandemic influenza countermeasures. Additional periodic purchases may be needed to replenish stockpile for readiness. Congress may decide on funding for purchases through Project BioShield or SNS budget authorities. BARDA purchased AVA anthrax vaccine using Project BioShield funds between 2005 and 2007. The AVA anthrax vaccine was purchased using Project BioShield funds. In 2008, 14.5 million doses were bought with SNS funds instead. Experts suggest that broad spectrum countermeasures would be valuable additions to the SNS, providing defense against unknown threats and having nonbiodefense applications. Project BioShield allows for procuring such countermeasures, considering the presence of a commercial market. HHS aims to acquire new broad spectrum countermeasures through Project BioShield, which has historically focused on individual threat agents. Congress may need to provide further guidance or authorities to support the development and procurement of these countermeasures."
