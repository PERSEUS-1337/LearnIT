    "content": "The military retirement system has been a topic of interest and debate since the 1948 Hook Commission. Numerous reports and studies have been conducted to address concerns about the system's cost and structure. Critics point to issues such as the 20-year \"cliff\" vesting, generous benefits for young retirees, and lack of flexibility in force management. The escalating cost of military retirement is a growing concern as Congress looks to address budget deficits. The military retirement system is a noncontributory, defined benefit system that provides inflation-protected monthly compensation and other benefits after a military career. Critics highlight the high cost, lack of force management flexibility, and inefficiency of the system. Supporters argue that it compensates for a career of service and sacrifice, and serves as a significant incentive for retaining a career military force. The military retirement system includes Temporary Early Retirement Authority (TERA), survivor benefits for eligible survivors of deceased retirees, and various retirement variations. Retired pay is subject to federal income tax. Active duty personnel become eligible for retirement after 20 years of service, with the option to stay on active duty for up to 40 years. Reserve component personnel qualify for retirement based on \"points\" and equivalent years of service, with retired pay typically starting at age 60. Disability retirement offers two options based on years of service or severity of disability. Those who separate before 20 years of service generally receive no retirement benefits. The military retirement system aims to provide financial support to members and former members of the Armed Forces during their old age, maintain competitiveness with private-sector employers, ensure a pool of experienced military manpower for emergencies, and keep the military forces young. Those who do not complete 20 years of service generally receive no retirement benefits. The military retirement system provides financial support to members and former members of the Armed Forces, ensuring promotion opportunities for younger members. Military retirees can be recalled to active duty and are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The system does not allow for gradual vesting of benefits and requires a minimum of 20 years of service. As of FY2010, there were 2,271,000 beneficiaries at a cost of $50.842 billion annually. Military retirees also receive additional benefits such as commissary and exchange access, TRICARE medical care, and Morale, Welfare, and Recreation services. The military retirement system provides financial support to members and former members of the Armed Forces. There are three methods of calculating retired pay: Final Basic Pay, High-Three, and Redux. Eligibility is based on the date of entry into the armed forces. Final Basic Pay system is the most expensive, based on the final amount of monthly basic pay multiplied by years of service. The Computation Base is calculated by multiplying 2.5% by years of service. Servicemembers retiring with 20, 30, or 40 years of service will receive 50%, 75%, or 100% of their final monthly base pay, respectively. Those eligible for the Final Pay system are aging out, with DOD estimating fewer than 15,000 active duty and 35,000 reserve members remaining. Most are expected to retire by 2016, leading to the phase-out of the Final Pay system, which is the most expensive retirement system. COLA for Final Basic Pay retirees is tied to the annual Consumer Price Index. The retirement system for servicemembers includes the Final Basic Pay and High-3 systems, with COLA indexed to the annual CPI. High-3 uses the average basic pay for the highest 36 months, while Final Basic Pay uses the final monthly pay factor. Servicemembers entering service after August 1, 1986, can choose between High-3 or Redux systems, with a $30,000 Career Status Bonus. The retirement choice must be made within 180 days of completing 15 years of service. Redux offers a different multiplier and COLA formula compared to the High-3 system. It rewards longer service and reduces the cost of military retirement. Retiring at 20 years under Redux results in only 40% of High-3, but staying on active duty earns an additional 3.5% per year up to 30 years, reaching 75% of High-3. Beyond 30 years, an additional 2.5% per year can be earned up to a maximum of 100% of High-3 for 40 years of service. The COLA for Redux retirees is CPI minus 1% annually until age 62. The Redux retirement system offers adjustments to retired pay for those between 20 and 30 years of service, with a one-time CPI adjustment at age 62. Redux and High-3 pays are equal at age 62, but Redux accrual never exceeds High-3. The COLA adjustment under Redux is lower than High-3, leading to few choosing Redux. Members selecting Redux within 180 days of 15 years of service receive a $30,000 Career Status Bonus for completing a 20-year military career. The Career Status Bonus (CSB) offers a $30,000 bonus for completing a 20-year military career, which can be paid in installments or as a lump sum. If not completed, a prorated share of the bonus must be repaid. The CSB was not adjusted for inflation since its enactment in 1999, making it worth approximately $22,000 today. If indexed to the CPI, it would be worth around $38,500. The Army and Air Force Vitalization and Retirement Equalization Act of 1948 established the current military retirement system, featuring vesting at 20 years of service and computed retired pay at 2.5% per year. Over the years, there have been three significant modifications to the system, including the High-3 calculation in 1980 and the Redux plan in 1986 which reduced the retirement benefit at 20 years from 50% to 40%. These changes were aimed at saving costs and encouraging longer careers. In 1980, the High-3 calculation was introduced, and in 1986, the Redux plan reduced the retirement benefit at 20 years from 50% to 40%. Congress added a $30,000 Career Status Bonus to the Redux plan to incentivize participation. This legislative history provides perspective for policy makers reviewing recent reform proposals. The FY1981 Defense Authorization Act introduced the High-3 calculation to reduce military retirement costs and increase pay for active-duty personnel. It replaced the Final Pay methodology with a new computation base for servicemembers entering the military after September 8, 1980. The High-3 calculation replaced the Final Pay method for military retirement, resulting in estimated savings of 13% according to the DOD. Those who joined before September 8, 1980, were exempt from this change. The conversion to High-3 was a significant reform in the military retirement system, with the goal of saving $2.9 billion. The DOD developed models to meet a savings target of $2.9 billion through military retirement reforms. However, the models predicted a potential retention problem, with reductions of 8 to 12% for the 10 to 20 year group and 16 to 37% for the 21 to 30 year group. Secretary of Defense Weinberger stated that DOD did not support adoption of the proposed changes. The Department of Defense opposes significant degradation in combat readiness due to mandated reductions, citing concerns about loss of leadership and technical expertise. Assistant Secretary of Defense emphasized that deep cuts in retirement benefits would hinder personnel retention and pose risks to future readiness, leading to immediate personnel cuts if $2.9 billion cannot be restored. Redux, also known as the Military Retirement Reform Act of 1986, retains the 20-year cliff vesting but reduces the Computation Base to 40% at 20 years of service. It incentivizes longer careers by increasing the multiplier to 3.5% per year between years 20 and 30, reaching 75% of High-3 at 30 years of service. The cap on retired pay was lifted, allowing for a 2.5% increase per year between years 30 and 40. Redux increases the multiplier by 2.5% per year between years 30 and 40, resulting in lower payments for 20 to 29 years of service compared to the High-3 method. However, payments are the same as High-3 for 30 years of service and beyond. Redux also adjusts retired pay annually by CPI minus 1%, with a one-time adjustment at age 62 to align with High-3. After age 62, the COLA calculation reverts to CPI minus 1% for Redux retirees. The first Redux eligible retiree was set to retire on August 1, 2006. In 1999, military retirement system was modified due to various factors such as lagging pay, high personnel tempo, and reduced effectiveness as a retention tool. Military families were stressed, and some argued that servicemembers were leaving the all-volunteer force. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Service Chiefs highlighted deferred maintenance, readiness concerns, and personnel shortages due to recruitment and retention challenges in the all-volunteer force. General Henry H. Shelton emphasized military retirement and pay reform as a top priority. Admiral Jay L. Johnson expressed worry about declining retention rates in the Navy. The Air Force is facing a shortage of over 800 pilots, with more pilots leaving for civilian opportunities. The military drawdown and low morale have also contributed to recruitment and retention challenges. In response, the FY2000 NDAA introduced benefits like a 4.8% military pay raise to improve recruiting and retention efforts. The FY2000 NDAA introduced benefits to improve recruiting and retention efforts, including a 4.8% military pay raise, increased basic pay annually, special allowances for military families, Thrift Savings Plan enrollment, and increased education benefits. Additionally, a $30,000 bonus was added to the Redux retirement program, and service members were allowed to choose between Redux and the High-3 programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the enhanced benefits would cost $18 billion more over 10 years. Servicemembers in the FY2000 NDAA were given the choice between the Redux and High-3 retirement systems. Those who chose Redux had to commit to 20 years of active duty and could receive a Career Status Bonus. A calculator was provided to help individuals compare the two options. The Navy and Marine Corps have seen a significant decline in the number of servicemembers opting for the Redux/CSB retirement option, with only 16% choosing it in 2010 compared to 41% in 2003. This trend suggests that High-3 is the more popular retirement program in the military. The DACMC was chartered by the Secretary of Defense in 2005 to balance military pay and benefits for recruitment and retention. The committee's report in 2006 focused on retirement reform and modernizing the retirement system. The DACMC committee focused on retirement reform, highlighting criticisms of the current system and recommending longer military careers, earlier vesting, and a TSP-type program with government matching funds. The committee recommended a three-tiered retirement system with a retirement annuity at age 60, early vesting of a TSP account at 10 years, and compensation incentives for retention. Modeling career scenarios showed a smaller first-term force, a stronger mid-career force, and reduced retirement system costs. The President convened the 10th Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation in 2005 as required by Title 37 of the U.S. Code. The 10th Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation in late 2005, led by Brigadier General Jan D. Eakle, conducted a complete review of the compensation system for uniformed services members, focusing on retirement options. The report was published in two volumes in 2008. The 10th Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation in 2008 analyzed retirement options for military personnel. The QRMC proposal suggested minor modifications to the DACMC's recommendations, including early vesting and age eligibility for retired pay. It introduced a penalty for retiring with 20 or fewer years of service and adjusted the age for receiving retired pay based on years of service. The QRMC retirement proposal includes reducing age by forfeiting 5% for each year less than age 57, with defined contribution portion vesting at 10 YOS and penalty-free withdrawal at age 60. Government match varies based on YOS, with a maximum match of 5% for those with over 5 YOS. Services have more control over gate pay and separation pay elements, allowing them to set milestones based on service needs. Separation pay is enhanced by adding a multiplier to the formula (Base pay x YOS). The 10th QRMC recommended a retirement system for both active and reserve components, along with a five-year demonstration project to refine the proposal. This approach is similar to how other government agencies have used demonstration projects to modify compensation systems. The ongoing economic recession and high unemployment led to studies on reducing government costs, including defense. Various reports, such as the Quadrennial Defense Review Independent Panel and the President's Plan for Economic Growth, made recommendations on the military retirement system. These recommendations are compared in Table 3. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) was established by Congress in the 1990s to examine national defense strategy, force structure, and budget plans every four years. By 2006, concerns arose about the bureaucratic nature of the QDR, leading to calls for a more comprehensive assessment. The NDAA recommended an \"independent panel\" to assess the 2010 QDR, which highlighted escalating personnel entitlements in the DOD budget. The panel suggested establishing a National Commission on Military Personnel to modernize the military personnel system, including compensation reform and restructuring career progression. The Sustainable Defense Task Force proposed 19 options to save $960 billion between 2011 and 2020, with three focusing on personnel costs. One option suggested reforming military compensation by considering all pay components, projected to save $55 billion. Another option aimed to reform the DOD's healthcare system. The Defense Business Board (DBB) is a DOD organization tasked with providing independent advice to improve effectiveness and service delivery. In 2010, the board was asked to identify alternatives to reduce DOD's overhead. The Sustainable Defense Task Force proposed options to save $960 billion between 2011 and 2020, including reforming military compensation, healthcare system, and reducing recruiting expenditures. The task force emphasized the importance of not economizing on pay and benefits while over-using military personnel. The Defense Business Board was tasked with finding ways to reduce DOD's overhead by $100 billion over 10 years. A task force chaired by Arnold Punaro highlighted the need to reform the military retirement system over the next 20 years. A follow-on briefing in 2011 proposed replacing the defined benefit with a defined contribution plan. The Defense Business Board recommended replacing the defined benefit retirement plan with a defined contribution plan, specifically the Thrift Savings Plan. The new plan would include automatic enrollment, member contributions, and an annual government contribution. The DOD match would vary based on circumstances, and the plan would be transportable into the private sector and back into the military. Disabled members would be exempt, and the plan would vest after 3 to 5 years, with benefits payable at age 60 to 65. There would be a right of survivorship transferability upon death, and no impact on current military retirees. The Defense Business Board recommended replacing the defined benefit retirement plan with a defined contribution plan, specifically the Thrift Savings Plan. The proposed options include grandfathering current personnel or transitioning both current and new members while allowing current members to retain a portion of their defined benefit based on years of service. The Debt Reduction Task Force, established in 2010, aimed to develop a long-term plan to reduce the debt and achieve fiscal sustainability. The task force, led by co-chairs Pete Domenici and Dr. Alice Rivlin, recommended a new military retirement plan based on the Federal Employees Retirement System. It would integrate currently serving members with less than 15 years of service into the new plan, while those with more than 15 years would be grandfathered. The defined benefit would be 2.5% times years of service based on High-5 pay, with retirement starting at age 57 for those with at least 20 years of service. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform was established in 2010 to propose recommendations to balance the budget by 2015. It was led by former Senator Alan Simpson and former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles, with 18 members from both political parties. The commission estimated savings of $131 billion from 2020 to 2040 with a new military retirement plan. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, established in 2010, required 14 of the 18 members to report any recommendations. The commission made two recommendations regarding military retirement: 1. Create a federal workforce entitlement task force to re-evaluate military retirement programs and recommend savings. 2. Defer Cost of Living Adjustments (COLA) until age 62 and then provide a one-time catch-up. The report, released by the White House on September 19, 2011, aims to pay for the American Jobs Act and achieve over $3 trillion in net deficit reduction over the next 10 years. The recommendations include program reductions, eliminations, and tax increases to reach the $3 trillion goal. For military retirement, the report suggests establishing a commission to develop reform recommendations, with DOD proposing changes and the President having the final decision-making authority. The report outlines recommendations for military retirement reform, with a focus on cost reduction and specific initiatives. The Defense Business Board and Debt Reduction Task Force both highlighted the unsustainable nature of the current system. New proposals target the cost of military retirement and suggest changes that would apply to new entrants while grandfathering current military personnel. The current military retirement system is deemed \"unsustainable\" according to the Debt Reduction Task Force, with projected savings of $131 billion between 2020 and 2040. The system is funded by an accrual accounting system, with $50.842 billion paid to military retirees in FY2010. The actual cost to DOD in FY2009 was $17.5 billion, approximately 2.5% of the annual DOD budget, due to accrual accounting. The cost of future military retirement is influenced by basic pay received while on active duty and the annual Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) received after retirement. Basic pay has increased by nearly 37% over the past 10 years to offset inflation and increase the attractiveness of military service. Military retired pay COLA has been inflation-protected since 1986 and indexed to increases in the CPI. The cost of military retirement is influenced by basic pay and COLA, which has increased by nearly 21.7% since 2002. Military retirees start receiving their annuity immediately, unlike other retirement plans that typically start at age 55, 60, or 65. Most retirees have spouses and children, often in high school or college. Retired military personnel often need a second career due to receiving retired pay. Reform initiatives aim to address the inequity of the 20-year vesting rule for retirement benefits. Recommendations include adjusting the vesting period to 5, 10, or 15 years, or providing transition/separation pay. Some suggest adjusting the 20-year vesting rule for military retirement benefits to encourage longer careers. A comparison with other hazardous occupations like federal law enforcement shows they become eligible for immediate annuity after 25 years, which is more than the military's 20 years. The military emphasizes youth, vigor, and physical fitness due to health concerns as the population ages. Older servicemembers are more vulnerable to injuries and longer recoveries. Retirement eligibility at 20 years of service may still be appropriate. The military retirement system remains primarily a defined benefit program with the option to participate in a tax-deferred savings plan. Private-sector employers have shifted towards 401(K)-type programs, but these plans may have high fees and unpredictable returns. The FERS civil service retirement includes both defined benefit and defined contribution components with matching funds up to 5% through the TSP. The National Defense Authorization Act of 2000 extended participation in the TSP to military personnel, allowing contributions from 1% to 9% of basic pay. Members can also contribute up to 100% of special incentive pays or bonuses, with a contribution limit of $49,000 per year for those deployed to combat operations. Participation in TSP is optional, with no automatic enrollment, and contributions and earnings are taxed upon withdrawal. The TSP is a popular investment opportunity for military personnel, with over 600,000 members enrolled by 2009. Participation is higher among officers and active component members compared to enlisted and reserve component members. Junior officers and enlisted personnel have lower participation rates due to lower incomes and less focus on retirement. Congress is considering a new proposal to provide matching TSP contributions to all military personnel. Using a 4% match instead of the 5% allowed under FERS, DOD estimated the annual cost of military retirement at $2.8 billion. Critics argue that the current system lacks flexibility to provide benefits to those serving less than 20 years or incentives based on position or skill. Previous studies have suggested solutions like retired or severance pay for involuntary separation. Studies have recommended solutions for military retirement, including retired or severance pay for involuntary separation, deferred annuities starting at age 60, 10-year vesting, and separation pay incentives for \"over strength\" skills. Congress provided Temporary Early Retirement Authority (TERA) during the military drawdown in the 1990s, allowing servicemembers with 15 to 20 years of service to apply for early retirement with reduced retired pay. This program targeted specific grades and skills, originally limited to 1992-1995 but later extended to 1999. Early retirement was a popular drawdown incentive for servicemembers to receive retirement annuity with less than 20 years of service. Congress could consider retaining the current military retirement system, such as the High-3, or implementing a hybrid system that includes a contributory element like the Thrift Savings Plan. This reformed system could offer enhanced flexibility for force managers to retain personnel in critical skill areas and could be tested through a multiyear demonstration project before full implementation. The Quadrennial Defense Review Independent Panel recommended establishing a National Commission on Military Personnel to address compensation reform, \"Continuum-of-service\" issues, active-reserve force mix, and healthcare and retiree benefits for active, reserve, and retired personnel. The Panel recommended establishing a National Commission on Military Personnel to address compensation reform, \"Continuum-of-service\" issues, active-reserve force mix, and healthcare and retiree benefits for active, reserve, and retired personnel. The Commission would develop recommendations for reforming the current system, with input from DOD, and forward them to the President for approval and release. Congress would then be required to approve or disapprove without modification."
