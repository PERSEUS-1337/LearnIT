FINDINGS.\" Congress finds that Adak Island, located 1,200 miles southwest of Anchorage, Alaska, has unique physical and biological features, including a deepwater harbor and abundant marine wildlife. The island was reserved as a preserve in 1913 for its value to seabirds, marine mammals, and fisheries. Military development on the island supported a community of 6,000 residents by 1990. The Adak Naval Complex on Adak Island, home to a community of 6,000 residents, was closed due to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990. The Aleut Corporation, representing indigenous people of the Aleutian Islands, was unable to select any land on Adak Island under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The Aleut Corporation is seeking to establish a community on Adak Island by exchanging Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act land selections for lands formerly occupied by the Navy. This exchange is aimed at offsetting the removal of a portion of Adak Island from refuge status. The public interest lies in promoting the reuse of Adak Island lands by exchanging them for other Aleut Corporation selections within the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. This exchange aims to maintain a human population on Adak to control caribou and ensure the presence of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to protect the natural resources of the Aleutian Islands Unit. Active reuse of Adak is crucial to avoid future environmental problems associated with former defense sites in Alaska. The agreement is ratified. The \"Agreement Concerning the Conveyance of Property at the Adak Naval Complex\" dated September 20, 2000, is ratified by The Aleut Corporation, the Department of the Interior, and the Department of the Navy. Any modifications to the boundaries must be agreed upon by all parties. The Agreement Concerning the Conveyance of Property at the Adak Naval Complex, ratified by The Aleut Corporation, the Department of the Interior, and the Department of the Navy, stipulates that at least 36,000 acres of land will be conveyed to the United States. Notification was given to the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate. Effective upon conveyance of the Adak Exchange Lands to the Aleut Corporation, these lands will be removed from the National Wildlife Refuge System. They will no longer be part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge and will not be subject to laws pertaining to that refuge. The Secretary will adjust the refuge boundaries to exclude all interests in lands received by The Aleut Corporation. This action is in accordance with the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act governs the exchange and conveyance of lands by the United States. Lands received under this Act do not constitute a sale or disposition of land. Public easements for access to public lands and waters satisfy the Act's requirements. Additionally, reacquisition of lands is addressed in the Act. The Secretary of the Interior can acquire land conveyed to The Aleut Corporation under the Agreement and this Act through purchase or exchange. If these lands are acquired by the United States, they will be automatically included in the Refuge System, subject to refuge laws and regulations, with boundaries adjusted accordingly. The Department of Navy will convey personal property on Adak Island to The Aleut Corporation at no cost when real property is transferred. The Secretary of the Interior will also convey former landfill sites to the Aleut Corporation without charge. The Aleut Corporation will receive a tax basis equal to fair value for all property received. The Aleut Corporation will receive a tax basis equal to fair value for all property received, determined by replacement cost appraisal. Property received will be treated as not developed until actually occupied, leased, or sold. Certain lands described in Appendix A will be unavailable for selection. The Aleut Corporation will receive lands described in Appendix A, which will be conveyed to them. Maps in Appendix A show the lands and are available at specified offices. In case of discrepancies, the maps will control."
