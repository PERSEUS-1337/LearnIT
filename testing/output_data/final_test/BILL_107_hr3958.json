    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge Settlement Act of 2002\". Congress finds that the State of Utah and the Secretary of the Interior have negotiated an agreement regarding the ownership of lands within the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge in Bear River Bay of the Great Salt Lake. The State is entitled to ownership of sovereign lands constituting the bed of the Great Salt Lake, but uncertainty exists due to the lack of a meander line survey within the Refuge. To settle this uncertainty, the Act aims to address the boundary issue caused by the gap in the surveyed Great Salt Lake meander line. The Secretary and the State have agreed to establish a fixed sovereign land boundary along the southern boundary of the Refuge, resolving conflicting claims to ownership of lands within the Refuge.
