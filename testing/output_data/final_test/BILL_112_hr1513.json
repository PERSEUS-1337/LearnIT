    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Great Ape Protection and Cost Savings Act of 2011\". Congress finds that chimpanzees are the only great apes used in invasive research in the United States, with approximately 1,000 housed in laboratories, more than half of which are owned and financially supported by the Federal Government. Great apes are intelligent and social animals, and research environments cannot meet their complex needs. Invasive research on great apes and their breeding, housing, maintenance, and transport significantly impact them. The Federal Government spends more on maintaining great apes in laboratories than in suitable sanctuaries designed for their lifetime care. The National Research Council report recommends ethical care for chimpanzees used in research, a moratorium on breeding, avoiding euthanasia for population control, and creating sanctuaries for housing. The Great Ape Protection Act aims to phase out invasive research on great apes, prohibit their transport and breeding for research purposes, and ensure lifetime care in suitable sanctuaries. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"assigned to an active protocol\" refers to great apes used in invasive research funded publicly or privately. A \"great ape\" includes species like chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, orangutans, and gibbons. \"Invasive research\" involves any study causing harm or distress to great apes, such as drug testing. Invasive research on great apes includes testing drugs or harmful substances, body penetration, restraint, isolation, and other manipulations that may harm their health or well-being. This does not include natural observation. The approved research activities on great apes include close observation of natural behavior, temporary separation from the social group, post-mortem examination, and physical exams without sedation. Physical exams are conducted by licensed veterinarians or physicians for the well-being of individual great apes. These exams may include collecting biological samples to benefit the ape, its social group, or the species. Permanent retirement refers to placing a great ape in a suitable environment. The term \"permanent retirement\" refers to placing a great ape in a suitable sanctuary for lifetime care and to cease the use of the ape in invasive research, excluding euthanasia. The term \"person\" includes individuals, corporations, government entities, and other organizations under U.S. jurisdiction. Suitable sanctuary refers to a sanctuary meeting or exceeding care standards for chimpanzees in federally supported sanctuaries or a nonprofit wildlife sanctuary providing lifetime care for abused or neglected animals without conducting invasive research or commercial activities. The curr_chunk outlines the requirements for an organization to be considered a suitable sanctuary for animals, including not engaging in commercial activities with animals, not using animals for entertainment or breeding purposes, and not allowing public contact with the animals. The curr_chunk states prohibitions regarding activities with animals in sanctuaries. Prohibitions are in place to prevent invasive research on great apes, including housing, breeding, and transportation for such purposes. Federal funding is also prohibited for any invasive research on great apes. Transfer of ownership of a great ape to a non-Federal entity is prohibited unless it is a suitable sanctuary. Individualized medical care by licensed professionals for the well-being of the great ape is allowed, including surgical procedures and birth control treatments. The Act mandates the permanent retirement of all federally-owned great apes within 3 years for breeding, holding, or research purposes. Violators face civil penalties up to $10,000 per violation, with each day of non-compliance considered a separate offense. Additionally, a Great Ape Sanctuary System Fund is established. The \"Great Ape Sanctuary System Fund\" is established in the Treasury of the United States to support the construction, renovation, and operation of the sanctuary system. The Fund consists of appropriated amounts and civil penalties, with funds not otherwise allocated being transferred to the Fund. The \"Great Ape Sanctuary System Fund\" receives penalties collected under section 6 and prohibits the use of funds for any other purpose. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must submit annual reports on Fund operations, including deposits and expenditures. The annual report on the \"Great Ape Sanctuary System Fund\" includes expenditures, recommendations for additional authorities, and the remaining balance in the Fund. SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATES.\n\nThe prohibition on research for great apes will take effect 3 years after the enactment of this Act for those assigned to an active protocol, and immediately for those not assigned. The prohibitions on housing and funding will also take effect 3 years after the enactment. Any provisions without a specific effective date will be effective upon enactment.\n\nSEC. 9. SEVERABILITY. SEC. 9. SEVERABILITY.\n\nIf any part of this Act is found invalid or unenforceable, it will not affect the other provisions, and the Act will be interpreted as if the invalid part was never included."
