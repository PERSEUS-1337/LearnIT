    "content": "The \"Local Emergency Health Services Reimbursement Act of 2002\" allows federal reimbursement for emergency health services provided to undocumented aliens. The \"Local Emergency Health Services Reimbursement Act of 2002\" appropriates $200,000,000 annually for fiscal years 2003 through 2007 to make allotments to states with the highest number of undocumented aliens. $134,000,000 is used to compute allotments for 17 states with the highest number of undocumented aliens. The allotment for each state is based on the ratio of undocumented aliens in the state to the total number in all states. Any unspent allotment is available for the next fiscal year. The number of undocumented aliens in each State is determined based on estimates prepared by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. $66,000,000 is allocated for the 6 States with the highest number of undocumented aliens. Any unspent allotment can be carried over to the next fiscal year. States with the highest number of undocumented alien apprehensions will receive allotments based on the ratio of apprehensions in the state to the total apprehensions for all states.
