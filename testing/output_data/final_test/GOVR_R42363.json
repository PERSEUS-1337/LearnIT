The full removal of U.S. sanctions on Burma depends on the release of all political prisoners, which could aid in Burma's transition to democracy. The 114th Congress remains concerned and has passed resolutions urging for the immediate release of political prisoners in Burma. Burma was under military junta control for nearly 60 years, arresting thousands for political reasons. The junta transferred power in 2011 to a civilian/military government. Despite amnesties, political arrests continued. In 2015, the NLD won elections, with Aung San Suu Kyi's friend becoming President in 2016. President Htin Kyaw took office on March 30, 2016, with Aung San Suu Kyi appointed as Foreign Minister and State Counselor. He granted amnesty to political prisoners, but as of May 31, 2016, 67 remained incarcerated and 189 were awaiting trial. Since the 2015 parliamentary elections, the NLD has faced pressure to release political prisoners and prevent new arrests. The AAPP(B) and FPPS highlight the need for support for released political prisoners suffering from physical and mental conditions. However, doubts remain about the NLD-led government's ability to address the issue due to the Tatmadaw's control over security forces. Burma's security forces, controlled by the Tatmadaw and Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, use laws to arrest people for political reasons. The President can grant amnesty, but it requires the recommendation of the NDSC, mostly appointed by the Commander-in-Chief. The Obama Administration acknowledges past releases of political prisoners as progress in Burma. The NLD-led government is urged to release remaining political prisoners and prevent new arrests, but doubts persist due to the Tatmadaw's influence. The presence of political prisoners in Burma raises questions for U.S. policy, including whether their release is a top priority, if it should impact relations with Burma, and if it should be a condition for U.S. assistance to the government and military. The presence of political prisoners in Burma raises questions for U.S. policy regarding the assistance provided to facilitate their identification, release, and support, as well as preventing the arrest of new political prisoners. There is no consensus on the number of political prisoners in Burma due to lack of transparency in prison records and varying definitions of political prisoners. Reports of new political prisoners being arrested periodically. The number of political prisoners in Burma is uncertain due to varying definitions and lack of transparency in prison records. International agreements provide some protection for prisoners detained for political reasons, but there is no single standard for defining political prisoners. The State Department considers someone a political prisoner if they are incarcerated under an illegitimate law that restricts human rights. The State Department defines a political prisoner as someone incarcerated under a law that restricts human rights based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or group membership. This definition excludes those who have committed violent acts. The State Department recognizes that being accused of violent acts and committing violent acts are different, considering circumstances when determining if someone is a political prisoner in Burma. Ex-President Thein Sein defined political prisoners as \"prisoners of conscience\" and excluded those who committed criminal acts. The definition of political prisoners in Burma varies among different groups. While some, like Burma's military and Amnesty International, limit it to \"prisoners of conscience,\" organizations like AAPP(B) and HRW have a broader definition that includes those involved in opposition movements. The AAPP(B) rejects the narrow definition for various reasons. The AAPP(B) rejects the narrow definition of political prisoners as \"prisoners of conscience\" and includes those involved in armed resistance against the government due to the violence perpetrated by the Burmese military and police. The Political Prisoners Review Committee attempted to develop a consensus definition but faced challenges. The AAPP(B) rejects the narrow definition of political prisoners as \"prisoners of conscience\" and includes those involved in armed resistance against the government due to the violence perpetrated by the Burmese military and police. Bo Kyi, the Committee's AAPP(B) representative, stated in May 2013 that a common definition of political prisoners was discussed in a workshop in Rangoon in August 2014, attended by various Burmese organizations, political parties, and the International Committee of the Red Cross. The agreed definition of a political prisoner is anyone arrested, detained, or imprisoned for political reasons or wrongfully under criminal charges due to their active or supporting role in activities promoting freedom, justice, and equality. A political prisoner is defined as anyone arrested, detained, or imprisoned for their active or supporting role in political activities promoting freedom, justice, equality, and human rights. This includes involvement in armed resistance but excludes terrorist activities. The NLD is considering submitting a proposed definition of political prisoner to the Union Parliament, following recommendations to adopt an internationally recognized definition. ANP member Pe Than supports legal definitions of \"political prisoners\" and \"political offenses\" to protect activists, despite opposition from Deputy Minister of Home Affairs General Aung Soe. Deputy Minister of Home Affairs General Aung Soe opposes Pe Than's proposal, arguing that giving special treatment to political prisoners would discriminate against others arrested for alleged law violations. Allegations of corruption among Burmese officials involve detaining people on false charges for personal gain. This has led to the creation of a special group of \"political prisoners.\" Additionally, past governments in Burma targeted the Rohingya community. The Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic minority in Burma, faced political repression including movement restrictions and discrimination. Estimates vary on the number of political prisoners in Burma, with 83 in prison and 203 awaiting trial as of June 2016. The government released some political prisoners in 2015 but continued to arrest new ones. Groups assisting political prisoners estimate that over 100 political prisoners have been convicted and sentenced as of December, with more than 400 facing trial as of September. Around 100 or more are currently in detention, excluding detainees in Rakhine State, which are estimated to be in the hundreds. The lack of transparency in Burma's judicial and prison system makes it challenging to obtain an accurate count of political prisoners. With 42 prisons and 109 labor camps across the country, there are no publicly accessible records of detainees' whereabouts. Organizations rely on various sources such as inside networks, confidential informants, court trial files, and families of prisoners to compile information on political prisoners. The government of Burma faces challenges in accurately counting political prisoners due to lack of transparency in the judicial system. Aung San Suu Kyi pledged to release all political prisoners, using legal methods outlined in the constitution. President Htin Kyaw granted amnesty to 113 people awaiting trial and pardoned 83 political prisoners following Aung San Suu Kyi's announcement. The government of Burma faces challenges in accurately counting political prisoners due to lack of transparency in the judicial system. President Htin Kyaw granted amnesty to 113 people awaiting trial and pardoned 83 political prisoners following Aung San Suu Kyi's announcement. One possible approach is to amend or repeal laws used to arrest and imprison people for political reasons, including The Right to Peaceful Assembly and Peaceful Procession Act, The Ward and Village Tract Administration Law, and The Electronic Transactions Act. An uninvited U.S. visitor swam across a small lake to her house. The Electronic Transactions Act imposes up to seven years in prison for acts detrimental to security or distributing secret information. The Penal Code contains provisions used to suppress political dissent, including penalties for speech inciting hatred or contempt. The curr_chunk discusses laws in place in a certain country that criminalize speech inciting hatred towards the government, insulting religious feelings, and spreading rumors to cause fear or alarm. Additionally, the Unlawful Association Act allows the President to declare organizations illegal if they interfere with law and order. The Unlawful Association Act in a certain country criminalizes membership in illegal groups and stipulates prison terms. The judicial system is plagued by corruption and incompetence, with reports of bribery and manipulation affecting case outcomes. Efforts to reform the judiciary may require cooperation from the military for constitutional changes. The NLD, with a majority in Parliament, can amend laws despite military presence. Changing laws may impact Tatmadaw cooperation on issues like civil war. Another option is amending the constitution to transfer security forces to civilian control. Article 338 states that all armed forces in Myanmar, including the military and the national police force, are under the command of the Defence Services. The Myanmar Police Force, part of the Ministry of Home Affairs, is responsible for law enforcement and is directly controlled by the Commander-in-Chief. Amending the constitution to give the President more control over the appointment of the Minister of Home Affairs could reduce political arrests by the police force. Amending the constitution in Burma is a challenging process, requiring support from a significant portion of the Union Parliament and voters. Military support is crucial due to their significant presence in the Parliament. The military leadership has a mixed record on political prisoners, with some officers supporting amnesty while others have not. The military in Burma has control over security forces and continues to arrest political prisoners despite some cooperation with the previous government. The release of prisoners with ties to ethnic armed groups is a key issue. The military's stance may differ under the new government led by the NLD. The Burmese military and Myanmar Police Force have continued to arrest individuals involved in peaceful protests despite a pledge to release political prisoners by the end of 2013. There are concerns that military leaders intend to persist in detaining political protesters, as indicated by Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing's speech on Tatmadaw Day in March 2016. President Htin Kyaw granted two amnesties in April 2016 without the support of the NDSC, leading to further arrests for political reasons in May 2016. On Tatmadaw Day in March 2016, Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing highlighted the hindrances to democratization as the rule of law and armed insurgencies. Efforts to amend repressive laws faced opposition from military officers appointed by Hlaing. Despite this, the Union Parliament passed revisions to the Ward or Village Tract Administration Law on June 3, 2016. The military members opposed a 2016 proposal to define \"political prisoners.\" The release of these prisoners could impact national reconciliation. Relations between the NLD and some EAOs are delicate due to Aung San Suu Kyi's background and willingness to work under the 2008 constitution. Some EAOs believe the NLD may offer better terms than the previous government to end the civil war, possibly by releasing prisoners associated with EAOs. The Shan State Progress Party (SSPP) and Shan State Army (SSA) have called for the release of civilians detained by the Burma Army for alleged association with outlawed ethnic armed organizations. Other ethnic armed groups have also demanded the release of their members as a precondition for peace negotiations. The detention of political prisoners in Burma led to sanctions imposed by the United States. The United States imposed sanctions on Burma between 1988 and 2008 due to the detention of political prisoners, including opposition leaders like Aung San Suu Kyi. Various acts, such as the Customs and Trade Act of 1990, Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003, and Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act of 2008, were passed in response to crackdowns on opposition parties and popular protests. The release of political prisoners, including Buddhist monks, is a precondition for lifting U.S. sanctions on Burma. Sanctions will continue until certain conditions are met, such as the release of prisoners held for political reasons. The President can ban new investments in Burma if there is harm to opposition leaders or large-scale repression of the Democratic opposition. The Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act requires a ban on all imports from Burma. The Burmese sanction laws include bans on imports, asset freezes, and visa restrictions on certain officials and supporters until conditions like the release of political prisoners are met, with provisions for a presidential waiver if in the national interest. The ban on new U.S. investments in Burma was waived on July 11, 2012, along with the BFDA import ban on November 15, 2012. President Obama waived financial sanctions in the JADE Act on August 6, 2013. Most sanctions related to political prisoners have been lifted. Congress has also enacted legislation addressing political prisoners in Burma. Section 7043(b)(3)(A) of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 requires a comprehensive strategy for promoting democracy and human rights in Burma to be submitted to congressional committees. The promotion of democracy and human rights in Burma includes support for civil society, former prisoners, monks, students, and democratic parliamentarians. The State Department and USAID are required to support programs for former political prisoners, including health, education, and vocational training activities, as well as programs to monitor the number of political prisoners in Burma. The Senate version of the State Department Appropriations Act would reinstate the requirement for funds to implement the comprehensive strategy. U.S. officials continue to call for the release of all political prisoners. The U.S. officials have been urging for the release of political prisoners in Burma since 2011. The State Department welcomed the release of political prisoners in April 2016 by the NLD-led government. It remains to be seen how active the government will be in assisting the new government to prevent the arrest and detention of new political prisoners. Obama Administration tied Burma's political prisoner issue with other major issues related to democracy transition in Burma. President Obama addressed the detention of prisoners of conscience during his visit to Burma in November 2012. The U.S. officials have been urging for the release of political prisoners in Burma since 2011. The State Department welcomed the release of political prisoners in April 2016 by the NLD-led government. Obama Administration tied Burma's political prisoner issue with other major issues related to democracy transition in Burma. President Obama addressed the detention of prisoners of conscience during his visit to Burma in November 2012. Meetings and speeches in Burma will reaffirm the progress needed, including the release of remaining political prisoners, ending ethnic conflicts, establishing the rule of law, stopping the use of child soldiers, and providing access for humanitarian assistance and human rights observers in conflict areas. Commitment to work with the government, Aung San Suu Kyi, political opposition, and civil society to implement commitments announced before President Obama's visit a year ago. Watching closely the commitment to release all political prisoners by the end of the year. The State Department is committed to assisting the reintegration of political prisoners back into society without conditions. They plan to work with the Thein Sein government to resolve remaining cases and establish technical assistance programs for released prisoners to promote democratic transition and human rights. President Obama mentioned past prisoner releases during his visit in November 2014. President Obama praised Myanmar's progress in political reform, citing the release of political prisoners as evidence. However, some Burmese activists criticized his assessment as being disconnected from reality. Critics of Burma's reforms say President Obama's visit ignored key issues like political prisoners. The State Department and U.S. ambassador raised concerns with other governments and the EU. British Foreign Secretary urged against lifting sanctions until political prisoners are released. Following the release of political prisoners in Burma on April 8, 2016, the State Department welcomed the new government's commitment to human rights and democracy. However, no similar statement was issued after another release on April 17, 2016. The continued detention of political prisoners and the state of human rights in Burma are likely to be significant issues in the future. In the future, Congress may review U.S. policy towards Burma, including existing restrictions and the political prisoner issue. Legislation may be considered to amend restrictions based on evolving conditions. Funding for humanitarian programs in Burma may also be evaluated to address the needs of released political prisoners, IDPs, refugees, and vulnerable populations. Members of Congress sent letters prior to Secretary Kerry's trip to Asia, which included Burma. Members of Congress expressed concern about U.S. policy towards Burma, highlighting issues such as political prisoners remaining incarcerated despite promises of release, and the harsh treatment of journalists. Senator Marco Rubio and Senator Mark Kirk also raised alarm over the arrests of journalists, indicating a chilling effect on press freedom. The arrests of journalists and concerns about political prisoners in Burma have raised alarm among members of Congress. They may push the Obama Administration to address these issues and consider altering U.S. restrictions on relations with Burma based on changing political situations. The President has the authority to waive some restrictions if necessary. The President has the authority to waive restrictions on relations with Burma if certain conditions are met or if it is in the national interest of the United States. Congress may review the President's determination and include provisions in future appropriations bills regarding political prisoners in Burma. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 required support for former political prisoners and a comprehensive strategy for democracy and human rights in Burma. The Senate version of the State Department, Foreign Operations, and Other Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2017 would reinstate the requirement for funds to support former political prisoners in Burma. Congress may consider additional funding for assistance to Burma, with the Obama Administration requesting $82.7 million for various projects to promote democracy, human rights, and economic opportunity. Congress could also place conditions on the availability of assistance to Burma. The Senate may reinstate the requirement for funds to support former political prisoners in Burma, with Congress considering additional funding for assistance to promote democracy, human rights, and economic opportunity. Conditions could be placed on the availability of assistance to Burma, including the identification and release of political prisoners."
