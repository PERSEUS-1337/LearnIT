    "content": "The Medicare Payment Fairness Act of 2009 may be cited as the \"Medicare Payment Fairness Act of 2009\". It includes a value index under the Medicare physician hospital service. The Medicare Payment Fairness Act of 2009, also known as the \"Medicare Payment Fairness Act of 2009\", introduces a value index for each fee schedule area under the Medicare physician hospital service. This index is determined by the ratio of quality to cost components, with quality measures reflecting health outcomes, patient safety, and health status for the Medicare population. The Secretary will consider hospital readmission rates, emergency department utilization for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions, and hospital admissions when establishing the quality component for the Medicare Payment Fairness Act of 2009. The quality component for each fee schedule area under the Medicare Payment Fairness Act of 2009 includes hospital admissions for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions, mortality amenable to health care, and other items deemed appropriate by the Secretary. The quality score for each area is compared to the national average quality score to determine the ratio. If quality data is insufficient at a sub-State level, the quality component for that area is adjusted accordingly. The cost component of the Medicare Payment Fairness Act of 2009 is based on total annual per beneficiary Medicare expenditures in a fee schedule area, with the option to use expenditures in the last two years of life for severity differences. The Medicare Payment Fairness Act of 2009 establishes the cost component for fee schedule areas based on the ratio of cost per beneficiary in the area to the national average cost per beneficiary. Amendments to the Social Security Act include adding \"value\" to geographic considerations and defining a value index. The Medicare Payment Fairness Act of 2009 amends the Social Security Act to include a value index for physician work. It also adjusts the computation of geographic and value factors for physicians' services.
