    "content": "Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is a process that captures manmade CO2 at its source, purifies it, transports it to a storage site, and injects it into geological reservoirs. The injected CO2 must be monitored for leakage and remain underground permanently. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is involved in CCS initiatives. The U.S. Department of Energy has been researching and developing carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology since 1997, with significant funding allocated for CCS projects, including nearly $7 billion in total appropriations since FY2008. This funding, including $3.4 billion from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, aimed to accelerate the development and demonstration of CCS in the United States. The U.S. Department of Energy has been investing in CCS technology since 1997, with substantial funding allocated for projects. The FutureGen project faced delays and changes before being suspended in 2015. This report provides an overview of the DOE CCS program, its funding levels, achievements, and prospects for success. The U.S. Department of Energy has been investing in CCS technology since 1997, with substantial funding allocated for projects. The FutureGen project faced delays and changes before being suspended in 2015. Legislation in Congress focused on EPA GHG rules, incentives for CCS development, and emission standards proposed by the EPA in 2014 to address climate change goals. In June 2013, President Obama directed EPA to propose standards for GHG emissions from new fossil-fueled power plants by September 20, 2013, and for existing power plants by June 1, 2014. EPA may finalize the power plant rules by mid-summer 2015. New natural gas-fired power plants can meet the proposed standard without additional cost, while new coal-fired plants would need CCS technology to capture CO2 emissions. Compliance period for coal-fired plants is seven years. The EPA proposed rule requires new coal-fired power plants to limit CO2 emissions to 1,000-1,050 pounds per megawatt-hour and utilize CCS technology. The focus is on DOE's CCS RD&D program to achieve advanced CCS technology by 2020. The debate over the rule is seen as largely symbolic. The EPA's proposed rule for new power plants is symbolic, as it is necessary for regulating existing power plants under the Clean Air Act. The guidelines for existing plants include goals for improved efficiency, natural gas substitution, zero-emission generation, and demand-side efficiency. While CCS is not explicitly included, it could still be an option for reducing emissions. Congressional interest in coal's future is tied to CCS. The debate over the EPA's proposed rule for new power plants revolves around the future of CCS. While there are mixed opinions on whether the rule would promote CCS development for new coal-fired plants, most agree that coal will still play a significant role in electricity generation. The number of coal plant retirements and the impact of EPA regulations are disputed. The focus is on whether CCS is the best emissions reduction system for coal plants and if it has been adequately demonstrated. EPA points to ongoing CCS demonstration projects as justification for considering CCS as the best system of emissions reduction for coal-fired plants. The EPA's proposed rule for new power plants focuses on the future of CCS, with ongoing projects justifying CCS as the best emissions reduction system for coal-fired plants. The shift to natural gas for electricity production is driven by cheaper and abundant fuel, leading to separate BSER determinations for coal-fired and gas-fired power plants. Based on modeling and utility plans, natural gas combined-cycle power generation is seen as the most cost-effective option due to cheap gas and CO2 emissions regulations. This may lead to increased investment in natural gas-fired plants over coal. EPA regulations could incentivize CCS development despite abundant natural gas supplies. The EPA's re-proposed ruling for new power plants considers technology, specifically CCS technology, as a factor for accelerating development. Critics argue against the rule citing concerns about CCS technology demonstration and violations of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. President George W. Bush proposed the FutureGen project in 2003, a $1 billion initiative to build a coal-fired power plant with carbon sequestration and hydrogen production capabilities. The project was later restructured by the DOE to focus on multiple commercial demonstration projects instead of a single plant. The DOE requested $156 million for the restructured FutureGen program to support projects sequestering at least 1 million tons of CO2 per year. After the Recovery Act, $1 billion was allocated to the FutureGen Alliance for the construction of FutureGen 2.0 in Mattoon, Illinois. FutureGen 2.0 aimed to retrofit Ameren's power plant in Meridosia, Illinois with oxy-combustion technology. DOE canceled funding for the project due to the deadline for spending Recovery Act funds and uncertainty about securing private-sector funding. The FutureGen Alliance had spent $200 million of the $1 billion allocated. The DOE suspended the FutureGen project, questioning if it was a unique case in a complex and challenging endeavor. Approximately $3.3 billion in Recovery Act funding was allocated to large demonstration projects, with FutureGen receiving nearly $1 billion. Some argue that FutureGen was unique from its original conception compared to other large-scale demonstration projects in the United States. FutureGen was a unique large-scale demonstration project in the United States with an ambitious vision to create a near-zero emission CCS plant. The project combined capture, transportation, and storage components into a 250-megawatt functioning power plant, which was unprecedented and likely to experience delays in development. Scholars have difficulty categorizing FutureGen within existing technological change schemes. FutureGen project aimed to create a near-zero emission CCS plant, combining capture, transportation, and storage components into a 250-megawatt power plant. Scholars found it challenging to categorize within existing technological change schemes due to its unique and ambitious nature. The project's progression since 2003 has been erratic, possibly due to the daunting task of tackling all stages of technology development in one project. The FutureGen project's progress has been erratic since 2003, raising questions about the success of other large-scale demonstration projects funded by the DOE under the Clean Coal Power Initiative. Lessons learned from these projects will be shared with the electric power industry. DOE has been involved in CCS RD&D since 1997, with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 providing a 10-year authorization for CCS research. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 expanded this authorization to include seven large-scale CCS demonstration projects. Since the enactment of EISA, funding for CCS RD&D has shifted towards large-scale capture technology development through demonstration projects. The Recovery Act has provided significant funding to promote and support federal CCS RD&D activities, with $3.4 billion intended to accelerate the commercial deployment of CCS technologies by 2020. Senators Heitkamp and Kaine introduced S. 601, the Advanced Clean Technology Investment Act, on February 26, 2015. Senators Heitkamp and Kaine introduced S. 601, the Advanced Clean Technology Investment in Our Nation Act of 2015, to promote CCS for coal-fired utilities through loan guarantees, tax credits, and DOE R&D support. This bill is similar to legislation from the 113th Congress. Multiple bills in the 113th Congress aimed to address EPA rules for reducing GHG emissions from coal-fired power plants, including H.R. 3826, the Electricity Security and Affordability Act, which would have set requirements for EPA before issuing GHG emission regulations. The 113th Congress introduced bills to accelerate research and development of CCS technology for coal-fired power plants. S. 2152 proposed increased DOE funding for CCS research, loan guarantees for projects, tax credits for facilities, and a clean energy coal bond. Another bill, S. 2287, aimed to revise tax credits for CCS and broaden loan guarantees. The 113th Congress introduced bills to promote CCS technology for coal-fired power plants, including tax credits and loan guarantees. The DOE's Office of Fossil Energy focuses on developing ultra-clean energy from coal, with an increasing emphasis on CCS. The Coal Program at DOE has become the main focus, with CCS dominating coal R&D funding. Despite a reduction in funding in FY2016, DOE sees CCS as a promising option to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Deploying CCS technologies is costly, but essential for mitigating emissions from power plants. The costs of deploying CCS technology for power plants must be reduced to effectively mitigate GHG emissions. The Boundary Dam Plant in Canada is the only commercial-scale plant with CCS, but it is challenging to predict when lower-cost CCS technology will be available in the US. The coal RD&D program aims to have advanced CCS technology ready for large-scale demonstration by 2020. The DOE's coal R&D program aims to have advanced CCS technology ready for large-scale demonstration by 2020. The report discusses the components and funding history of the CCS activities within the program since FY2012, focusing on the time period when Recovery Act funding was obligated. Projects like the Kemper County Energy Facility and the Boundary Dam Project are highlighted for their contributions to the advancement of CCS technology. The DOE's Coal Program, within the Office of Fossil Energy, pursued various program areas such as Innovations for Existing Plants, Advanced Turbines, Carbon Sequestration, and more. The program structure was changed after FY2010, with two main categories: CCS Demonstration Programs and CSS and Power Systems. The FY2016 budget emphasizes support for near-zero emissions fossil energy technologies through research. The DOE's Coal Program focuses on developing near-zero emissions fossil energy technologies, specifically advanced CCS technologies. Programs target the three steps of CCS: capture, transportation, and storage. FutureGen aims to combine all three steps in a zero-emission fossil fuel plant. RD&D is divided among different industrial sectors within the CCS Demonstrations Program Area. The Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) program area provides federal support for new coal technologies. The Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) program originally supported new coal technologies to reduce pollutants, but shifted focus to reducing GHG emissions through efficiency improvements and CO2 capture. The program areas of CCPI and ICCS focus on demonstrating carbon capture technology, accounting for a significant portion of funding for CCS RD&D in the Recovery Act. This shift towards large industrial demonstration projects aligns with expert recommendations. The push for large-scale carbon capture demonstration projects, capturing 1 million metric tons or more of CO2 per year, aims to reduce costs associated with capturing emissions before they are released. The costliest component of CCS is the capture process, leading to higher estimated costs for power plants with CCS. The lack of information on technical questions at an industrial scale has contributed to uncertainty in cost estimates. Data from projects like the Kemper County Energy Facility and the Canadian Boundary Dam project are starting to emerge. The Administration requests approximately $191 million for FY2016 for fossil energy R&D programs. The largest activity is program direction ($114 million), supporting overall fossil energy R&D programs. The second-largest activity is natural gas technologies ($44 million), focusing on safe shale gas development and methane emissions reduction. Other activities include plant and capital, environmental restoration, and supercomputer, totaling approximately $33 million in the FY2016 request. The FY2016 request for fossil energy R&D programs includes approximately $33 million for plant and capital, environmental restoration, and supercomputer activities. Cost estimates for environmental technologies like power plant scrubbers can vary based on the technology's commercial readiness. Deploying commercial-scale CCS demonstration projects can provide more accurate cost estimates compared to laboratory or pilot-plant projects. DOE awarded Southern Company Services a cooperative agreement under the CCPI Round 2 program to develop technology at the Kemper County Energy Facility in Mississippi. The $270 million award aimed to support the deployment of gasification technology called Transport Integrated Gasification (TRIG TM) for the Kemper County Project, an integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) power plant owned by Mississippi Power Company. The Kemper County Project, owned by Mississippi Power Company, will use lignite as a fuel source with a peak net output capability of 582 megawatts. It is designed to capture 65% of CO2 emissions, making it comparable to a natural gas-fired plant. The captured CO2 will be transported for enhanced oil recovery. Commercial operation has been delayed since construction began in 2010. The Kemper County Project by Mississippi Power Company, using lignite as fuel, has faced delays and cost overruns. Originally estimated at $2.67 billion, costs have now escalated to approximately $5.2 billion. Commercial operation was expected to start in 2016 but has been pushed back. The Kemper County Project by Mississippi Power Company has faced significant cost overruns, with estimates now exceeding $6 billion due to construction issues and delays pushing the start-up date to 2016. The project's expenses are under increased scrutiny in light of environmental regulations on CO2 emissions and the promised benefits of CCS technology. The Boundary Dam Project in Canada, operated by SaskPower, is the only commercial-scale power plant with CCS technology in the world. The project cost approximately $1.3 billion, with $800 million for building the CCS process and $500 million for retrofitting the coal-fired generating unit. It received $240 million from the Canadian government and started operating in October 2014 after a four-year construction period. The Boundary Dam Project in Canada cost $1.3 billion, with $800 million for CCS technology and $500 million for retrofitting. It captures CO2 for enhanced oil recovery and stores unused CO2 underground. The project aims to capture at least 1 million tons of CO2 per year. The majority of Recovery Act funds for CCS were directed to three subprograms. The DOE aims to develop technologies for commercial-scale CCS demonstration projects by 2020, with a target of five projects by 2016. The allocation of Recovery Act funding prioritized these projects as crucial for the future success of CCS in the United States. The CCPI, ICCS, and FutureGen programs are key to this effort, facing both accomplishments and challenges. The $800 million funding increase from the Recovery Act is being used to expand activities in the CCPI program for Round 3, focusing on developing technologies to reduce pollutants from power plants. DOE did not request additional funding for CCPI in the annual appropriations process after the Recovery Act. The 2010 DOE CCS Roadmap states that Recovery Act funds have been used for demonstration projects to advance CCS at commercial scale. The DOE selected six projects under CCPI Round 3 with a total funding of $1.75 billion, but three projects in Alabama, North Dakota, and West Virginia withdrew, reducing the DOE's share to approximately $1.03 billion. Reasons for withdrawal included financial concerns and uncertainty about future regulations. Southern Company withdrew its Alabama Plant Barry project from the CCPI program on February 22, 2010, due to financial concerns and the need for more time to perform due diligence on its commitment. They continue work on a smaller CCS project at Plant Barry. On July 1, 2009, Secretary Chu announced $100 million in DOE funding for the Antelope Valley 120 Megawatt Project to capture CO2 from a power station near Beulah, ND. Basin Electric Power Cooperative withdrew citing regulatory uncertainty, cost concerns, and lack of a long-term energy strategy. The project aimed to supply captured CO2 for enhanced oil recovery in Canada's Weyburn field. In July 2011, American Electric Power (AEP) decided to halt its plans for a carbon capture plant at its Mountaineer power plant in West Virginia. The project was part of an ongoing CCPI project, but AEP dropped it due to uncertainty about recovering costs and broader economic conditions. Congressional inaction and economic challenges have reduced incentives for AEP to invest in CCS. Phase 2 of a project was canceled due to climate policy uncertainty. DOE redistributed funding from a canceled project to other clean energy projects, including the Petra Nova Energy Project in Texas. Funding for the Basin Electric Power project was announced but not awarded, potentially leading to reallocation of funds. Funds for the AEP Mountaineer project were rescinded by Congress in FY2012 appropriations. A total of $187 million was rescinded from the Fossil Energy Research and Development account. The original DOE ICCS program was divided into two main areas: Area 1 for large industrial demonstration projects and Area 2 for testing innovative concepts for CO2 reuse. The DOE ICCS program had two main areas: Area 1 focused on large industrial demonstration projects, with $686 million in funding for three Phase 2 projects, while Area 2 involved feasibility studies for CO2 reuse, with $17.4 million in Recovery Act funding. The DOE ICCS program funded six projects in a second phase to convert captured CO2 into useful products like fuel and plastics. These projects received $141.5 million in funding from the Recovery Act, totaling 71% of the overall cost. Additionally, the program expanded with 22 more projects funded under the Recovery Act to accelerate CCS technologies in various categories. The DOE funded 22 projects under the Recovery Act for carbon sequestration, with a total share of $594.9 million out of $765.2 million. Federal funding for all ICCS projects combined is $1.422 billion out of $2.038 billion. DOE allocated funds for carbon sequestration and storage activities in FY2012-2015 and requested $109 million in FY2016. Recovery Act funds were also awarded for 10 projects for CO2 storage site characterization. DOE has allocated funding for 10 projects to conduct site characterization of geologic formations for CO2 storage. This is part of the broader RD&D efforts for injecting CO2 into subsurface reservoirs, which is the third step in the CCS process. Large-volume CO2 injection demonstration projects are now underway across the country to validate long-term storage in various storage formations. The DOE has funded 10 projects for site characterization of geologic formations for CO2 storage as part of broader efforts for injecting CO2 into subsurface reservoirs. Large-volume CO2 injection experiments are being conducted at a commercial scale to gather crucial information on different geologic reservoirs for storage. The DOE established seven regional carbon sequestration partnerships (RCSPs) in 2003 to address regional differences in fossil fuel use and geologic reservoir potential for CO2 storage. The DOE established seven regional carbon sequestration partnerships (RCSPs) in 2003, involving 43 states and 4 Canadian provinces, with over 400 organizations. These partnerships have gone through three phases from 2003 to 2018: Characterization Phase, Validation Phase, and Development Phase, focusing on geological sequestration of CO2. The RCSPs, funded by the DOE, play a significant role in carbon sequestration activities. They receive a majority of the annual spending on carbon storage and provide the framework for various geologic sequestration projects. The Development Phase is currently ongoing, with large-scale CO2 injection projects like SECARB and MGSC underway. The Development Phase projects funded by the DOE aim to understand the technical and nontechnical challenges of storing CO2 underground for long periods. This includes regulatory, liability, and ownership issues that could hinder widespread deployment of CCS. EPA has promulgated a rule for managing underground CO2 injection, but a complete regulatory framework is still lacking in the United States. The EPA has created a new class of injection wells (Class VI) under the Safe Drinking Water Act to regulate the injection of CO2 and protect underground water sources. However, this regulation only addresses certain issues such as underground water protection and does not cover other important aspects like long-term liability, potential emissions, legal issues, and property rights. The potential challenges of broad community acceptance of CCS include issues related to property rights, underground migration of CO2 plumes, and public unfamiliarity with CCS details. Large-scale injection tests aim to address community concerns and guide government agencies and the private sector towards widespread CCS deployment. The success of the federal CCS RD&D program hinges on whether CCS technologies are commercially deployed. The success of the Clean Coal Program depends on the deployment of new coal technologies in domestic and international markets. Commercial scale demonstrations help overcome technical and financial challenges, gain early learning experience, and secure private financing. The Kemper County Energy project may be the first in the US to capture and inject large quantities of CO2 for carbon sequestration. The Boundary Dam Project in Canada, operational since 2014, is the first commercial-scale power plant with CCS technology. Most of the captured CO2 is used for enhanced oil recovery. The DOE is conducting commercial-scale demonstration projects for CO2 capture, injection, and storage. The success of these projects will impact the future deployment of CCS technologies to prevent CO2 emissions. The proposed EPA standard for new coal-fired power plants has renewed interest in CCS technology. Congress may need to review the prospects for commercial deployment of CCS. The success of commercial-scale demonstration projects for CO2 capture, injection, and storage will impact the future deployment of CCS technologies. Congress may need to review the prospects for commercial deployment of CCS and its potential impact on the environment. The injection of fluids, including produced water, in shale formations raises concerns about leakage and induced earthquakes. Public worries over hydraulic fracturing and deep-well injection of produced waters may extend to CO2 injection. The success of DOE in addressing these concerns during large-scale demonstration projects will impact the future of CCS deployment."
