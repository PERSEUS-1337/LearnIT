    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 2192 of the Streets and Highways Code amends the Trade Corridors Improvement Fund to receive revenues from state and federal sources for approved projects. This chapter governs the expenditure of these funds. The funding in subdivision (a) is available for infrastructure improvements on federally designated Trade Corridors of National and Regional Significance, the Primary Freight Network, and other high-volume freight corridors. The California Transportation Commission consults various state and regional plans to determine eligible projects for funding. Eligible projects for funding must align with state economic, environmental, and public health goals for freight policy, as outlined in relevant plans. This may include infrastructure improvements on designated trade corridors and high-volume freight routes. Highway, rail, and landside access improvements are needed to accommodate freight movement efficiently, especially to and from ports of entry, rail terminals, and seaports. This includes enhancing the freight rail system to transport goods to distribution centers, separating rail lines from road traffic, improving rail mobility in mountainous regions, and increasing rail freight system capacity. Projects to enhance port capacity and efficiency, truck corridor improvements, border enhancements for goods movement with Mexico, and surface transportation improvements to facilitate goods movement in and out of the state. The commission evaluates projects for funding based on costs and benefits to California's economy, environment, and public health. They consult with the State Air Resources Board for evaluation parameters and allocate funds for trade infrastructure improvements. This includes addressing urgent needs, balancing demands of ports and airports, and ensuring geographic balance. The commission evaluates projects for funding based on economic, environmental, and public health benefits. They prioritize trade corridor mobility, safety, and emissions reduction while considering the state's economy. Amendments to the 2007 guidelines must be adopted by April 1, 2017. The commission evaluates projects for funding based on economic, environmental, and public health benefits, prioritizing trade corridor mobility, safety, and emissions reduction. Amendments to the 2007 guidelines must be adopted by April 1, 2017. The commission, in adopting amended guidelines and developing the program of projects, accepts nominations from regional and local transportation agencies and the Department of Transportation. They also consider factors like \"velocity\" and \"throughput\" when allocating funds. The Streets and Highways Code is amended to define \"reliability\" as consistent cargo travel time and \"congestion reduction\" as reducing daily delays. The commission will allocate funds to projects with identified supplemental funding from local, federal, or private sources. Projects must have supplemental funding equal to or greater than the amount provided by the commission to be eligible for funding. Priority may be given to projects with higher levels of committed supplemental funding."
