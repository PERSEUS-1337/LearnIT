REAP provides formula grants to eligible school districts and states to support rural education. The program continues to operate despite the expiration of its authorization in 2008, and Congress is expected to consider reauthorization issues. The Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) addresses challenges faced by rural schools, including allocation of funds. Rural schools have advantages such as close community ties and quick adaptability, but also face fiscal limitations and resource shortages. Congress may address reauthorization issues as they consider the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). Resource shortages in rural schools lead to limited curricular options, challenges in attracting qualified teachers, declining enrollment, high transportation costs, and difficulties meeting NCLB requirements. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) study found that rural LEAs face challenges in recruiting qualified teachers for core academic subjects due to limited resources and competitive salaries. Small rural districts struggle with releasing teachers for training and conferences, hindering their ability to meet NCLB requirements. The U.S. Department of Education has addressed concerns of rural school districts by providing additional flexibility, such as allowing extra time for teacher qualification requirements. Congress created REAP to help rural districts lacking resources to compete for federal grants. REAP authorizes two rural education programs under ESEA Title VI-B: the Small, Rural School Achievement Program (SRSA) for LEAs with less than 600 students, and the Rural and Low-Income School Program (RLIS) for larger rural LEAs with high poverty rates. The program was authorized at $300 million for FY2002 and continues to operate with appropriations. In FY2012, $179 million was allocated for REAP, with modest growth in appropriations except for FY2006 and FY2011. Appropriations for the Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) have grown modestly, with a 10% increase from FY2002 to FY2012. To be eligible for REAP funds, Local Education Agencies (LEAs) must be designated as rural by the Department of Education. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) classifies schools based on their geographic location using \"locale codes\" on an urban-to-rural scale. An LEA must be designated as rural to be eligible for the Small Rural School Achievement (SRSA) program, which categorizes areas based on population size and location within a CBSA or MSA. An LEA is eligible for the SRSA program if all schools have locale codes of 7 or 8 and meet certain criteria. The RLIS program is available to LEAs with specific locale codes and poverty levels. The Secretary can waive the locale code requirement for SRSA but not for RLIS. The SRSA program is available to LEAs with locale codes of 7 or 8, while the RLIS program is for LEAs with specific locale codes and poverty levels. An LEA receiving a grant under SRSA is not eligible for RLIS funding. Combining eligibility criteria reduces the number of eligible LEAs for assistance. Grants for eligible LEAs can be reduced based on funds received from other ESEA programs. Funding calculations differ between SRSA and RLIS programs. Under the RLIS program, grants are allocated to states and then distributed to LEAs based on a formula or competitive basis. The initial SRSA base grant is $20,000, with an additional amount added for LEAs with more than 50 students. The extra amount is $100 for each student over 50, capped at $60,000. For example, an LEA with 55 students would receive $20,500, while an LEA with 449 students would receive $59,900. LEAs with 450-599 students receive the maximum grant of $60,000. The SRSA program provides grants to LEAs based on the number of students, with a maximum award of $60,000. The grant amount is adjusted based on funds received from other ESEA grant programs. LEAs receiving $60,000 or more from these programs would not receive additional funds from the SRSA program. The SRSA program provides grants to LEAs based on student numbers, with a maximum award of $60,000. LEAs already receiving $60,000 or more from other ESEA programs would not get additional funds from SRSA. State amounts for SRSA are the total allocated to LEAs in each state, while RLIS reserves funds for BIE schools and outlying areas. States distribute RLIS funds to eligible LEAs competitively or through a state-selected formula approved by the Secretary, making individual LEA grant estimates impossible. Alabama and other southeastern states receive RLIS funding due to their larger consolidated LEAs with no small LEAs. Alabama also receives substantial grants under RLIS for LEAs with high poverty rates. Conversely, states with few high-poverty LEAs receive more SRSA awards. For example, Connecticut receives no RLIS funding due to having only six high-poverty LEAs out of 193. Individual LEA grant estimates are impossible under the RLIS program. Minnesota has 159 out of 168 LEAs eligible for SRSA grants, resulting in a significant amount of funding. South Dakota has 30 out of 179 LEAs eligible for RLIS, with only four receiving funds due to eligibility under both RLIS and SRSA programs. Hawaii, Maryland, Vermont, and the District of Columbia receive no REAP funding in FY2010. SRSA grant recipients can use funds for various ESEA programs. Local Educational Agencies (LEAs) eligible for SRSA grants can use funds from various ESEA programs, including teacher training, technology enhancement, language instruction, safe schools, and innovative programs. The REAP-Flex provision allows flexibility in using offsetting funds for authorized activities. For example, funds from the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program can be used to incorporate technology into early reading programs. The GAO found that flexibility under the SRSA program allowed small, rural LEAs to redirect funds to crucial NCLB needs, such as supporting technology initiatives. RLIS grant recipients can use funds for teacher recruitment, professional development, and educational technology to improve teaching. The GAO reported various uses of REAP funds to meet NCLB requirements, including technology needs, supplementary services, professional development for teachers, and student remedial services. REAP aims to support rural school districts. According to statute, REAP aims to compensate rural school districts for receiving small formula grant amounts. SRSA-eligible LEAs receive smaller grants due to their smaller enrollments, but they receive higher awards per pupil compared to SRSA-ineligible LEAs. The decision to reauthorize hold-harmless provisions could impact the distribution of federal funds to SRSA-eligible LEAs. Congress may also need to assess if REAP funds are spread too thinly to be effective. The average award per pupil for RLIS grants is only $28, while the average award per student for SRSA grants is $81. NCES has introduced a new \"urban-centric\" locale code system with 12 classifications to better depict a school's geographic context. The new codes are based on improved technology, recent residential developments, and finer distinctions between urban and rural areas. The new \"urban-centric\" locale code system introduced by NCES has 12 classifications to depict a school's geographic context, ranging from Large City to Distant Town based on population size and proximity to urban areas. The NCES introduced a new urban-centric locale code system with 12 classifications to depict a school's geographic context, ranging from Large City to Distant Town based on population size and proximity to urban areas. Town, Remote Town, Fringe Rural, Distant Rural, and Remote Rural are some of the classifications used to define different types of territories based on their distance from urbanized areas. The metro-centric codes are being phased out by NCES but are still available for the operation of REAP. NCES introduced a new urban-centric locale code system with 12 classifications. The old metro-centric codes are still available for REAP operation. Congress may consider switching to the new locale codes, with a focus on comparing old and new codes for REAP eligibility. Analysis shows a high overlap between rural schools identified under both systems. Based on the comparison between old and new town categories, it is suggested to replace metro-centric rural codes with urban-centric rural codes for eligibility criteria. This involves assigning specific urban-centric codes to schools in order to determine eligibility for SRSA and RLIS programs. The proposed switch to new urban-centric codes would increase the number of eligible LEAs in SRSA and RLIS programs. This change will result in some LEAs and states losing funding while others gain funding, creating \"winners\" and \"losers\" unless there are significant increases in REAP funding. The Census Bureau's elimination of metro-centric codes will impact eligibility criteria for funding. The Census Bureau's elimination of metro-centric codes will impact funding eligibility criteria. Congress could consider hold-harmless provisions for eliminated LEAs to soften the funding loss. However, a formula change based on new locale codes may result in lower grants overall for remaining LEAs. The current SRSA formula often does not allocate all appropriated funds due to a $60,000 cap on grants. The current SRSA formula has a $60,000 cap on grants, leading to excess funds that are distributed through a \"ratable increase\" procedure. The statute could be amended to reflect this procedure or provide a different policy for additional appropriations. Increasing the cap from $60,000 is also an option to consider. One option to improve the Rural and Low-Income School (RLIS) program is to allow small, poor rural Local Education Agencies (LEAs) to benefit from both RLIS and Small, Rural School Achievement (SRSA) programs. This would increase the number of eligible LEAs for RLIS and redistribute state grants accordingly. Additionally, setting a higher poverty threshold for eligibility could further target assistance to small, poor LEAs. The SRSA formula has resulted in distributional anomalies, such as very large per-pupil grants for some LEAs with only one or a few students. One approach to address this is to limit LEA participation to those with a minimum total enrollment. Another anomaly is when LEAs receive grants just slightly less than their final SRSA grant, which could be eliminated to redistribute funds to other LEAs. Some LEAs eligible for the SRSA program have offsetting grants larger than their initial grant, leading to concerns about the lack of additional funding. One proposed solution is to adjust the calculation of initial grants to ensure more LEAs receive funding. Additionally, states do not receive state administration funding under the SRSA program despite providing data for fund allocation. Some suggest reserving a percentage of SRSA program funds for state administration to address data allocation issues. Concerns exist that poverty measures for RLIS eligibility may not accurately reflect rural poverty. The SAIPE program provides income and poverty estimates for states, counties, and school districts. The SAIPE program generates poverty estimates for states, counties, and school districts by combining survey data with population estimates and administrative records. The process involves distributing data from national levels to more narrow geographic levels, leading to some distributional error. Rural program proponents argue that child poverty in small, sparsely populated school districts could be better estimated using different data sources. In small, sparsely populated school districts, child poverty could be better estimated using Free and Reduced-Price Lunch (FRPL) data. A proposal in the Rural Education Achievement Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 suggests using FRPL data to determine eligibility for RLIS. The switch to FRPL data would increase the number of eligible LEAs significantly. Switching from SAIPE data to FRPL data for determining eligibility for RLIS could significantly increase the number of eligible LEAs, with over 900 LEAs potentially being added using the new locale codes. Congress may need to consider setting a higher threshold than 40% to control the number of newly eligible LEAs and analyze the distributional impacts more closely due to concerns about the quality of the data. This switch could lead to significant shifts in the distribution of RLIS funds across regions and states, as highlighted in the 1994 ESEA amendments. The NRC recommended research into improving SAIPE data by incorporating additional income-related information like FRPL data. Census Bureau researchers found that FRPL data may not be precise enough for formal use in producing school district poverty estimates at this time. FRPL data may not be precise enough for producing school district poverty estimates due to timing discrepancies in student counts and income threshold differences compared to Census Bureau poverty levels. The FRPL program's eligibility as a measure of poverty is considered too expansive, as it includes more children than the census definition of poverty. Additionally, FRPL data may undercount children in middle and high schools, leading to inaccurate representations of poverty in high school districts. The self-reported nature of FRPL data, dependent on families applying for the program, raises concerns about accuracy according to the USDA. The eligibility verifications performed by school districts suggest that many ineligible children are being certified for free and reduced meals, making the data unreliable for measuring poverty. The self-reported nature of FRPL data and discrepancies with census poverty estimates raise concerns about accuracy. Between 1994 and 2004, the ratio of school-age children receiving free or reduced-price lunch increased from 28.6 to 32.2 percent, while the estimated poverty rate for related children ages 5 to 17 decreased from 19.8 to 16.2 percent. This discrepancy suggests an increase in the number of low-income children despite official poverty estimates declining during the late 1990s economic expansion."
