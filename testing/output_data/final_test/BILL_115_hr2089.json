    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Protect Law Enforcement Armor Act\" or the \"PLEA Act.\" Congress finds that law enforcement is threatened by handguns and ammunition designed to penetrate body armor, such as the Five-seveN Pistol manufactured by FN Herstal. This pistol is capable of penetrating level IIA armor and can perforate 48 layers of Kevlar up to 200 meters. The Five-seveN Pistol and similar handguns pose a threat to law enforcement by using ammunition capable of penetrating body armor. The purpose of the Act is to protect officers by testing handguns and ammunition for this capability and prohibiting civilians from owning such firearms or ammunition. The Act treats armor-piercing handguns like machineguns under federal firearms laws. The definition of an armor-piercing handgun is any handgun that fires ammunition capable of penetrating body armor, as determined by the Attorney General. Standards for testing firearms and ammunition for their ability to penetrate body armor will be established within a year. The Attorney General will determine which firearms and ammunition are exempt from restrictions based on factors like material composition, barrel length, and marketing. The Fabrique Nationale Herstal Five-seveN handguns were designed to penetrate body armor. The term 'Body Armor Exemplar' refers to armor meeting minimum standards for law enforcement protection. (c) Inclusion in Definition of Firearm.--Section 921(a)(3)(A) of such title is amended to include an armor-piercing handgun. Section 922(o) of such title is amended to ban possession or transfer of armor-piercing handguns, with exceptions for lawful possession before the effective date of the amendment. (e) Ban on Unauthorized Transport in Interstate or Foreign Commerce: Amends Section 922 to include \"armor-piercing handgun\" before \"machinegun\" in subsections (a)(4) and (b)(4). \n(f) Enhanced Penalties for Using, Carrying, or Possessing During and in Relation to a Crime of Violence or Drug Trafficking Crime: Amends Section 924(c)(1) to include \"armor-piercing handgun\" after \"machinegun\" in subparagraphs (B)(ii) and (C)(ii). \n(g) Penalties for Conspiring To Commit an Offense Subject to Certain Enhanced Penalties: Amends Section 924(o) to include \"armor-piercing handgun\" after \"machinegun\". \n(h) Exception From Requirement To Allow Importation of an Unserviceable Firearm That Is a Curio or Museum Piece: Amends Section 925(d)(2) to include \"an armor-piercing handgun or\" before \"a machinegun\". Amendments are made to various sections of the law to include \"armor-piercing handgun\" alongside \"machinegun\" in different contexts for law enforcement officers and retired officers."
