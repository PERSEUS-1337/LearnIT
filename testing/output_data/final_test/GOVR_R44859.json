The country heavily relies on foreign aid, with U.S. assistance being a key focus. Congressional interest is mainly on health aid and governance issues, particularly during the presidency of Bingu wa Mutharika. U.S. bilateral assistance to Malawi has ranged from $196 million to $261 million in recent years, with additional funding for disaster response. The Obama Administration requested $195.6 million for FY2017. In FY2017, congressional appropriators mandated at least $56 million in Development Assistance account funds for Malawi, with $10 million for higher education programs. The Trump Administration requested $161.3 million for Malawi in FY2018, part of a proposed one-third reduction in global aid levels. Malawi last held national elections in May 2014, with Peter Mutharika winning with 36.4% of votes. Banda succeeded President Wa Mutharika after his death in 2012, facing treason charges from then-Foreign Minister Peter Mutharika. Initially supported by international donors, her administration was marred by a corruption scandal leading to aid restrictions. Malawi suffered from drought in 2015-2016, impacting harvests due to delays in distributing subsidized seeds and fertilizer. The poor harvests in Malawi in 2015-2016 were due to delays in distributing seeds and fertilizer. USAID expects conditions to improve after the 2017 April-May harvest season, but challenges such as delays in fertilizer distribution, armyworm infestation, and low farm earnings continue to impact output and incomes for rural dwellers. Approximately 6.7 million Malawians faced acute food insecurity in early 2017. Additionally, a territorial dispute with Tanzania over Lake Malawi, potentially rich in fossil fuel reserves, has been ongoing since 2016. The international border dispute over Lake Malawi between Malawi and Tanzania continues, with Malawi claiming the entire lake based on historical mappings. Mediation efforts, led by Mozambique's former president, have resumed. Malawi allows oil and gas exploration in the lake, drawing criticism. Economic plans for the lake, including a shipbuilding plant, face uncertainty due to the border dispute. Malawi plans to lodge a legal case with the International Court of Justice in the Hague. The legal case over the dispute with the International Court of Justice in the Hague involves a refugee influx from Mozambique to Malawi. Approximately 10,000 Mozambicans fled fighting between the government and an armed opposition party, with 3,000 remaining in Malawi as of late March 2017. Malawi hosts a total of about 27,300 refugees, mostly from Rwanda and Burundi, with some residing in the country for several years. During Muluzi's presidency, political pluralism and market-based economic reforms grew, along with corruption allegations. Bingu wa Mutharika succeeded Muluzi, with his first term being economically successful but marked by signs of semi-authoritarian leadership. He attempted to remove Joyce Banda as vice president, leading her to form her own party. Mass protests in 2011 were harshly repressed, resulting in international donors withholding aid. In 2011, the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation paused its $350 million Compact in Malawi due to accusations by Wa Mutharika against Western donors. The Compact was reinstated after his death. Banda succeeded Wa Mutharika and received support from the Obama Administration and Members of Congress for her positive policy agenda and governance decisions. She was praised as an advocate for women's rights and for promoting gender equality in a region dominated by male leaders. After succeeding Wa Mutharika, Banda received support from the Obama Administration and Members of Congress for her positive policy agenda and governance decisions. She was praised for promoting gender equality in a region dominated by male leaders. However, her administration faced criticism for economic reforms that led to economic hardship, labor strikes, and a drop in GDP per capita. In 2013, President Banda faced criticism over a state embezzlement scandal known as \"Cashgate\" and the sale of a presidential jet. These issues, along with economic hardship and alleged corruption during her tenure, contributed to her electoral defeat in 2014. The polling process for the 2014 presidential race had logistical shortcomings, violence, and legal challenges. The 2014 polling process had logistical issues, violence, and legal challenges. Mutharika won with 36.4% of the votes, while Banda came in third with 20%. The election resulted in a hung parliament, with Mutharika's party holding a quarter of seats. Mutharika plans to run for a second term in 2019. Mutharika, born in 1940, is a former U.S. resident and professor of law who returned to Malawi in 1993 to help design a new constitution. He has held various cabinet ministerial posts and plans to run for a second term in 2019. Malawi's GDP fell from $6.4 billion in 2015 to $5.5 billion in 2016 due to decreased agricultural production from a severe drought. GDP per capita dropped from $354 to $294. Analysts predict growth to increase in 2017 as the drought ends, with the IMF projecting GDP growth to reach 4.5% in 2017 and 5.0% in 2018. Malawi's import-dependent economy faces challenges due to poor infrastructure, high transport costs, and import dependency. Malawi's economic challenges include high transport costs, import dependency, and structural obstacles hindering growth. Government efforts focus on private sector growth, trade liberalization, and reducing administrative costs. Privatization of state firms and development of the mining sector are underway. Agriculture, employing a large labor force, faces market price shocks and weather risks. The first uranium mine in 2009 diversified export earnings. Smallholder farmers produce food for subsistence and cash crops like tobacco. Malawi's economy relies on agriculture, with a focus on tobacco as the top export. The country has a small manufacturing sector and limited skilled workforce. Malawi received debt relief in 2006 and is a member of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), aiming to improve transport and electricity networks. Relations with donor governments are crucial for long-term development. Malawi's heavy reliance on donor aid, particularly after the \"Cashgate\" corruption scandal in 2013, has led to a shift from direct budget support to project-based aid from members of the Common Approach to Budget Support (CABS) group and the United States. This change has focused on social services, humanitarian needs, and infrastructure development. Despite Cashgate investigations and prosecutions, donors remain concerned over government budget execution capacity and corruption in Malawi. Allegations of inflated maize purchases led to the firing of the Minister of Agriculture. The IMF suspended a $145 million credit program in 2015 but signaled intent to reinstate in 2016. The IMF signaled its intent to reinstate the extended credit facility arrangement for Malawi, with the program being extended until June 2017. The European Union is assessing the government's progress in meeting policy targets for potential aid resumption, and the World Bank resumed cooperation in May 2017. Malawi faces challenges such as institutional weaknesses, lack of education, and resource limitations affecting access to justice. Reports of misconduct by security agencies exist, but efforts are being made to promote human and legal rights advocacy. The State Department highlighted various human rights issues in Malawi in 2016, including unlawful police killings, torture by security officers, sexual exploitation of children, arbitrary arrest and detention, discrimination against marginalized groups, and child labor. These problems are being addressed through legal rights advocacy and capacity-building efforts by government institutions and NGOs. In Malawi, persons with albinism face serious human rights threats, with a wave of violent attacks in 2016 exposing a failure of policing. Abductions, killings, and grave robberies were carried out by individuals and criminal gangs seeking body parts for magical powers. Women and children were particularly vulnerable, sometimes targeted by their own relatives. The government is working to address these challenges, including elder abuse. President Mutharika reported in 2016 that investigations into the root causes of attacks on albinos had led to prosecutions and convictions. In Malawi, investigations into attacks on albinos led to prosecutions and convictions. President Banda addressed human rights issues, including a campaign for the elderly and plans to review the Witchcraft Act. Homosexuals also face discrimination, with efforts to repeal anti-homosexuality laws. In Malawi, a neighborhood watch group detained two suspected homosexual men, leading to a criminal case that was later dropped pending a review of sexual conduct laws. Plans for public consultations on reforming laws banning homosexuality have sparked controversy, with protests by religious groups. Despite reported suspension of anti-gay laws, two men were convicted of homosexual acts in late 2016. Relations between the U.S. and Malawi have fluctuated, improving under President Banda after strains during President Wa Mutharika's second term. Under President Mutharika, U.S. relations with Malawi have remained close and positive, focusing on advancing health, education, agriculture, energy, and environmental stewardship. Both countries share views on the importance of economic and political stability in southern Africa. Malawi participates in the Young African Leaders Initiative and is eligible for trade benefits under the U.S. African Growth and Opportunity Act. The U.S. maintains close ties with Malawi under President Mutharika, focusing on health, education, agriculture, energy, and environmental stewardship. Malawi is eligible for trade benefits under the U.S. African Growth and Opportunity Act. Bilateral assistance from the State Department and USAID totaled $222.4 million in FY2015, with an estimated $260.9 million in FY2016. The Obama Administration requested $195.6 million for FY2017. The Trump Administration requested $56 million in Development Assistance account funds for Malawi in FY2018, with $10 million allocated for higher education programs. This funding would primarily support global health programs, with an additional $317,000 for International Military Education and Training (IMET) programs. U.S. development efforts in Malawi focus on combating HIV/AIDS, improving food security, and other specialized program aid from various federal agencies. The U.S. aims to counter the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Malawi, increase food security, spur economic growth, and reduce poverty. Assistance also focuses on strengthening institutions for effective social service delivery, private sector and civil society capacities, biodiversity preservation, and climate change mitigation. Significant funding goes towards health programs like PEPFAR, PMI, GHI, and FTF initiatives to expand agricultural production and access. Development Assistance in Malawi aims to improve social development prospects, promote sustainable livelihoods, expand participatory governance, and enhance good governance. The country's military receives assistance for peacekeeping training. Malawi was awarded a $21 million Millennium Challenge Corporation Threshold program in 2005 and a $350 million MCC compact in 2011, focusing on fighting corruption. The Millennium Challenge Corporation compact in Malawi was initially suspended in 2012 but reinstated in 2012 under President Banda. It focuses on improving the national power grid, rebuilding the power utility, and mitigating environmental constraints on hydropower facilities to reduce energy costs and enhance economic productivity. Ongoing investments in public goods and services, poverty alleviation efforts, and initiatives for private sector growth may improve socioeconomic conditions in Malawi. U.S.-Malawian relations are likely to focus on U.S. assistance and development cooperation, influenced by the Trump Administration's policies. The future of key development initiatives like PEPFAR and FTF will impact aid delivery to Malawi and the nature of bilateral relations."
