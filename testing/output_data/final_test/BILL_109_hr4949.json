    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Military Retirees' Health Care Protection Act\". It includes findings and the sense of Congress. Congress finds that career uniformed service members and their families endure unique and extraordinary demands and sacrifices over a 20- to 30-year career in protecting freedoms for all Americans, especially evident during wartime. The primary offset for these sacrifices is a system of extraordinary retirement benefits, including health care. The grateful Nation provides extraordinary retirement benefits, including superior health care coverage, to career uniformed service members who sacrifice much of their personal life for the national interest. Many private sector firms are reducing health benefits, leading retired members to rely on TRICARE coverage earned through military service. Some civilian employers offer incentives for TRICARE-eligible employees to use TRICARE over their own coverage. Despite efforts to control costs, the Department of Defense faces challenges in managing TRICARE program expenses. The Department of Defense aims to control TRICARE program costs by increasing fees for retired service members, which surpass the growth in retired pay. However, these proposed cost hikes overlook the sacrifices made by career service members. Additionally, many healthcare providers are hesitant to accept TRICARE patients due to lower payments and unique administrative requirements. The Department of Defense plans to raise fees for TRICARE beneficiaries to save money, but this may deter many from using their military health benefits. They are also counting deposits to the Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund against their budget, impacting readiness needs and weapons programs. Public Law 108-375, section 725, aims to prevent large fee increases for TRICARE beneficiaries. Congress recognizes the Department of Defense's obligation to retired service members' health benefits and urges exploring cost-saving options that do not disadvantage beneficiaries. SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON INCREASES IN CERTAIN HEALTH COSTS FOR MEMBERS OF THE UNIFORMED SERVICES. Prohibition on increasing charges for medical care, pharmacy benefits program, and inpatient care for members of the uniformed services after December 31, 2005. After December 31, 2005, charges for inpatient care cannot exceed $535 per day. Premiums under TRICARE coverage for certain members in the Selected Reserve cannot be increased above the December 2005 amount."
