    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Job Creation through Energy Efficient Manufacturing Act\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2. The \"Job Creation through Energy Efficient Manufacturing Act\" aims to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies in manufacturing and industrial facilities across the United States. It establishes a program to provide financial support for businesses to invest in energy-saving measures and clean energy systems, as well as assisting building owners in implementing these technologies. The \"Job Creation through Energy Efficient Manufacturing Act\" helps building owners invest in energy-saving measures and systems to reduce costs, create savings, defer capital expenditures, and increase property value and sustainability. The \"Job Creation through Energy Efficient Manufacturing Act\" defines key terms such as \"covered program\" and \"Secretary\" and includes provisions for financing energy efficient manufacturing programs. The Secretary will establish the \"Financing Energy Efficient Manufacturing Program\" to provide grants to States for covered programs. States can apply for grants to expand these programs, which will be evaluated based on their potential to increase investment and energy savings in retrofit projects. The Secretary will consult with States and stakeholders to identify financing opportunities for manufacturing and industrial businesses across multiple states. States receiving grants should prioritize programs that leverage private funding and aim to expand energy efficiency. The Davis-Bacon Compliance section of the Act requires that all laborers and mechanics on funded projects be paid prevailing wages. The Secretary of Labor has the authority to enforce these labor standards. Section 3145 of title 40, United States Code requires states receiving grants under this Act to submit performance reports on covered programs within 2 years. States must also collect and share data from these programs in cooperation with the Secretary. The Secretary must include data collected from covered programs in the report submitted under Section 3145 of title 40, United States Code. Additionally, the Secretary is required to incorporate this data into Department of Energy databases while ensuring the protection of confidential business information. Authorization of Appropriations: $250,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated for this Act, to be available until expended. Funds allocated to States must be directed to the State energy office responsible for developing the State energy plan."
