    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Comprehensive National Mercury Monitoring Act\". Congress finds that mercury is a potent neurotoxin with significant ecological and public health concerns, primarily affecting those who consume contaminated fish, especially children and women of childbearing age. It is estimated that over 630,000 children born in the US each year are exposed to high levels of mercury in the womb, impacting neurological development. Additionally, 8% of women of childbearing age have blood mercury levels exceeding EPA safety values. As of 2006, 3,080 fish consumption advisories for mercury contamination have been issued in 48 States, with a 26% increase from 2004. These advisories cover over 22,000 square miles of lakes and 882,000 miles of rivers. Despite the importance of fish as a protein source, the extensive advisories highlight the health risks of mercury pollution. In many areas, mercury enters aquatic ecosystems through atmospheric emissions. The Environmental Protection Agency cosponsored a workshop in 2003 to quantify and document mercury changes in various environmental fields resulting from anticipated reductions in mercury emissions in the United States. The United States has implemented regulations to limit mercury emissions from various sources, but current monitoring programs are not effectively measuring the environmental benefits. A comprehensive, long-term mercury monitoring program has been proposed and documented in two sources: an article from 2005 and a book from 2008. The Office of Inspector General of the Environmental Protection Agency issued a report in 2006 highlighting the need for improved monitoring to assess the impact of EPA's Clean Air Mercury Rule on potential hotspots. The report emphasized the importance of field data to advance mercury science and detect health risks from 'utility-attributable hotspots'. The EPA was recommended to develop a mercury monitoring plan to evaluate the rule's impact on mercury deposition and fish tissue. The articles published in BioScience in 2007 identified 5 biological mercury hotspots and 9 areas of concern in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. They found high mercury deposition near a coal-fired utility in southern New Hampshire. The Environmental Protection Agency coconvened a workshop in 2008 with various experts to establish a national mercury monitoring program. Over 50 scientists participated and agreed on the program's goal and design elements. The Environmental Protection Agency coconvened a workshop in 2008 with experts to establish a national mercury monitoring program. The program aims to understand sources, consequences, and trends in US mercury pollution through intensive monitoring sites. The consortium emphasized the need for a comprehensive monitoring network to track changes in atmospheric deposition, ecosystem contamination, and bioaccumulation of mercury in fish and wildlife. Workshop findings are published in an EPA report (430-K-09-001). SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include terms like Administrator, Advisory Committee, Ancillary measure, Ecoregion, and Mercury export. The curr_chunk defines terms related to mercury monitoring, including mercury flux, program, and surface sediment. The curr_chunk focuses on the monitoring program related to mercury. The Administrator, in consultation with relevant federal agencies, shall establish a national mercury monitoring program to track trends in atmospheric mercury concentrations, deposition, and mercury levels in various ecosystems over time. The Administrator, in coordination with the Advisory Committee and federal agencies, will select monitoring sites in multiple ecoregions of the US, including national parks and wildlife refuges, to track emissions and ecological changes over time. The Administrator will establish standardized measurement protocols and a centralized database for environmental mercury data collection and distribution, aiming for reductions in domestic mercury emissions. Monitoring sites may be colocated with other long-term environmental monitoring programs. The program will monitor long-term changes in mercury levels in the air at selected locations, following established data assurance and quality standards. Measurements will be determined in consultation with various federal agencies. The program will monitor mercury deposition, flux, reemission, and sulfur species to understand mercury cycling through the ecosystem. Ancillary measures in water and soil chemistry will also be monitored for long-term changes in mercury levels. The program, led by the Director of the United States Geological Survey, will conduct various activities including extraction and analysis of soil and sediment cores, measuring mercury concentrations in water and sediments, and monitoring long-term changes in mercury levels in aquatic and terrestrial organisms at selected locations. The program, led by the Director of the United States Geological Survey, will conduct activities to measure mercury concentrations in various organisms, including zooplankton, fish, birds, and mammals. The \"Mercury Monitoring Advisory Committee\" will advise on the establishment and operation of a program to measure mercury concentrations in organisms. It will consist of scientists appointed by various federal agencies. SEC. 6. REPORTS AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE.\n\nThe Administrator must submit reports to Congress every 2 years on the program, including trend data. Every 4 years, the report must assess the reduction in mercury deposition rates needed to prevent adverse effects. All data obtained under this Act must be made available to the public. \n\nSEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2011 and 2012 includes funding for various agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, United States Geological Survey, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and National Park Service. For fiscal years 2013 to 2016, funding is allocated to agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, United States Geological Survey, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and National Park Service. Funding is allocated to agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, United States Geological Survey, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and National Park Service."
