    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Stepping Up to STEM Act of 2013\". Congress acknowledges the transformative impact of technology and the Internet on the global economy and daily life. It emphasizes the need for an education system that fosters critical thinking, collaboration, and problem-solving skills using technology. Access to quality digital learning resources and teachers who can effectively utilize them is crucial for promoting equality and equity in education. Effective learning technology implementations should address language arts, mathematics, and science challenges for all students. This requires partnerships among education agencies, researchers, and technology developers to harness technology effectively. It is essential to design innovations that include technology, good learning content, instructional strategies, teacher support, and data analysis for improved student outcomes. The common goal is to use technology for deeper learning opportunities for students who may not have access otherwise. The Department of Education is establishing an Office of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education, along with an Assistant Secretary for STEM Education. The Department of Education is creating the Office of STEM Education, overseen by the Assistant Secretary for STEM Education. The Assistant Secretary will advise the Secretary on STEM education matters, coordinate STEM activities across Federal agencies, and conduct evaluations of STEM programs every 5 years. The Department of Education will conduct evaluations of STEM education activities every 5 years to assess their impact on student participation in advanced placement and STEM degrees, exposure to STEM content outside of school hours, academic achievement in math and science, and the number of qualified STEM teachers. A report on the evaluation results will be submitted to the Department. The evaluation results will be submitted to various committees for review and authorization of appropriations for fiscal year 2014 and beyond. SEC. 4. ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS AGENCY FOR EDUCATION. Title II of the Department of Education Organization Act is amended to include a new section establishing an Advanced Research Projects Agency for Education. ARPA-ED is established in the Department for breakthrough research in educational technology, integrating STEM content areas, promoting advances in sciences for new learning technologies, and developing effective processes for their use. The ARPA-ED program focuses on developing, testing, and evaluating educational technology innovations, including data analytic tools for reporting under Federal mandates. It also aims to accelerate technological advances in areas where the private sector may struggle and encourages collaboration with nongovernmental entities for technology transfer and educational research. The ARPA-ED program aims to promote educational research using new technologies and data, coordinate efforts between agencies, work with the National Science Foundation's Cyber Learning Program, and authorize the Secretary to appoint a Director and establish processes for project development. The ARPA-ED program aims to promote educational research using new technologies and data, coordinate efforts between agencies, and award grants, contracts, and cash prizes for promising areas. It also requires independent evaluations of processes and individual projects for effectiveness. The ARPA-ED program focuses on promoting educational research with new technologies and data, coordinating efforts between agencies, and evaluating the effectiveness of individual projects. Information on effective practices and technologies developed with ARPA-ED support is disseminated through established educational centers and laboratories. The Secretary may use ARPA-ED funds for evaluations. Advisory committees for this section are exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Grants awarded under ARPA-ED should not duplicate activities of other federal programs. The Secretary may use ARPA-ED funds for evaluations and advisory committees for this section are exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Grants awarded under ARPA-ED should not duplicate activities of other federal programs. State networks and consortia on STEM education are established under Section 5. The Secretary of Education will provide grants to eligible networks to expand STEM education, which includes State-based STEM networks or similar organizations involving various stakeholders. These networks aim to enhance student achievement in STEM disciplines at schools, particularly for historically underrepresented students and rural schools. The grant program aims to increase quality afterschool STEM programs for underrepresented students. Eligible networks must submit an application and provide matching funds of at least 30% of the grant amount. Each eligible network receiving a grant under this section must provide matching funds of at least 30% of the grant amount. The funds are to be used for testing, sharing, and scaling up STEM education research and programs, identifying strengths and weaknesses in State STEM efforts, and implementing rigorous standards for STEM education from prekindergarten to grade 12. The grant recipients must match funds for STEM education programs, focusing on career and college ready standards, international standards, 21st-century skills, English language learners, special education students, and STEM literacy. They should develop innovative STEM assessments measuring interest, engagement, and proficiency, and support the implementation of assessments measuring career and college ready standards. Promoting rigorous STEM teacher programs in higher education, developing curriculum tools and professional development for STEM educators, creating STEM career pathways, and implementing expanded learning opportunities on school sites to enhance STEM education. Promoting programs to develop STEM content coaches and master educators to strengthen classroom competencies. Networks receiving grants must conduct evaluations on their effectiveness in STEM teaching and learning and submit reports to the Secretary. The Secretary may not endorse or approve any STEM curriculum for schools or require specific programs to be adopted. Grants under this section cannot exceed $20,000,000 in any fiscal year. Definitions for terms like \"elementary school\" and \"State educational agency\" are provided. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms such as \"high concentration of low-income students,\" \"institution of higher education,\" \"Secretary,\" \"State,\" and \"STEM,\" as outlined in various education acts. The curr_chunk defines \"STEM\" as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, and \"21st century readiness initiative\" as an initiative combining core academic subjects with critical skills to prepare students for postsecondary education and careers."
