    "content": "The Immigration Moratorium Act of 1994 establishes a 5-year immigration moratorium from October 1, 1994, to September 30, 1999. During the immigration moratorium, the worldwide level of family-sponsored immigrants is set at 325,000 for a fiscal year, with deductions for refugees, spouses and children of U.S. citizens, and certain employment-based immigrants. The worldwide level of employment-based immigrants for a fiscal year is 50,000, and the worldwide level of diversity immigrants for a fiscal year is zero. SEC. 4. ALLOTMENT OF VISAS. During the immigration moratorium, visas may be allotted under section 203 of the Immigration and Nationality Act as follows: spouses and unmarried children of permanent resident aliens qualify for 40 percent of the worldwide level of family-sponsored immigrants, and visas for parents of U.S. citizens will be allotted in any fiscal year. In a fiscal year, parents of U.S. citizens will receive 60% of family-sponsored immigrant visas, while sons and daughters of U.S. citizens will receive 75% of available visas and sons and daughters of permanent resident aliens will receive 25%. The Act allocates visas to various categories of immigrants, including siblings of U.S. citizens over 21 years old, employment-based immigrants, and diversity immigrants. The number of visas allotted to each category is specified, with zero visas for certain groups. The Act does not limit the number of visas available to spouses and children of U.S. citizens under a specific section of the Immigration and Nationality Act. SEC. 5. GRANTING IMMIGRANT STATUS. During the immigration moratorium, the Attorney General may only accept petitions for classification under specific categories, such as spouses or children of U.S. citizens or permanent resident aliens, parents of U.S. citizens, and qualified immigrants with priority dates. During the immigration moratorium, petitions for classification under specific categories like spouses or children of U.S. citizens or permanent resident aliens will be accepted. Petitions not meeting these criteria will be returned to the filers. During the immigration moratorium, the annual admission of refugees is limited to 50,000. Immediate relatives are defined as children and spouses of U.S. citizens who have acquired citizenship. This Act will take effect upon enactment."
