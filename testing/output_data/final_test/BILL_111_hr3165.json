    "content": "The Wind Energy Research and Development Act of 2009 may be cited as the Wind Energy Research and Development Program. The Wind Energy Research and Development Act of 2009 establishes a program for research and development to improve wind turbine efficiency, reliability, and capacity, optimize design for various atmospheric conditions, and reduce construction and maintenance costs. Research areas include new materials for rotor blades, gearbox performance, manufacturing cost reduction, and transportable towers over 100 meters. The Wind Energy Research and Development Act of 2009 aims to enhance wind turbine efficiency and reliability through various advancements such as low-cost transportable towers over 100 meters, advanced computational modeling tools, and advanced control systems with blade sensors for improved performance under different wind conditions. The Wind Energy Research and Development Act of 2009 focuses on improving wind turbine performance and reliability through advanced generators, offshore technology, radar mitigation, small-scale turbines, transmission scalability, and infrastructure optimization. The Wind Energy Research and Development Act of 2009 focuses on improving wind turbine performance and reliability through various research areas determined by the Secretary, including high voltage transmission and other research areas. The Wind Energy Research and Development Act of 2009 focuses on improving wind turbine performance and reliability through various research areas determined by the Secretary, including high voltage transmission and other research areas. Additionally, the act includes a Wind Energy Demonstration Program. The Wind Energy Research and Development Act of 2009 includes a Wind Energy Demonstration Program conducted by the Secretary of Energy to measure wind energy system performance across diverse geographic areas in the United States. Collaboration with industry and academic institutions is required for demonstration projects, and data collected must be useful for program implementation. Cost-sharing is also mandated in compliance with specific sections. The curr_chunk states compliance with sections 988(a)-(d) and 989 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. SEC. 4. EQUAL OPPORTUNITY: The Secretary of Energy must coordinate with specific offices and give preference to applications from certain groups. SEC. 5. COMPETITIVE AWARDS: Awards will be based on technical merit. SEC. 6. COORDINATION: The Secretary must coordinate activities to avoid duplication. SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. $200,000,000 authorized for the Secretary of Energy for fiscal years 2010-2014."
