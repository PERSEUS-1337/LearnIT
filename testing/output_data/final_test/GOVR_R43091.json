    "content": "Since 2007, U.S. Congress has addressed state courts using military service in child custody cases. Servicemembers raised concerns about their deployment affecting custody decisions. Military members with dependents must have contingency plans for deployments that may separate them from their children. The proposed legislation aims to prevent custody battles involving military parents deployed for duty. It seeks to ensure that deployment does not influence child custody decisions, balancing federal responsibility for servicemembers' rights with state jurisdiction over custody matters. The proposed military child custody legislation, H.R. 1898, aims to address custody issues for servicemembers deployed for duty, balancing federal interests with state jurisdiction over domestic relations matters. The potential impact on military children and servicemembers' ability to serve their country is a primary concern, especially regarding child custody decisions based on deployments. Approximately 142,000 Armed Forces members are single custodians of minor children, with complex situations arising when servicemembers deploy without custody orders. The question of care for children during deployments or military obligations is a significant issue. The question of child custody during military deployments is traditionally handled by state courts, but there are calls for federal legislation to create a national standard. Proponents argue that inconsistent state laws can complicate custody matters for military parents, while opponents raise concerns about the impact of such legislation. Opponents argue that federal legislation for military child custody cases would infringe on states' rights in family law matters and prioritize servicemembers' legal rights over the best interest of the child. Congressional interest in this issue stems from its authority to regulate the armed forces. Courts potentially using military service in child custody cases first caught the attention of Representative Michael R. Turner of Ohio through the case of Kentucky National Guard Lieutenant Eva Slusher. Lt. Slusher temporarily lost custody of her daughter to her ex-husband after serving on active duty. Some Members of Congress have proposed amendments to the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to establish a national standard for child custody cases involving military custodians. The proposed legislation H.R. 1898 aims to protect child custodians in military service by reinstating custody orders after deployment, prohibiting courts from using deployment as the sole factor in custody decisions, and clarifying that it does not create federal jurisdiction. The proposed legislation H.R. 1898 aims to protect child custodians in military service by reinstating custody orders after deployment and prohibiting courts from using deployment as the sole factor in custody decisions. If State laws provide higher protection to deploying servicemembers' parental rights, the court must apply the higher State standard. However, concerns in the Senate exist over preempting State laws on child custody issues. The only current federal protection for single-parent servicemembers in custody disputes is the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. The Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act (SCRA) aims to protect servicemembers during military service by suspending judicial and administrative proceedings that may affect their civil rights. The SCRA was amended in the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act to clarify its applicability to child custody cases. Judges are required to grant a stay of proceedings in child custody cases involving servicemembers. The SCRA mandates a stay of legal proceedings, including child custody cases, for the first 90 days after a servicemember's deployment. Additional stays can be requested based on the ongoing impact of military duty on participation. However, courts have discretion in granting these stays, often prioritizing resolving custody issues for the best interest of the children. Critics argue that the SCRA falls short in protecting servicemembers' rights in child custody matters. Proponents argue that the SCRA does not prevent courts from considering a servicemember's military service in custody determinations and lacks guidance on temporary custody arrangements. Opponents believe the SCRA aligns military parents' protection with state laws without federal intervention. William T. Robinson III of the American Bar Association stated that the SCRA delays permanent changes in parental rights until after a servicemember's return. The SCRA applies to various cases, including custody over an incapacitated adult and cases without an original custody order. The DOD raised concerns about judges not following the SCRA in high-visibility child custody cases. The debate revolves around protecting servicemembers' rights. The debate centers on the conflict between protecting servicemembers' rights in child custody cases, which is seen as a federal responsibility, and state jurisdiction over custody issues. Proponents argue for federal legislation to establish a national standard for military child custody cases, citing inconsistencies in state laws that could disadvantage servicemembers. State laws allow ex-spouses to venue shop for custody agreements, especially in servicemember cases involving multiple states. Proponents advocate for federal legislation to create a national standard for military child custody cases, aiming to resolve state inconsistencies and enhance military readiness. Opponents argue that child custody is a state matter. The American Bar Association highlighted the federalization concern in a 2011 white paper on military child custody. The American Bar Association opposes federal legislation to federalize child custody laws, arguing that states have the expertise to handle such matters and that a single national standard would not be appropriate due to the unique nature of each case. The American Bar Association opposes federal legislation to federalize child custody laws, arguing that states have the expertise to handle such matters and that a single national standard would not be appropriate due to the unique nature of each case. Critics argue against federal involvement in child custody cases, stating that it would lead to federal court intervention, increased costs, delays, and uncertainty for all parties involved. They also highlight the issue of residency requirements that limit venue shopping or multiple jurisdiction venues. Both sides agree that no court should show bias. When courts make child custody determinations, the ultimate criteria is usually cited as \"the best interest of the child.\" This includes considering the wishes of the parents and child, relationships with family members, comfort in home and community, and the mental and physical health of all involved individuals. The best interest of the child is the ultimate criteria in child custody decisions, considering various factors such as relationships, home environment, and mental/physical health. While deployments are not the sole factor in custody decisions, they are considered by courts as part of the analysis. Supporters of federal legislation argue for a standard to prevent courts from using deployment against servicemembers in custody cases, while opponents cite a DOD study showing deployments are not the primary reason for custody loss. Opponents argue against federal child custody legislation, stating that deployment is not the sole factor in custody decisions and that the best interest of the child should be the ultimate determinant. They believe enacting such legislation would prioritize servicemembers' rights over those of the child. Additionally, they argue that the proposed legislation could allow losers of military child custody cases at the state level to seek better outcomes in federal court. The American Bar Association believes that the language in the legislative proposal H.R. 1898 may not prevent federal court involvement in military child custody cases, as federal jurisdiction can be invoked to vindicate rights claimed under federal statute. H.R. 1898 could result in federal court intervention in military child custody cases, potentially prolonging litigation as a federal judge decides whether to keep the case or send it back to state court. Despite previous bipartisan support for child custody legislation in the House, the bill does not explicitly prohibit removal to federal court. In the Senate, federal child custody bills have not advanced since 2008 due to concerns about federal intrusion in state matters and the belief that the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act already protects military personnel in custody disputes. Senator John McCain emphasized the traditional state jurisdiction over child custody laws and urged caution in preempting state approaches with federal legislation. Senator John McCain emphasized the historical federal deference to State legislatures in child custody issues and expressed concerns about preempting state approaches with federal legislation. Opposition to the proposed legislation has been raised by the Senate Veterans' Committee and the American Bar Association, who have cited the importance of acquiring more data before making any decisions on the matter. The Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) supported a House recommendation for a report on child custody disputes involving deployed military members, emphasizing the need for more data before federal intervention. The Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) supported a House recommendation for a report on child custody disputes involving deployed military members, emphasizing the need for more data before federal intervention. The SASC report expressed apprehension towards federal child custody legislation, preferring to focus on personal responsibility of servicemembers and the DOD's oversight in preparing effective family care plans. The Senate's version of the 2009 National Defense Authorization Act highlighted the importance of properly prepared Family Care Plans for military readiness. Family Care Plans are crucial for military readiness by minimizing strain on Armed Forces members with child custody arrangements during deployments. These plans, while not legally binding, help in coordinating care for dependents and reducing legal difficulties. The Family Care Plan is a crucial tool for servicemembers and their ex-spouses to plan for the care of dependents during deployments. Properly drafted plans can be used as evidence in custody disputes. The Senate committee recommended obtaining the views of the Council of Governors on legislative proposals related to Family Care Plans. The Senate committee sought input from the Council of Governors on legislative proposals regarding child custody disputes involving deployed service members, emphasizing the importance of state laws in domestic relations matters. The committee expressed concerns about preemptive federal legislation that could impact existing procedural protections under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act and state laws. The Senate committee recommended that State Governors should have the opportunity to express their views on federal child custody legislation before any congressional action is taken. The Department of Defense has generally opposed federal child custody legislation, except for a brief period in early 2011 when then Secretary Gates showed a change of heart. Former Secretary Gates had previously expressed DOD's opposition to federal child custody legislation in a letter to Representative Turner in 2009. In response to a letter from Representative Turner, the Department of Defense reviewed state laws on child custody protections for Service members. They found that some level of protection exists in about 28 states, but the approaches vary widely. Secretary Gates acknowledged the need for steps to ensure Service members' protection in child custody cases. The Department of Defense is taking steps to address child custody cases in the military, including contacting governors of states without legislation, including custody concerns in key quality of life issues, improving liaison efforts, and working with legal officials to develop strategies for states with large military populations. The Department of Defense is working with the American Bar Association to provide free legal representation for Service members in child custody cases. They are also updating Family Care Plans across the military services and believe these efforts can resolve issues better than new legislation. The Department opposes a proposal in the FY2010 Defense Authorization Bill that would disrupt State domestic schemes. The Department of Defense supports State legislation addressing parents in military service, recognizing the complexities of balancing servicemember interests with child welfare. They are updating Family Care Plan guidance to complement State efforts and oppose disrupting State laws with Federal oversight. The Department of Defense is updating its Family Care Plan guidance to align with State legislation regarding parents in military service. Despite the failure of Section 584 of H.R. 2647 in the Senate, the FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 111-84, Section 572) passed, requiring DOD to submit a report on child custody disputes involving deployed service members. The report, submitted to Congress in May 2010, analyzed 33 appellate cases since 2003 and concluded that military service does impact child custody disputes. The report concluded that no custody battle is decided by a single factor and there is no trend of servicemembers losing custody solely because of their military service. It emphasized that state legislatures are best suited to balance the interests of deploying servicemembers and the child, and federal legislation would be counter-productive. The Supreme Court has indicated that matters of child custody are best left to state courts. The vast majority of custody cases involving servicemembers and deployment allegations end in favor of the servicemembers after litigation. Legislation mandating custody outcomes based on a single factor is not recommended. State-level legislation is more effective in addressing child custody issues related to military service. The House Armed Services Committee expressed dissatisfaction with the Department of Defense's report on child custody cases involving deployed servicemembers. The report did not consider military service as a contributing factor in custody decisions, leading to concerns about the limited scope of the report. The committee emphasized the importance of early consultation with the non-custodial parent and the need for an appropriate Family Care Plan to minimize disruptions in custody arrangements during deployment. The House Armed Services Committee criticized the Department of Defense's report on child custody cases involving deployed servicemembers for not considering military service as a factor in custody decisions. The committee highlighted challenges in gathering data and concluded that there is insufficient information to determine the extent of servicemembers losing child custody due to their service. The House Armed Services Committee criticized the Department of Defense for not considering military service in child custody cases involving deployed servicemembers. Despite efforts to support service members facing custody issues, the committee still advocates for congressional legislation to protect them and their children. Outgoing Secretary Gates withdrew objections to federal child custody legislation without consulting Pentagon judge advocates. Since Secretary Gates' reversal in position and departure in July 2011, DOD support for federal child custody legislation has been uncertain. Former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta's stance on child custody legislation was also questioned. Former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta supported efforts on child custody legislation but raised concerns about the bill passed by the House, stating it needed a critical revision to prioritize the best interest of the child. Former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta emphasized the importance of prioritizing the best interest of the child in child custody cases. He suggested adding the words \"as the sole factor\" in the legislation to ensure flexibility for courts to make decisions in the child's best interest. The proposed language was included in H.R. 1898, but there have been no further updates from the Department of Defense since Panetta's letter to Representative Turner. The American Bar Association opposes federal child custody legislation, arguing it is the states' responsibility. They passed Resolution 106 in 2009, stating their position against federal intervention in custody cases involving military members. The American Bar Association opposes federal intervention in state child custody matters involving servicemember-parents and urges states to enact legislation prohibiting denial of child custody based solely on military deployment. The National Governors Association also opposes federal efforts to intervene in military family matters addressed by state law. The nation's governors oppose federal intervention in military family matters, stating that states have legislation in place to address challenges faced by deployed servicemembers and their families. Nearly 30 states have passed laws to support military families, and states work closely with the Department of Defense on child custody cases. Congressional intervention is deemed unnecessary and could have unintended consequences. The Adjutants General Association of the United States (AGAUS) opposes federal intervention in military family matters, stating that state laws and court-integrated social services are best for resolving domestic relations issues involving National Guard members. AGAUS urges Congress to reject legislative attempts to preempt state family law with federal legislation. AGAUS opposes federal intervention in military family matters and urges Congress to reject legislation that would infringe upon state sovereignty in child custody cases involving National Guard members. They also advocate for state laws to determine family law matters and custody based on the best interest of the child. The National Military Family Association (NMFA) supports Resolution 106, which prohibits custody changes or denials based solely on military deployment. They emphasize the importance of educating judges on the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to avoid confusion and support state laws determining custody based on the child's best interest. The Uniform Law Commission's Uniform Deployed Parents Visitation and Custody Act (UDPCVA) is recommended for adoption by all 50 states. The UDPCVA, approved in July 2012, addresses child custody and visitation issues when parents are deployed in military service. The Commission provides non-partisan draft legislation to standardize custody rights for deployed military parents. Attorney Eric Fish acknowledges state courts' struggles with these issues. The Uniform Law Commission's UDPCVA addresses child custody and visitation issues for deployed military parents. State courts struggle with jurisdiction, visitation rights for step-parents/grandparents, and custody arrangements. The Commission aims to provide states with standardized legislation based on best practices. They oppose federal intervention, citing family law as a state's rights issue. Mr. Fish argues that the UDPCVA maintains states' rights and protects service members without creating unnecessary federal complexity. Representative Turner disagrees, stating that his bill would only establish minimum protections for military parents without creating federal jurisdiction. He emphasizes that the bill allows courts to consider the best interests of the child without penalizing service members for their absence due to military service. According to data from the Congressional Research Service, 46 states have military child custody legislation in line with the Uniform Deployed Parents Custody and Visitation act. Alabama, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and New Mexico do not have current laws, with Massachusetts having pending legislation. The issue of military child custody continues to be a focus of legislative action until state courts stop using military service as the sole factor in custody decisions. The debate in Congress revolves around federal involvement in military child custody cases, with 46 states already having some form of legislation. The focus is on determining the best interest of the child/children in custody decisions. The debate in Congress revolves around federal involvement in military child custody cases, with a focus on determining the best interest of the child/children in custody decisions. H.R. 1898 aims to protect the child custody rights of deployed members of the Armed Forces by adding a new section to the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. The court will reinstate the custody order in effect before deployment, unless not in the child's best interest. Deployment cannot be the sole factor in custody decisions for servicemembers' children. No federal jurisdiction or right of action is created. In child custody proceedings involving a deploying servicemember, the court must uphold the higher State standard of protection for the parent's rights. Deployment is defined as a servicemember's movement to a location for 60 to 540 days without family members. The Child Custody Protection Act, H.R. 1898, and the Servicemember Family Protection Act, H.R. 4201, have undergone legislative efforts in Congress. H.R. 1898 was referred to the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs and the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity in the 113th Congress. H.R. 4201 was referred to the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs in the 112th Congress, with subsequent committee consideration and mark-up sessions. The House debated and passed H.R. 4201 on 5/30/2012 with a vote of 390-2. The bill was then sent to the Senate and referred to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.

The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) allows for the stay, postponement, or suspension of legal proceedings, orders, judgments, or decrees that may affect servicemembers' civil rights. This Act also provides protection to sureties, guarantors, endorsers, and other individuals who are liable on obligations or liabilities during military service. Additionally, judgments or decrees can be vacated or set aside for these individuals. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) provides protection to sureties, guarantors, endorsers, and other individuals liable on obligations during military service. A court may not enforce a bail bond when military service prevents the surety from obtaining the principal's attendance. Waivers of protections under the Act are allowed but invalidated upon entrance to military service. The SCRA provides protections to individuals liable on obligations during military service. Waivers of protections are allowed but become invalid upon entering military service. Citizens serving with allied forces are entitled to relief and protections similar to military service defined in the Act. The SCRA extends rights and protections to reserves and individuals ordered to report for military service or induction. Reservists are entitled to these protections from the date of the order until reporting for duty. Similarly, individuals ordered for induction under the Military Selective Service Act receive these rights from the date of the order until reporting for duty. The SCRA provides rights and protections to reserves and individuals ordered for military service or induction. These protections apply from the date of the order until reporting for duty. The SCRA also includes provisions for civil actions where the defendant does not appear, requiring the plaintiff to file an affidavit regarding the defendant's military service status. The SCRA includes provisions for civil actions where the defendant's military service status is uncertain. If the defendant is in military service, the court must appoint an attorney to represent them before entering a judgment. If the court cannot ascertain the defendant's military status from affidavits, the plaintiff may be required to file a bond before judgment is entered. Before entering judgment, the court may require the plaintiff to file a bond in an approved amount. If the defendant is later found to be in military service, the bond will indemnify them against any loss from the judgment. The bond remains until the time for appeal expires. The court can issue orders to protect the defendant's rights under the Act. The requirement for an affidavit may be satisfied by a written statement. A written statement, declaration, verification, or certificate must be provided in writing and certified as true under penalty of perjury. Making or using a false affidavit is punishable by fine or imprisonment. In cases involving a defendant in military service, the court may grant a stay of proceedings for 90 days if certain conditions are met. A stay of proceedings may be granted if counsel is unable to contact the defendant or determine if a meritorious defense exists. Section 202 procedures do not apply to stays under this section. Servicemembers can request a stay under section 202 if they receive notice of the action. Default judgments against servicemembers during their military service can be vacated or set aside upon application. Upon application by or on behalf of the servicemember, a judgment can be reopened if the servicemember was materially affected by military service in defending the action and has a valid defense. The application must be filed within 90 days of military service termination. Vacating a default judgment under this Act does not affect rights of a bona fide purchaser. Section 202 allows for a stay of proceedings in civil actions involving servicemembers who are in military service or within 90 days after termination of service, upon receiving notice of the action. The court can stay the action for at least 90 days upon application by the servicemember, with specific conditions to be met for the stay. The servicemember can apply for a stay of civil action by providing a letter explaining how military duty affects their ability to appear, a letter from their commanding officer confirming military duty prevents appearance, and stating that military leave is not authorized. This application does not waive any defenses and does not constitute an appearance for jurisdictional purposes. The servicemember can also apply for an additional stay based on continuing military duty affecting their ability to appear. The servicemember can apply for an additional stay of proceedings based on the ongoing impact of military duty on their ability to appear.
