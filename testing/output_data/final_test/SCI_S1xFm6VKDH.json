    "content": "Two main lines of research on visual reasoning are neural module network (NMN) with explicit multi-hop reasoning and monolithic network with implicit reasoning. NMN focuses on interpretability and compositionality, while the monolithic network prioritizes performance and model flexibility. The Meta Module Network (MMN) is a novel hybrid approach that efficiently utilizes a Meta Module for versatile functionalities while maintaining compositionality and interpretability. It parses input questions into functional programs using a Program Generator and translates functions into recipes with a Recipe Encoder. Instance Modules are dynamically instantiated based on these recipes, guided by a Teacher-Student framework. MMN leverages the meta module to enhance parameterization efficiency and uses recipes to specify functionality. In summary, MMN utilizes a meta module for parameterization efficiency and recipe encoding for generalization. It outperforms NMN and monolithic networks on the GQA benchmark, showcasing strong compositional reasoning abilities. Visual reasoning demands understanding and answering complex questions without prior exposure to similar compositions, a key aspect of human intelligence. NMNs were introduced to tackle such tasks by pre-defining functions, but MMN's approach shows significant improvements. The NMN approach involves pre-defining functions and encoding them into modules for complex reasoning tasks. However, as tasks become more complex, model complexity and scalability issues arise. In contrast, monolithic network architectures like MFB, BAN, DCN, and MCAN offer state-of-the-art solutions for visual reasoning. The black-box methods like MFB, BAN, DCN, and MCAN have outperformed the NMN approach on challenging image datasets like VQA. They use a unified neural network for general-purpose reasoning, which is more flexible and scalable. However, these models lack the ability to capture question compositionality and suffer from poorer generalizability compared to module networks. The Meta Module Network (MMN) proposes a flexible meta module that can take a function recipe as input and instantiate a child module to accomplish specific functionality. This approach allows for scalability to accommodate a larger set of functional semantics without adding complexity. The Meta Module Network (MMN) introduces module supervision to enforce designated functionality in different instance modules, disentangling tasks for high compositionality. Experiments on GQA benchmark show MMN outperforms NMN and monolithic network baselines. Visualization demonstrates MMN's inferential chain. The Meta Module Network (MMN) introduces module supervision for designated functionality in instance modules, outperforming NMN and monolithic network baselines on GQA benchmark. Visualization showcases MMN's inferential chain and its interpretability. Experiments demonstrate generalization ability to unseen functional semantics in a visual reasoning task. Architecture of the Coarse-to-fine Program Generator is depicted, utilizing a pre-trained object detection model for image extraction. The object detection model extracts regional features from an image and uses self-attention networks to encode the question and features. A cross-attention network refines visual features based on the question, which are then fed into the meta module for further processing. In programming languages, syntax rules and semantics define the functionality of programs through a set of functions with fixed arity. These functions are categorized based on abstract semantics and implemented with different realizations. A program is a sequence of function calls, each returning List of Objects, Boolean, or String values. In programming languages, functions with fixed arity define program functionality. A two-stage generation process is used to create syntactically plausible programs, ensuring plausibility and grammaticality. The execution graph for answer prediction is built by exploiting the dependency relationship between functions. In the fine-grained generation stage, syntactic constraints are enforced to achieve high execution accuracy. A Meta Module is designed to instantiate instance modules based on input function recipes, improving program synthesis efficiency. The Meta Module uses a recipe vector to transform into a \"geometric relation\" module for searching target objects. It incorporates neighbor modules and visual representation to produce the final output. The instantiation process involves feeding a function to instantiate the meta module into an instance module. The Meta Module Network instantiates the meta module into an instance module to build the execution graph dynamically. Each module outputs a message to neighbor modules, with the final output used for answer prediction through a softmax-based classifier. Training optimizes parameters in the Meta Module and Visual Encoder to maximize likelihood on training data. The shared parameter space of functions allows for joint optimization, giving Meta Module Network an edge over standard module networks. The Meta Module Network benefits from a shared parameter space for different functions, allowing for joint optimization. It can accommodate larger function semantics and has better generalization ability to unseen functions. Module Supervision involves extracting supervision signals from training data and adapting them during inference using a Teacher-Student framework. The Teacher-Student framework in the Meta Module Network involves a Symbolic Executor as the 'Teacher' guiding a 'Student' module during training. Knowledge transfer occurs by comparing execution results with object detection to train the Student for end-to-end model training. The Teacher-Student framework in the Meta Module Network involves a Symbolic Executor guiding a Student module during training by aligning predictions with a guideline distribution. The Meta Module Network incorporates KL divergence into the loss function with a balancing factor \u03b7. Experiments are conducted on the GQA v1.1 dataset, comparing with state-of-the-art methods and analyzing inferential chains. The GQA dataset contains 22M questions over 140K images, with a balanced-split of 1M questions for improved answer distribution. The GQA dataset contains 1M questions designed for multi-hop reasoning, increasing semantic complexity and visual understanding challenges. Evaluation metrics include accuracy, consistency, plausibility, and validity. Questions and function keywords are encoded with 300 dimensions, with a vocabulary size of 3761. Training starts with a 22M unbalanced \"all-split\" for bootstrapping. The study utilizes the GQA dataset for training and testing, with a focus on meta module mechanism and module-based approach. Experimental results show significant performance gains over previous models, including the VQA state-of-the-art monolithic model MCAN. The single model achieves competitive performance, tying with LXMERT pre-trained on large-scale datasets. The study focuses on the MMN model, which is self-contained and does not rely on external scene graph generation models. Ablation studies were conducted to analyze the contribution of different components in MMN, including module supervision, attention supervision, and bootstrapping in training. Results from ablation studies show that module supervision significantly improves MMN performance with fewer parameters. Increasing the value of \u03b7 also leads to accuracy improvement, highlighting the importance of module supervision. Directly supervising attention weights in Transformer heads only yields marginal improvement, indicating the effectiveness of implicit regularization in MMN. Bootstrapping is crucial for exploring more data and better regularizing reasoning modules, with the epoch size of bootstrapping influencing final model performance. Choosing the optimal epoch size for bootstrapping influences the final model performance. Visualization of inferential chains shows the model's interpretability. Quantitative analysis reveals a Recall@1 of 59% and Recall@2 of 73%, indicating the effectiveness of the model. The effectiveness of module supervision is demonstrated with significantly higher Recall@1 results compared to random guessing. Detailed analysis reveals bottlenecks in relation-type and object/attribute recognition functions, possibly due to limitations in visual features and network fine-tuning. Scene graph modeling is crucial for surpassing performance benchmarks. Additional experiments validate the generalization ability of the meta module. The meta module's ability to generalize to unseen functions is validated through additional experiments. The proposed MMN outperforms the standard NMN in handling unseen functions, showcasing its flexibility and extensibility in handling growing function sets. The zero-shot accuracy of the meta module demonstrates its generalization ability and validates the extensibility of the proposed recipe encoding. The MMN is more flexible and extensible for handling growing function sets under incremental learning. Monolithic networks for visual reasoning use attention mechanisms for multimodal fusion. Models like SAN, MAC, and MuRel enable multi-hop reasoning on complex questions but lack model interpretability and compositionality. Neural Module Networks excel in interpretability and compositionality by parsing questions into programs and executing them through dynamically composed neural modules. The MMN is a monolithic network that uses a Meta Module for program execution, similar to an LSTM cell in Recurrent Neural Network. It offers high interpretability and compositionality, ensuring strong empirical performance. GQA was introduced for real-world visual reasoning, with models like MAC network and language-conditioned graph neural networks. Meta Module Network (MMN) is a model designed for visual reasoning tasks, leveraging dense visual features and performing explicit multi-hop reasoning based on predicted programs for interpretability. It bridges the gap between monolithic networks like MAC network and language-conditioned graph neural networks, offering strong empirical performance. The Meta Module Network (MMN) bridges the gap between monolithic networks and traditional module networks by utilizing a Meta Module for specific functionalities. It outperforms baseline methods and achieves comparable performance to state of the art. Error analysis suggests that relation modeling over scene graphs could further enhance MMN performance. Future work includes incorporating scene graph prediction into the framework. Visual encoder, multi-head attention network, recipe embedder, and function statistics are illustrated and described in detail. The detailed function descriptions are provided in Figure 9, with more inferential chains visualized in Figure 10 and Figure 11."
