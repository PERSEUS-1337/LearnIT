    "content": "During the 1800s, the increase in reporters covering Congress led to the establishment of formal press galleries and rules to manage the Capitol press corps. Congressional reporters provided detailed accounts of proceedings, often transcribing floor debates and sending information to newspaper publishers outside the capital area. In the 1800s, formal press galleries were established in Congress to manage the Capitol press corps. Correspondents were allowed on chamber floors to hear proceedings, with designated reporters' gallery spaces by the mid-1800s. In 1877, a committee of correspondents was created to oversee press gallery membership. The Official Congressional Directory listed correspondents in 1880 and published press gallery rules in 1888. Separate galleries and committees exist for different types of press, with the ability to propose rule changes subject to approval. The congressional press galleries manage Capitol press corps, credential journalists, coordinate coverage for congressional events, distribute press releases, provide information on proceedings and legislation, and facilitate Member communications with journalists. They also oversee arrangements for daily press during presidential elections. The congressional press galleries oversee arrangements for daily press during presidential elections and presidential inaugurations. The autonomy of each press gallery and correspondents' committee is determined by responsibilities granted by the Speaker of the House and the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. Rules and practices are similar across galleries, with additional House and Senate chamber rules affecting press coverage of Congress. This report outlines general rules and authorities affecting press galleries and media coverage, followed by credentialing requirements shared by galleries. Key distinctions between daily press galleries are also highlighted. The congressional press galleries oversee arrangements for daily press during presidential elections and inaugurations. Key distinctions between the daily press galleries, periodical press galleries, radio and television galleries, and press photographers' gallery are discussed. Data comparing gallery composition over time is provided. The House and Senate press galleries operate under unified governing rules approved by the Speaker of the House and the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. The press galleries for the House and Senate are established separately, with each chamber having its own administrative staff. The Speaker of the House controls media access to the House of Representatives. The galleries may coordinate on certain matters, and responsibilities are shared between the chambers and correspondents' committees. In 1857, a press space was created in the House chamber above the Speaker's chair, allowing press gallery access. The press gallery was equipped with desks and seats for reporters. In 1939, rules were added for radio and wireless correspondents. Today, the Speaker regulates gallery admission for journalists according to House rules. The House press galleries are supervised by the Executive Committee of Correspondents and the Executive Committee of Radio and Television Correspondents' Galleries. The Senate granted floor privileges to local newspaper reporters in 1838 and reserved gallery seats for reporters in 1839. Initially, the vice president oversaw the Senate press gallery, but on March 12, 1873, the Senate made changes. The Senate press gallery was initially overseen by the vice president. In 1873, the Senate granted the Rules Committee jurisdiction over the gallery, providing one seat per newspaper and allowing a seat on the floor for Associated Press reporters. Rules were later amended to include reporters from various media. The Committee on Rules and Administration has the authority to make rules for the Senate floor and galleries, as well as for reporters' galleries and press facilities on the Senate side of the Capitol. The Senate press galleries are overseen by the Rules for Regulation of the Senate Wing, with the Sergeant at Arms responsible for maintaining order. Correspondents' committees, appointed by the Speaker of the House and the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, make decisions related to gallery operations to ensure consistency between the House and Senate galleries. The correspondents' committees oversee press credentials for various congressional press galleries, determining temporary or permanent access. They may suggest changes to gallery rules, subject to approval by the Speaker of the House and the Committee on Rules and Administration. Committee members must be in good standing with the gallery they oversee and are selected by fellow members. The correspondents' committees oversee press credentials for congressional press galleries, ensuring independence from direct congressional influence and maintaining journalistic integrity. Committee members must be in good standing with the gallery, selected by fellow members, and primarily employed as journalists. Gallery facilities are managed by nonpartisan staff hired by the House and Senate, reporting to respective administrative bodies. The press gallery rules regulate media coverage of Congress, addressing photography, broadcasting, and recording activities. Provisions in House and Senate rules aim to preserve decorum by prohibiting certain activities and electronic devices. Handheld devices have made it possible for non-reporters to capture and transmit visual/audio materials. The House and Senate galleries prohibit the use of cameras and electronic devices, including for accredited journalists. Rules allow for broadcasting of proceedings, with audio and video feeds available since the late 1970s. The House and Senate allow accredited journalists access to audio and video feeds for news or public affairs programs. The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 enabled this coverage, with live and archived video available on their websites. Press credentialing requirements are detailed in the Official Congressional Directory and press gallery websites. Press credentials for journalists are detailed in the Official Congressional Directory and press gallery websites. Journalists must apply for credentials at the start of each Congress, subject to approval by the Speaker of the House and the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. Temporary credentials may be available for those who do not meet all regular requirements. Press credentials for congressional galleries have consistent requirements for journalists, including being a correspondent in good standing, primarily employed as a journalist, not involved in lobbying, and not employed by the government. Additional requirements may be set by each gallery. Every four years, press credentials are also provided for presidential nominating conventions and inaugurations. The original House and Senate press galleries were established in the 1800s for daily printed press members. The daily press galleries for congressional correspondents have specific requirements for press credentials, overseen by the Standing Committee of Correspondents. The committee is comprised of elected members from the daily press gallery, with day-to-day operations managed by professional staff from each chamber. House press gallery offices are in H-315 - H-319, employing four staff, while Senate press gallery offices are in S-316, employing seven staff. The Senate press gallery offices in S-316 employ seven professional staff and serve as a liaison between the Standing Committee of Correspondents and journalists for accreditation decisions. Journalists in the daily press galleries must reside in Washington, DC. The periodical press galleries require correspondents to regularly publish news material and have Washington coverage. The Executive Committee of Correspondents oversees the periodical press galleries. The Executive Committee of Correspondents oversees the periodical press galleries, which are elected every two years by members. Credentialing responsibilities rotate between House and Senate galleries every four years. House gallery is in H-304 with four staff, Senate gallery in S-320 with three staff. Radio and television galleries provide credentials for broadcast media, with decisions made by the Executive Committee of the Radio and Television Correspondents' Galleries. The Executive Committee oversees the periodical press galleries and manages credentialing for broadcast media. Radio/TV galleries provide assistance to journalists and Members of Congress, including managing reservations for press conferences and providing media logistics and security. The House radio/TV gallery is located in H-320 and employs seven professional staff. The House radio/TV gallery manages reservation requests for Members' press conferences at the \"House Triangle\" and provides information about other press conference locations suitable for radio or television coverage. Members may host press conferences in the House radio/TV gallery's Capitol Visitor Center studios upon invitation of an accredited journalist. Other locations throughout the Capitol may be used by Members for broadcast media events, but are not managed by the House radio and television gallery. Gallery staff can assist Members with logistics for events in these locations. The Senate radio and television gallery, located in S-325, assists Senators with logistics for press conferences at the \"Senate Swamp\" and other suitable locations. Senators can host press conferences in the Capitol Visitor Center studio upon invitation of an accredited journalist. The Senate studio is also available for exclusive interviews with Senators. Other Capitol locations for broadcast media events can be used by Senators, such as committee rooms by contacting the relevant committee. Rooms in the Capitol Visitor Center, including SVC-200/201, are also available for events. The Press Photographers' Gallery provides credentials for news photographers and assists in facilitating photographic coverage of the House and the Senate. The photo gallery offices are located on the Senate side of the Capitol, in S-317, and employ three professional staff. Requirements for press photography credentials are found in Senate Rule XXXIII. The Standing Committee of Press Photographers is a six-member board responsible for the administration of the photographers' gallery. The Press Photographers' Gallery administers the gallery and elects standing committee members annually. Rules specify committee composition, reflecting changes in the news media environment. Data on gallery membership changes from 1975 to 2015 may inform press gallery rules. Between the 94th and the 114th Congresses, the number of accredited congressional journalists more than doubled, growing from 2,588 in 1975 to 6,016 in 2015. This increase suggests that more journalists have access to Congress today than in the past. The number of accredited correspondents covering Congress has increased significantly from 2,588 in 1975 to 6,016 in 2015. This growth may reflect industry trends such as consolidation of media outlets. The proportion of journalists holding credentials from different galleries has also shifted over time, with radio/TV correspondents seeing the most substantial increase. In the 114th Congress, 58% of congressional correspondents held radio/TV credentials, compared to 28% in the 94th Congress, reflecting the growth of video-based news. The House and Senate press galleries' structure has remained unchanged, with independent committees setting rules, professional staff managing operations, and authority retained by the House Speaker and Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. The congressional press galleries operate fairly autonomously with nonpartisan, professional personnel managing daily operations. The correspondents' committees, independent from Congress, make key decisions including journalist accreditation. The establishment of radio and television galleries in 1939 was a significant adaptation to changes in the news media environment. The Speaker of the House and the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration oversee gallery rules but the galleries run independently. The press galleries in Congress are overseen by independent correspondents' committees to maintain a boundary between the press and Members of Congress. This separation is believed to enhance media accountability and ensure press access without bias. The independence of these committees also safeguards against government interference in press freedom by allowing journalists to set and enforce their own rules. Press credentialing requirements and gallery rules establish and uphold journalistic standards for congressional coverage. Press credentialing requirements and gallery rules in Congress aim to establish and maintain journalistic standards for congressional reporters. These rules have origins dating back to the late 1800s, ensuring legitimate news reporters have access to Members of Congress while preventing lobbyists from posing as reporters. The rules prohibit accredited journalists from engaging in lobbying, paid advocacy, or advertising activities on behalf of any entity. Press credentialing requirements and gallery rules in Congress aim to establish and maintain journalistic standards for congressional reporters. Credentialed correspondents must be primarily employed as journalists to maintain impartiality. Questions have been raised about the sufficiency of disclosure requirements and enforcement by independent committees. Media outlets employing congressional correspondents must be editorially independent of entities lobbying the federal government. These rules ensure reporters are focused on news reporting and not seeking access for other purposes. Changes in how news is produced and distributed have led to revisions in the rules and facilities of the congressional press galleries. The addition of radio and television reporters prompted the creation of radio and television galleries in the House and Senate. The structure of the congressional press galleries has remained largely unchanged since then. New facilities were added in 2008 with the completion of the Capitol Visitor Center. Trends in the news industry may impact the composition of congressional press gallery membership. The evolution of news production and distribution has influenced the congressional press galleries, with concerns arising about the impact of media trends on gallery membership. Television, cable networks, media consolidation, and internet-based news are key factors that may affect the composition of journalists in the galleries and raise questions about potential conflicts of interest. Internet-based journalists applying to congressional press galleries must adhere to similar rules as traditional media journalists, despite the challenges of distinguishing between different media formats online. The ease of self-publishing on the Internet and the use of handheld devices for reporting news may blur the lines between professional journalists and non-journalists in the Capitol. These considerations are relevant for gallery requirements and broader chamber policies. Since the 1800s, changes have occurred in news production and distribution, but the structure of congressional press galleries has remained consistent. Credentialing requirements were established to prevent staff from acting as reporters and lobbyists from posing as reporters. The accreditation process now ensures access for credible journalists and news outlets, with an independent correspondents' committee overseeing congressional press credentials to safeguard against potential infringements on press freedom. The press galleries in Congress are overseen by the Speaker of the House and the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration to prevent infringement on press freedom. Administrative staff help insulate the galleries from political pressure. Resources allocated to the galleries have increased, but the number of credentialed correspondents, especially in the radio/TV galleries, continues to grow. This growth may impact resource allocation and distribution across the galleries. The current gallery divisions are based on distinctions between media types and publication schedules. The current gallery divisions in Congress, based on media types and publication schedules, may blur as multimedia journalists and Internet-based news are considered for accommodation by Congress."
