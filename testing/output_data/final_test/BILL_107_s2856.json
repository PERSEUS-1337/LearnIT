    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Colombian Temporary Protected Status Act of 2002\". Congress finds that Colombia has been in a 38-year civil war, resulting in the death of tens of thousands of civilians and combatants. The two main rebel groups, FARC and ELN, have engaged in military activities in 700 municipalities, controlling up to 50% of Colombian territory. They attack police, military, and civilians, committing massacres, killings, and forcing citizens into their ranks. Paramilitary groups like the AUC have become a significant military force in Colombia, responsible for numerous extrajudicial killings and forced disappearances since 1995. The FARC, ELN, and AUC, designated as foreign terrorist organizations, have a combined force of 25,000 combatants. The Colombian government, under President Andres Pastrana, has dealt with armed groups. The administration of President Andres Pastrana provided armed rebel groups, including the FARC, opportunities to negotiate a peace agreement. However, the FARC misused a safe haven to enhance its military capability and continued its violent campaign against the government and people of Colombia. Despite negotiations, the FARC kidnapped political officials and executed Members of Congress engaged in peace talks. After President Pastrana withdrew from peace negotiations with the FARC, violence escalated in Colombia. The FARC targeted mayors, urban areas saw increased killings, and rebel bombings became a daily occurrence. Senator Martha Catalina Daniels was involved in negotiations with the FARC. Since President Pastrana withdrew from peace talks with the FARC, violence in Colombia has escalated. The FARC has targeted mayors, urban areas have seen a rise in killings, and bombings are frequent. Additionally, the middle and upper classes are being kidnapped, with thousands abducted annually since 1998. Millions have been displaced, creating one of the world's largest internal refugee crises. In 2001, hundreds of Colombians were massacred in disputed rural regions. In light of the recent escalation of the civil war in Colombia, Congress believes Colombia qualifies for temporary protected status in the United States for Colombian nationals. In response to the civil war escalation in Colombia, Congress designates Colombia for temporary protected status under section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Colombian nationals meeting specific criteria are eligible for this designation for a period of one year. The Attorney General grants consent for temporary protected status aliens to travel abroad in emergency situations. Aliens returning to the United States with authorization will be treated the same as other returning aliens with temporary protected status."
