    "content": "The Defense Production Act of 1950 is being reauthorized until September 30, 2004. There is a focus on addressing resource shortfalls for radiation-hardened electronics. The President may take actions under the Defense Production Act to address the industrial resource shortfall for radiation-hardened electronics, with a limit of $200,000,000. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report on the domestic industrial base for radiation-hardened electronics to Congress within 6 months. The Department of Defense's plans for radiation-hardened electronics include projected requirements, intentions for the industrial base, and plans for using providers beyond current contractual arrangements. The Defense Production Act of 1950 is amended to clarify the President's authority to obtain information for industry studies. Additionally, there is a focus on critical infrastructure protection and restoration. Section 702 of the Defense Production Act of 1950 is amended to define critical infrastructure as vital systems and assets essential to national security. Additionally, there is a mention of critical infrastructure protection and restoration in paragraph 14. SEC. 6. REPORT ON CONTRACTING WITH MINORITY- AND WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESSES. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to the Senate and House committees within a year of the enactment of the Act on contracts with minority- and women-owned businesses under the Defense Production Act of 1950. The report should include details on the types of goods and services, dollar amounts of contracts, and ethnicity of the majority owners of such businesses. The Secretary of Defense is required to submit a report to Congress within a year on contracts with minority- and women-owned businesses under the Defense Production Act of 1950. The report should detail barriers in the contracting process, recommendations for legislative or administrative action to increase opportunities for these businesses, and definitions of \"women-owned business\" and \"minority-owned business.\" The term \"minority\" is defined in section 1204(c)(3) of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989. SEC. 7. COMMERCE RESPONSIBILITIES REGARDING CONSULTATION WITH FOREIGN NATIONS. Section 123(c) of the Defense Production Act Amendments of 1992 is amended to designate the Secretary of Commerce to lead negotiations with foreign nations to eliminate offset arrangements in defense procurement. An annual report on the negotiation results must be transmitted to Congress. The interagency team will submit recommendations to the Secretary of Defense for modifications to agreements related to contractual offsets or industrial participation arrangements. If a foreign country is pursuing such arrangements, notification will be sent to the USTR. The interagency team will recommend modifications to agreements on contractual offsets or industrial participation arrangements to the Secretary of Defense. If a foreign country requires compensation in nondefense or dual-use equipment exceeding defense supplies, the USTR will be notified, treating it as unjustifiable and taking appropriate action under the Trade Act of 1974. Additionally, a report on the effects of foreign contracts on domestic contractors will be submitted under the Defense Production Act of 1950. The amendment to (50 U.S.C. App. 2099(d)(1)) includes adding a new subparagraph (F) requiring a compilation of data on the impact of foreign contracts awarded through offsets on domestic contractors and subcontractors."
