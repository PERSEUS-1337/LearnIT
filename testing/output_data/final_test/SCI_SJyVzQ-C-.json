    "content": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a key architecture for language modeling and sequential prediction. Optimizing RNNs is challenging compared to feed-forward neural networks, but techniques like fraternal dropout have been proposed to address this issue. Fraternal dropout involves training two identical RNN copies with different dropout masks to encourage robust representations. This regularization technique is shown to be upper bounded by the expectation-linear dropout objective, which helps bridge the gap between training and inference phases. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results in sequence modeling tasks on benchmark datasets like Penn Treebank and Wikitext-2. It also shows significant performance improvement in image captioning (Microsoft COCO) and semi-supervised (CIFAR-10) tasks. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as LSTM and GRU are popular for tasks like language generation and translation but are harder to optimize due to challenges like variable length input sequences and dense embedding matrices. Batch normalization is applied to address these optimization challenges in RNNs. Regularization techniques for RNNs are an active area of research due to optimization challenges. Various methods like dropout, Variational dropout, DropConnect, and Zoneout have been proposed to address these challenges. Batch normalization and its variants have not been as successful in RNNs compared to feed-forward networks. In this paper, a regularization technique called fraternal dropout is proposed for LSTM networks. It involves minimizing prediction losses from two identical LSTM copies with different dropout masks and adding a regularization term based on the difference between their predictions. This regularization encourages predictions to be invariant to dropout masks and is related to other dropout techniques like expectation linear dropout and \u03a0-model. Regularization techniques like fraternal dropout for LSTM networks aim to minimize prediction losses by using different dropout masks. This method is related to expectation linear dropout, \u03a0-model, and activity regularization. Dropout is effective for densely connected layers to prevent overfitting, but there is a gap between training and inference phases due to linear activations. The goal is to have final predictions invariant to dropout masks. Fraternal dropout aims to minimize prediction variance by training neural networks to be invariant to dropout masks. The approach focuses on using different dropout masks with RNN models. This method is related to expectation linear dropout and helps prevent overfitting in densely connected layers. The authors propose a method to minimize prediction variance by explicitly minimizing the difference between predictions with and without dropout masks. This regularization objective is upper bounded by expectation-linear dropout regularization. This approach aims to prevent overfitting in densely connected layers. The authors propose a regularization method to improve performance in a semi-supervised setting by applying target loss on networks with dropout. Backpropagating target loss through both networks leads to faster convergence and better performance compared to applying it on only one network. This regularization is especially effective for weight dropout, as dropped weights do not get updated during training iterations. The authors propose a regularization method to improve performance in a semi-supervised setting by applying target loss on networks with dropout. Backpropagating target loss through both networks leads to faster convergence and better performance compared to applying it on only one network. This regularization is especially effective for weight dropout, as dropped weights do not get updated during training iterations. Additionally, they show that minimizing their regularizer is equivalent to minimizing the variance in model predictions and discuss the effects of target-based loss on both networks. Applying target loss on both networks leads to faster convergence. Temporal embedding is impractical in NLP due to memory constraints. Using a time-dependent weighting function in supervised learning is unnecessary. Our method is related to other semi-supervised works like BID20 and BID21, but we refer to BID8 for more details. Monte Carlo sampling of masks and averaging predictions during evaluation works for feed-forward networks but not for RNNs. In language modeling, we test our model on PTB and WT2 datasets using AWD-LSTM 3-layer architecture as the baseline model. The AWD-LSTM 3-layer architecture is used as the baseline model for language modeling on PTB and WT2 datasets. The model has 24 million parameters for PTB and 34 million for WT2 due to a larger vocabulary size. Fraternal dropout regularization is added on top of the baseline model to outperform existing methods. Most hyper-parameters remain unchanged from the baseline model. The hyper-parameters of the model were adjusted, including coefficients for AR and TAR, halving batch size due to increased memory usage, and altering the non-monotone interval for the optimizer. Grid search was conducted for the non-monotone interval, with similar results for larger values. The model was trained longer using ordinary SGD optimizer compared to the baseline model. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing benchmarks, with validation perplexity at 60.64 \u00b1 0.15 and test perplexity at 58.32 \u00b1 0.14. Experiments with fraternal dropout further improve performance. In the experiment, fraternal dropout is applied to improve performance in the WikiText-2 language modeling task, surpassing the current state-of-the-art. The experiment also includes applying fraternal dropout to an image captioning task using the show and tell model as a baseline. In the experiment, fraternal dropout is used to enhance performance in the WikiText-2 language modeling task and image captioning task with a pretrained ResNet-101. The focus is on the benefits of using fraternal dropout in RNNs, particularly with smaller \u03ba values for optimal results. Averaging gradients for different masks helps update weights more frequently, benefiting from fraternal dropout. The study also examines related methods like expectation linear dropout, \u03a0-model, and activity regularization. In Section 2, experiments compare ELD regularization with FD regularization and ELDM modification. Results show that FD and ELD have similar generalization, while baseline and ELDM perform worse. ELDM seems to have optimization issues. Comparison with \u03a0-model shows similarities in performance. Our approach outperforms \u03a0-model in language modeling tasks by converging faster due to back-propagating target loss through both networks. Key details include the use of LSTM and AWD-LSTM models, batch size of 64, truncated back-propagation with 35 time steps, and specific training parameters like learning rate adjustments and weight dropout. The experiment focused on evaluating the performance difference when backpropagating target loss through one network (\u03a0-model) versus both networks. Tuning a function instead of using a constant coefficient was found to be infeasible. The comparison was made on a semi-supervised task using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The experiment evaluated performance on a semi-supervised task using the CIFAR-10 dataset. They used 4k labeled and 41k unlabeled samples for training, 5k labeled for validation, and 10k labeled for testing. Grid search was done on \u03ba and dropout rates. Results showed that fraternal dropout performed similarly to \u03a0-model without using unlabeled data. BID16 authors studied the importance of activity regularization in LSTMs. In LSTMs, activity regularization (AR) and temporal activity regularization (TAR) are applied to the output activation. AR was implemented with a dropout mask in experiments, showing comparable performance to the \u03a0-model on altered CIFAR-10 data. Fraternal dropout outperformed traditional dropout when unlabeled data was not used. The method may be beneficial in data-limited scenarios. Ablation study on PTB word level modeling with single layer LSTM showed train and validation perplexity. Validation perplexity on PTB word level modeling with single layer LSTM is studied with various regularization techniques including temporal activity regularization (TAR), prediction regularization (PR), activity regularization (AR), and fraternal dropout (FD). FD shows faster convergence and better generalization compared to other regularizers. The regularization is applied on the pre-softmax output to rule out gains only from regularization. The best model is selected based on grid search results, and the regularization outperforms other methods in terms of convergence and generalization. Average hidden state activation decreases with the application of any regularizer. The importance of fine-tuning for AWD-LSTM 3-layer model is highlighted, showing reduced hidden state activation with regularization techniques. Fine-tuning is crucial for better results, with hyper-parameters affecting the learning process. Ablation study in Table 5 demonstrates the significance of fine-tuning in language modeling tasks. In an extensive grid search, experiments were conducted on an AWD-LSTM 3-layer model with fraternal dropout or expectation linear dropout regularizations. Over 400 experiments were run without fine-tuning on the PTB dataset, showing that both FD and ELD outperform the baseline model using AR and TAR regularizers. In this paper, a regularization method for RNNs called fraternal dropout is proposed, which reduces variance in model predictions across different dropout masks. The model achieves state-of-the-art results on language modeling tasks with faster convergence compared to other methods. Ablation studies are conducted to evaluate the model, showing its superiority over related methods. Fraternal dropout is a regularization method for RNNs that reduces variance in model predictions across different dropout masks. It outperforms related methods in language modeling tasks and converges faster. However, applying Monte Carlo sampling for evaluation in RNNs is not straightforward due to the complexities in generating output predictions. Fraternal dropout is a regularization method for RNNs that reduces variance in model predictions across different dropout masks. However, applying Monte Carlo sampling for evaluation in RNNs is complex due to the nonlinear nature of hidden states. Averaging predictions with different masks at each time step is time-consuming and may not guarantee accurate sequence generation. The use of fraternal dropout in RNNs aims to reduce variance in model predictions across different dropout masks. However, applying Monte Carlo sampling for evaluation in RNNs is complex due to the nonlinear nature of hidden states. Averaging predictions with different masks at each time step may not guarantee accurate sequence generation, but can be used to estimate the probability assigned by the model to a given sequence. Experiments on the PTB dataset using MC-eval showed results that are summarized in TAB10. The fraternal dropout method is compared with MC1, MC10, and MC50 models, showing that MC1 performs much worse. MC50 results are worse than the baseline, while MC10 is also evaluated. Fraternal dropout is believed to be more powerful in RNNs due to variance accumulation in predictions across time steps. In RNNs, variance in prediction accumulates among time steps due to shared parameters, leading to the use of the same \u03ba value at each step. Applying regularization on pre-softmax predictions or using the same \u03ba value for all layers can alleviate this issue. Best performing RNN architectures often use dropout, while feed-forward networks like ResNet architectures often do not use dropout at all. In image recognition tasks, experimenting with fraternal augmentation can improve performance even when dropout is not used. Fraternal dropout may be an alternative to Monte Carlo sampling for RNNs, addressing the gap between training and evaluation modes. When dropout benefits a given architecture, applying fraternal dropout should further enhance performance. By using fraternal dropout, one can ensure consistent predictions across different augmentations in neural networks."
