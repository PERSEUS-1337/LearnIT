The Budget Control Act of 1994 sets direct spending targets for fiscal years 1994 through 1997, excluding net interest and deposit insurance. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget must submit a report to Congress within 30 days of enactment, projecting these targets based on legislation in effect at that time. The Budget Control Act of 1994 sets direct spending targets for fiscal years 1994 through 1997, excluding net interest and deposit insurance. Direct spending targets shall be subsequently adjusted by the Director under section 6. The President must provide an annual review of direct spending and receipts in each budget submission, including information on adjusting spending targets, total program outlays, and federal receipt categories. Additionally, a special direct spending message must be provided by the President. The President must include a special direct spending message in the budget if actual outlays exceeded targets or are projected to exceed targets. The message should explain adjustments to targets, analyze spending variances, and provide recommendations to address overages. The President's recommendations to address direct spending overages may include proposed legislative changes to reduce outlays or increase revenues in order to recoup or eliminate the overage for the prior, current, and budget years. This may also involve recouping only part of the overage based on economic conditions or other specified reasons. The President's recommendations for addressing direct spending overages may involve proposed legislative changes to reduce outlays or increase revenues. This could include recouping part of the overage based on economic conditions or other specified reasons, with exceptions for certain programs like the Social Security Act. The President's recommendations for addressing direct spending overages may involve proposed legislative changes to reduce outlays or increase revenues. If the President recommends reductions, a special direct spending resolution will be implemented through reconciliation directives instructing committees to recommend changes in laws. If no reductions are recommended, a special resolution concurring with the President's recommendation of no legislative action will be included in the special direct spending message. After the President's special direct spending message is submitted, the required text shall be introduced as a concurrent resolution in the House of Representatives without substantive revision. If the chairman fails to do so, any Member of the House of Representatives may introduce the resolution after the tenth day. The resolution introduced under this paragraph shall be referred to the Committee on the Budget. SEC. 5. REQUIRED RESPONSE BY CONGRESS. The Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives must include a separate title in the concurrent resolution on the budget with reconciliation directives for committees to recommend changes in laws to reduce outlays or increase revenues by specified amounts. If no legislative changes are recommended to address an overage, a statement to that effect must be included. The Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives must include a separate title in the concurrent resolution on the budget with reconciliation directives for committees to recommend changes in laws to reduce outlays or increase revenues by specified amounts. If no legislative changes are recommended to address an overage, a statement to that effect shall be set forth in that title. If the resolution proposes to recoup or eliminate less than the entire overage, a resolution directing an increase in direct spending targets must be reported. Conference reports must fully address any overage. The House of Representatives must consider a conference report on the budget that addresses any overage through reconciliation directives. If the House Budget Committee fails to report a required resolution by April 15, it will be automatically discharged from further consideration. The President's recommendations are reflected in a concurrent resolution introduced as per section 4(c)(2), which will be placed on the calendar for consideration. Ten days after the House Budget Committee is discharged, any Member can move for the House to consider the resolution, which is a privileged and non-debatable motion. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 applies to special direct spending resolutions, resolutions increasing targets, and reconciliation legislation in the House and Senate. Limitation on Changes to the Social Security Act: Reconciliation legislation reported must not include any legislative changes to the Social Security Act. SEC. 6. ADJUSTMENTS TO DIRECT SPENDING TARGETS. Prior to the submission of the President's budget for fiscal years 1994 through 1997, the Director adjusts direct spending targets. This includes adjustments for increases in the number of beneficiaries under direct spending programs. The adjustment is based on the percentage change in the annual average number of beneficiaries for each program. The Director adjusts direct spending targets by calculating the percentage change in the annual average number of beneficiaries for each program and applying it to projected outlays. The results are then added to the direct spending targets in effect prior to the adjustment. The Director adjusts direct spending targets based on changes in program beneficiaries and projected outlays, with adjustments made for revenue legislation and congressional decisions. Adjustments are made to targets for current and future years. The Director adjusts direct spending targets based on changes in program beneficiaries and projected outlays, with adjustments made for revenue legislation and congressional decisions. Targets are increased for the current and budget years by the amount stated in the reconciliation bill, and decreased for the current, budget, and outyears through 1997 by reductions in direct spending. The Director also adjusts targets to reflect costs of emergency legislation designated by Congress and the President. SEC. 7. RELATIONSHIP TO BALANCED BUDGET AND EMERGENCY DEFICIT CONTROL ACT.\n\nLegislation reported under section 5 will not affect budget enforcement procedures under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n\nSEC. 8. ESTIMATING MARGIN.\n\nProcedures in sections 4 and 5 do not apply if the overage is less than one-half of 1 percent of the direct spending target for a fiscal year.\n\nSEC. 9. CONSIDERATION OF APPROPRIATION BILLS. SEC. 9. CONSIDERATION OF APPROPRIATION BILLS.\n\nIn the House of Representatives, it is not allowed to consider any general appropriation bill if the President has submitted a direct spending message until Congress adopts a budget resolution meeting certain requirements. Waiving this rule requires the adoption of a resolution. \n\nSEC. 10. MEANS-TESTED PROGRAMS.\n\nWhen making recommendations, the President and Congress should explore all alternatives before proposing cuts to means-tested programs.\n\nSEC. 11. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\nThis Act applies to direct spending targets for fiscal years 1994 through 1997 and expires at the end of fiscal year 1997. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 4604 on July 21, 1994, establishing direct spending targets."
