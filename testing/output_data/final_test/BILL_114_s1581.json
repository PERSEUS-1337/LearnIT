    "content": "The \"Clean Vehicle Corridors Act\" is the short title of this legislation. Congress finds that market uncertainties hinder the use of cleaner alternative energy resources in transportation, despite investor interest. Energy security and environmental benefits of American-made fuels are important, but imported petroleum is still widely used in on-road vehicles. Petroleum is still widely used as fuel in on-road vehicles, but cleaner alternative transportation fuels like natural gas, electricity, and biofuels can be cost-effective over time. However, the lack of refueling infrastructure hinders the sales of these vehicles. Developing infrastructure along designated routes is crucial to promote the use of cleaner alternative fuel vehicles and ensure commercial success without penalizing current users or early adopters. Developing infrastructure along Clean Vehicle Corridors will eliminate logistical barriers, provide cleaner refueling stations, attract more buyers to clean vehicles, and create new market outlets for clean fuel providers, increasing the likelihood of commercial success for alternative fuel vehicles. The purpose of developing infrastructure along Clean Vehicle Corridors is to eliminate logistical barriers, provide cleaner refueling stations, attract more buyers to clean vehicles, and create new market outlets for clean fuel providers, increasing the likelihood of commercial success for alternative fuel vehicles. The Act aims to provide market certainty for private and commercial capital investment in clean transportation, promote technologies for cleaner alternative fuels, and facilitate incentives to attract clean transportation vehicles and increase energy demands. The Act aims to increase energy demands, support job growth, reduce vehicle pollution, decrease foreign oil dependence, and promote innovation in transportation energy and technology. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"cleaner alternative fuels\" include compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas (propane), plug-in electric, advanced biofuels, hydrogen, and other fuels designated by the Secretary. \"Clean Cities\" refers to a voluntary public-private partnership managed by the Department of Energy to achieve goals in related legislation. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 define the term \"highways\" as roadways including the National Highway System, the Interstate Highway System, the National Truck Network, and other critical truck routes designated by the Federal Highway Administration. The term \"supporting infrastructure\" under the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act includes fueling or charging stations, rest stops, travel plazas, and service areas along Clean Vehicle Corridors. The Clean Vehicle Corridors Program is established under SEC. 5. The Clean Vehicle Corridors Program, established under SEC. 5, mandates the Secretary of Transportation to designate at least 5 \"Clean Vehicle Corridors\" within a year of the Act's enactment. Before making these designations, the Secretary must consult with the Secretary of Energy and obtain their approval. The Clean Vehicle Corridors Program requires the Secretary of Transportation to designate corridors after consulting with various government entities and gathering information from different organizations and individuals. Leveraging existing programs is also encouraged to achieve the Act's purposes. The Secretary of Transportation will encourage the addition of cleaner alternative fuel options and infrastructure along Clean Vehicle Corridors, giving preference to corridors connecting Clean Cities and considering air quality nonattainment areas. The Secretary may provide waivers for cleaner alternative fuel projects and vehicles along Clean Vehicle Corridors, including modifying lane and weight restrictions to accommodate vehicles using cleaner alternative fuels. The Clean Vehicle Corridor projects designated under subsection (a) are eligible for increased Federal funding share under MAP-21. Owners and operators of publicly owned infrastructure can designate parking spaces near major facilities for vehicles using cleaner alternative fuels. Cleaner alternative fueling infrastructure projects can be included in State energy conservation plans. The Secretary of Transportation maintains a website with information and resources for Clean Vehicle Corridors, including best practices for promoting cleaner alternative fuel use. Areas surrounding Clean Cities have priority for Department of Energy funding opportunities. The Secretary will identify mechanisms to promote cleaner alternative fuel infrastructure and post this information on a linked website. The Department of Energy collaborates with stakeholders to gather data on cleaner alternative fueling station usage patterns. Interstate compacts can be established by contiguous States to facilitate planning for necessary facilities. The Secretary, in consultation with other federal agencies, may provide technical assistance to interstate compact partnerships. This assistance does not limit federal laws or agency jurisdiction. Each compact established under subparagraph (A) must acknowledge that Congress can withdraw its consent every 3 years after the compact takes effect."
