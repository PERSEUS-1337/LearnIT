    "content": "Congress has shown renewed interest in Mexico, a key trade partner and energy supplier with strong ties to the United States. The two countries are economically interdependent, with Congress closely monitoring the renegotiation of NAFTA, resulting in the proposed USMCA. Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, in his fifth year of a six-year term, maintains a high approval rating despite challenges with rising insecurity and slow growth. Voters elected L\u00f3pez Obrador in a desire for change from traditional parties. L\u00f3pez Obrador was elected president of Mexico with 53% of the vote, leading to concerns about potential reversals of reforms. Pressure from various groups may limit his populist tendencies. Mexico has transitioned to a multiparty democracy over the past two decades. Key issues of congressional interest include security, foreign aid, human rights, trade, migration, energy, education, environment, and water. Since the 1990s, Mexico's presidential power has become more balanced with Congress and the Supreme Court. Presidents from the National Action Party struggled to enact reforms due to constraints on executive power. The Calder\u00f3n government focused on an aggressive anticrime strategy, leading to arrests and extraditions of drug kingpins but also resulting in organized crime-related violence. Despite security challenges, the government achieved economic stewardship during the global financial crisis, health care expansion, and efforts on climate change. In 2012, the PRI regained control of the presidency after 12 years. In 2012, the PRI regained control of the presidency with Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto's victory over L\u00f3pez Obrador. Pe\u00f1a Nieto shepherded structural reforms through a fragmented legislature with a \"Pact for Mexico\" agreement. The energy reform attracted $160 billion in investments from foreign oil and gas companies. Despite early success, Pe\u00f1a Nieto left office with low approval ratings. Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto faced extremely low approval ratings (20% in November 2018) due to record levels of homicides, moderate economic growth, and corruption. His reputation was further damaged by botched investigations and reports of benefiting from government contracts. Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador and his MORENA coalition won Mexico's presidential and legislative elections in 2018. Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, former mayor of Mexico City, established the leftist party MORENA after leaving the PRD. In the 2018 elections, he won with 53.2% of the vote, defeating his closest rival Ricardo Anaya. L\u00f3pez Obrador's victory in 31 of 32 states marked a significant shift in Mexico's political landscape. In the 2018 Mexican elections, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador's victory with 53.2% of the vote signaled a significant change in the country's political scene. The results also led to internal struggles within traditional parties like the PAN and highlighted voter frustration with the PRI. MORENA's coalition secured solid majorities in both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, with the ruling coalition currently controlling 70 out of 128 Senate seats and 316 out of 500 Chamber seats. The MORENA coalition, led by L\u00f3pez Obrador, lacks the two-thirds majority needed for constitutional changes. Despite a mandate for policy change, opposition may arise if power dynamics between federal and state offices are altered. L\u00f3pez Obrador's proposal for federal representatives in each state faced resistance from governors. MORENA and allies control four governorships, including Mexico City. L\u00f3pez Obrador aims to govern differently from previous administrations, focusing on corruption, poverty, inequality, and crime. L\u00f3pez Obrador aims to address voters' concerns about corruption, poverty, and inequality, as well as escalating crime and violence. Despite some advisers endorsing progressive social policies, he personally opposes abortion and gay marriage. He has set high expectations for his government, promising conflicting goals such as a \"fourth transformation\" for Mexico. Observers question the attainability of his ambitious goals due to existing fiscal constraints. President L\u00f3pez Obrador's popular politics include daily press conferences, salary cuts, and social programs like youth scholarships and pensions. Despite criticism from investors, his government's policies, such as infrastructure investments in southern Mexico, have garnered public support. Investors have criticized some of President L\u00f3pez Obrador's actions, including canceling a $13 billion airport project and halting new energy contracts. However, they were somewhat reassured by the administration's austere budget and support for existing energy contracts. The Congress has enacted labor reforms to comply with USMCA commitments, but the fate of education reforms from 2013 remains uncertain. President L\u00f3pez Obrador has faced opposition to his efforts to raise education standards, with critics accusing him of cutting funding for oversight agencies and dismissing data on organized crime-related violence as \"fake news.\" The escalating violence in Mexico, fueled by U.S. drug demand and smuggling, remains a significant challenge. Organized crime-related homicides in Mexico increased in 2015 and 2016, reaching record levels in 2017. Over 150 politicians were killed during the 2018 campaign. The homicide rate continued to rise in 2018 and the first three months of 2019 due to intensified fighting among criminal organizations. The Jalisco New Generation cartel's rise led to increased infighting among criminal groups. The extradition of \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n in 2017 sparked succession battles within the Sinaloa Cartel, allowing other groups like the CJNG to challenge its dominance. Criminal organizations in Mexico are competing to meet the rising demand for heroin and opioids in the United States. Additionally, these groups are diversifying away from drug trafficking, leading to further expansion. Organized crime in Mexico is diversifying away from drug trafficking into activities like oil theft, alien smuggling, kidnapping, and human trafficking. Fuel theft has become a national security threat, costing Mexico up to $1 billion annually and leading to violent conflicts with the army. The government's reactive approach of deploying federal forces has resulted in human rights abuses. Top criminal leaders are being targeted, with security forces killing or detaining at least 110 out of 122 as of August 2018. As of August 2018, security forces had killed or detained 110 out of 122 high-value targets identified by the Pe\u00f1a Nieto government. In August 2018, a new bilateral effort was announced between the Mexican government and the U.S. DEA to arrest the leader of the CJNG. President L\u00f3pez Obrador faces pressure to refine his security strategy amidst historic levels of violence and high-profile massacres. His priorities include anticorruption initiatives, social investments, human rights, drug policy reform, and transitional justice for nonviolent criminals. Mexico's security strategy for 2018-2024 focuses on addressing socioeconomic drivers of violent crime, including providing scholarships to youth and decriminalizing marijuana production. President L\u00f3pez Obrador has pushed for constitutional reforms to allow military involvement in public security for five more years and established an 80,000-strong National Guard to combat crime, despite criticism from human rights groups. After criticism from human rights groups, the Congress modified L\u00f3pez Obrador's proposal to ensure the National Guard will be under civilian command. Corruption is a major issue in Mexico, with 84% of Mexicans identifying it as a pressing challenge. The costs of corruption in Mexico reportedly reach up to 5% of GDP annually. Mexico has fallen 33 places in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index from 2012 to 2018. Several current or former governors, including some from the PRI, are under investigation for corruption and collusion with organized crime groups. A case against the chair of Pe\u00f1a Nieto's 2012 campaign for receiving bribes from Odebrecht stalled after the prosecutor was fired. Mexico implemented constitutional reforms in 2008 to transition to an adversarial public trial system for criminal cases, aiming for transparency and efficiency. However, progress in corruption cases, like the Odebrecht scandal, has been slow under L\u00f3pez Obrador's government. Mexico transitioned to an adversarial public trial system for criminal cases in 2008, aiming for transparency and efficiency. Despite meeting the 2016 deadline for adopting the new system, implementation issues led to public backlash as criminals were released due to flawed investigations and weak cases. The new system improved courtroom infrastructure and case resolution but requires additional training for police and prosecutors to address persistently high levels of impunity. Reforming the Attorney General's Office in Mexico is crucial for strengthening the legal system. Analysts highlight the inefficiency of the current office due to limited resources, corruption, and a lack of political will. Civil society groups advocate for creating an independent prosecutor's office to replace the current system. The need for additional training for police and prosecutors is emphasized to address high levels of impunity. It remains uncertain if L\u00f3pez Obrador will allocate the necessary resources for these reforms. In 2014, Mexico's Senate established the new prosecutor general's office, appointing Dr. Alejandro Gertz Manero as Prosecutor General in January 2019. Concerns have been raised about his independence due to his ties to President L\u00f3pez Obrador. Gertz Manero is tasked with addressing electoral fraud and corruption as grave crimes during his nine-year term. The proposal to expand the list of grave crimes for mandatory pretrial detention, including corruption and electoral fraud, was passed by the Senate in December and the lower chamber in February 2019. Critics, such as the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, argue that this violates the presumption of innocence. The president supported the outcome despite opposition. The National Anticorruption System was fully implemented in July 2016, giving investigative and prosecutorial powers to a civilian board of directors and increasing penalties for corruption. The National Anticorruption System was fully implemented in July 2016, giving powers to a civilian board of directors and increasing penalties for corruption. However, federal implementation lagged during the Pe\u00f1a Nieto government, and state-level implementation varied. President L\u00f3pez Obrador has not prioritized implementing the system, despite naming a special anticorruption prosecutor in February 2019. Many states have not fulfilled requirements for establishing a local NAS. The Mexican government has failed to adequately address serious human rights violations committed by criminal groups and state actors, including extrajudicial killings. Despite efforts to establish a National Anticorruption System, implementation has been lacking at both federal and state levels. Critics argue that the government has not done enough to protect journalists, human rights defenders, migrants, and other vulnerable groups. Since 2006, over 37,000 people remain missing in Mexico, with high rates of disappearances in states along the U.S.-Mexico border. The National Human Rights Commission found over 3,900 bodies in clandestine graves since 2007. Despite a law against torture enacted in 2017, the UN Committee against Torture noted widespread torture by state agents in Mexico, with impunity for the crime. Only 4.6% of torture investigations led to convictions. President L\u00f3pez Obrador's efforts to address human rights were recognized by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. President L\u00f3pez Obrador's efforts to prioritize human rights were praised by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet. She commended the government's actions to seek justice, provide reparations to victims, and prevent human rights violations. Bachelet also acknowledged the establishment of the Presidential Commission for Truth and Access to Justice for the Ayotzinapa case, as well as broader initiatives to address disappearances in Mexico. International concerns have been raised about the safety of journalists in the country, with Mexico being identified as one of the most dangerous places for journalists to work. Mexico is one of the most dangerous countries for journalists, with 120 media workers killed from 2000 to 2018. The Committee to Protect Journalists estimates 41 journalist deaths since 2000. Mexico also ranks in the top 10 for unsolved journalist murders. Additionally, 17 journalists and human rights defenders were killed in the first three months of L\u00f3pez Obrador's government. During his term, President Pe\u00f1a Nieto prioritized promoting trade and investment in Mexico, participated in U.N. peacekeeping efforts, and spoke out against the deterioration of democracy in Venezuela. He also strengthened ties with China, negotiated the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, and continued to engage in international partnerships even after the U.S. withdrawal. Mexico, under President L\u00f3pez Obrador, has shifted towards a more noninterventionist foreign policy approach, focusing on domestic policy. The country has prioritized economic integration with the Pacific Alliance countries and the CPTPP agreement. Despite this, Mexico may still engage in global issues deemed important, but has reversed its active role in addressing the crisis in Venezuela. Mexico, under President L\u00f3pez Obrador, has shifted towards a noninterventionist foreign policy approach, prioritizing economic integration with the Pacific Alliance and CPTPP. Despite pressure, Mexico has not recognized Juan Guaid\u00f3 as Interim President of Venezuela. The country continues to support investment in the Northern Triangle countries and address the challenges of illegal immigration from Central America. Mexico has transitioned to an open market economy with numerous free trade agreements. Mexico has transitioned from a state-led economy to an open market economy with free trade agreements with 46 countries, including NAFTA. The country's exports now make up over 38% of its GDP, with automobiles, auto parts, and computer equipment being top exports to the U.S. Despite efforts to diversify, Mexico remains heavily reliant on the U.S. for exports, remittances, tourism, and investment. Mexico's economy heavily relies on the U.S. for exports, remittances, tourism, and investment. A U.S. withdrawal from NAFTA could cost Mexico low-skilled jobs and lower GDP growth. Remittances have surpassed oil exports as Mexico's largest foreign exchange source, reaching $33.0 billion in 2018. Despite a 2% growth in 2018, the economy may slow to 1.6% in 2019 due to factors like declining private investment and gasoline shortages.

Remittances have surpassed oil exports as Mexico's largest foreign exchange source, reaching $33.0 billion in 2018. Despite a 2% growth in 2018, the economy may slow to 1.6% in 2019 due to factors like declining private investment and gasoline shortages. The country revised its growth forecast for 2019 downward to a range of 1.1% to 2.1%. Investor sentiment and growth prospects could worsen if L\u00f3pez Obrador continues to promote government intervention and rely on popular referendums for economic decisions. The Mexican economy is closely tied to the U.S., and negative impacts from protectionist U.S. trade policies and a projected economic slowdown in 2020 could hurt Mexico's growth prospects. President Trump's threats to close the U.S.-Mexico border could have immediate and serious economic consequences.

President Trump's threats to close the U.S.-Mexico border could have immediate and serious economic consequences. Sound macroeconomic policies, a strong banking system, and structural reforms backed by a flexible line of credit with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have helped Mexico weather recent economic volatility. Nevertheless, the IMF has recommended additional steps to deal with potential external shocks. These steps include improving tax collection, reducing informality, reforming public administration, and improving governance. Over the past 30 years, Mexico has recorded a somewhat low average economic growth rate of 2.6%. Some factors\u2014such as plentiful natural resources, a young labor force, and proximity to markets in the United States\u2014have been counted on to help Mexico's economy grow faster in the future. Most economists maintain that those. Mexico's economy faces challenges such as corruption, weak regulatory framework, and education system deficiencies. Corruption costs the country $53 billion annually, hindering investment. The lack of skilled labor due to education system shortcomings also impacts industrial competitiveness. Low oil prices since 2014 have affected government revenue, making up 32% in 2017. Continued reforms are seen as crucial for future economic growth. Mexico's economy faces challenges including corruption, weak governance, and education system deficiencies. Low oil prices since 2014 have impacted government revenue, leading to budget cuts. The Pe\u00f1a Nieto government raised taxes to compensate for lost oil revenue, while the L\u00f3pez Obrador administration aims to maintain fiscal targets through budget cuts. Analysts suggest that Mexico needs to implement economic reforms and address issues like corruption and weak governance to achieve full economic growth potential. High poverty rates persist, especially in rural southern regions and among indigenous populations. Conditions in indigenous communities in Mexico have not significantly improved since the Zapatistas uprising in 1994. Many rely on remittances for basic needs due to high income inequality, with 64% of wealth held by the top 10% of the population. Factors contributing to this inequality include a regressive tax system, industry monopolies, low minimum wage, and ineffective social programs. The 2013-2014 reforms in Mexico aimed to boost formal-sector employment and productivity, particularly among small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to address income inequality and poverty. The reforms sought to increase access to credit for SMEs and incentivize their participation in the formal economy by offering insurance, retirement savings accounts, and home loans to those that register with the national tax agency. The Pe\u00f1a Nieto administration implemented social programs like federal pensions, an anti-hunger program, and a cash transfer program called Prospera. However, corruption within the Secretariat for Social Development affected the effectiveness of these programs. L\u00f3pez Obrador has proposed state-led economic development to rebuild Mexico's domestic market in his National Development Plan 2018-2024. In his National Development Plan 2018-2024, L\u00f3pez Obrador pledged to revitalize Pemex and build a \"Maya Train\" to boost tourism. He also announced a $25 billion investment in southern Mexico, along with potential U.S. investments, to create jobs and improve infrastructure. Social programs include increased payments for the elderly, financial assistance for disabled individuals, monthly payments for students, and paid apprenticeships for young people. The impact of these programs will be evaluated over time. While programs are underway, their scale and impacts will take time to evaluate. Concerns arise over decoupling monthly support to families with requirements for children to attend school and receive health checkups. Mexican-U.S. relations have grown closer over the past two decades, focusing on trade, energy production, combating illicit flows, and managing environmental resources. Bilateral talks and mechanisms have helped find common ground on issues like migration and water management. U.S. policy changes could trigger responses. Policy changes that go against Mexican interests may lead to responses from the Mexican government in areas where the US benefits from cooperation, such as combating illegal migration. Despite initial concerns, US-Mexico relations under the L\u00f3pez Obrador administration have remained friendly, but tensions have arisen over trade disputes, tariffs, immigration, border security, and Mexico's neutrality in the Venezuela crisis. The Mexican government has generally supported US migration and border security policies but has protested against policies causing extended border delays. President L\u00f3pez Obrador has also urged the US Congress to consider the USMCA. Mexico is a significant source and transit country for heroin, marijuana, and synthetic drugs destined for the United States. Mexican drug trafficking organizations pose the greatest crime threat to the United States, engaging in drug trafficking, money laundering, and other violent crimes. They traffic heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine, marijuana, and the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl. Mexico has been a recipient of U.S. counterdrug assistance for heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine, marijuana, and fentanyl. Cooperation between the two countries was limited in the past due to distrust and sensitivity, but resumed in 2007 with the M\u00e9rida Initiative focusing on strengthening Mexican institutions. In 2011, a revised strategy prioritized combating transnational criminal organizations through intelligence sharing and law enforcement operations. The M\u00e9rida Initiative, a U.S. counterdrug assistance program for Mexico, focuses on combating organized crime, improving border security, and addressing root causes of violence. Recent efforts include combating opioid production, improving border controls, and training forensic experts. However, despite these efforts, organized crime-related homicides in Mexico and opioid-related deaths in the U.S. have increased, raising questions about the effectiveness of the initiative. The future of the M\u00e9rida Initiative is uncertain, with some speculating that President L\u00f3pez Obrador may shift priorities. The future of the M\u00e9rida Initiative under President L\u00f3pez Obrador is uncertain. There are predictions that he may focus on anticorruption initiatives, social investments, human rights, and drug policy reform. Bipartisan support in Congress for the initiative has been strong, with increased funding provided in the FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Common interests with the U.S. include combating human rights violations, weapons trafficking, money laundering, and the fentanyl trade. The increased resources for the M\u00e9rida Initiative are primarily for addressing the flow of U.S.-bound opioids. The State Department is required to develop a strategy on international efforts to combat opioids, including in Mexico, and report on how the initiative is combating cocaine and methamphetamine flows. The Department of Defense is not playing a primary role in the initiative but is overseeing the procurement and delivery of equipment. Despite this, bilateral military cooperation with Mexico is increasing. Cooperation between the US and Mexico has been increasing, with DOD assistance supporting Mexico's efforts to improve security, track suspects, strengthen border security, and disrupt illicit flows. Various funding streams, including State Department appropriations and IMET funds, support DOD training and equipment programs in Mexico. DOD programs in Mexico are overseen by U.S. Northern Command. DOD counternarcotics support to Mexico totaled approximately $63.3 million in FY2018. Policymakers may want to receive periodic briefings on DOD efforts to ensure coordination with M\u00e9rida Initiative, compliance with U.S. vetting requirements, and avoiding reinforcing militarization of public security in Mexico. Extraditions during the Calder\u00f3n government were seen as a success indicator of the M\u00e9rida Initiative, with an average of 98 people extradited per year to the U.S. Extraditions fell to 54 in 2013 under President Pe\u00f1a Nieto but rose to 76 in 2016. The U.S. Congress has ongoing concerns about human rights conditions. The U.S. Congress has ongoing concerns about human rights conditions in Mexico, monitoring adherence to Leahy vetting requirements for State Department aid and DOD funding. Assistance to a brigade in Tlatlaya was suspended due to concerns about extrajudicial killings. Congress conditioned 15% of U.S. assistance until Mexico complied with human rights standards. Mexico lost $5.5 million in funding in FY2014. Human rights reporting requirements applied to FMF from FY2016-FY2019. The U.S. Congress has ongoing concerns about human rights conditions in Mexico, monitoring adherence to Leahy vetting requirements for State Department aid and DOD funding. Assistance to a brigade in Tlatlaya was suspended due to concerns about extrajudicial killings. Congress conditioned 15% of U.S. assistance until Mexico complied with human rights standards. Human rights reporting requirements applied to FMF rather than to M\u00e9rida Initiative accounts. U.S. assistance to Mexico has supported the Mexican government's efforts to reform its judicial system and improve human rights conditions. Congress provided funding to support Mexico's transition to a new justice system aiming to strengthen human rights protections. The State Department established a high-level human rights dialogue with Mexico, and USAID supported Mexico's 2014-2018 human rights plan, including legislation development, prevention efforts, improved state responses to abuses, and expanded assistance to victims. The U.S. Congress is concerned about human rights conditions in Mexico and monitors adherence to Leahy vetting requirements for aid. Assistance to a brigade in Tlatlaya was suspended due to concerns about extrajudicial killings. Congress may increase funding for human rights programs in Mexico, including training for military and police, and support for human rights organizations. Human rights conditions and compliance with the FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act are closely monitored. Members of Congress have raised concerns about extrajudicial killings, abuses of Central American migrants, and other human rights issues. The United States and Mexico have a strong economic and trade relationship through NAFTA, which has removed trade barriers and provided rules for North American trade. Economic studies show a small but positive effect of NAFTA on both countries, with some adjustment costs in certain sectors. The U.S. Congress is concerned about human rights conditions in Mexico, including extrajudicial killings, abuses of migrants, and spyware use against activists. Policymakers question how the L\u00f3pez Obrador administration will address past human rights abuses and prevent new ones, as well as how police and judicial reforms are improving human rights protections. Mexico is the United States' third-largest trading partner, with a significant trade relationship under NAFTA. The two countries have seen a sixfold increase in merchandise trade since 1993, with the US being Mexico's main export market. However, the trade balance has shifted from a surplus to a deficit, reaching $81.5 billion in 2018. In 2018, the United States had a trade deficit of $81.5 billion. Trade with Mexico included a surplus of $7.4 billion in services in 2017, mainly in travel, transportation, business, and financial services. Total trade reached $561.3 billion in 2018, with a focus on supply chains and manufacturing collaboration. The U.S.-Mexican border region has become important for production due to the flow of intermediate inputs and finished products. Foreign direct investment (FDI) also plays a significant role, with U.S. FDI in Mexico increasing from $15.2 billion in 1993 to $109.7 billion in 2017. The U.S.-Mexican High-Level Economic Dialogue and the High-Level Regulatory Cooperation Council aimed to promote economic competitiveness and align regulatory principles. Trilateral cooperation with Canada occurred under the North American Leadership Summits. Despite discontinuation under the Trump Administration, the bilateral Executive Steering Committee and efforts along the border continued. The U.S.-Mexico CEO Dialogue and trade disputes between the United States and Mexico, including issues like country-of-origin labeling and NAFTA trucking provisions, have been ongoing despite positive advances in bilateral economic relations. Mexican business leaders have collaborated with U.S. counterparts to support the proposed USMCA over abandoning NAFTA. In recent trade disputes, the United States and Mexico have clashed over tariffs on solar panels and washing machines, as well as the suspension agreement on fresh tomato exports from Mexico. Mexico is hopeful for a new arrangement to be reached before a U.S. withdrawal. The United States and Mexico are in a trade dispute over tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Mexico retaliated with tariffs on U.S. exports. The Trump Administration also initiated an investigation into motor vehicle imports. The US, Canada, and Mexico signed the proposed USMCA. The proposed USMCA, if approved, would replace NAFTA and make changes to market access provisions for autos and agriculture products, investment rules, government procurement, and intellectual property rights. It would also introduce new chapters on digital trade, state-owned enterprises, and currency misalignment. The USMCA would tighten rule of origin requirements for duty-free treatment of U.S. motor vehicle imports from Mexico, requiring 75% North American content for vehicles and 70% for steel and aluminum, with 40%-45% of auto content made by workers earning at least $16. The proposed USMCA would maintain NAFTA's dispute resolution mechanisms, introduce new rules on market access, investment, and intellectual property, and tighten rules of origin for autos. Policymakers may debate issues related to U.S.-Mexico trade as they consider the USMCA. The proposed USMCA is being debated by policymakers, focusing on issues like congressional consideration, meeting negotiating objectives, and the impact on U.S.-Mexico trade relations. A USITC study suggests a small positive impact on the U.S. economy. Some policymakers urge lifting steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico before Congress considers the agreement. Congressional objectives and concerns will influence the timing of consideration. The proposed USMCA is vital for U.S. firms, workers, and farmers, with concerns about worker rights protection in Mexico, enforceability of labor provisions, ISDS provisions, and auto rules of origin. Critics argue that USMCA enforcement tools may not sufficiently protect worker rights. Uncertainty remains about whether Mexican labor reforms will address these concerns. The Mexican Congress has passed labor reforms to address concerns about worker rights protection in Mexico. Immigration policy has been a long-standing issue in the U.S., with a focus on preventing unauthorized migration. Mexico is a major source of migrants to the U.S., but more Mexicans are now leaving than arriving. Protecting the rights of Mexicans living in the U.S. remains a top priority for the Mexican government. Mexico has supported immigration reform in the United States while combating transmigration and working with U.S. law enforcement. The Trump Administration deported 141,045 Mexicans in FY2018. Concerns about U.S. removal policies were addressed during the Obama Administration. President Trump's immigration policies have strained U.S.-Mexican relations. President Trump's repeated insistence that Mexico will pay for a border wall strained U.S.-Mexican relations. Mexico expressed regret over the rescinding of DACA but pledged to assist beneficiaries returning to Mexico. Despite criticism of U.S. immigration policies, Mexico continues to collaborate with the U.S. on migration and border issues. The Trump Administration broadened categories for immigrant removal, leading to more long-term Mexican deportees. The Mexican government is concerned about the large-scale removal of Mexican nationals in the U.S. without legal status. They have enhanced services for Mexicans in the U.S., including a 24-hour hotline and legal support. Mexico hopes for a solution from the U.S. Congress regarding the phased ending of the DACA initiative. As of July 2018, around 561,400 Mexicans were brought to the U.S. Since 2014, Mexico has assisted the U.S. in managing a surge in unauthorized migration from the Northern Triangle countries. Mexico has apprehended almost 524,000 migrants and asylum seekers from the Northern Triangle from 2015 to November 2018. As U.S. asylum policies tighten, Mexico has absorbed more Central Americans in need of humanitarian protection with U.S. assistance through the M\u00e9rida Initiative. Mexico has received support for its humanitarian protection efforts through global U.S. Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) implemented by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and others. Some U.S. policymakers have praised Mexico's management of migration flows, while others have questioned its ability to protect migrants from abuse and provide asylum. The L\u00f3pez Obrador administration aims to address immigration by protecting human rights, decriminalizing migration, and cooperating with Central America, facing challenges due to increased flows from the Northern Triangle and pressure from the U.S. to limit them. The U.S. and Mexican governments pledged to boost investment in Central America, but the Trump Administration plans to end foreign assistance programs for the Northern Triangle countries. This decision will affect approximately $450 million in funding. Mexico has provided humanitarian relief to Central American migrants but has not increased funding for the migration agency or asylum system. The Mexican government has recently limited protections due to pressure from the United States and overcapacity in migration stations. Mexico has limited protections and increased deportations for migrants, especially those in large groups or caravans, to deter future flows. The asylum system is overwhelmed, with 29,000 applications in 2018 and 80% from 2017 still pending. President L\u00f3pez Obrador's efforts to maintain positive relations with the U.S. have led to criticism and strained relations with some Central American governments. The decision to allow Central American asylum seekers to be returned to Mexico under the U.S. Migrant Protection Protocols has put pressure on local governments and aid organizations. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, there have been significant delays and unpredictable wait times at the U.S.-Mexican border, impacting U.S.-Mexican trade. Efforts to reduce wait times have been made through public-private partnerships, but infrastructure and staffing issues persist on both sides of the border. The United States and Mexico declared their intent to collaborate on enhancing the border in 2010. The U.S. and Mexico have been collaborating since 2010 to enhance the border through the M\u00e9rida Initiative. A Bilateral Executive Steering Committee has been overseeing the development of binational action plans focused on infrastructure development, trusted traveler programs, cargo preclearance projects, cross-border commerce, and information sharing among law enforcement agencies. Recent efforts include opening a railway bridge at Brownsville-Matamoros and launching cargo pre-inspection test locations. In recent months, U.S. efforts to address an influx of Central American asylum seekers and expedite border barrier construction have led to longer wait times at the border. Concerns have been raised about potential policies from President Trump that could worsen delays, such as closing the border or imposing tariffs on Mexican exports. Mexico has urged the U.S. to reconsider these policies to reduce extended border delays. Mexico's efforts to increase security along its borders and enforce immigration laws, address Central American migration, and improve bilateral cooperation with the U.S. on border security and immigration are key issues. The construction of a new border wall could impact trade and migration flows. Mexico's energy production is crucial for economic growth, but challenges in the oil and gas sector persist. Mexico's 2013 energy reforms opened up oil, electricity, gas, transmission, production, and sales to private and foreign investment while maintaining state control over hydrocarbons. These reforms created opportunities for U.S. businesses in various sectors. Despite attracting over $160 billion in investments, Pemex's debt increased significantly, and production declines persisted. The reforms did not privatize Pemex but exposed it to competition and joint ventures. Pemex's debt increased by over 60% from 2013 to 2017, impacting Mexico's energy sector. The USMCA aims to reinforce Mexico's energy reforms and includes provisions for investment in the sector. The agreement also facilitates expedited exports of U.S. natural gas to Mexico, which have significantly increased since the 2013 reforms. The USMCA aims to reinforce Mexico's energy reforms and facilitate expedited exports of U.S. natural gas to Mexico, which have surged by 130% since the 2013 reforms. The value of U.S. petroleum products exports to Mexico in 2018 was $30.6 billion, nearly double the value of U.S. energy imports from Mexico. Energy cooperation with Mexico is seen as giving North America an industrial advantage. L\u00f3pez Obrador's plans for Mexico's energy sector are still evolving. L\u00f3pez Obrador's government will honor existing contracts not tainted by corruption but has halted future auctions and plans to focus on upgrading existing refineries and building a new one in Tabasco. The energy plans also aim to revitalize Pemex, despite its financial troubles. The decision to stop new auctions in wind and solar energy has raised concerns about Mexico's clean energy future. U.S.-Mexican energy cooperation in the hydrocarbons sector may be affected by L\u00f3pez Obrador's policies. The future of U.S.-Mexican energy cooperation in the hydrocarbons sector may depend on the policies of the L\u00f3pez Obrador government. Efforts to develop hydrocarbon resources in the Gulf of Mexico under the U.S.-Mexico Transboundary Agreement could continue through collaboration between regulatory entities. Educational exchanges and training opportunities for Mexicans in the petroleum sector could expand. Analysts suggest providing more technical assistance to Mexico, particularly in deepwater and shale. Additionally, efforts to provide natural gas resources to Central America and connect Mexico to the Central American electricity grid could be enhanced. The United States plans to offer more technical assistance to Mexico, especially in deepwater and shale exploration. Oversight questions may focus on the implementation of the Transboundary Hydrocarbons Agreement, Mexico's development of energy-sector regulators, and the impact of transnational crime on the energy industry and foreign workers' safety. Congressional oversight may also address the fairness of policies towards foreign investors by the incoming Mexican government. Cooperation and conflicts over shared rivers like the Colorado River and Rio Grande have been ongoing issues between the two countries. The 1944 Water Treaty between the United States and Mexico governs the sharing of river flows, overseen by the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC). The treaty mandates the U.S. to provide Mexico with 1.5 million acre-feet of Colorado River water annually. Deliveries in the Rio Grande basin near El Paso/Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez are conducted under a 1906 binational convention. Recent developments in the Colorado River Basin focus on managing water and infrastructure to improve availability during drought and protect ecosystems. The United States continues to meet its delivery requirements to Mexico under the 1944 Water Treaty, with recent actions by the IBWC aimed at cooperative basin management through Minute 323. Minute 323, a binational agreement from September 2017, allows for cooperative water management in the Colorado River basin. It includes provisions for Mexico to share in water cutbacks during shortages in the U.S. portion of the basin and the creation of a \"Mexican Water Reserve\" to store delayed deliveries at Lake Mead. Congressional oversight may focus on Minute 323 implementation and water management during potential shortage conditions. In the Rio Grande Basin, Mexico has not consistently met its delivery obligations since 1994. Mexico has not consistently met its Rio Grande delivery obligations under the 1944 Water Treaty, with recent shortfalls in the 2010-2015 cycle. Despite this, Mexico has made up for deficits in subsequent cycles. The current cycle from October 2015 to October 2020 saw below-target deliveries in the third year, but overall deliveries were close to meeting the cumulative target. Efforts are being made to improve water management through a binational model and input from working groups for better predictability and treaty compliance. The FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act includes a reporting requirement for the U.S. Department of State to improve transparency and predictability of water deliveries from Mexico to the United States to meet annual water apportionments to the Rio Grande, in accordance with the 1944 Treaty between the United States and Mexico. Recent developments in wastewater and river pollution along the border have sparked interest from congressional appropriators. Committees are focusing on oversight and reporting requirements regarding pollution in the Tijuana River and wastewater management near Nogales, AZ. The FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act mandates a report from the IBWC quantifying transboundary flows from Mexico entering the United States. The IBWC is required to report on the annual volume and composition of transboundary flows from Mexico to the United States in the Tijuana watershed. The report will also cover the time between discharges from Mexico and notification to the U.S. Government and local communities. Additionally, it will discuss mitigation measures for increased flows in 2017 and 2018, as well as concerns about compliance with treaty provisions related to border floodplain encroachment. Collaboration between the U.S. and Mexican governments on environmental issues in the border region is also highlighted. Collaboration between the U.S. and Mexican governments on environmental issues in the border region has been ongoing since the signing of the La Paz Agreement in 1983. The agreement led to the creation of the North American Development Bank (NADB) and the Border Environment Cooperation Commission (BECC) during the negotiations for NAFTA. Despite a decrease in federal funding post-2000, the two governments have continued to implement binational environmental programs, including the current 10-year Border 2020 program focused on reducing air pollution, improving access to clean water, promoting waste management, and enhancing environmental health. The Trump Administration's FY2020 budget request would eliminate funding for U.S.-Mexican border programs run by the EPA, despite Congress providing $3.0 million in EPA funding each year in FY2018 and FY2019. In 2009, President Obama and then-President Calder\u00f3n announced the Bilateral Framework on Clean Energy and Climate Change to develop clean energy sources and combat climate change. USAID and Mexico also expanded cooperation through the Mexico Global Climate Change (GCC) Program, which began in 2010 and provided $50 million. The Mexico Global Climate Change (GCC) Program, funded with $50 million through FY2016, prioritized environmental protection and clean energy in North American cooperation. Mexico, Canada, and the United States all ratified the Paris Agreement under the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. President Obama accepted the agreement on behalf of the U.S. in 2016, but President Trump announced withdrawal in 2017. President L\u00f3pez Obrador's 2018-2014 plan for the environment includes pledges to adjust government policies to comply with the Paris Accord and meet Mexico's Nationally Determine Contribution (NDC). However, L\u00f3pez Obrador has also pledged to bolster hydrocarbons production rather than renewable energy sources, raising concerns among environmental groups. President L\u00f3pez Obrador's plan to build a coal-fired refinery has raised concerns as it goes against prior pledges to reduce coal-based electricity generation. Mexico would need to invest $8 billion per year from 2014 to 2030 to meet its NDC, but only invested $2.4 billion in 2017. Educational exchanges between the US and Mexico increased during the Obama Administration, with initiatives like \"100,000 Strong in the Americas\" and Proyecta 100,000 aiming to boost student and researcher exchanges between the two countries. The U.S. and Mexican governments launched a Bilateral Forum on Higher Education, Innovation, and Research (FOBESII) in 2013 to increase student and researcher exchanges. In 2016-2017, U.S. students studying in Mexico increased by 10.8%, while Mexican students in the U.S. decreased by 8.9%. Mexico ranks ninth in countries with students studying in the U.S., facing challenges like lack of scholarship funding and English language skills. Many Mexican students face barriers such as lack of scholarship funding and English language skills. President Pe\u00f1a Nieto's structural reforms were praised, but their impact depends on implementation. Mexico's ranking in the Global Competitiveness Index improved in 2017 due to some reforms, but critics allege votes were bought. Some reforms have faced implementation issues, opposition from interest groups, and challenges in tax collection. Teachers unions in southern Mexico strongly opposed education reforms requiring evaluations. In southern Mexico, teachers unions vehemently opposed education reforms with evaluations. In June 2016, 8 people died in clashes between unions and police in Oaxaca. Despite international investment, low oil prices have hindered development of shale resources."
