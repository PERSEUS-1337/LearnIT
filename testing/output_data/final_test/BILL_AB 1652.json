    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 47607 of the Education Code is amended to allow for charter schools to be initially granted for up to five years, with the possibility of subsequent renewals for up to 15 years. Material revisions to the charter petition require approval from the granting authority, which also has the right to inspect the charter school at any time. Renewals and material revisions of charters are governed by Section 47605 standards and criteria, focusing on increases in pupil academic achievement as the key factor for charter renewal. \"All groups of pupils served by the charter school\" refers to significant pupil subgroups defined by Section 52052. Charter schools must meet specific criteria for charter renewal, including academic performance targets, API rankings, and comparison to demographically similar schools. The academic performance of a charter school must be at least equal to public schools and schools in the district it is located in, based on clear data and assessments for similar pupil populations. A chartering authority must submit supporting documentation and a written summary for any determination made regarding charter renewal. The Superintendent reviews the materials and may make recommendations based on the review. A charter renewal cannot be granted until 30 days after the charter school submits the required materials. Additionally, a charter may be revoked if substantial evidence shows the charter school did not meet certain criteria. Before revocation, the chartering authority must notify the charter school of any violations, giving them a chance to remedy the issue unless it poses a severe threat to pupil health or safety. Factors for revocation include material violations of charter conditions, failure to meet pupil outcomes, fiscal mismanagement, or violation of laws. Academic achievement for all pupil groups is crucial in determining charter revocation. Before revoking a charter for failure to remedy a violation, the chartering authority must notify the charter school and give them a chance to address the issue. If a charter school fails to remedy a violation, the chartering authority must provide written notice of intent to revoke and hold a public hearing within 30 days. A final decision to revoke or not must be made within 30 days after the hearing, supported by factual findings specific to the charter school. If a school district revokes a charter, the charter school can appeal to the county board of education within 30 days. The county board can reverse the decision if findings are not supported by evidence. If no decision is made within 90 days or the revocation is upheld, the charter school can appeal to the state board. If a county office of education revokes a charter, the charter school can appeal to the state board within 30 days. The state board can reverse the decision if findings are not supported by evidence. During an appeal, a charter school facing revocation can still operate and receive funding to prevent disruption to student education. If a county board reverses a school district's decision to revoke a charter, the school can continue to function and access resources. The charter school facing revocation can retain grants, resources, and facilities. Any withheld funding or resources must be reinstated. Final decisions on revocation must be reported to relevant authorities. If state-mandated costs are identified, reimbursement will be provided to local agencies and school districts."
