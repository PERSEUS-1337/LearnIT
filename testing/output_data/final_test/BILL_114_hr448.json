    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Women's Health Protection Act of 2015\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purpose section. Access to safe, legal abortion services is crucial for women's health and their ability to participate equally in society. However, various hindrances such as blockades, insurance restrictions, and limitations on minors' access have impeded this essential healthcare service. These restrictions do not enhance women's health or safety but instead reduce the availability of services. Since 2010, there has been a significant increase in laws and regulations targeting abortion, threatening women's health and access to safe services. Congressional action is needed to address these restrictions, which violate constitutional protections. Many State and local governments are imposing restrictions on abortion that violate constitutional protections for women, including bans before viability. These restrictions are not based on science and do not improve the safety of abortion services or protect women's health. Many State and local governments are imposing restrictions on abortion that violate constitutional protections for women, including bans before viability. These restrictions harm women's health by reducing access to essential health care services, especially impacting low-income women, women of color, and those in medically underserved areas. Federal legislation is needed to stop harmful restrictions on abortion services across the United States to ensure all women have access to safe abortion, a constitutional right affirmed by the Supreme Court. Congress has the authority to protect this right under the Commerce Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment. The purpose of this Act is to safeguard women's health by ensuring continued availability of abortion services. The Act aims to protect women's health by ensuring the availability of abortion services without unnecessary restrictions. It does not address all threats to abortion access, such as clinic violence or insurance coverage limitations, which should be addressed separately by Congress. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include abortion as any medical treatment to terminate a pregnancy, abortion provider as a healthcare professional who performs abortions, government as entities acting under US laws, and health care professional as licensed medical professionals. In this Act, an abortion provider refers to a healthcare professional competent to perform abortions. Medically comparable procedures are defined as similar in terms of risk, complexity, duration, or sterile precaution. Pregnancy is defined as the period starting with the implantation of a fertilized egg. The term \"State\" includes all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and US territories. Viability refers to the point in a pregnancy where, in the medical judgment, the fetus can survive outside the womb. In the context of the Act, viability is the stage of pregnancy where there is a reasonable chance of the fetus surviving outside the uterus with or without medical assistance. SEC. 4. PROHIBITED MEASURES AND ACTIONS. Prohibited limitations on abortion services include requirements for specific tests or procedures not generally needed, mandating the same clinician for all related services, and restricting providers' abilities. Limitations on abortion providers' prescribing drugs, providing services via telemedicine, and facility requirements not imposed on facilities with similar procedures. The text prohibits unnecessary in-person visits before obtaining an abortion, restrictions on medical training for abortion procedures, and measures similar to limitations on abortion services. The text prohibits measures that single out abortion services or make them harder to access without significantly advancing women's health or safety. To show unlawfulness, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the measure targets abortion services or impedes women's access based on specific factors. The text prohibits measures that impede access to abortion services based on specific factors, including interference with providers' care, delays in access, increased costs, and requirements imposed. The text evaluates whether a measure or action related to abortion may require unnecessary trips to providers, decrease service availability, impose unequal penalties, or have a cumulative impact with other requirements. The text prohibits certain restrictions on abortion, including a ban before fetal viability, unless the measure significantly advances safety or health with no less restrictive alternative. The text outlines prohibitions on abortion, including a ban before fetal viability and restrictions on abortion after fetal viability if it poses a risk to the woman's life or health. It also includes limitations on delaying immediate abortions for health reasons and prohibits restrictions based on a woman's reasons for seeking an abortion. The Act prohibits laws regulating physical access to clinic entrances, parental consent for minors seeking abortion, insurance coverage for abortion, and a specific procedure. It applies to government restrictions on abortion services, regardless of when they were enacted. SEC. 5. LIBERAL CONSTRUCTION. The provisions of this Act shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes. Nothing in this Act shall interfere with a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy. SEC. 6. ENFORCEMENT. The Attorney General can file a civil action for injunctive relief against government officials enforcing unlawful restrictions under this Act. Individuals or entities affected by violations can also file civil actions. Health care facilities or professionals can do the same on behalf of their patients. In civil actions under this Act, courts can award equitable relief, costs of litigation, and attorney fees to prevailing plaintiffs. District courts have jurisdiction over these proceedings without requiring exhaustion of other remedies. SEC. 7. PREEMPTION: States cannot create laws that conflict with this Act. \n\nSEC. 8. SEVERABILITY: If any part of this Act is deemed unconstitutional, the rest remains unaffected."
