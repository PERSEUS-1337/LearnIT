    "content": "States have the primary responsibility for child welfare, involving various state and local entities in investigating abuse and neglect, providing services, and overseeing foster care. Federal funding of nearly $7.9 billion in FY2008 supports these activities, with the majority allocated for foster care services. The federal government provides funding for foster care for children who meet federal eligibility criteria, which was established in the early 1960s. The 1996 welfare reform law converted funding for cash aid for needy families with children to a block grant, but federal foster care assistance is still available for children removed from homes that would have met the eligibility requirements for cash aid. Federal foster care assistance is available for children meeting eligibility criteria. States must comply with federal child welfare policies to ensure safety and well-being, especially for children in foster care. Non-compliance results in a Program Improvement Plan to be implemented within two years. In FY2006, an estimated 905,000 U.S. children were victims of abuse or neglect, with 1,530 children dying due to abuse or neglect. The rate of reported child maltreatment victims has been around 12 children per 1,000 children since 1999, lower than in the early to mid-1990s. States must address compliance issues identified by the CFSR through a Program Improvement Plan (PIP) within two years to avoid losing federal child welfare funding. Between 2000 and 2006, child victims experienced neglect (64%), physical abuse (16%), sexual abuse (9%), psychological maltreatment (7%), medical neglect (2%), and \"other abuse\" (14%). The number of children in foster care on the last day of FY2006 was 510,000, representing a decline from previous years. The national foster care caseload decreased by about 10% between FY1999 and FY2006. The foster care caseload declined by about 10% between FY1999 and FY2006, with 24 states reporting reductions in their caseloads. Illinois, California, and New York had the greatest declines in caseloads during this period. Between FY1999 and FY2006, the foster care caseload decreased by about 10% nationally, with 24 states showing reductions. However, some states experienced significant increases in caseloads, such as Massachusetts (3%), Idaho (93%), Texas (89%), and Iowa (86%). Additionally, five states saw caseload increases ranging from one-third to two-thirds. The number of children exiting foster care rose from 250,000 in FY1999 to 289,000 in FY2006. The number of children entering foster care may be increasing nationally, with an estimated 303,000 children entering in FY2006 compared to 293,000 in FY1999. The rate of children entering foster care declined during FY2000 through FY2004 but increased again in FY2006. Federal child welfare policy is often associated with foster care policy, with most funding and policies focused on children in foster care. However, the mission of child welfare agencies is broader, encompassing a larger group of children and families. In FY2006, states received allegations of abuse or neglect related to approximately six million children, with many cases being \"screened out\" due to various reasons. In FY2006, states investigated abuse or neglect allegations involving 3.6 million children, identifying over 905,000 victims. Post-investigation services were provided to 1.3 million children, with 77% receiving services at home and the rest placed in foster care. Not all victims received post-investigation services, with roughly three out of five victims receiving any services. During FY2006, states reported that roughly 60% of child maltreatment victims received services post-investigation. Among victims, 22% were placed in foster care, 37% received services at home, and 41% received no services. For children not identified as victims, over 4% were placed in foster care, 26% received in-home services, and 70% received no services. States served approximately 799,000 children in foster care for at least one day during the fiscal year. On September 30, 2006, an estimated 510,000 children were in foster care. Federal statute allows state child welfare agencies to use funds for services to ensure child well-being and safe, permanent homes. Services include educating the public on child abuse, prevention efforts, and identifying abused children. Services for children in foster care include parenting education classes, procedures to identify abuse or neglect, protection from unsafe home situations, temporary foster care placement, support for reunification with families, and services for permanent placement if reunification is not possible. For FY2008, Congress allocated nearly $7.9 billion in child welfare funding, with the majority going towards supporting casework activities for children removed from their birth families due to abuse or neglect. This includes funding for children in foster care ($4.6 billion) and those who have been adopted ($2.2 billion). Additionally, services and activities are provided to help children find permanent families and support youth aging out of the foster care system to succeed as independent adults. In FY2008, federal child welfare funding of $7.9 billion was allocated, with the majority supporting casework activities for children in foster care and those who have been adopted. Additionally, funding is provided for child and family services to ensure the safety and well-being of children in their homes. States also receive funding to help youth aging out of foster care successfully transition to independent adulthood. In FY2008, federal child welfare funding of $7.9 billion was allocated for casework activities for children in foster care and those who have been adopted. Funds totaling $173 million were made available for research, demonstration programs, and services related to child welfare. Federal child welfare programs are primarily administered by the Children's Bureau within the Administration for Children and Families at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Legislation related to child welfare programs authorized under the Social Security Act includes Title IV-B and Title IV-E programs. The House Education and Labor Committee and the Senate HELP Committee report bills amending grant programs under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. These committees also handle legislative proposals for additional programs like Adoption. The House Education and Labor Committee and the Senate HELP Committee handle legislative proposals for child welfare programs, including Adoption Opportunities and Abandoned Infants Assistance. Federal social service programs have discretionary funding authorizations that expire after a specific number of years, prompting congressional committees to review program effectiveness. Child welfare programs undergo reauthorization legislation periodically to review program effectiveness. Funding for these programs can be capped or open-ended, with some having time-limited authorization while others have permanent funding authority. Programs with permanent funding authority do not require reauthorization legislation but can still be amended by the authorizing committee. In 2007, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support held hearings related to child welfare policy. In February 2008, the subcommittee held a hearing on the Invest in KIDS Act. As of mid-June 2008, no hearings had been held in the Senate. No Senate hearings focused on child welfare during the 110th Congress. The first hearing in May 2007 addressed challenges in the child welfare system, with witnesses from various organizations highlighting concerns about services for families and children. Witnesses highlighted challenges in the child welfare system, including the need for services to prevent placement, reunite families, sustain permanence, recruit foster homes for older children and those with special needs, ensure adequate workforce staffing and training, and availability of federal funds. Specific challenges mentioned were the overrepresentation of African-American children and other minority groups, providing services to youth in foster care, and those who age out without a permanent home. Collaboration across systems was noted as essential for addressing child and family health, mental health, and substance abuse issues. Witnesses emphasized the importance of addressing child welfare challenges such as recruiting foster families for older children and those with special needs, setting national standards for caseworker workload, and providing training and support for staff. They also recommended better distribution of federal funds for child welfare purposes. Several witnesses emphasized the need for accountability in child welfare practices, including supervisors and caseworkers. Some mentioned the federal Child and Family Services Review as a positive step but called for greater efforts. HHS-supported training and technical assistance were also highlighted as essential. Additionally, discussions at hearings focused on issues facing vulnerable youth populations, including those in foster care needing educational stability and support services as they age out. Witnesses at a hearing discussed the challenges faced by youth aging out of foster care, including low educational attainment, homelessness, financial struggles, early parenthood, and other difficulties. Representative Dennis Cardoza, the GAO, former foster youth, and advocacy groups were among those present. Youth aging out of foster care face challenges such as low educational attainment, homelessness, financial struggles, and early parenthood. Independent living services for these youth vary widely by state, with less than half receiving transitional services. It is crucial to create permanent connections for youth before they leave foster care, such as matching them with a supportive family or adult mentor. Some suggest allowing youth to remain in foster care custody until at least age 21. The importance of supporting youth aging out of foster care was emphasized, with calls for extending foster care custody until age 21, prioritizing sibling connections, and providing essential services like housing, education, and job training. Testimonies highlighted the need for permanent adult connections for foster youth and urged for community engagement and better data collection on outcomes. A hearing was held to address the health and mental health status of children in foster care. The hearing focused on the health and mental health needs of children in foster care, with witnesses presenting studies showing high rates of physical and mental health issues among these children. Medicaid provides screening and treatment for children in foster care, who often have emotional or behavioral issues. The hearing highlighted the importance of early identification and coordination between agencies for children in foster care. Testimony emphasized the need for clinical review before prescribing psychotropic medication and access to complete medical histories. Proposals included creating electronic records for better storage and access to information. Proposals discussed include creating electronic records for medical histories and establishing a \"medical home\" for each child in foster care. The 109th Congress enacted changes to improve child welfare services, with ongoing debates on further amendments to federal child welfare policy. In 2007, child welfare hearings in the 110th Congress introduced bills to change federal child welfare financing, expanding eligible populations for Title IV-E funds and providing additional support for child and family services. Other proposals aim to improve services for children in foster care, youth aging out of care, kinship caregivers, and decision-making involvement. The legislative proposals discussed aim to enhance the safety, permanence, and well-being of children by improving foster and adoptive parent recruitment efforts, allowing tribal governments access to federal funds, and making other related changes. These proposals would amend existing child welfare programs and policies, as well as create new programs or amend other social service and education programs. The focus is on addressing a wide range of child welfare policy concerns to benefit the primary populations served by child welfare agencies. Several bills aim to expand federal assistance under Title IV-E of the Social Security for children by delinking it from the eligibility rules of the former federal cash welfare program. This includes allowing eligible children leaving foster care for legal guardianship to receive support and extending the age of eligibility for foster care support to 21 years old. The share of children in foster care eligible for Title IV-E support has declined, with bills proposed to delink eligibility from income rules. This includes the Invest in KIDS Act, the Partnership for Children and Families Act, and the Place to Call Home Act, potentially expanding federal support for foster care and adoption. The current law may expand eligibility for federal foster care support to include all children in foster care and those adopted from foster care meeting state \"special needs\" criteria. There is no clear correlation between a state's income eligibility rules and the share of children eligible for Title IV-E support. Many attribute the decline in eligible children to the requirement linking eligibility to the income rules of the now-repealed AFDC program. Federal law requires states to apply income and eligibility rules from the prior AFDC program to determine Title IV-E eligibility for foster care support. The median income test for a family of three has decreased from 60% to 45% of the federal poverty level. In two-thirds of states, the income eligibility test is now less than 50% of the poverty guideline. There is no limit on federal funding for Title IV-E foster care, with the government sharing a fixed part of eligible claims submitted by states. The government provides open-ended entitlement funding for Title IV-E foster care maintenance and adoption assistance payments. Bills like H.R. 5466, H.R. 3409, H.R. 4207, and S. 2900 support these payments and related child placement activities. H.R. 5466 and H.R. 3409 limit state reimbursement for specific administrative costs to 15% of federal funding. H.R. 4207 and S. 2900 do not include a limit on state reimbursement for administrative costs, while H.R. 5466 and H.R. 3409 propose reducing federal reimbursement rates for foster care and adoption assistance to control costs. These bills aim to maintain the current level of federal commitment to funding these services. The proposed bills H.R. 5466 and H.R. 3409 suggest reducing federal reimbursement rates for foster care and adoption assistance under the Title IV-E program. States that receive less funding due to these changes can submit additional claims for three years to receive funding at previous levels. This adjustment would be factored into establishing future reimbursement rates based on the state's overall federal support during the three-year period. The reimbursement rates for foster care and adoption assistance under the Title IV-E program range from 50% to 83%, with specific rates for program administration and training costs. States must cover costs for children who do not meet federal eligibility criteria. Eligibility for adoption assistance is based on various criteria, including family income standards. In FY2006, roughly 89% of children adopted with child welfare agency involvement receive an adoption subsidy. Among those with a subsidy, 78% received federal adoption assistance, while 22% received state-only support. In FY2000, 85% received federal adoption assistance, and 15% received state-only support. Data on the total share of children receiving federal versus state-only support is unavailable. The Adoption Equality Act of 2007 aimed to address adoption assistance disparities. The Equality Act of 2007 and the Improved Adoption Incentives Act aim to expand adoption assistance eligibility for children adopted from foster care based on special needs criteria determined by each state. The number of children receiving Title IV-E adoption assistance has significantly increased in recent years, with a projected 430,400 children to receive this assistance in FY2009. This growth aligns with the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, which encourages states to expedite the adoption of children out of foster care. Since the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, states have increased efforts to expedite adoptions of children out of foster care. The number of children adopted with public child welfare agency involvement doubled between FY1995 and FY2000, and has remained steady at 50,000 to 53,000 annually since FY2000. In FY2006, about one in four children in foster care were living with relatives, and many children left foster care to be adopted or placed in legal guardianship with relatives. The Kinship Caregiver Support Act and other child welfare bills aim to provide federal reimbursement for guardianship subsidies to relatives who assume legal guardianship of children previously in foster care. Guardianship is seen as a positive permanent placement for children who cannot be reunited with their parents or adopted. Research has found that children placed in subsidized guardianship fare well on safety, permanence, and well-being factors compared to those reunited with birth families or adopted from foster care. Guardianship provides stability, eliminates the stigma of foster care, and allows caregivers to make important decisions for the child. The GAO recommended federal reimbursement for legal guardianship similar to adoption in 2007. Federal reimbursement for legal guardianship, similar to adoption, is advocated to reduce the overrepresentation of African-American children in foster care. Many relative caregivers have limited income, and financial support is crucial for them to care for children. A survey showed that a significant number of children placed in kinship care arrangements come from households below the federal poverty threshold. Relative caregivers currently receive varying levels of financial support based on their legal relationship to the child. Relatives caring for children in foster care may receive financial support based on their legal relationship to the child. This support can include foster care maintenance payments, Title IV-E adoption assistance payments, or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) \"child-only\" benefits. The level of support varies depending on the state's policies and licensing standards. Relatives caring for children in foster care may receive financial support through foster care maintenance payments, Title IV-E adoption assistance, or TANF child-only benefits. TANF child-only benefits vary by state and are typically less than foster care maintenance payments. Some children leaving foster care for a legal guardian may receive support through state subsidized guardianship programs, with over 30 states having such programs in place. These programs provide monthly financial assistance to adults who become legal guardians of children previously in foster care. Some states rely on state and local funding for subsidized guardianship programs, while others use federal Title IV-E funds or TANF funds. Legislation such as S. 661, H.R. 2188, H.R. 5466, S. 3038, and H.R. 3409 require a guardianship assistance agreement between the state child welfare agency and the legal relative guardian for federal reimbursement. The guardianship assistance agreement must specify services and payment amount, taking into account the needs of the relative guardian and child. Legislation like S. 661, H.R. 2188, H.R. 3409, H.R. 5466, and S. 3038 aim to ensure federal reimbursement for these agreements. The bills aim to establish guardianship assistance payments based on the needs of the child and relative guardian, with reimbursement for nonrecurring expenses capped at $2,000. States must document that relative guardianship is the best permanent placement option for foster children. The bills aim to establish guardianship assistance payments for relative guardians of former foster children, requiring a strong attachment to the child and a commitment to care for them permanently. Legal guardianship must be established by a court, and a fingerprint-based criminal background check is mandatory. The bills (S. 661, S. 3038, H.R. 2188, H.R. 3409) propose criminal background checks for relative guardians, with disqualifications for certain criminal histories. H.R. 5466 requires fingerprint-based checks but does not specify disqualifying findings. S. 3038 also mandates that relative guardians' homes meet state licensing standards. Eligibility for Title IV-E assistance is a key focus of these bills. The bills (S. 661, S. 3038, H.R. 2188, H.R. 3409) propose eligibility criteria for Title IV-E guardianship assistance payments, requiring the child to have been in foster care for at least 12 months and eligible for Title IV-E payments. They also emphasize the importance of a strong attachment to the relative guardian, consider reuniting with parents or adoption as inappropriate placement options, and involve consultation with children aged 14 and older. Additionally, minor siblings of eligible children may be placed in the same guardianship. The bills propose eligibility criteria for Title IV-E guardianship assistance payments, requiring the child to have been in foster care for at least 12 months and eligible for Title IV-E payments. They emphasize the importance of a strong attachment to the relative guardian, consider reuniting with parents or adoption as inappropriate placement options, and involve consultation with children aged 14 and older. Additionally, minor siblings of eligible children may be placed in the same guardianship arrangement to receive federal assistance payments. Title IV-E guardianship assistance is available for children under 18 or under 21 with a mental or physical illness. H.R. 5466 allows states to provide assistance until age 21, while S. 3038 does not support assistance after 18. States can seek reimbursement for training foster or adoptive parents of eligible children. The Foster Care Continuing Opportunities Act of 2007 and other bills aim to extend federal foster care support to youth until their 21st birthday. States can seek reimbursement for training relative guardians of Title IV-E eligible children. The Foster Care Continuing Opportunities Act of 2007 and other bills aim to extend federal foster care support to youth until their 21st birthday. To be eligible for Title IV-E foster care, a child must be under the care and placement responsibility of the state. Most youth leave foster care at 18, but some states allow them to remain in care. S. 1512 and H.R. 5466 would permit a state to continue making foster care maintenance payment claims. H.R. 5466 and S. 1512 propose extending foster care support for eligible youth until their 21st birthday, with the option to remain in care until their 19th or 20th birthday. Additional bills like H.R. 3409, H.R. 4208, and S. 2560 require states to make maintenance payments for youth who choose to stay in foster care after turning 18, with a written voluntary placement agreement outlining rights and obligations. H.R. 3409, H.R. 4208, H.R. 5466, and S. 2560 aim to expand placement options for older youth in foster care, including licensed supportive housing facilities. Current federal policy limits reimbursement to foster family homes or child-care institutions, excluding older youth in independent living situations. These bills propose extending foster care support until age 21 and making maintenance payments for youth over 18 with a voluntary placement agreement. H.R. 5466 aims to include licensed supportive housing facilities as eligible placement settings for older youth in foster care and allow foster care maintenance payments to cover rent for a youth's apartment. This bill also proposes amending the definition of \"child-care institution\" to include supervised settings for Title IV-E eligible youth over 18 years old. H.R. 5466 proposes open-ended reimbursement for child and family services under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act to help prevent placement of children in foster care or facilitate successful reunification with parents. This would allow states to seek federal reimbursement for services aimed at reducing the number of children in foster care, shortening their stay, increasing family-like placements, and enhancing the well-being of children in foster care or receiving adoption assistance. The federal reimbursement rate for child and family services under Title IV-E would be tied to a state's FMAP, ranging from 50% to 83%. States must submit a plan to HHS outlining services to be supported, assessment methods, and spending on a Program Improvement Plan. Annual spending reports must also be submitted. HHS must approve state plans for child and family services under Title IV-E if they meet specified requirements, except if a state is not in substantial conformity with child welfare policy and not implementing a PIP. HHS can disapprove plans if a state is not making progress in complying with federal policy or if funds are to be used in a similar way as in the past five years. States must use funds received under Title IV-E to supplement existing child and family services funds, rather than replace them. H.R. 3409 mandates states to maintain previous spending levels for foster care maintenance payments for non-Title IV-E eligible children, directing the funds towards specific service categories. S. 1462 aims to eliminate the AFDC link. S. 1462 aims to remove the AFDC link for federal eligibility for Adoption Assistance, requiring states to spend any savings on authorized purposes under Title IV-E or Title IV-B. H.R. 4091 also expands eligibility for federal adoption assistance but does not include the same spending requirement. H.R. 5466, H.R. 3409, and H.R. 4207/S. 2900 would increase the number of children eligible for foster care maintenance payments. S. 2900 would expand federal support for caseworker activities for all children in foster care, not just those eligible for Title IV-E payments. This would ensure critical efforts required by federal law are made on behalf of all children in foster care. S. 2900 would increase federal funding for caseworker activities for all children in foster care, expanding support beyond those eligible for Title IV-E payments. This aims to fulfill federal requirements for all children in foster care. H.R. 4207 / S. 2900 allows states to transfer federal savings from reducing foster care days to child-welfare training or services like family support, preservation, reunification, and adoption. States must negotiate with HHS on expected placement days and submit a plan for fund usage. H.R. 3409 would increase annual funding for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program by $200 million, raising the total authorization to $745 million. Funding for CAPTA state grants and community-based grant programs in FY2008 was less than $27 million and $42 million respectively. The Crime Control and Prevention Act of 2007 seeks additional funding of $200 million annually for CAPTA state grants and community-based grants. An additional $545 million would be allocated to community-based groups for parent education, counseling, family-strengthening services, and adoption services. Proposals aim to support older youth in foster care, including those aging out of the system. Some proposals aim to expand federal eligibility for foster care aid until a youth turns 21, ensuring attention to the needs of older youth in foster care. Legislation like H.R. 4208, S. 2560, and H.R. 3409 would require earlier actions for older youth in foster care, amending current law related to case planning and review of permanency plans. These changes seek to improve access to education, medical, and social services for older youths in foster care and those aging out. The proposed legislation (H.R. 4208, S. 2560, and H.R. 3409) aims to amend current law regarding case planning for youth in foster care. It would require the inclusion of programs and services in the case plan to help transition youth from foster care to independent living, starting at age 14. Additionally, it mandates consultation with the youth during permanency hearings to discuss the transition plan. The proposed legislation (H.R. 4208, S. 2560, and H.R. 3409) would require case plans for youth in foster care to document efforts for permanent placement or adult connections. It also mandates reviewing efforts for permanent living arrangements at permanency hearings for youth transitioning to independence. The proposed legislation aims to improve the transition of youth from foster care to independent living by requiring permanency hearings in court. It also seeks to increase funding for the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program to support services for older youth in foster care. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) aims to support youth aging out of foster care with education, job training, personal finance management, and health skills. States can use CFCIP funds for personal and emotional support, educational achievement, employment, counseling, financial support, and housing assistance. Proposed bills would increase annual funding authorization to $200 million to enhance services for older youth in foster care. Proposed bills aim to amend the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) by increasing funding to $200 million and expanding services for youth in foster care. The bills would allow states to provide services to youth until age 25, require funds to be used for youth aged 18-25, and add a new purpose for the program. S. 2560 and S. 3038 propose amendments to the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) to expand services for youth who left foster care after reaching certain ages. The bills would require states to inform youth of available support services before they leave foster care. H.R. 3409, H.R. 4208, and S. 2560 aim to improve the distribution of federal program information for youth transitioning to self-sufficiency. They would modify program evaluation requirements and ensure equal opportunity for private providers to receive funds for independent living services. Eligible youth can use Education and Training Vouchers for post-secondary education or training. The Education and Training Vouchers (ETV) program provides vouchers valued at up to $5,000 for post-secondary education or training. Several bills aim to expand eligibility for the ETV program to include youth who left foster care to guardianship or adoption after certain ages. Additionally, proposed amendments to the Higher Education Act would impact the ETV program. H.R. 4137, passed in February 2008, would amend the Higher Education Act to provide services for youth in foster care or recently emancipated youth. It requires the Education Department to ensure foster care youth receive supportive services through federal Trio programs, including mentoring and tutoring. These programs aim to support disadvantaged students for post-secondary education. H.R. 4137 and S. 1642 aim to provide services for youth in foster care or recently emancipated youth through federal Trio programs in post-secondary education. These programs include Talent Search, Upward Bound, Student Support Services, and Educational Opportunity Centers, with specific provisions for targeting foster youth and other disconnected youth. S. 1642 also includes services for temporary housing during academic breaks for these youth. H.R. 4137 proposes amendments to the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEARUP) to provide academic and support services for disadvantaged students, with a priority for those in foster care or who were in care until age 16. Funding through the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education would be used for demonstration projects offering comprehensive support services for students. S. 1642 aims to establish demonstration projects providing support services for students who were in foster care until age 18 to succeed in postsecondary education, including housing assistance. It also requires educational technology training programs to include strategies for serving students in foster care or aging out. The House has passed technical amendments to a law that would make any individual who was in foster care or a ward of the court at age 13 or older eligible for \"independent student\" status for federal student aid. The Medicaid Foster Care Coverage Act would require states to provide Medicaid coverage to these individuals. H.R. 1376 and H.R. 3409 aim to extend mandatory Medicaid coverage to youths in foster care until age 25, with states having the option to limit coverage based on certain criteria. Currently, states can choose to provide Medicaid to youth aging out of foster care, but many remain uninsured. Several proposals aim to increase health coverage for youth aging out of foster care, as research shows many are not covered. A recent study found that less than half of 19-year-olds who left foster care had health insurance, compared to nearly all who remained in care. The Focusing Investments and Resources for a Safe Transition Act (S. 2341) would establish individual development accounts for these youth to use for housing, education, vocational training, or starting a business. The Foster Children Self-Support Act (H.R. 1104) would establish a grant program for youth aging out of foster care to use for housing, education, vocational training, or starting a business. It would also prohibit states from using certain Social Security benefits to reimburse for foster care costs. H.R. 1104 aims to establish a grant program for foster youth aging out of care to support their housing, education, and vocational training. It also prohibits states from using specific Social Security benefits to reimburse foster care costs. Additionally, the bill requires states to develop individualized plans for foster children receiving benefits to help them achieve self-support after leaving care. Congress created the special immigrant juvenile classification in 1990 to allow a child who was brought to the United States illegally and experienced abuse, neglect, or abandonment to petition for legal permanent residency. This classification enables the child to obtain a driver's license, work, secure a mortgage, and live independently as an adult in the country. Federal law mandates states to provide protections for children in foster care, ensuring their safety and finding them a permanent home. Several proposals seek to amend child welfare programs. H.R. 5466 proposes amendments to child welfare programs to provide additional services and protections for children in foster care, including educational stability, medical services, and access to court advocates. The bill aims to ensure stability in school placement for foster children and support certain transportation costs. States are required to maintain health and education records for children in foster care under current law. H.R. 5466 requires states to ensure educational stability for children in foster care by considering school proximity and coordinating with local educational agencies to maintain school enrollment. H.R. 5466 aims to provide educational stability for foster care children by ensuring school enrollment continuity or facilitating enrollment in a new school if necessary. It also includes provisions for reimbursement of transportation costs for children to remain in their original school. Additionally, the School Choice for Foster Care Kids Act (H.R. 4311) allows funds from certain programs to be used for transportation vouchers for school-age foster care children. The current law allows funds to help foster youth transition to independent adulthood, including securing a high school diploma or post-secondary degree. Many children in foster care have unmet health and mental health needs, with coordination between child welfare and health agencies being crucial. \"Coordination between child welfare and health agencies is crucial for improving foster children's access to necessary services. H.R. 5466 would require states to have a plan for ongoing oversight and coordination of health care services, including mental health and dental services, for all children in foster care.\" The bill mandates states to develop an oversight and coordination plan with child welfare and Medicaid agencies, pediatricians, and health experts to ensure proper medical care for children in foster care. The plan includes health screening schedules, monitoring and treatment of health needs, updating and sharing medical information, and ensuring continuity of health care services. H.R. 5466 mandates states to ensure continuity of health care services for children in foster care, oversee prescription medicines, and make efforts to place siblings together in foster care placements unless it poses a safety risk. The benefits of placing siblings together in foster care include stability and well-being for children, better outcomes, and streamlined casework efforts. Despite the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act's requirement for a court advocate, not all abused or neglected children receive one. The CASA for Every Child Act of 2007 aims to ensure that every child in foster care has a court-appointed special advocate. Funding from the Victims of Child Abuse Act supports local CASA programs to provide training and assistance. The Department of Justice administers the funds, with the goal of having a CASA available to every victim of child abuse or neglect by 2010. H.R. 3283 and S. 2237 focus on funding and support for CASA programs. H.R. 3283 would only allow federal reimbursement for CASA costs if the program is a volunteer member of the National CASA and meets national standards. S. 2237 would authorize $8 million annually from FY2008 to FY2011 to expand recruitment, build capacity, and provide training for CASA programs in areas with high populations in foster care. S. 2237 aims to provide funding and support for CASA programs serving children in foster care. It would authorize $8 million annually to expand recruitment, build capacity, and provide training for volunteers. The bill also requires HHS to develop model standards for training individuals acting as GALs or CASAs in child abuse and neglect cases. S. 2237 aims to improve the quality and uniformity of representation for individuals in abuse or neglect cases by developing caseload standards for child representatives. HHS must disseminate the curriculum and standards to state child welfare agencies within 18 months. H.R. 5466 allows states to claim reimbursement for training costs for GALs, CASAs, and other court personnel. The Foster Care Mentoring Act of 2007 (S. 379) would authorize funding for grants to provide mentoring to children in foster care. HHS would award grants to states or political subdivisions to establish mentoring networks. Successful applicants could receive up to $600,000 annually with requirements for training and matching funds. The bill would authorize $15 million for the grant program in FY2008 and FY2009, with additional funding in following years. S. 379 authorizes additional funding for a national hotline for mentors to youth in foster care, requires annual reports and evaluations of the mentoring program, and allows for loan forgiveness for mentors in a statewide program. Loan forgiveness amount is $2,000 for every 200 hours of service, not to exceed $20,000. The proposed bills H.R. 3409, H.R. 4208, and S. 2560 aim to address issues related to foster care, including reducing the incidence of children running away from foster care and preventing children from being placed in foster care due to inadequate housing or lack of access to mental health services. These bills would require states to have written policies and procedures in place to address these issues. The proposed bills aim to amend the state plan provisions of the Title IV-E foster care program to prevent children from being placed in foster care solely due to homelessness or substandard housing. It would also require states to work with families and housing authorities to secure permanent housing for homeless families with minor children. Additionally, the Keeping Families Together Act would authorize family support grants for mental health treatment to prevent parents from relinquishing their children. The GAO reported that parents were placing their children in child welfare or juvenile justice custody to access mental health services due to limitations in insurance and availability of services. Proposed bills would allocate funding for mental health treatment to prevent such placements. The proposed bills allocate grant funds to states to establish a \"sustainable system of care\" for children and youth in state custody or at risk of placement for mental health services. States can use the funds for interagency cooperation, expanding insurance coverage, delivering mental health services, providing outreach and education, and training personnel. The grant funds allocated to states aim to establish a sustainable system of care for children and youth in state custody or at risk of placement for mental health services. States must provide increasing levels of matching funds and submit a state plan detailing how the system of care will be financed. The grants will be administered by SAMHSA within HHS. A task force is proposed to address mental health issues in children and youth within child welfare and juvenile justice systems. It would be established jointly with ACF, CMS, OJJDP, and the Office for Special Education to improve access to services and make recommendations to Congress for better delivery of mental health services. A task force is proposed to address mental health issues in children and youth within child welfare and juvenile justice systems. It would establish standard definitions for data collection, encourage interagency cooperation, eliminate custody relinquishment, provide advice on grant administration, offer technical assistance, make recommendations for breaking down barriers, and provide biannual reports to Congress. Funding of $1 million annually from FY2008 through FY2013 would be authorized for this task force. Several bills propose federal support for guardianship payments to relative caregivers of foster children, aiming to strengthen family connections and promote the use of relatives as foster parents. Kinship care involves a non-parent adult assuming primary responsibility for a child, often due to various reasons like military deployment, illness, or abuse. At least 2.3 million children are living with relatives due to various reasons like military deployment, illness, or abuse. Most children in kinship care arrangements are under private agreements, with only a small number in formal foster care. Some children in kinship care have had prior involvement with child welfare agencies or court activities. The goal is to increase family connections for children in foster care. H.R. 5466, S. 661, H.R. 2188, and H.R. 3409 aim to increase family connections for children in foster care by authorizing funds for kinship navigator programs, identifying family members for child placement, and involving relatives in care planning. These bills also allow states to set separate licensing standards for relative foster care providers. Kinship providers may lack legal authority to enroll children in their neighborhood school. The bills S. 661 and H.R. 2188 propose establishing kinship navigator programs to provide information and support for relatives caring for children in foster care. These caregivers often lack legal authority for educational and medical decisions, and may not have access to necessary services. Additionally, H.R. 5466 suggests Family Connection Grants to enhance family connections and support for children in foster care. H.R. 5466 proposes Family Connection Grants under Title IV-B of the Social Security Act for state, local, or tribal child welfare agencies and nonprofit organizations to establish kinship navigator programs. The grants aim to help kinship caregivers access services for children and themselves, including information and referral systems and partnerships between public and private agencies. The proposed legislation, S. 661 and H.R. 2188, would authorize grants for private agencies to support kinship caregiving families. The grants would fund activities such as kinship care ombudsman and caregiver support services. Funding would increase over three years, with a requirement for non-federal support. State agencies would receive at least half of the funds. Grantees must provide plans for continuing the program after federal funding expires. H.R. 5466 would establish a new competitive grant program under Title IV-B of the Social Security Act known as Family Connection Grants to help children in foster care reconnect with family members through kinship navigator programs and intensive family-finding efforts. ACF would be allowed to reserve up to 1% of funds for technical assistance to grantees. The Family Connection Grants program under H.R. 5466 aims to help children in the child welfare system by reestablishing relationships and finding permanent family placements. Grantees, including child welfare agencies and nonprofit organizations, must submit applications detailing how funds will be used to implement programs for children and families, with assurance of cooperation in program evaluation by HHS. The bill authorizes $50 million annually for Family Connection Grants for child welfare programs. Grantees must provide increasing non-federal support, with HHS making up to 20 payments per year. 3% of funds are reserved for program evaluation, and 2% for technical assistance. States are encouraged to prioritize placing children with suitable relatives. The bills S. 661, H.R. 2188, and S. 3038 aim to prioritize placing children with suitable relatives in care. They require states to notify grandparents and other relatives within 60 days of a child's removal, explaining their options for participating in the child's care. States must also exercise due diligence in identifying and informing relatives about placement options. S. 3038 requires states to notify adult relatives of children entering foster care and non-parent relative caretakers of children receiving TANF assistance. H.R. 2188, S. 661, H.R. 5466, and H.R. 3409 allow states to establish separate licensing standards for relative caregivers to protect the child's safety, including criminal records checks. H.R. 5466 and H.R. 3409 propose amending licensing requirements for foster care, ensuring all children in foster care are placed in licensed homes or institutions. Current federal policy mandates states to have licensing standards in place for foster homes receiving federal support. States must have background check procedures for foster and adoptive parents in place, with approval contingent on completion of these checks. Prospective caregivers with certain criminal convictions may not be approved. Children in unlicensed placements may not receive federal foster care support. Licensing standards for relatives and non-relatives must be the same. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 limits states' ability to seek reimbursement for case planning costs under Title IV-E. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 requires background checks for foster and adoptive parents. Relative caregivers are less likely to be licensed due to various reasons. The Housing Protection and Foster Care Prevention Act of 2008 aims to amend the United States Housing Act. The Housing Protection and Foster Care Prevention Act of 2008, introduced by Representative Maxine Waters, proposes excluding eligible guardianship subsidies for former foster children from income calculations for federal housing assistance programs like Section 8. This change would align the treatment of guardianship subsidies with foster care maintenance payments, ensuring they are not considered income for eligibility and rent purposes. The bill specifies that the subsidy must be for a child under 18 who was in foster care for at least 12 months, with no plans for reunification with parents. In April, Representative Waters announced that HUD would no longer count eligible guardianship subsidies for children formerly in foster care as part of family income. H.R. 2188 aims to amend the definition of \"family support\" in the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program to assist kinship caregivers in accessing needed services. States must now spend at least 20% of federal PSSF funds on family support services, including aids for kinship caregivers. H.R. 2188 proposes to include aids for kinship caregivers in spending and establish a Title IV-E kinship guardianship program. States must certify to HHS that they will inform workers and families of permanency options and provide information on support services. Additionally, separate grant programs aim to improve child welfare. Senator Clinton's S. 2395 proposes grant programs to enhance child welfare agency recruitment practices for foster and adoptive parents, ensuring diversity. States must conduct diligent recruitment and can seek federal reimbursement for related costs. Most states were advised to improve their recruitment plans during the initial round of Child and Family Services Reviews. Multiple recruitment efforts were discussed in the final reports. The CFSR discussed various recruitment efforts for foster and adoptive parents, including general population and targeted recruitment. States have tried to streamline efforts by combining training and licensing. However, stakeholders in many states mentioned a shortage of homes for specific populations of children. H.R. 4198 aims to amend Title IV-E to address these issues. H.R. 4198 proposes competitive grants for \"one church, one child\" foster and adoptive parent recruitment programs, allowing various entities to establish or expand programs using networks of organizations to recruit and support foster and adoptive parents and children. The bill proposes funding for adoptive parents and support services, as well as establishing a National Clearinghouse for Adoption Promotion. Additionally, the Adoption Improvement Act of 2007 aims to provide grants to child welfare agencies to enhance their support for prospective adoptive parents. A recent survey found that child welfare agencies could do more to support adults interested in adopting children. Annually, 240,000 calls are made to agencies about adoption, but only 6% result in completed adoptions. Prospective parents face challenges such as difficulty contacting agencies and unhelpful interactions. S. 2395 would authorize grants to improve child welfare services. S. 2395 would authorize grants to child welfare agencies to increase adoptions by implementing various methods, including involving marketing firms, establishing specialized hotlines, and coordinating adoption sources for immediate access to available children. The bill aims to increase adoptions by granting child welfare agencies access to adoption sources, providing information to prospective parents, involving successful adoptive parents in recruitment and matching processes, and participating in program evaluation. The Tribal Foster Care and Adoption Access Act of 2007 would authorize $50 million for grants to improve accessibility and responsiveness of child welfare agencies to adoptive parents. It would also allow Indian tribes to make direct claims for federal reimbursement of foster care or adoption assistance payments. The Tribal Foster Care and Adoption Access Act of 2007 authorizes grants to improve child welfare agencies' accessibility to adoptive parents and allows tribes to claim federal reimbursement for foster care and adoption assistance. S. 1956, H.R. 4688, and H.R. 5466 propose that tribes must operate a Title IV-E program or have a cooperative agreement with a state to receive funding. These bills also allow tribes to receive Adoption Incentives on the same basis as states. The Tribal Foster Care and Adoption Access Act of 2007 authorizes grants to improve child welfare agencies' accessibility to adoptive parents and allows tribes to claim federal reimbursement for foster care and adoption assistance. S. 1956, H.R. 4688, and H.R. 5466 propose that tribes must operate a Title IV-E program or have a cooperative agreement with a state to receive funding. These bills also allow tribes to receive Adoption Incentives on the same basis as states. Additionally, eligible tribes can receive a portion of a state's Chafee Foster Care Independence Program and Education and Training Voucher funds in exchange for providing independent living services to tribal youth aging out of foster care. States and tribes can also enter into cooperative agreements to ensure services for older tribal foster youth. The Tribal Foster Care and Adoption Access Act of 2007 authorizes grants to improve child welfare agencies' accessibility to adoptive parents and allows tribes to claim federal reimbursement for foster care and adoption assistance. S. 1956, H.R. 4688, and H.R. 5466 propose that tribes must operate a Title IV-E program or have a cooperative agreement with a state to receive funding. These bills also allow tribes to receive Adoption Incentives on the same basis as states. Additionally, eligible tribes can receive a portion of a state's Chafee Foster Care Independence Program and Education and Training Voucher funds in exchange for providing independent living services to tribal youth aging out of foster care. States and tribes can also enter into cooperative agreements to ensure services for older tribal foster youth. The bills require tribes to meet all state requirements for operating a Title IV-E program, with modifications to certain plan requirements. The bills S. 1956, H.R. 4688, and H.R. 5466 allow tribes to establish licensing standards for foster care, with the exception of tribes in Alaska under H.R. 5466. These bills also give HHS the authority to modify Title IV-E requirements to benefit tribal children. S. 1956 and H.R. 4688 address background check requirements for foster and adoptive parents, while H.R. 5466 does not make changes for tribes in this regard. S. 1956, H.R. 4688, and H.R. 5466 address background check requirements for tribes regarding foster care and adoption. S. 1956 mandates background checks in accordance with the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act, while H.R. 4688 allows tribes to choose between different procedures. All three bills provide reimbursement for foster care and adoption assistance based on tribal population income. The proposed legislation would allow tribes to receive reimbursement for foster care and adoption assistance based on tribal population income. Children must meet specific judicial determinations to be eligible for support, including findings that the child's home was contrary to their welfare at the time of removal. Tribes would be permitted to use federal, state, tribal, or private funds to meet matching requirements. The proposed legislation (S. 1956, H.R. 4688, and H.R. 5466) aims to provide tribes with access to Title IV-E funds for foster care and adoption assistance. It includes provisions to waive residency requirements and requires HHS to issue regulations for tribal access to funds. The legislation clarifies that states remain responsible for providing support to eligible tribal children and youth. The Senate passed a bill in 2008 to appropriate $1 million annually for five years to establish a National Child Welfare Resource Center for Tribes. This center would exclusively serve the needs of Indian tribes for independent living supports and services for tribal children and youth. The bill also ensures that states cannot terminate foster care or adoption assistance payments for tribal children, regardless of cooperative agreements with tribes. H.R. 5466 and H.R. 2314 aim to improve child welfare services by establishing a grant program for workforce development and allowing states to claim federal reimbursement for training costs. H.R. 2314 specifically focuses on training costs for state-approved private child welfare agency workers. The Child Welfare Workforce Improvement Act (S. 2944) introduced by Senator Hillary Clinton aims to expand the range of workers eligible for federal reimbursement under Title IV-E training provisions. It also calls for a National Academy of Sciences Study on child welfare workforce issues and mandates state reporting of certain workforce data. Factors hindering recruitment and retention of child welfare workers were identified in a 2003 GAO report. H.R. 5466 aims to address challenges faced by child welfare workers and supervisors, such as high caseloads, lack of support, low salaries, violence risk, and training constraints. The bill proposes grants to states to improve specific indicators like caseload size, supervisor-to-caseworker ratio, staff education levels, and training opportunities. $200 million would be allocated annually for this purpose. The bill proposes $200 million annually for states to improve child welfare indicators through training and support for staff. States must submit applications detailing their plans to enhance specific indicators, with HHS having the authority to disapprove applications that do not show meaningful progress. The bill proposes $200 million annually for states to improve child welfare indicators through training and support for staff. States must submit applications detailing their plans to enhance specific indicators, with HHS having the authority to disapprove applications that do not show meaningful progress. Allotments to states would be based on the relative share of children, with a minimum annual allocation of $300,000 per state. States must spend at least $1 for every $3 received in federal grant funds and adhere to additional evaluation and accountability measures. The bill allows states to receive federal reimbursement of 75% of the cost of short-term training for child welfare workers employed by private agencies serving Title IV-E eligible children. States can also claim reimbursement for both short-term and long-term training of public and private child welfare agency workers under certain conditions. H.R. 5466 and S. 2944 allow states to seek reimbursement for short-term training costs for individuals working in abuse and neglect courts or agencies serving children. S. 2944 broadens the topics for federal reimbursement and allows funds from private nonprofit institutions as matching funds. It also mandates a national study on child welfare staff and recommendations for federal regulations on reporting staff characteristics and services. The Healthy Children and Families Act of 2007 and the Education Begins at Home Act propose changes to child welfare policy, including funding for nurse home visitation programs and early childhood home visitation. Congress allocated $10 million for a nurse home visitation initiative in FY2008. The omnibus FY2008 appropriations measure (H.R. 2674, enacted as P.L. 110-161) provides funding for nurse home visitation programs to support models proven effective in randomized controlled trials for preventing abuse and neglect. The FY2009 HHS budget requests continued funding for these evidence-based programs. Home visiting programs aim to prevent abuse and neglect, reduce government costs, and improve the health and well-being of children and families. Services vary but focus on improving family functioning, promoting physical health, and ensuring school readiness. Evaluations show mixed results, with some programs effective in improving outcomes and reducing costs. S. 2237 would amend the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA). S. 2237 proposes to amend the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act to allocate $545 million for parent education, counseling, and family strengthening services. Funds would be distributed through Community-Based Grants to Prevent Child Abuse and Neglect, aiming to improve parenting skills and prevent child abuse. States would be required to use a portion of federal funds for family support and preservation services under the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program. The Promoting Safe and Stable Families program allocates funds for family support, preservation, and adoption promotion services to improve parenting skills and prevent child abuse. States must use a portion of federal funds for these services. The PSSF program aims to support families at high risk of child welfare involvement, whether the child is at home or in foster care. In contrast, HHS's CAPTA grant program targets families before child welfare intervention is necessary. Child welfare agencies must ensure child safety and make efforts to prevent removal from the home. Parent training is a widely offered child welfare service, with many families receiving it annually. However, child welfare agencies often do not pay for parent training, leading to a lack of control over the training provided and limited evaluation of its effectiveness. In most counties, child welfare agencies do not always fund parent training, with the service often provided by other community organizations. S. 2237 would require states receiving parent training services for child welfare-involved families to implement effective models or principles, considering the diverse needs of families based on the reasons for child welfare involvement. S. 2237 would mandate states to have an \"infant safe haven\" law allowing parents to anonymously relinquish care of a newborn without penalty. This law aligns with existing federal legislation and aims to provide a safe option for parents in crisis. S. 2237 mandates states to have an \"infant safe haven\" law allowing parents to relinquish care of a newborn without penalty, with provisions for collecting medical history, searching missing person databases, and publicizing the law. Safe haven providers are defined in state laws to include various settings like hospitals, emergency medical services, police stations, and fire stations. States have different age limits for legally relinquishing an infant to a safe haven provider, typically between three days and one month. State laws ensure the relinquishing parent's anonymity and prohibit abandonment charges, except in cases of child abuse or neglect. Safe haven providers may ask for family and medical history information, and in some states, they must provide information about the legal effects of leaving the infant and referral services. Safe haven laws allow parents to safely relinquish their infants to designated providers without fear of prosecution. The child is then transferred to a child welfare agency for adoption. Some states allow parents to reclaim their parental rights within a specified time period. Advocates believe these laws prevent infant abandonment in dangerous places and ensure the child's safety. Safe haven laws aim to protect the child's best interest and safety by allowing parents to safely relinquish their infants to designated providers without fear of prosecution. However, critics argue that these laws may encourage irresponsible behavior and lead to the loss of important genetic information for the child. Additionally, there are concerns about potential interference with the parental rights of fathers who may be unaware of the child's birth and relinquishment. Practical considerations include raising public awareness of the laws and ensuring knowledge of the provisions among safe haven providers. Timing and conduct of termination of parental rights proceedings for children left at safe havens are also important factors to consider. S. 2237 would authorize funds for the Federal Bureau of Prisons to conduct a pilot program collecting information about children of federal prisoners. This includes their number, ages, living arrangements, and ensuring policies support family relationships. Close to 88% of prisoners are in state prisons, not federal prisons. S. 2237 would require the Federal Bureau of Prisons to \"encourage\" state correctional agencies to implement similar intake procedures, policies, practices, and staff-training as part of a pilot program. Over 2.4 million children have a parent in state or federal prison, with additional children having parents on probation or parole. These children and their caregivers have unique needs related to maintaining family connections. S. 2237 aims to address the unique needs of children with incarcerated parents by authorizing funding for the Federal Resource Center for Children of Prisoners. This center reviews policies of corrections agencies to support parent-child relationships for the well-being of the child. The center was initially operated by CWLA and later transitioned to Family and Corrections Network. S. 2237 requires HHS to provide states with a report on recommendations for child protective services during a person's arrest and establish services to support families affected by incarceration. A significant number of children in the child welfare system have caregivers with a history of criminal justice involvement, highlighting the need for support services. Children with a primary caregiver recently arrested are more likely to experience neglect or abandonment, have parents with substance abuse or mental health issues, and live in families facing extreme poverty or domestic violence. Legislation like the Safe Babies Act of 2007 aims to provide support for these vulnerable families. The Safe Babies Act of 2007 aims to provide training and assistance for local teams to support developmentally appropriate court services for infants and toddlers who have been abused or neglected. Funding of $5 million annually from FY2008 through FY2012 is authorized for this purpose. The Safe Babies Act of 2007 aims to establish a National Court Teams Resource Center modeled after Miami-Dade County, Florida. Legislation introduced by Representative Fattah and Senator Landrieu would require a White House Conference on Children and Youth in 2010 to improve child welfare systems at the state and local levels. The bill aims to reduce child abuse and neglect, decrease the number of children in foster care, and increase permanent placements through family reunification, kinship placements, and adoption. It requires HHS to organize a White House Conference with other federal entities and authorizes $10 million in appropriations. The Adoption Tax Credit is available to offset costs for adopting eligible children. Under current law, adoption tax benefits totaling $362 million were claimed by over 56,400 taxpayers, benefiting more than 65,800 children. Approximately half of the children were adopted domestically, one-third internationally, and the rest had special needs and were adopted domestically, primarily from foster care. Individuals adopting children with special needs can claim the full adoption tax credit without incurring any adoption-related costs. H.R. 5466 and S. 3038 would require states to inform individuals adopting children from foster care as part of their Title IV-E plan. The adoption tax credit allows individuals adopting children from foster care to claim tax benefits without documenting expenses. Legislation such as H.R. 273, H.R. 471, H.R. 1074, H.R. 3192, and S. 561 aim to make these provisions permanent and increase the maximum adoption tax benefits. The adoption tax credit, established in 1996, initially provided up to $5,000 in qualified adoption costs for any child, or up to $6,000 for children with special needs. The credit was available for taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes up to $75,000 and was non-refundable. In 2001, the credit was expanded to $10,000 and adjusted annually for inflation. H.R. 4313 would expand the tax credit for adopting children aged nine or older. The adoption tax credit was initially set at $10,000 and adjusted annually for inflation. The income limit for taxpayers was increased to $150,000, with the full credit amount available for adopting a child with special needs. However, the tax provisions were subject to a sunset date of December 31, 2010, which would revert the credit back to $5,000 for tax year 2011. Taxpayers with adjusted incomes of $75,000 or more would see a decline in the allowable credit, and those adopting children with special needs would need to show qualified costs to claim the credit. The adoption tax credit amount was increased to $15,000 for tax year 2008 and would continue to increase annually based on inflation. The bill would also make the tax credit refundable, allowing taxpayers to be reimbursed for all qualified adoption costs without needing to owe taxes in that amount for the given year. In tax year 2005, the unused adoption tax credit exceeded the allowed amount. The ADOPT Act of 2007 aimed to provide additional tax benefits for families adopting children aged 9 and older. Taxpayers could claim an additional $2,000 annually for each year after adoption until the child's 19th birthday, without income limitations. The Birthparents Assistance Act of 2008 (H.R. 5640) proposes grants for post-adoption services and counseling for birthparents, including a national hotline and training for birth care facilities. H.R. 5640 proposes grants for post-adoption services and counseling for birthparents, including training for birth care facilities. It would require HHS to provide technical assistance, evaluate services provided by grantees, and report to Congress. The bill authorizes appropriations of $30 million for FY2009 and additional funding for FY2010 through 2013. Adoption Incentives program funding authorized under Section 473A of the Social Security Act set to expire in FY2008. Bush Administration proposes legislation to increase bonuses, H.R. 5466 would reauthorize funding through FY2013. Program created in 1997 to encourage adoption of children from foster care. Adoption numbers increased significantly from FY1995 to FY2013. Since FY1995, child welfare agency involvement in adoptions has doubled to around 50,000-53,000 annually. States earned $221 million in incentives for adoptions finalized between FY1998 and FY2006. The largest bonuses were paid in the early years of the program. In FY2006, 19 states earned a total of $7.4 million in incentives. States must increase adoptions from their foster care caseload to be eligible for incentives. The Adoption Incentive Program rewards states for increasing adoptions from their foster care caseload. States can earn bonuses for adoptions of children aged nine or older, Title IV-E eligible children with special needs under the age of nine. Bonuses are awarded based on three baselines established for each state. States receive $4,000 for each adoption exceeding the baseline, $4,000 for older child adoptions, and $2,000 for Title IV-E eligible special needs children under nine. H.R. 5466 and S. 3038 would reauthorize funding for the Adoption Incentives program at $43 million annually for FY2009 through FY2013. Both bills would increase incentive awards for adoptions of children aged nine and older and special needs children under nine. The base year for determining adoption increases would be fixed at FY2007. Both H.R. 5466 and S. 3038 would reauthorize funding for the Adoption Incentives program at $43 million annually for FY2009 through FY2013. The base year for determining adoption increases would be fixed at FY2007, with additional funds available for states that increase adoptions from foster care and place children into legal guardianships. The President's Budget requests $20 million for Adoption Incentives in FY2009, proposing to set FY2007 as the baseline year for adoption incentives and doubling the adoption bonus for children aged nine and older. This change aims to better reflect recent changes in the child welfare population and provide a true fiscal incentive for increasing adoptions. The Administration proposes to increase Adoption Incentive awards for older special needs children to address the growing number of children waiting to be adopted. The funds received by states can only be used for finalizing adoptions or other permanency options, not for post-adoption services. Funding for CAPTA was last reauthorized in 2003 and the Administration's FY2009 budget requests a \"straightline reauthorization\" with funding authority of \"such sums as may be appropriated.\" The budget includes funding for home visitation initiatives and a feasibility study on a national child abuse and neglect offender registry. CAPTA authorizes funding for grant programs to improve child protection systems, prevent abuse, and conduct research. Funding was authorized at $200 million for FY2004 and beyond, but actual appropriations have never exceeded $106 million. HHS administers these funds, and while no bill for CAPTA reauthorization has been introduced, there are bills to amend it, such as H.R. 3409. H.R. 3409 and S. 2237 propose amendments to CAPTA, with H.R. 3409 focusing on youth homelessness and extending funding authority, while S. 2237 authorizes additional funds for child welfare services and community-based activities to prevent child abuse and neglect. S. 2237 also introduces a new funding authorization of $545 million for parent education, counseling, and community-based grants under CAPTA. H.R. 5876, the Stop Child Abuse in Residential Programs for Teens Act of 2008, would amend CAPTA to require states to develop licensing standards for residential programs serving youth with emotional or behavioral issues. It would also mandate the creation of a public database of programs covered by these standards. S. 2341, S. 2944, and the Adoption Opportunities program are legislative measures related to child welfare. S. 2341 proposes a grant program for youth aging out of foster care, S. 2944 calls for a national study of the child welfare workforce, and the Adoption Opportunities program was last reauthorized in 2003. No reauthorization legislation has been introduced as of early 2008. The Adoption Opportunities program, authorized at $40 million for FY2004 and varying amounts for FY2005-FY2008, received $26.4 million in FY2008. Administered by HHS, funding is distributed through competitive grants supporting adoption information, special needs adoption, and recruitment of adoptive families. Grants also fund research, services, and training related to adoption. The Abandoned Infants Assistance program, established in 1988 in response to concerns about \"boarder babies\" due to drug abuse by parents, provides grants for reducing adoption barriers and supporting adoptive families. Reauthorized in 2003 with funding authorized at $45 million for FY2004 and subsequent years. The Abandoned Infants Assistance program, established in 1988 to prevent abandonment of infants exposed to HIV/AIDS and drugs, received $11.6 million in FY2008. No reauthorization legislation has been introduced, but the Administration requested a \"straightline reauthorization\" with funding authority of \"such sums as may be appropriated.\" Funds are distributed through competitive grants or contracts to address the needs of abandoned infants, especially those with special medical needs. The Abandoned Infants Assistance program, established in 1988 to prevent abandonment of infants exposed to HIV/AIDS and drugs, received $11.6 million in FY2008. Funding supports recruiting and retaining foster families, providing residential care programs, and training health and social services personnel for abandoned infants. Grant funding also supports the National Abandoned Infants Assistance Resource Center. Children's Advocacy Centers coordinate a multi-disciplinary response to child abuse. Funding authority for this program expired. The funding authority for the Children's Advocacy Centers program, which coordinates a multi-disciplinary response to child abuse, expired in FY2005. Congress has continued to appropriate funds for this purpose, but as of early February 2008, no legislation has been introduced to reauthorize funds for this program. The Administration has proposed combining funding and program authority for this program and others into a single \"Child Safety and Juvenile Justice\" program, to be distributed on a competitive basis to assist state and local governments in addressing child safety and juvenile justice needs. The Children's Advocacy Centers program, authorized under the Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990, provides funding to support local and regional CACs, as well as training and technical assistance. Despite the expiration of funding authority in 2005, Congress has continued to allocate funds for the program. Additionally, funding is also provided for expanded technical assistance and training to improve the judicial system's handling of child abuse and neglect cases. The funding authority for the program addressing child abuse and neglect cases expired in FY2005, but Congress has continued to appropriate funds for it. No legislation has been introduced to reauthorize funds for this program as of early February 2008. The funds are administered by the Department of Justice and have supported the \"Model Courts Initiative\" of the National Council for Juvenile and Family Court Judges. Despite the expiration of funding authority, Congress has continued to provide funds, with $2.4 million appropriated for FY2008. Funds for Adoption Awareness program were appropriated by Congress for FY2008, totaling $12.4 million. The program supports infant and \"special needs\" adoptions under the Public Health Service Act. HHS administers the funds, with $9.6 million allocated for infant adoption awareness through competitive grants or contracts to eligible health centers for training staff to provide adoption information to pregnant women. The Adoption Awareness program funds were appropriated by Congress for FY2008, totaling $12.4 million. Health centers are required to provide adoption information to pregnant women equally with other options. Special needs adoption awareness funds of $2.9 million are distributed through competitive grants for a national campaign. The President's Child Welfare Option and the Pew Commission have proposed changes to federal child welfare fund distribution. The President's FY2009 budget proposes a new method for states to finance foster care programs and child welfare services, offering a flexible grant over five years. This plan aims to support families in crisis and at-risk children. No specific legislative language has been introduced yet, but states could opt for an annual pre-established grant amount for five years under this proposal. The FY2009 budget proposes a flexible grant for states to finance child welfare services over five years, based on Title IV-E funding. States can use the grant for various child welfare activities without restrictions on eligibility criteria. The FY2009 budget proposes a flexible grant for states to finance child welfare services over five years, based on Title IV-E funding. States would need to uphold child safety protections, maintain state investment in child welfare programs, and participate in HHS-administered reviews. States facing a foster care crisis could access TANF contingency funds. The proposal includes set-asides for Indian tribes and monitoring of state foster care programs. The Pew Commission in May 2004 released recommendations to restructure the federal child welfare system, including removing income eligibility requirements for Title IV-E adoption assistance and foster care maintenance payments. The Commission also suggested reducing the federal reimbursement rates for these payments to lower costs. The Pew Commission recommended reducing federal reimbursement rates for adoption subsidies and foster care maintenance payments, with a proposed 35% reduction. They also suggested a three-year adjustment period to ensure states receive the same level of funding as before. Additionally, the Commission proposed creating a single grant program for services, case management, and training funds. The Pew Commission recommended creating a \"Safe Children, Strong Families\" grant program that would provide capped, mandatory funding for child welfare purposes, excluding foster care maintenance payments. The grant would combine funding from Title IV-B and Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, with an initial funding level of about $3.7 billion enhanced by $200 million in the first year. The Commission proposed a \"Safe Children, Strong Families\" grant program with initial funding of about $3.9 billion, distributed to states based on current funding shares. The grant would be indexed to grow annually by 2% plus inflation, with a federal matching rate of about 68% to ensure equal federal support for all states. The Commission recommended that states continue to claim open-ended reimbursement for State Automated Child Welfare Information Systems at a 50% federal reimbursement rate. Other recommendations included federal reimbursement for children exiting foster care to legal guardianship, direct federal reimbursement claims for Indian tribes under Title IV-E programs, and removing funding limits for territories. Adoption incentive payments would also be revamped. The Commission recommended revamping adoption incentive payments to reward states for finding permanent homes for children, transferring unspent foster care funds to the Safe Children, Strong Families Grant, providing enhanced federal matching rates for states that improve child welfare workforce competence, investing penalties for noncompliance in Program Improvement Plans, and reserving funds for research and best practices sharing. In May 2007, a partnership of eight organizations proposed child welfare reform, emphasizing the need to renew and strengthen the federal-state partnership. The organizations included AFSCME, APHSA, Catholic Charities USA, CLASP, CWLA, Children's Defense Fund, National Child Abuse Coalition, and Voices for America's Children. Their reform proposals focused on federal financing and were not provided in legislative form. The partnership of eight organizations proposed child welfare reform in May 2007, focusing on renewing and strengthening the federal-state partnership. Their proposals, not in legislative form, aim to guarantee services and safe homes for at-risk children by amending Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. This includes expanding federal eligibility for Title IV-E foster care and allowing states to use funds for a broader range of purposes without converting to a block grant. The partnership's proposal suggests that states reducing foster care caseloads can reinvest federal Title IV-E funds in services to prevent abuse or neglect. It also recommends using funds for post-permanency services, subsidized guardianship, and transitioning older youth out of foster care. Additionally, it calls for tribal access to funding and relative-specific licensing standards. The partnership proposes changing the federal matching rate for casework activities under the Title IV-E program to the state's Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), allowing states to establish relative-specific licensing standards with safety protections and criminal background checks. This would increase federal matching rates for casework activities related to child and family needs, permanency plans, and foster parent supervision. The partnership proposes changing the federal matching rate for casework activities under the Title IV-E program to the state's Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), allowing states to use child welfare funds for evaluations and expand training support eligibility. The partnership proposes allowing federal Title IV-E reimbursement at a 75% matching rate for training topics related to child safety, permanency, and well-being. States can make claims for private child welfare agency workers, court personnel, and other social service agency workers. States would also be required to report annually on funds spent on specific services to enhance accountability. The partnership proposes federal Title IV-E reimbursement at a 75% matching rate for training on child safety, permanency, and well-being. States must report annually on funds spent on services, number of children served, service duration, and access issues. The U.S. Government Accountability Office will evaluate reforms' effectiveness in enhancing services, foster care placements, worker recruitment, and child outcomes. States can submit additional data during the Child and Family Services Review process to increase knowledge about children's outcomes. Appendix B outlines the Title IV-E Foster Care Eligibility Criteria for state-level data reporting during the Child and Family Services Review (CFSR) process."
