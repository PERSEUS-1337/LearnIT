    "content": "The \"Endangered Salmon Predation Prevention Act\" emphasizes the importance of preventing sea lion predation on salmon stocks in the Columbia River. It calls for continued funding for lethal and nonlethal measures to protect endangered and threatened species. The Act also amends the Marine Mammal Protection Act to allow for the temporary removal of marine mammals in the Columbia River and its tributaries to safeguard salmon populations. The Secretary may issue a permit to authorize lethal taking of sea lions in the Columbia River and its tributaries to protect endangered salmon, steelhead, lamprey, and sturgeon species. An eligible entity can apply for a permit from the Secretary to authorize lethal taking of sea lions in the Columbia River and its tributaries for a maximum of 5 years, with established procedures for coordination and monitoring. The Secretary may renew permits for lethal taking of sea lions for up to 5 years, with annual takings limited to 10% of the annual potential biological removal level. Intentional lethal takings must be humane and follow specific protocols. The Endangered Salmon Predation Prevention Act allows for the humane chemical euthanasia of sea lions by authorized agencies or individuals. If after 5 years the Secretary determines that lethal removal is no longer necessary to protect fish species, permits for lethal removal will be suspended. Eligible entities are defined as those involved in removal activities in the mainstem. Entities eligible for removal activities in the mainstem of the Columbia River and its tributaries include the states of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, as well as the Nez Perce Tribe, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon, and the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation. Entities eligible for removal activities in the Columbia River and its tributaries include the states of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, as well as recognized tribal committees and the Columbia River Intertribal Fish Commission. The Secretary may delegate authority to these entities for removal activities in specific areas of the river.

The term 'Indian tribe' is defined in section 4 of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. This Act does not affect any treaty rights of federally recognized Indian tribes. The Secretary of Commerce will study and report to Congress on the impact of deterring and lethally taking sea lions on the recovery of endangered salmon and steelhead stocks in the Columbia River and its tributaries.
