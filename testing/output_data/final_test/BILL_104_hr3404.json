    "content": "The Safe and Affordable Manufactured Housing Improvement Act of 1996 is referenced in terms of amendments to the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. Definitions are provided in Section 2 of the Act. Section 603 (42 U.S.C. 5402) is amended to define 'Federal manufactured home construction and safety standard' as a performance standard for manufactured home construction, design, and transportation. It also introduces new definitions for 'consensus committee' and 'consensus process'. The consensus process involves the consensus committee recommending changes to the Federal manufactured home construction and safety standards. Transportation refers to moving manufactured homes or components from the manufacturing facility to the retailer's location or the purchaser's site. The Secretariat is the organization chosen to oversee the consensus process. The Secretary oversees the consensus process and appoints members of the consensus committee. SEC. 3. FEDERAL MANUFACTURED HOME CONSTRUCTION AND SAFETY STANDARDS. The Secretary is authorized to establish Federal manufactured home design, construction, transportation, and safety standards through a consensus process. This process must be reasonable, practicable, and reflective of current building standards and technology. The Secretary can establish standards for manufactured homes through a consensus process. This process includes appointing a committee, conducting open meetings, and allowing public comment before any final actions are taken. The consensus committee established under section 553 and subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code, shall be selected and function according to procedures set by the American National Standards Institute. Committee members must be qualified, certified by the Institute, and provided with staff resources. The committee is responsible for maintaining and revising Federal manufactured home standards. The consensus committee, established under section 553 and subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code, is responsible for maintaining and revising Federal manufactured home construction and safety standards. Revisions to the standards are considered over a 2-year cycle, with proposed standards or revisions published for public comment in the Federal Register. The Secretary may adopt or reject the standards submitted by the committee. The Secretary must issue a final order adopting or rejecting a proposed standard within 180 days of submission by the consensus committee. If the Secretary rejects the standard, it must be published for public comment. If the Secretary fails to take action within the 180-day period, the recommendations of the consensus committee will take effect after 60 days. The consensus committee's recommendations will take effect 60 days after the 180-day period. If the Secretary fails to act within this time frame, the committee will publish notice of the revised standards and their effective date. The Secretary can request interim emergency standards from the committee in response to health or safety emergencies, with a 60-day deadline for submission. Written interpretations can also be requested by interested parties. The consensus committee must provide written interpretations of the Federal manufactured home construction and safety standards, which become binding after notice and comment rulemaking procedures by the Secretary. The Secretary can reject interpretations only if they are inconsistent with the title's purposes. Subsection (b) clarifies that all recommendations are effective unless expressly provided otherwise. In subsection (c), orders for Federal manufactured home construction and safety standards must specify the effective date. Preemption prohibits states from enforcing standards unless expressly authorized. The standards mandated by the United States Housing Act of 1996 for manufactured homes are exhaustive and supersede State and local laws. The consensus committee and the Secretary must consider relevant data to promote the purposes of the Act when recommending and establishing performance standards. The United States Housing Act of 1996 mandates exhaustive standards for manufactured homes, superseding State and local laws. The consensus committee and the Secretary consult with agencies, consider performance standards' reasonableness and cost impact, and assess their contribution to the Act's purposes. Subsections are redesignated accordingly. The Manufactured Housing Improvement Act of 1996 mandates the use of consensus process for adopting or amending standards. The consensus committee can establish evaluation methodologies based on need determined by the Secretary. Compliance with existing standards can be determined through these methodologies. The Manufactured Housing Improvement Act of 1996 requires consensus process for adopting or amending standards. Section 610 is amended to reflect this change. SEC. 4. INSPECTION FEES. Section 620 (42 U.S.C. 5419) is amended to address inspection fees. The Secretary may establish and impose fees on manufactured home manufacturers, distributors, and dealers to cover inspection expenses. Fees collected will be deposited in a dedicated fund and used only for specified functions, subject to approval in an appropriations Act. Annual reports on fund expenditures will be provided to Congress. The Secretary must disclose information on funds collected, disbursed, and balance to the public in accordance with disclosure laws."
