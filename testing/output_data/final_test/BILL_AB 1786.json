    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The State of California establishes the California Standardbred Sires Stakes Program for standardbred horses bred in the state. Horses eligible for the program must be offspring of registered California standardbred stallions or stallions from specific locations. The California Standardbred Sires Stakes Program is overseen by the board and administered by the California Standardbred Sires Stakes Committee. The committee consists of five members and one alternate chosen by the California Harness Horsemen\u2019s Association. Administrative expenses are limited to 4 percent of the program's income, with all expenses requiring board approval. The board is responsible for ensuring proper administration and establishing rules for race classes, horse eligibility, fees, and prizes. The California Standardbred Sires Stakes Program involves fees for horses and races, registration of California stallions, mares, and foals, and other necessary matters for program administration. Funds are deposited with the California Standardbred Sires Stakes Committee for distribution as approved by the board. Breakage funds are used to support the program and increase purses according to specific criteria. The California Standardbred Sires Stakes Program awards a percentage of total purses to standardbred breeders and owners of registered California standardbred stallions based on the amount of purse money earned by each horse. The distribution percentages vary from 10% to 100% depending on the year and type of race. The California Standardbred Sires Stakes Program allocates funds to purses for races for two-year-old and three-year-old fillies owned by California residents. The schedule of races is determined by the board based on specific criteria. California standardbred sires stakes races are scheduled for two-year-old or three-year-old trotters and pacers, with the option for four-year-old or aged horses. Base purses are determined by the committee, and the purse distribution for each race division is 50% for 1st place, 25% for 2nd place, 12% for 3rd place, 8% for 4th place, and 5% for 5th place."
