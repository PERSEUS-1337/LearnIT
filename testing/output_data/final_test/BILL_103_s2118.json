    "content": "The \"Violent Crime Intervention Act of 1994\" establishes a national criminal records database to address the incomplete and outdated information in many state systems. Less than 20 percent of criminal records are fully computerized, hindering crime-fighting efforts. Developing a complete and accurate nationwide database is deemed a national urgent priority. The Attorney General will issue guidelines for states to qualify as fully participating members of the Interstate Identification Index within 180 days of the Act's enactment. Requirements include timely submission of arrest reports and audits of state criminal records to ensure accuracy. The Attorney General will issue guidelines for states to qualify as fully participating members of the Interstate Identification Index. States must report audit results annually, certify compliance with the law, and meet other conditions determined by the Attorney General. Non-qualifying states must pay a user fee for each identification request to the Index. SEC. 103. AUTHORIZATION. $100,000,000 authorized for grants to States to improve criminal record databases for Interstate Identification Index membership. The Congress finds that violent criminals often serve only a small portion of their original sentences, leading to a significant proportion of serious violent crimes being committed by released criminals who then travel to other states to commit more crimes. This affects tourism, economic development, and other commercial activities. State policies on early release of violent criminals have interstate implications. The purpose of this title is to reduce violent crime by holding States accountable for releasing violent criminals early, impacting other States and requiring Federal law to intervene. SEC. 202. CAUSE OF ACTION. The victim of a violent crime can sue a State in federal court if the perpetrator had a prior violent offense conviction, was released early from incarceration, and committed the crime before the original sentence would have ended. The State is not liable if it requires violent criminals to serve their full sentence. The term \"crime of violence\" is defined as in section 16 of title 18, United States Code. The State is responsible for damages to the victim. A State can be held liable for actual damages resulting from a violent crime in an action brought under this title, but not for punitive damages."
