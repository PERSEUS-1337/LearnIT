    "content": "The \"Elder Justice Reauthorization Act\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress finds that elder abuse is a significant issue, with at least 10% of older Americans experiencing it. Victims of elder financial abuse lose an estimated $2.9 billion annually. Elder abuse victims are more likely to end up in hospitals and nursing homes. Adult protective services lack dedicated Federal funding, leading to underreporting and underestimation of elder abuse cases. The Federal Government plays a crucial role in addressing elder abuse by promoting research, training, public safety, data collection, and the development of protective services. There are disparities in state laws and practices regarding elder abuse, leading to inequities in prevention and services. The government should support similar efforts as those for child abuse and domestic violence. The Federal Government should lead efforts to prevent elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation by promoting coordinated planning and sharing knowledge. This comprehensive approach involves integrating various agencies and recognizing the roles of adult protective services and long-term care ombudsman programs. The need for prevention, detection, reporting, investigation, assessment, and treatment of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation at all government levels is emphasized. It ensures trained personnel are in place to provide services and cultural competency to address diverse older adult populations. Balancing an elder's self-determination with society's responsibility to protect elders is crucial. The future well-being of older adults is at risk due to elder abuse, requiring a coordinated Federal response. Prevention of elder abuse is a wise investment that can save Medicare and Medicaid costs in the future. Victims of elder abuse suffer long-lasting effects. SEC. 3.
