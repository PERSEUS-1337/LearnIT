    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Working Together for Rural Access to Mental Health and Wellness for Children and Seniors Act\". Congress acknowledges the national problem of providing adequate mental health care in rural communities, where accessing specialized services is difficult. Rural primary care providers are seeing an increase in mental health issues, with the Surgeon General estimating that 21 percent of children experience mental health disorders. Left untreated, these issues can lead to school failure, drug abuse, and incarceration. (4) 1 in 5 children and adolescents may have a diagnosable disorder, but 70-80% receive little help. (5) Schools lack resources for mental health interventions, needing sustainable funding. (6) Mental health is crucial for all youth to succeed in school. (7) Telemental health collaborations are necessary to improve services in remote areas. (8) Telemental health is effective for diagnosing and treating mental health conditions in rural areas. The purpose of this Act is to provide assistance to rural areas for improving access to mental health care through collaborative efforts, mobile health services vans for students, and telemental health services for individuals of all ages.
