    "content": "The \"Small Business Contract Equity Act of 2000\" may be cited as the Act. Procedures for bundling contracts are outlined in the Act. Procedures for Bundling of Contracts under the \"Small Business Contract Equity Act of 2000\" require the submission of a draft solicitation to the Small Business Administration for determination if it would result in a bundled contract. The Administrator must determine if a draft solicitation would lead to a bundled contract and submit this determination to the department or agency head. If bundling is identified, market research must be conducted before publishing the solicitation. Within 45 days of the Administrator's decision, a study supporting the bundled contract must be submitted to the Administrator by the department or agency head. The Administrator must review a study supporting a proposed bundled contract to ensure it meets the standards set forth in the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997 and regulations. The study should demonstrate measurable savings and equal quality of goods or services to be procured. The Administrator reviews a study for a proposed bundled contract to ensure compliance with the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997. Any deficiencies in the study will be addressed by the Administrator, with proposed changes to the draft solicitation. If the agency head disagrees with the Administrator's determination, they can appeal to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The Director's decision is final and can be delegated to a subordinate official within the Office of Management and Budget. The Administrator reviews a study for a proposed bundled contract to ensure compliance with the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997. If the study meets the standards, the solicitation may be published in Commerce Business Daily. If the study does not meet the standards, the solicitation must be revised. The Administrator can waive requirements for a study if an unusual situation arises. Agency heads can appeal waiver requests to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, who will make a final decision within 5 days. The term \"bundled contract\" is defined in this section. The Administrator will promulgate regulations for implementing the bundled contract section within 30 days of enactment. Comments on proposed rules will be accepted for 45 days, and final rules will be published within 120 days if no objections are raised. If no final rule is published within 120 days after the effective date of the Act, the proposed regulations will automatically become final. SEC. 3 prohibits agencies from bundling contract requirements if they do not meet certain small business procurement goals. Prohibition on Bundling of Contract Requirements: Agencies are restricted from awarding or soliciting bundled contracts if they fail to meet small business procurement goals. The Small Business Act prohibits agencies from bundling contracts if they do not meet small business procurement goals. Deadlines for goal determination are specified, including a preliminary report due by September 15 each year. The Small Business Act requires agencies to report on meeting small business procurement goals by October 15 each year."
