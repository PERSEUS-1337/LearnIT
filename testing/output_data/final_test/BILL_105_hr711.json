The \"Public Benefit Bonds Innovative Financing Act\" amends the Internal Revenue Code to address the tax treatment of distributions from qualified retirement plans investing in public benefit bonds. This includes treating the distributee's investment in the contract as including their share of interest from the bonds for distribution purposes. The distribution from a qualified retirement plan investing in public benefit bonds is treated as described in subsection (e)(2)(B), with the distribution first allocated to the investment in the contract attributable to the interest. For distributions made over multiple years, the amount of public benefit bond interest considered for each calendar year is based on the prior year's allocation. In the final year, the interest received by the plan participant is included in the calculation. The term 'public benefit bond' refers to an obligation used for infrastructure financing, with specific criteria to qualify as such. A published rating and involvement of a governmental entity or public-private partnership are required for an obligation to be considered a public benefit bond. The term 'public benefit bond' refers to an obligation used for infrastructure financing, with specific criteria to qualify as such. A benefit bond must be designated as intended for public benefit and bear a legend to that effect. A qualified retirement plan includes a qualified retirement plan and an eligible deferred compensation plan. Dividends from regulated investment companies meeting certain requirements are treated under this subsection. For taxable year dividends, if interest on public benefit bonds exceeds 75% of gross income, the entire dividend is treated as interest. Otherwise, a portion is based on the company's interest income. Shareholders must be notified of regulated investment company distributions. The distribution by a regulated investment company designated as interest on a public benefit bond shall not exceed the amount specified in a written notice to shareholders within 45 days after the taxable year. Gross income for this purpose excludes gains from stock or securities sales. Definitions in this section include 'entity' as an individual, corporation, etc., and 'infrastructure facility' as specified. The term 'infrastructure facility' includes various transportation systems, water treatment facilities, waste disposal facilities, and other related structures, whether owned by public or private entities. The term 'public-private partnership' refers to an entity involved in developing infrastructure facilities through contracts with a State or its instrumentality, or under state regulation. The text discusses regulations regarding public-private partnerships for infrastructure development, specifically focusing on ownership and operation of infrastructure facilities by a combination of governmental and nongovernmental entities. Additionally, there is mention of an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code regarding the treatment of public benefit bond interest in qualified retirement plans. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code states that retirement plans will be treated as an investment in the contract. The effective date for these amendments will apply to distributions after the enactment of the Act."
