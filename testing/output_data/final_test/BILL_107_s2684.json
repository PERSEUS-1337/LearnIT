    "content": "The Dirty Bomb Prevention Act of 2002, also known as the Sealed Source Security Act, amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to enhance security measures for sealed sources. The term 'sealed source' refers to licensed byproduct material or special nuclear material sealed in a container to prevent leakage, excluding fuel or spent fuel. A 'security threat' includes sabotage, theft, or use in a radiological dispersal device involving a sealed source. The task force on sealed source security, established to address criminal activity involving sealed sources that could harm public health or safety, consists of key members including the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Transportation, the Attorney General, the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of Homeland Security. The task force on sealed source security, comprised of key members such as the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, is responsible for evaluating and enhancing security measures against potential threats. They will also consider input from other federal, state, and local agencies in this process. The task force on sealed source security will consider input from federal, state, and local agencies, stakeholders, industry experts, and the public. They will evaluate actions to establish a classification system based on the potential terrorist use of sealed sources and the threat to public health and safety. This system will consider factors such as radioactivity levels and dispersibility of sealed sources. The task force on sealed source security will establish a national system for recovery, storage, and tracking of sealed sources, considering factors like dispersibility and material form. The task force will establish a national system to impose fees on users of sealed sources, modify export controls, and improve security measures for sealed sources. The task force aims to improve the security of sealed sources through actions such as audits, evaluations of security measures, increased fines for violations, background checks, and physical security measures. The task force will submit a report to the President and Congress every 3 years detailing administrative and legislative actions to enhance the security of facilities with sealed sources. The Commission must take necessary actions within 60 days of the report submission. The Commission must revise the licensing system for sealed sources and ensure States with agreements under section 274b establish compatible programs promptly. Additionally, the Commission will arrange a study with the National Academy of Sciences to explore alternative uses of sealed sources within 60 days of enactment. The National Academy of Sciences will review current uses of sealed sources and identify processes that could be replaced with alternatives. A report on the study results must be transmitted to Congress within 1 year. Sec. 170B. Uranium supply and Sec. 170C. Sealed source security are key provisions in the legislation."
