Their performance has outperformed broader market indicators, prompting calls for including a REIT option in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) for federal workers. Legislation was introduced in 2005 to allow for this option, with hearings held to discuss the matter. This report summarizes the history of REITs, their recent strong performance, and arguments for their inclusion in the TSP. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) were introduced in the 1960s as a way to apply the mutual fund concept to real estate. The Real Estate Investment Trust Act of 1960 made REITs financially viable by exempting them from double taxation of shareholder dividends. To qualify for this tax exemption, REITs must distribute at least 90% of their income as dividends. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 further supported the development of the REIT market by allowing REITs to operate and manage property. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 allowed REITs to operate and manage property themselves, leading to an increase in investment funds. REITs specialize in various types of real estate, with equity REITs owning and operating properties, while mortgage REITs lend money to real estate owners. Hybrid REITs operate in both modes. Mortgage REITs are sensitive to interest rates, while equity REITs are affected by a range of economic fundamentals. REITs can be private or publicly held companies, with publicly held REITs trading on stock markets like any other corporation. The publicly traded REIT market has grown significantly since 1975, with 202 REITs listed on stock exchanges by February 2006, totaling $368 billion in market value. REIT stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 since 2000, attributed to favorable economic fundamentals post-2000 stock market crash and 9/11 attacks. Following the stock market crash in 2000 and the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates to historic lows, reducing the cost of borrowed funds. This led to a decline in long-term rates, benefiting real estate funding. Consumer spending has been strong since the end of the last recession in November 2001, positively impacting REITs investing in resorts and retail structures. Economic growth has been favorable for the industrial real estate sector, hotels, and lodging sectors, and office vacancy rates are decreasing in many parts of the country. Additionally, a wave of mergers has been observed. The rise in REIT share prices can be attributed to factors such as mergers, going-private transactions, and poor performance of other investments since the market peak in 2000. Low interest rates have also driven investors towards U.S. REITs in recent years. Investor dollars have been surging into U.S. REITs in recent years, affecting the performance of REIT shares not only by real estate fundamentals but also by other investment opportunities. The market value of REIT stocks has grown explosively since 1990, with market capitalization doubling since 2000, indicating significant growth through mergers, debt and equity financings, and internal growth. Investor perceptions of REITs have changed due to factors like mergers, external debt and equity financings, and internal growth. The behavior of REIT stocks may not be a reliable guide to future performance as the composition of real estate assets in REITs is constantly shifting. Additionally, investor movements in and out of REITs can impact the behavior of REIT stocks under different market conditions. Investor perceptions of REITs have shifted as the market has grown and understanding of the sector has increased. The correlation between REITs and traditional asset classes has decreased, making them a valuable source of portfolio diversification. The behavior of REIT stocks has changed, with investors now viewing them more as real estate investments than simply domestic equity investments. The investment characteristics of publicly traded REITs may not remain constant in the future. REIT stocks have outperformed the S&P 500, leading to concerns of overvaluation and a potential correction. Despite low cap rates in 2006, REIT stocks have risen by 13%. The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) is a tax-deferred retirement savings option for federal workers, similar to 401(k) plans for private sector employees. The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) offers five investment vehicles, including stock indexes like the S&P 500 (C fund), international stocks (I fund), and small to mid-size companies (S fund), as well as bonds (F fund) and government securities (G fund). There are also five \"lifecycle\" arrangements for investing based on projected time frames. Individual stock investments and sector-specific funds are not allowed in the TSP. The TSP offers various investment options, including stock indexes and bonds. Chairman Jon Porter introduced a bill for a real estate stock index investment option under the TSP to promote diversification among investors. Adding a REIT fund option to the TSP is the next logical step for federal employees, providing a valuable diversification tool with strong returns and risk reduction potential. Chairman Porter highlighted the benefits of including highly risky assets like REITs in a portfolio for enhanced overall returns. The TSP governing board and CEO have recommended against adding a REIT fund, citing that REIT stocks are already included in the stock funds offered by the TSP. The TSP governing board and CEO have recommended against adding a REIT fund, as REIT stocks are already included in the TSP's stock funds. The inclusion of REITs in the current funds provides hedging value and captures superior returns, allowing participants to increase their exposure to REITs beyond broad indices like the S&P 500. This could potentially lead to outperforming peers who stick to traditional stock options. The TSP governing board and CEO recommend against adding a REIT fund, as REIT stocks are already included in the TSP's stock funds. Participants who choose the REIT option could outperform peers in stock funds, but it is a volatile choice with potential losses. The TSP structure discourages \"return chasing\" by offering few investment alternatives. Educating against counterproductive investment behavior would be costly. Hedging and diversification benefits of new TSP funds are argued for. The TSP governing board and CEO recommend against adding a REIT fund due to the already included REIT stocks in the TSP's stock funds. Arguments against adding more investment options include concerns about fund expenses and the potential impact on total investment returns over time. Adding funds based on emerging markets, hedge funds, commodities, junk bonds, etc., could lead to increased expenses and potentially lower returns. Adding a REIT fund to the TSP may result in higher management and transaction costs, which could be above current levels. There are concerns about offering a wide range of investment choices to TSP participants, as it may lead to suboptimal behavior and unsuitable investment allocations. The argument for investor choice and self-direction is countered by concerns of paternalism. The question arises as to why the government or its designees should decide where TSP participants can invest their funds if individuals act rationally in their own self-interest. Behavioral finance research questions individual investors' ability to make optimal decisions with their funds. Studies show that those who choose balanced funds like TSP lifestyle options tend to achieve better returns than those who make allocation decisions themselves. This challenges the assumption that individuals always act in their best interest. The neoclassical assumption of rational self-interest may be simplistic. S. 2490 and H.R. 1578 were introduced in 2006. The Employee Thrift Advisory Council opposes adding a REIT option to the TSP. A study is commissioned to review the TSP investment policy. The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board is reviewing the existing TSP investment policy and considering adding more options, including a REIT option, with publication expected later in 2006."
