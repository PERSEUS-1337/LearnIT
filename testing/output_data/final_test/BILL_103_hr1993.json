    "content": "The text introduces a new section in the Internal Revenue Code allowing for a credit for employer expenses related to on-site day-care facilities. The new section in the Internal Revenue Code offers a credit for employer expenses on qualified day-care facilities. The credit is 50% of the qualified investment in property for the facility, not exceeding $150,000. Qualified investment includes costs for property used in the day-care facility with allowable depreciation deductions. The term 'qualified day-care facility' refers to a facility operated by an employer to provide dependent care assistance for employees' dependents, with specific criteria for eligibility. A qualified day-care facility must meet state and local regulations, including licensing requirements, and cannot discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. For facilities jointly operated by multiple employers, the definition includes those located on the premises of one employer. A qualified day-care facility must meet state and local regulations, including licensing requirements, and cannot discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. For facilities jointly operated by multiple employers, the definition includes those located on the premises of one employer within a reasonable distance from the premises of the other employers. If there is a recapture event with respect to any qualified day-care facility, the taxpayer's tax for the year will be increased by a certain percentage of the decrease in credits allowed for prior years if the qualified on-site day-care expenses were zero. The applicable recapture percentage for a qualified day-care facility is determined from a table based on certain criteria. The recapture percentage for a qualified day-care facility varies depending on the year of the recapture event, starting at 100% in Years 1-3 and decreasing to 0% in Years 11 and thereafter. Year 1 begins on the first day of the taxable year when the qualified day-care facility is put into service by the taxpayer. A recapture event includes the cessation of facility operation or a change in ownership of the facility with the credit allowable under subsection (a). The taxpayer acquiring an interest in a facility can assume recapture liability from the previous owner, making them responsible for any recapture liability as if there was no change in ownership. The tax for the taxable year is increased only for credits allowed by this section. The increase in tax under this subsection applies to credits allowed by this section, adjusting carryforwards and carrybacks if not used to reduce tax liability. No credits against tax for determining other credits under subpart A, B, or D. No recapture for casualty loss affecting a qualified day-care facility's operation. The special allocation rules for the credit allowable by this section include allocation in case of multiple employers jointly operating a qualified day-care facility, pass-thru in the case of estates and trusts, and allocation in the case of partnerships. The special allocation rules for the credit allowable by this section involve regulations set by the Secretary. If a credit is determined for property, its basis is reduced by that amount. If there is a recapture amount in a taxable year for property with reduced basis, the basis is increased by the recapture amount. The recapture amount refers to any increase in tax determined under subsection (d). No other deductions or credits are allowed with respect to the credit determined under this section. This section does not apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1996. Conforming amendments are made to Section 38(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The employer on-site day-care facility credit is added as a new paragraph in the tax code. This amendment is included in the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The employer on-site day-care facility credit, added as a new paragraph in the tax code, applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 1993."
