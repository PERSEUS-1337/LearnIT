The Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917 set the first aggregate limit on federal borrowing while maintaining individual limits on bond issues. In 1939, Congress set an aggregate limit on federal debt, giving the Treasury more flexibility in managing the debt. Some argue that the federal government experienced technical defaults in the late 1970s, but historical records suggest otherwise. The meanings of \"default\" or \"technical default\" are clearer in private contracts than when applied to the federal government. The issuance of Treasury securities is governed by the Universal Offering Circular, which does not address failure to pay or other types of default events. A breach of the debt limit does not necessarily imply delayed payments or other failures to uphold federal obligations. However, a fully binding debt limit breach could lead to systematic payment delays and damage the federal government's fiscal reputation and credit rating. The government's fiscal reputation, credit rating, and ability to borrow at advantageous rates were at risk due to a technical default in October 1977 when a temporary debt limit increase lapsed before a revised debt limit measure was enacted. Federal debt exceeded the statutory limit of $400 billion for two business days until the measure was resolved. Treasury could not borrow during this time, despite having sufficient cash reserves. The Treasury faced a temporary debt limit increase lapse in October 1977, leading to a technical default risk. Despite having enough cash reserves, borrowing was not possible until a new measure was enacted. No federal payments were missed or delayed during this period, indicating no technical default occurred. In a similar 1979 incident, delays in Treasury checks for interest payments and security redemptions occurred due to organizational issues, affecting a small portion of the Treasury securities market. The federal government faced delays in Treasury checks for interest payments and security redemptions in 1979, affecting a small portion of the market. Some attributed the delays to a debt limit episode, but a temporary increase in the debt limit had already been enacted. Market interest rate movements on the date of the first delay were likely influenced by Federal Reserve announcements rather than the payment delays. Contentious debt limit episodes have been a recurring issue in American government history. Debt policy discussions have been divisive in American government history. Since 1978, 27 out of 56 debt limit modifications were \"clean,\" not linked to other provisions. Combining debt limit modifications with other provisions may result from fiscal compromises among policymakers. Debt limit modifications have often been linked with other issues as part of fiscal compromises among policymakers. For example, in 2014, a debt limit increase was enacted alongside a measure reversing reductions in military retiree pensions. This practice dates back to 1939 when the modern debt limit was being created. In 1957, Congress declined to raise the debt limit until the following February to promote better management of money and manpower in the defense program. Debt limit debates in the 1960s and 1970s focused on federal spending, social insurance programs, and conflicts with the Nixon and Ford Administrations. In the mid-1980s, a debt limit provision was included with budget constraints. The debt limit episode of 1995-1996 was significant according to the U.S. General Accounting Office. The debt limit episode of 1995-1996 was considered a \"crisis\" by the U.S. General Accounting Office. Some have suggested minting platinum coins as a solution to the debt limit issue, with the face values of platinum coins not being limited. Proponents propose minting a high-denomination coin that could be exchanged for cash at the Federal Reserve for the U.S. Treasury's general fund, pending approval from both the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve System. The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve rejected the platinum coin strategy in 2013 and 2015 due to legal, accounting, and policy issues. This strategy could be seen as undermining Congress's fiscal powers and blurring the separation between fiscal and monetary policy. Printing money to finance expenditures could impact the value of the dollar. The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve rejected the platinum coin strategy in 2013 and 2015 due to legal, accounting, and policy issues, as it could impact the value of the dollar. The latter option would affect the dollar's value by signaling a reluctance to make fiscal adjustments or subordinating monetary policy goals. If the U.S. Treasury were to obtain cash balances via this strategy, the debt limit could restrict the issuance of federal securities, disrupting scheduled auctions and undermining the Treasury's reputation. The Public Debt Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment may justify unilateral presidential actions to avoid a federal default by ignoring the debt limit. However, some argue that such actions would be extraconstitutional and usurp congressional power. The clause is unlikely to justify spending funds beyond a congressionally imposed debt ceiling. The Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment aimed to assert federal powers to protect civil rights and prevent a rollback of constitutional reforms. After the Civil War, Congress focused on reconstruction efforts. The Wade-Davis Bill in 1864 aimed to prevent recognition of debts created by the Confederacy. Following Lincoln's assassination, President Johnson's inauguration led to congressional initiatives for reconstruction. Lawmakers prioritized federal guarantees for civil and political rights for former slaves, aiming to supersede the three-fifths clause in the Constitution. The three-fifths clause in the Constitution impacted House seat apportionment, potentially increasing delegations from former Confederate states. Concerns arose over shifts in political power and the possibility of a coalition repudiating federal debts. Congress has a constitutional obligation to pay debts, with guarantees under various clauses. The Public Debt Clause in the Constitution obligates the government to pay its debts, raising questions about the President's powers in the event of a default. Some argue that the President could borrow money beyond the debt ceiling to cover threatened debt, even without Congress's approval. The judiciary typically determines if Congress has violated constitutional provisions. The President's powers in providing relief to debt holders would depend on delegated, inherent, or implied power, such as the Borrowing Clause. The case of Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer addressed the President's authority in areas where Congress holds constitutional power. In this case, President Truman issued an Executive Order to seize and operate steel mills to avert a potential nationwide strike. The President issued an Executive Order to seize and operate steel mills without citing statutory authority. The Court ruled the seizure as beyond the President's authority. Justice Jackson's concurring opinion in Youngstown identified three scenarios for a President's exercise of authority in areas assigned to Congress by the Constitution. The President's authority to act is determined by three scenarios: when authorized by Congress, when acting independently, and when conflicting with Congress. In the last scenario, the President's power is limited to his own constitutional powers. The President's authority is determined by three scenarios: authorized by Congress, acting independently, or conflicting with Congress. In the case of conflicting with Congress, the President's power is limited to his constitutional powers. Presidential claims to power must be scrutinized carefully to maintain the constitutional equilibrium. The argument that the President can borrow beyond the debt ceiling imposed by Congress is not valid as the borrowing authority delegated by Congress is explicitly limited by the debt ceiling. In a conflict between Congress and the President over borrowing authority, the President's power is limited to constitutional powers. The President's ability to borrow beyond the debt ceiling set by Congress is questioned, with arguments based on the Public Debt Clause or necessity. However, for the President's actions to be upheld in court, they must be deemed within the President's domain and beyond Congress's control. The Public Debt Clause does not explicitly grant the President or executive branch the power to borrow beyond the debt ceiling set by Congress. It is seen as a limitation on the government's ability to default on debt issued under the Borrowing Clause. Calls have been made to eliminate the debt limit as it is considered obsolete and redundant. Some argue that the debt limit is a crucial aspect of congressional power, while others believe it is redundant and obsolete. Modifying the debt limit involves changing the limit amount or extending the suspension date, serving as a blunt instrument that forces policymakers to focus on fiscal issues."
