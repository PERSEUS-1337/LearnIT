    "content": "The \"Telehealth Modernization Act of 2013\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress finds that telehealth technologies can transform healthcare delivery by improving access to quality care, utilizing information and communication technologies to enable diagnosis, consultation, treatment, and care management of patients. This mode of healthcare delivery has the potential to reduce costs, improve quality, change conditions of practice, and enhance access to healthcare, especially in rural and medically underserved areas. A lack of primary care providers, specialty providers, and transportation remains a significant barrier. Telehealth innovations face regulatory hurdles inhibiting their proliferation in various states, with 40 out of 50 states introducing legislation on telehealth policy by June 2013. Healthcare providers in underserved areas lack access to mentors, colleagues, and information resources, hindering their professional development. Difficulty in attracting and retaining health professionals and supporting local health facilities further exacerbates the access to healthcare issue in rural and urban areas. Congress should establish a Federal definition of telehealth to provide clarity and guidance to states, ensuring high-quality care and promoting innovation in healthcare. This definition can strengthen the provider-patient relationship and enhance the use of telehealth services. The Federal standard for telehealth should be established by Congress to provide clarity and guidance to states, ensuring high-quality care and promoting innovation in healthcare. This standard can strengthen the provider-patient relationship and enhance the use of telehealth services. States should authorize health care professionals to deliver care through telehealth, with conditions including access to medical history and identification of underlying conditions. Health care professionals should identify underlying conditions and contraindications before providing diagnosis or treatment. They should have a conversation with the individual to establish any diagnosis and review contraindications to recommended treatment. Additionally, they should document evaluations, medical records, and provide medical information. The health care professional should document evaluation and treatment provided to the individual, offer medical information in standard format, and share documentation with other healthcare professionals. Additionally, they should provide transparency regarding their professional credentials to the individual. The health care professional should not guarantee any items or services, including prescriptions, in exchange for payment or completion of forms. Prescriptions must be issued for legitimate medical purposes. The prescription must be issued by a health care professional after conducting a medical evaluation, not for drugs in certain schedules, and filled by a licensed entity. This section does not affect HIPAA privacy regulations. The term \"telehealth\" refers to health care delivered by a professional to an individual not in person, using real-time video, secure chat, secure email, or integrated telephony. This does not impact the standard of care established by State law. Health care can be delivered by a professional through telehealth, without the need for in-person interaction."
