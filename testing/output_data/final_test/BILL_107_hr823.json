SEC. 103. REIMBURSEMENT OF STATES FOR INDIRECT COSTS RELATED TO INCARCERATION OF ILLEGAL ALIENS. Section 501 of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 is amended to include reimbursement for costs incurred by states for imprisoning illegal aliens or Cuban nationals convicted of a felony, as well as indirect costs such as court expenses, indigent defense, and probation costs. Authorization of $200,000,000 for fiscal years 2002 through 2005 to carry out subsection (a)(2). SEC. 104. REIMBURSEMENT OF STATES FOR COSTS OF INCARCERATING JUVENILE ALIENS. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 is amended to include provisions regarding juvenile aliens who have been adjudicated delinquent or committed to a correctional facility by a State or locality. The term 'juvenile alien' is defined as an alien who has been through this legal process. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 is amended to include reporting on illegal juvenile aliens committed to State or local juvenile correctional facilities for specific offenses. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 is amended to include reporting on juvenile aliens under section 501. SEC. 105 of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 is further amended to include reimbursement of states bordering Mexico or Canada for emergency health services to undocumented aliens. Reimbursements shall be allotted with special consideration for qualifying states. In fiscal years 2002 through 2005, $200,000,000 is available for allotments to certain States for payments related to undocumented aliens. The Secretary will calculate allotments for the 17 States with the highest number of undocumented aliens based on ratios of the total available amount and the number of undocumented aliens in each State. The amount of allotment to a State for a fiscal year not paid out under subsection (c) is available for payment in the subsequent fiscal year. The number of undocumented aliens in a State is determined based on estimates prepared by the Statistics Division of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The Secretary will pay amounts to each State for a fiscal year as described in a State plan submitted to the Secretary. The payments will be made to local governments, hospitals, and providers of emergency health services to undocumented aliens, taking into account their payments for emergency medical services under the approved State plan or an alternative proxy for measuring the volume of emergency health services. The government will measure emergency health services provided to undocumented aliens by local governments, hospitals, and related providers. Special consideration is given to those located in border counties or areas with a high number of undocumented aliens. Providers offering emergency health services are considered related to hospitals. The government measures emergency health services for undocumented aliens provided by local governments, hospitals, and related providers. Providers include physicians, healthcare professionals, and entities offering emergency ambulance services. The term \"hospital\" and \"provider\" are defined in the Social Security Act. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and \"State\" refers to the 50 States and the District of Columbia. $200,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2005 for this section."
