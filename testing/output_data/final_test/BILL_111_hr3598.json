    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Energy and Water Research Integration Act\" and pertains to energy and water research and assessment. The Energy and Water Research Integration Act requires the Secretary of Energy to assess energy programs for water integration, focusing on minimizing freshwater use, increasing water efficiency, utilizing nontraditional water sources, considering climate effects on water supplies, and understanding energy requirements. The Energy and Water Research Integration Act mandates the Secretary of Energy to develop a Strategic Plan within 6 months to address research, development, and demonstration needs for energy and water programs. Technical milestones will be evaluated and established as necessary. The Energy and Water Research Integration Act requires the Secretary of Energy to develop a Strategic Plan within 6 months to address research needs for energy and water programs, including new cooling technologies, water reuse, carbon capture, and cost-effective technologies. The Energy and Water Research Integration Act mandates the development of a Strategic Plan by the Secretary of Energy to address research needs for energy and water programs, including technologies for water reuse, carbon capture, and energy efficiency in water distribution systems. Additionally, the Act emphasizes the importance of technologies for treating produced waters from various industrial activities, utilizing nontraditional water sources for energy generation, biomass production, and reducing impacts on water from energy resource development. The Secretary of Energy is required to develop a Strategic Plan addressing research needs for energy and water programs, including technologies for water reuse, carbon capture, and energy efficiency in distribution systems. Collaboration with other federal agencies and avoiding duplication of activities within the Department of Energy is also mandated. The Secretary of Energy must consider relevant information and recommendations, including those from the National Water Availability and Use Assessment Program. Additionally, the Secretary should consult with representatives from research institutions and industry with expertise in energy and water technologies for the Strategic Plan. The Secretary of Energy is required to submit a Strategic Plan to Congress within 9 months of the Act's enactment, and update it every 3 years using information from various sources. The Strategic Plan will be implemented in energy research, development, and demonstration programs of the Department of Energy. The Secretary of Energy must apply the Strategic Plan to energy and water intensive projects with high potential, ensuring no unnecessary delays or disruptions. Reports on findings and activities must be submitted to Congress every 2 years. The Secretary of Energy will report findings and activities to Congress every 2 years. Additional research, development, and demonstration activities may be conducted to integrate water considerations into Department activities. $60,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2011 to 2015. The Energy-Water Architecture Council is established. The Energy-Water Architecture Council, established by the Secretary of Energy, will promote improved energy and water data collection, reporting, and innovation. It will include representation from Federal agencies and non-Federal members with expertise in energy and water technologies. The Council's functions include making recommendations on data standards and protocols. The Energy-Water Architecture Council will recommend improvements in data collection standards and protocols for energy and water usage in the United States. It will also suggest ways to enhance Federal water use data and promote best practices for utilizing existing monitoring networks. Additionally, the Council will conduct annual technical workshops to facilitate information exchange among experts on water and energy conservation technologies. The Energy-Water Architecture Council will provide reports to Congress on its findings and activities related to water and energy conservation. $5,000,000 is authorized for the Secretary of Energy annually from 2011 to 2015 for this purpose. The Act limits federal regulations to not infringe on water use by State, tribal, or local governments. It also states that governments are not required to take actions that increase financial burdens by restricting water use. The Secretary of Energy must coordinate activities with other programs to avoid duplication."
