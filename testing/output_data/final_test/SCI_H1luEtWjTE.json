    "content": "The study introduces a formal framework for analyzing and synthesizing driver assistance systems using formal methods and a stochastic human driver model based on ACT-R. It aims to design provably correct Advanced Driver Assistance Systems for semi-autonomous vehicles by integrating probabilistic ACT-R models and using an abstraction technique to represent continuous systems as Markov models. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated in various case studies, highlighting the importance of improving driver safety through semi-autonomous features. Some car manufacturers have introduced semi-autonomous features in the form of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Ensuring safety in these vehicles is a challenge, with existing methods relying on testing and simulation, which may not provide the necessary guarantees for a safety critical system. Recent works have used formal verification to obtain strong guarantees for ADAS, but they often overlook the cognitive process of the human driver. This study focuses on designing an ADAS that considers a stochastic model of the driver's cognitive process, using the Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) framework. This study focuses on computational behavioral models of human cognitive performance in the context of designing an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS). It builds on existing human driver models and applies verification techniques to ensure the system's correctness based on temporal logic statements. The goal is to verify the probability of the Human-Vehicle model satisfying certain conditions and to synthesize an ADAS that optimizes safety. The study focuses on computational behavioral models of human cognitive performance for designing an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS). It involves verifying the human driver model using temporal logic statements and synthesizing an ADAS to optimize safety. The human driver model is abstracted to a Markov Chain for verification using off-the-shelf tools like PRISM. The driver model is divided into control and monitoring modules for managing perception cues and vehicle manipulation. The study focuses on computational behavioral models of human cognitive performance for designing an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS). It involves verifying the human driver model using temporal logic statements and synthesizing an ADAS to optimize safety. The driver model is divided into control and monitoring modules for managing perception cues and vehicle manipulation. The abstraction combines decision making and monitoring into one module for efficiency, unifying them through the use of \u00b5 \u2208 {1, 2}. The state space S is automatically generated for a given set of initial conditions, with a time discretization induced for all continuous variables. The state space S is automatically generated with transition probabilities based on control laws and Gaussian noise. The Human-Vehicle-ADAS system includes interventions like passive suggestions and active control to influence decision making. The Human-Vehicle-ADAS system can influence decision making through suggestions and active control, with interventions at the acceleration and steering levels. The optimal ADAS design involves finding an optimal policy over a certain specification using tools like PRISM. The framework was implemented in Python using PRISM for computational analysis. To study the applications of the Human-Vehicle-ADAS system, a simplified two-lane scenario was considered with lead vehicle moving at constant speed. Two properties, DISPLAYFORM1 and DISPLAYFORM2, were focused on for minimization and maximization. \u03d5 1 represents system safety, while \u03d5 2 relates to time efficiency. Results showed improved satisfaction of desired properties when optimized individually, with \u03d5 1 decreasing and \u03d5 2 increasing in probability. This optimization was done using tools like PRISM in Python for computational analysis. The framework allows for studying the relationships between properties using multi-objective optimization techniques, showing a trade-off between safety and time efficiency. Further analysis is available in BID6, exploring more complex scenarios. This approach enables the design of robust ADAS for semi-autonomous vehicles with formal guarantees, with potential for learning specifications to match expert driver behavior in the future."
