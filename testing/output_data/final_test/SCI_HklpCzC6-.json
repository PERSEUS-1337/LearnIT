    "content": "Inspired by the visual cortex's computational processes, a novel approach using denoising autoencoders for iterative inference is proposed for capturing complex joint distributions. This method is applied to image segmentation, with the estimated conditional score guiding gradient ascent towards the mode of the distribution. Unlike traditional methods like conditional random fields, this approach does not require an explicit energy function for structured outputs. The proposed iterative inference method using denoising autoencoders outperforms models based on CRFs or without explicit modeling of joint distribution. The visual cortex can perform fast feedforward inference for quick answers, but requires more time for iterative inference in complex image interpretation tasks. Recent deep learning research suggests that early computation is feedforward, while later computation is iterative to capture complex dependencies. Iterative inference is used to sample from or converge towards a dominant mode of the joint conditional distribution of output variables given inputs. This approach allows for modeling complex and multimodal distributions, unlike purely feedforward networks. This paper proposes a novel approach combining feedforward and iterative phases to find the dominant mode of the conditional distribution for semantic image segmentation. The method utilizes denoising autoencoders to estimate the score of the joint distribution, allowing for the modeling of complex and multimodal distributions. The method involves using denoising autoencoders to estimate the conditional score for semantic image segmentation. Two training scenarios are compared, with scenario 1 yielding the best results. The autoencoder takes a candidate output y and input x to update y towards a lower-energy value iteratively. The denoising autoencoder is used to estimate the gradient of the energy for semantic image segmentation, updating the candidate output towards a lower-energy value iteratively. This approach offers an alternative to traditional graphical modeling methods like conditional random fields, potentially capturing dependencies of any order and across the image. The paper introduces a novel training framework for modeling structured output conditional distributions using denoising autoencoder estimation of energy gradients. It demonstrates how this framework can be applied to image pixel-wise segmentation by proposing highly probable segmentations through gradient descent in the output space. The proposed iterative inference method refines image segmentation using denoising autoencoder estimation of energy gradients. Theoretical analyses show that the autoencoder can estimate the gradient of the energy function for a joint distribution of observed variables. The denoising autoencoder learns a vector field pointing towards likely configurations of input data. By conditioning the autoencoder with additional features, it can estimate an energy function to refine image segmentation through gradient descent. During training, a denoising autoencoder can refine image segmentation by taking a corrupted segmentation candidate as input along with additional features extracted from a feedforward segmentation network. This approach aims to iteratively reach an estimated conditional distribution for energy minimization. The denoising autoencoder refines image segmentation by using a corrupted segmentation candidate and additional features from a feedforward network. The DAE is trained to reconstruct the clean segmentation by minimizing a loss function during training. The denoising autoencoder refines image segmentation by iteratively refining a segmentation proposal using a pre-trained segmentation network and a trained DAE model. The final prediction is obtained by applying a rule to collapse corruption noise and iteratively refining the segmentation candidate. The test pipeline in Figure 2 involves feeding an input image x to a pre-trained segmentation network, which outputs intermediate feature maps h and a segmentation proposal y. These are then used by a denoising autoencoder (DAE) to compute the final output \u0177. Recent advancements in semantic segmentation focus on improving architecture design, context understanding, and enforcing structure consistency in segmentation outputs. CRFs, such as fully connected CRFs and CRFs as RNNs, are popular choices for imposing structured information in segmentation networks. Recent advancements in semantic segmentation include utilizing CRFs like fully connected CRFs and CRFs as RNNs. Iterative approaches have been introduced to improve structure consistency in segmentation outputs, such as decomposing the prediction process into multiple steps and iteratively adding structure information. Additionally, residual networks have been reinterpreted to iteratively refine learned pre-normalized images for segmentation predictions. Some research has also focused on leveraging the results of DAE on tasks like image generation, high-resolution image estimation, and semantic segmentation. In the context of image segmentation, DAEs are utilized to refine segmentation predictions by combining them with convolutional pseudo-priors during training. This approach extends the use of DAEs in tasks like image generation and high-resolution image estimation. In image segmentation, DAEs are used to improve segmentation predictions by incorporating a conditional score and corrupted feedforward prediction during training. The experiments aim to determine if a conditional DAE can be effective for iterative inference in segmentation, if the proposed corruption model based on feedforward prediction is superior to target output corruption, and if the resulting system outperforms traditional segmentation approaches like CRFs. The CamVid dataset is utilized for training and testing, consisting of 367 training images, 101 validation images, and 233 test images. The experiments utilized the CamVid dataset with 367 training images, 101 validation images, and 233 test images. Two feedforward architectures were tested for segmentation: FCN-8 and FC-DenseNet103, both without additional synthetic data. FCN-8 consists of a convolutional downsampling path followed by an upsampling path, while FC-DenseNet merges features from different resolution levels. FC-DenseNet103 is a segmentation network with a downsampling path that concatenates feature outputs and an upsampling path that recovers information using skip connections. The DAE also has downsampling and upsampling paths with convolutions, pooling, unpooling with switches, and convolution operations. Reverting max pooling operations improves quality. Reverting max pooling operations improves image quality in the reconstructed images. Using fully convolutional-like architectures with upsampling and skip connections decreases segmentation results compared to unpooling with switches due to added noise injected during training. Skip connections propagate noise to end layers, affecting the denoising process. The DAE model consists of 6 interleaved pooling and convolution operations, followed by 6 interleaved unpooling and convolution operations, starting with 64 feature maps in the first convolution. The downsampling path of the network has feature maps in the following sequence: 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, and 2048. In the upsampling path, the feature maps decrease from 1024 to 11 (number of classes). Data augmentation includes random crops and flips during training. The DAE model is trained using stochastic gradient descent with RMSprop BID22, starting with a learning rate of 10^-3 and applying exponential decay after each epoch. During training, the model is regularized with weight decay and uses data augmentation techniques like random crops and flips. Gaussian noise is added to the input, and the models are trained for a maximum of 500 epochs with early stopping based on validation error. The step size and number of iterations for segmentation output are determined by evaluating on the validation set. The best combination is selected based on mean intersection over union (IoU) for the test set. Results for FCN-8 and FC-DenseNet103 are reported without post-processing. Using DAE's iterative inference on the segmentation candidates of a feedforward segmentation network outperforms state-of-the-art post-processing variants, improving upon FCN-8 by 3.0% IoU. Applying CRF as a post-processor improves FCN-8 segmentation results by 1.2%. Similar improvements are seen with the context module and CRF-RNN as post-processors. Our method maintains the performance of all classes. Our method does not decrease the performance of any class compared to FCN-8. CRF loses 2.8% segmenting column poles, while CRF-RNN loses 1.1% segmenting signs. Post-processing with FC-DenseNet103 shows a slight improvement of +0.5% in IoU. Comparing to other post-processors, our method shows a slight improvement. End-to-end training of CRF-RNN with FC-DenseNet103 did not improve over FC-DenseNet103. DAE(y) consistently outperforms DAE(y true ) by 2.2% for FCN-8. For FC-DenseNet103, differences are smaller but noticeable. In comparison to other methods, our model consistently outperforms DAE(y true) by 2.2% for FCN-8 and shows noticeable improvements for FC-DenseNet103. Training our model end-to-end with the segmentation network did not enhance results and was more memory demanding. The FCN-8 segmentation network struggles to properly identify objects like fences, while CRF can refine segmentation but cannot add missing structures. Our method improves segmentation by smoothing large regions like sidewalks. Our method improves segmentation by smoothing large regions like sidewalks and correcting predictions by incorporating missing objects such as fences. An analysis of the influence of step size and number of iterations on validation set performance was conducted for FCN-8 and FC-DenseNet103 segmentation networks. There is a trade-off between step size and iterations, with smaller steps requiring more iterations for optimal performance. Different parameter combinations within a reasonable range lead to similar maximum performances. The proposed method utilizes denoising autoencoders for iterative inference in image segmentation tasks. Experimental results show that a conditional DAE can effectively improve segmentation, the proposed corruption model outperforms target output corruption, and the segmentation system surpasses state-of-the-art methods."
