This Act covers every stage of the voting process, from voter registration through recounts and archiving. The Voting Technology Standards Act of 2001 establishes a commission to develop voluntary technical standards for voting products and systems. The commission includes the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology as chair, representatives from the National Association of State Election Directors and the American National Standards Institute, and nine additional members selected by the commission. The commission established by the Voting Technology Standards Act of 2001 includes members selected for specific terms ranging from 3 to 6 years, with the possibility of serving up to 3 terms.

Vacancies are filled for the remainder of the term, and travel expenses are provided according to applicable provisions. The Commission cannot conduct business without a quorum. The Commission requires nine members for a quorum to conduct business. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology provides administrative and technical support upon request. The Commission will establish voluntary technical standards within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The Commission requires nine members for a quorum and the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology provides support. Within 9 months of the Act's enactment, the Commission will establish voluntary technical standards for US voting products and systems, ensuring usability, accuracy, security, and integrity. These standards will be reviewed every even-numbered year for updates. The Commission will publish findings, explanations, and new voluntary technical standards when determining the need for them. SEC. 4. LABORATORY ACCREDITATION. The National Institute of Standards and Technology will accredit independent laboratories to test voting products for conformity with technical standards. Efforts will be made to accredit a minority-owned laboratory.\n\nSEC. 5. INFORMATION DISSEMINATION. The National Institute of Standards and Technology will disseminate technical standards, guidelines, and information to assist in implementing voluntary technical standards. They will also maintain a list of accredited laboratories and certified voting products and systems. The National Institute of Standards and Technology will establish a research and development program to support voluntary technical standards for voting products and systems. This includes research on computer security, voter privacy, human factors in voting system design, and remote access voting. Reports on these efforts will be submitted to Congress. The Commission will transmit a report to Congress within 1 year of the Act's enactment. The report will assess human factors research for voting products, recommend ways to improve accessibility for disabled voters, reduce errors, and spoiled ballots.

The Commission will transmit a report to Congress within 10 years of the Act's enactment. The report will identify compliant states, assess the impact on vote tabulation accuracy, and recommend methods to promote voluntary technical standards. It will also evaluate the need for a grant program to ensure sufficient testing laboratories for voting products and systems. The title of the bill will be amended to focus on ensuring the usability, accuracy, integrity, and security of US voting products and systems.
