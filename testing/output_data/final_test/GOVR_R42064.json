The program was created under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 during a period of economic downturn for the domestic auto industry. The Detroit 3 automakers faced challenges in meeting fuel economy standards compared to foreign manufacturers. The ATVM program is part of the government's efforts to support the automotive industry. The federal government has a history of supporting research and development incentives for new domestic energy sources, including efforts to promote energy innovation in vehicles dating back to the Ford Administration. The Department of Energy has continuously backed research on electric batteries, fuel cells, and alternative vehicle technologies to reduce petroleum dependence. Federal support has also extended to initiatives like the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles and the Freedom Cooperative Automotive Research. The ATVM program was enacted in late 2007 to address concerns over the competitive decline of the Detroit 3 automakers, who saw their market share erode from 66% in 2000 to around 45% in recent years. Congress also enacted tax credits in 2005 to encourage the purchase of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles. The ATVM program was enacted in late 2007 due to economic slowdown and rising gasoline prices. The U.S. unemployment rate doubled, leading to a decline in vehicle purchases. Global economic factors contributed to a significant drop in U.S. light vehicle production and sales from 2008 to 2009. The economic slowdown and rising gasoline prices led to the enactment of the ATVM program in late 2007. This resulted in a serious decline in vehicle production and sales in the U.S. from 2008 to 2009, impacting automakers and the entire motor vehicle industry supply chain. GM and Chrysler faced financial challenges and sought assistance from the U.S. government, including possible federal bridge loans from the ATVM program. The George W. Bush Administration initially planned to use ATVM funds for financial institutions but later provided TARP assistance to GM and Chrysler to prevent their failure. This funding helped the automakers restructure and avoid bankruptcy. The ATVM program remained unchanged as U.S. light vehicle sales and domestic production grew significantly. General Motors Corporation and Chrysler underwent restructuring and bankruptcy in 2009. The federal government owned a majority share of the successor company, General Motors Company, which was later sold to private investors. Chrysler is now owned by Fiat and the merged company is Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. In 2013, Chrysler had net income of $2.8 billion on revenue of $72 billion. Ford did not receive TARP funds and has been profitable since 2009, recording $7.2 billion in net income on $147 billion of revenue in 2013. The ATVM program was established in 2007 and funded in 2009, discussed in Congress in 2011 but ultimately not reduced. The ATVM program, established in 2007 and funded in 2009, was discussed in Congress in 2011 for disaster relief in the FY2012 Continuing Resolution. Congress did not reduce ATVM funding, and the program remains as originally authorized and funded. EISA raises fuel economy standards and provides incentives for domestic production of fuel-efficient cars and light trucks, requiring NHTSA to increase CAFE standards to reach at least 35 mpg by MY 2020. Before EISA, passenger car CAFE standards were held constant at 27.5 mpg for nearly two decades. The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) established an incentive program to promote the domestic manufacture of fuel-efficient vehicles and components by providing up to $25 billion in loans and grants for manufacturing facilities in the United States. Qualifying vehicles or components had to achieve at least 25% higher fuel economy than a comparable MY2005 vehicle. The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) established a program to promote domestic manufacture of fuel-efficient vehicles by providing up to $25 billion in loans and grants. Automakers lobbied Congress to fund the program, but it was not initially funded. In 2008, Congress appropriated $7.5 billion for loan defaults and $10 million for administrative expenses. Senator Jeff Bingaman highlighted the credit problems that led to funding the program in fall 2008. The ATVM program faced credit problems for manufacturers and suppliers, especially for cutting-edge technologies like electric vehicle batteries. Senator Carl Levin emphasized the importance of supporting US companies in automotive innovation. In 2009, Congress amended the EISA definition to include \"ultra efficient vehicles\" to promote fuel economy. The ATVM program includes \"ultra efficient vehicles\" achieving 75 mpg or higher, with specific design requirements. Emissions standards for advanced technology vehicles do not apply to ultra-efficient vehicles. In 2011, the program faced funding debates, with a proposal to cut $1 billion from ATVM to fund FEMA. In 2011, there was a proposal to cut $1 billion from the ATVM program to fund FEMA's disaster relief program. The House initially did not agree to the legislation due to opposition to the ATVM reduction, but it was eventually passed with minor changes. The Senate later deleted the supplemental FY2011 FEMA funding and the ATVM offset. The bill was agreed to by the House on October 4, 2011, and signed by the President the next day, keeping the ATVM program intact. In April 2014, two reports called for the rescission of unobligated balances in the ATVM program, and the House budget resolution for FY2015 recommended rescinding the unobligated balance. In April 2014, GAO recommended rescinding unobligated balances in the ATVM program due to low demand and lack of viable applications. Recent bills have been introduced to expand or eliminate the program, including a floor amendment to H.R. 2609 in July 2013. In 2013, Representative Broun's floor amendment to H.R. 2609 aimed to eliminate remaining ATVM funding and redirect $6 million in savings to spending reduction, but it failed. The Alternative Fueled Vehicles Competitiveness and Energy Security Act proposed by Senators Wyden and Stabenow sought to expand ATVM loans to heavy vehicle manufacturers and remove loan authority cap. Senator Thune filed an amendment in September 2013 to the Energy Savings and Industrial bill. In September 2013, Senator Thune filed amendment 1887 to eliminate the ATVM program under the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act of 2013. The program aimed to increase fuel economy, promote advanced technologies in US-made cars, and protect the government's financial stake in auto companies. Section 201 of H.R. 1999 proposed ending the ATVM program by rescinding unobligated budget authority. The subsection outlines eligibility standards for ATVM loans, including rules for labor compensation, financial viability, and repayment periods. It allows for a deferral of loan repayment for up to five years after project operation begins. Projects must be completed by the end of 2020, with priority given to older facilities. Despite criticism, subsequent loan awards did not favor union-organized automakers. The ATVM program prioritizes loans for manufacturers with existing facilities at least 20 years old. Foreign automakers with older U.S. plants have received loans, like Ford Motor Company. Eligible vehicles must meet emissions standards, not specific technologies or fuels. The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) sets requirements for vehicle emissions and fuel consumption, including meeting Clean Air Act standards and achieving 25% higher fuel economy than the average base year combined fuel economy. Loan recipients under EISA must be financially viable without additional federal funding for the project. The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) requires loan recipients to be financially viable and have a positive net present value. This led to some loans being denied, especially during the auto industry crisis. EISA also mandates that qualifying vehicles achieve at least 25% higher fuel economy than vehicles with similar attributes, with the Department of Energy determining which vehicles are considered similar. The DOE established 13 classes of passenger cars and four classes of light trucks for the ATVM program, with set fuel economy benchmarks. Loans under the program have specific terms, including loan duration, interest rate, repayment deferral, and the lender being the Federal Financing Bank. DOE evaluates loan applications based on technical merit and other selection criteria. The DOE has set selection criteria for ATVM loans based on technical merit, fuel savings, fuel economy improvements, and reductions in petroleum consumption. The program factors in economic development, geographic location, and technological diversity. Appropriations cover the subsidy cost, with Congress assuming a 30% subsidy rate. GAO estimates $3.3 billion in subsidy costs obligated to date, leaving $4.2 billion unobligated. Five vehicle manufacturers have received loans under the ATVM program, with no component manufacturer awarded a loan. Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz announced changes to the program to address capacity constraints and the need for expansion capital in the auto sector. ATVM loans are now available for component manufacturers as well as vehicle assemblers. No ATVM applications have been approved since 2011. The Department of Energy (DOE) made revisions to the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) program to allow loans for component manufacturers in addition to vehicle assemblers. However, no new loans have been approved since 2011. Despite active loan solicitation, no new loans were announced in 2014. The DOE has received one application for $200 million, but there is uncertainty about the program's effectiveness in attracting new applicants. The DOE is increasing outreach efforts to generate more interest in the program, but there is still a lack of demonstrated demand for ATVM loans. The DOE has not explained how it plans to address challenges from previous applicants regarding a burdensome review process. Determining the use of program funds is crucial in a constrained fiscal environment to avoid unused appropriations being rescinded or redirected. As of January 8, 2015, DOE had approved $8.4 billion in ATVM loans to five companies for various projects related to electric and hybrid vehicles, natural gas vehicles, and advanced components for conventional vehicles. All loans were given to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) for parts production and assembly. The DOE approved $8.4 billion in ATVM loans for projects related to electric and hybrid vehicles, natural gas vehicles, and advanced components for conventional vehicles. The projects aim to displace gasoline and reduce carbon dioxide emissions, but the current performance measures do not account for the impact of increasing fuel economy standards. Borrowers may have improved fuel economy even without the ATVM funds. The DOE approved $8.4 billion in ATVM loans for projects related to electric and hybrid vehicles, natural gas vehicles, and advanced components for conventional vehicles. The program aims to displace gasoline and reduce carbon dioxide emissions, but without knowing the actions companies might have taken without ATVM funding, the program may overstate its benefits. DOE and GAO estimate that vehicles produced under the program will exceed CAFE targets, but it is unclear if these improvements will lead to fleet averages that exceed the standards. The bulk of ATVM lending has gone to Ford. The ATVM program has provided loans mainly for vehicles with gasoline-powered engines, with Ford receiving a significant portion. Other loans have been given for natural gas, hybrid, and all-electric vehicles, accounting for 30% of total loan originations. The loans are projected to save or create about 38,700 jobs in the motor vehicle industry, with most of the jobs being at the loan recipients' facilities. These estimates reflect significant employment changes for the recipients. The DOE data show that only in one case are the jobs cited in calculations also at supplier firms. Of the more than 900 saved/created jobs at the Vehicle Production Group (VPG), 49 jobs were at VPG, 613 at companies supplying parts, and 267 at dealers and service organizations. GM and Chrysler are not current loan recipients, with Chrysler withdrawing a $3.5 billion loan request in 2012 and GM not meeting viability requirements for Section 136 loans. GM later applied for $14.4 billion in loans. GM withdrew its $14.4 billion loan application from the DOE due to a slow pace of consideration. Other applicants also faced delays and opted for commercial loans instead. A 2013 GAO report suggested that the costs of the program may outweigh the benefits for companies. The GAO recommended using independent engineering analysis to improve program evaluation before further loan disbursements. The GAO found that DOE's ATVM staff lacked engineering skills to evaluate technical progress of borrowers, leading to risks of non-compliance with loan agreements. Instances of improper fund usage and lack of critical monitoring were identified in projects by Nissan, Ford, Fisker, and Tesla. GAO recommended additional performance measures for better assessment. The GAO criticized DOE for not having adequate performance measures to assess whether loan recipients were meeting program goals, specifically in improving fuel economy of all passenger vehicles in the US. They also faulted DOE for not being able to determine the impact of ATVM on automakers meeting CAFE standards and for lacking performance standards to evaluate loan recipients' financial condition."
