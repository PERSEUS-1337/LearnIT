    "content": "The \"Invest in America Now Act of 2012\" is the short title of this legislation. It extends the allowance for bonus depreciation for certain business assets. The \"Invest in America Now Act of 2012\" extends the 100 percent bonus depreciation for certain business assets from January 1, 2012, to January 1, 2014. This includes amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and effective dates for the extension. The amendments made by this subsection apply to property placed in service after December 31, 2011, with a conforming amendment for property placed in service after December 31, 2010. The expansion of the election to accelerate AMT credits in lieu of bonus depreciation is also addressed in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The bonus depreciation amount for eligible qualified property placed in service by the taxpayer in a taxable year shall be determined under subparagraph (B), increasing the limitation imposed by section 53(c) for that year. The applicable depreciation method for such property is the straight line method. The bonus depreciation amount for eligible qualified property placed in service by the taxpayer in a taxable year is 20 percent of the excess of allowable depreciation over the aggregate amount allowed for such property in that year. The bonus depreciation amount for any taxable year is limited to 50 percent of the minimum tax credit under section 53(b) for the first taxable year ending after December 31, 2011. The bonus depreciation amount for any taxable year is reduced by the sum of bonus depreciation amounts for prior years with elections made under this paragraph, or the minimum tax credit under section 53(b) for the taxable year. The adjusted minimum tax for taxable years ending before January 1, 2012 is determined by treating credits on a first-in, first-out basis. All corporations treated as a single employer under section 52(a) are treated as 1 taxpayer for this purpose. Eligible qualified property is defined for this paragraph. For taxable years before January 1, 2012, the adjusted minimum tax is calculated using a first-in, first-out basis for credits. Eligible qualified property is defined as specified in the paragraph. The text chunk discusses the treatment of credits before and after specific dates, the refundability of credits under section 6401(b), and rules regarding elections under the paragraph. The text chunk addresses partnerships with electing partners in a corporation making an election under subparagraph (A) and their distributive share of partnership items under section 702. It specifies that paragraph (1) does not apply to eligible qualified property and outlines the applicable depreciation method as the straight line method. For partnerships where one corporation owns over 50% of the capital and profits, each partner must consider their share of partnership amounts for the taxable year. This rule applies to partnerships with electing partners in a corporation making an election under subparagraph (A) and their distributive share of partnership items under section 702. The amendment made by this subsection applies to taxable years ending after December 31, 2011. In the case of a taxable year beginning before January 1, 2012, and ending after December 31, 2011, the bonus depreciation amount determined under paragraph shall be transitional. In 2011, the bonus depreciation amount under section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code for that year is determined by a specific formula. This formula considers property placed in service before January 1, 2012, and adjusts for the number of days in the taxable year before that date. The bonus depreciation amount for the year is determined by a formula that considers only property placed in service after December 31, 2011. It multiplies the limitation under the paragraph by a fraction based on the number of days in the taxable year after December 31, 2011. SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON SECTION 199 DEDUCTION ATTRIBUTABLE TO OIL, NATURAL GAS, OR PRIMARY PRODUCTS THEREOF. Amends section 199(c) of the Internal Revenue Code to deny the deduction for certain oil and gas income for major integrated oil companies. Effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2011."
