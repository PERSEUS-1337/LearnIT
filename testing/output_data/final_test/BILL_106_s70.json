Congress findings include the failure of the US intelligence community to detect missile launches by rogue nations and India breaking a nuclear testing moratorium, leading to concerns about proliferation of nuclear weapons technologies. On May 28, 1998, Pakistan conducted 5 underground nuclear tests and admitted efforts to arm missiles capable of targeting India. The CIA was criticized for failing to detect India's nuclear explosions despite evidence and India's declarations to enhance its nuclear arsenal. The CIA was conflicted on whether a transmission to China contained information that could advance their missile capabilities.
