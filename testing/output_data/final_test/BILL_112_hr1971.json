This includes providing information on prescription costs and payments. The Pharmacy Benefits Manager Transparency and Proper Operation Requirements Act requires PBMs to disclose aggregate average payments per prescription received from pharmacies and pharmaceutical manufacturers, including rebates and discounts.

The Pharmacy Benefits Manager Transparency and Proper Operation Requirements Act mandates PBMs to promptly reimburse pharmacies for clean claims, not require participation in a specific pharmacy network, and not exclude qualified pharmacies based on certain conditions. Pharmacies must accept PBM terms, meet licensure requirements, and agree to reimbursement rates. The Pharmacy Benefits Manager Transparency and Proper Operation Requirements Act prohibits PBMs from mandating the use of specific pharmacies in which they have ownership interests. The PBM is prohibited from incentivizing plan beneficiaries to use pharmacies where they have ownership interests, unless the incentives apply to all network pharmacies. Additionally, PBMs are limited in the period covered by audits of pharmacy providers.

The entity conducting the audit may use hospital or physician records to validate pharmacy records and legal prescriptions. Clerical errors are not subject to recoupment unless fraud is proven or financial harm occurs. Extrapolation or statistical expansion techniques are not allowed in audits. The PBM must disclose audit recoupment to the group health plan or insurer and notify the plan sponsor before selling utilization or claims data. The PBM must not sell data without approval from the plan sponsor, must not contact covered individuals without permission, and must not transmit data to a PBM-owned pharmacy without patient consent. The amendment requires PBMs to obtain opt-out consent from covered individuals before selling their data. The effective date applies to plan sponsors for plan years after the enactment of the Act.
