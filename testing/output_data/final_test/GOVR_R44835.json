While FMLA offers unpaid leave, private-sector employers are not required to provide paid leave. Some states offer family leave insurance (FLI) programs for cash benefits. Congressional proposals aim to expand access to paid family leave. Proposals to expand national access to paid family leave include a new tax credit, the Family and Medical Insurance Act, the New Parents Act, the Working Parents Flexibility Act, and the Freedom for Families Act. Members of Congress supporting paid leave cite various reasons for their support. Members of Congress supporting increased access to paid leave cite the challenges faced by workers balancing work and family responsibilities, as well as the financial difficulties that make unpaid leave unattainable for many families. Benefits of expanded paid family leave include stronger labor force attachment for caregivers, income stability, improved worker morale, job tenure, and productivity. Costs include financing payments to workers on leave, hiring temporary replacements, productivity losses, and administrative expenses. Costs and benefits depend on policy implementation factors such as benefit size, duration, financing, and other policy considerations. This report provides an overview of paid family leave in the United States, including state-level programs and recent federal legislative action. Workers often face family caregiving conflicts that require leave, ranging from short-term obligations like child care to more significant events like the arrival of a new child or serious medical conditions. Paid family leave in the United States typically covers caregiving for a new child or serious medical conditions, excluding day-to-day needs like school conferences or minor illnesses. Employer-provided paid family leave in the private sector is voluntary. According to a national survey, 16% of private-industry employees had access to paid family leave (PFL) in March 2018. PFL was more common among managerial and professional occupations, high-paying jobs, full-time workers, and employees in large companies. Recent company policies show an increase in access to PFL, with some focusing on parental leave and others offering broader family leave options. A 2017 study by the Pew Research Center examined U.S. perceptions and experiences with paid family and medical leave. The study found that 27% of employed individuals took leave for family caregiving or health reasons between 2014 and 2016, with 16% needing leave but unable to take it. Among those who took leave, 47% received full pay, 36% received no pay, and 16% received partial pay. Lower-paid workers had less access to paid leave, with 62% of those earning less than $30,000 annually receiving no pay during leave. Some states have enacted legislation to create state paid Family and Medical Leave Insurance (FLI) programs, providing cash benefits to eligible workers for caregiving activities. Four states have active programs, with three more awaiting implementation. State FLI laws vary in maximum weeks of benefits and wage replacement rates, offering between 4 to 10 weeks of benefits. New Jersey plans to increase benefit weeks from 6 to 12 starting July 1, 2020. DC is set to offer 8 weeks of paid family leave in 2020, and Washington is also working on implementing a program. When implemented, DC will offer 8 weeks of paid family leave in 2020, Washington State will offer 12 weeks in the same year, and New York's entitlement will increase to 12 weeks in 2021. Massachusetts will provide up to 12 weeks for family leave, with up to 26 weeks for care of a seriously ill military service member. Program eligibility typically involves minimum duration of in-state employment, earnings in covered employment, or contributions to insurance funds. State FLI programs are financed by employee payroll tax receipts, except for DC which will be financed by employers. Massachusetts and Washington State programs will be jointly financed by employers and employees. Some programs provide job protection directly. Many advanced-economy countries provide paid family leave, with variations in the number of weeks and wage replacement rates. Some FLI programs offer job protection directly to workers receiving benefits, ensuring they can return to their jobs after leave. Coordination between federal or state family and medical leave laws and FLI benefits may also provide job protection. The OECD's estimates show wide variation in the number of weeks and rate of wage replacement for paid family leave across countries. While most OECD countries provide paid leave to new mothers, a smaller share offer paid leave to new fathers, with varying entitlements and payment rates. Some countries also provide a separate entitlement to fathers for child caregiving purposes. Some countries offer separate entitlements to fathers for child caregiving purposes, either as individual or family entitlements. Countries like Japan, Luxembourg, and Finland reserve a portion of parental leave for fathers to encourage their participation in caregiving. The OECD examined family caregiver leave availability in 2011, with 14 out of 25 countries providing paid leave for workers with ill or dying family members. The Strong Families Act, enacted in December 2017, allows employers to claim tax credits for wages paid to employees on family or medical leave, increasing access to paid family leave. The Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act proposes a national family leave insurance program to provide cash benefits to eligible workers taking leave. The Insurance Leave Act (FAMILY Act) would provide cash benefits for caregiving activities, making unpaid leave more affordable. The New Parents Act offers Social Security benefits for new parents in exchange for delaying retirement. Other proposals include tax-advantaged parental leave savings accounts and health savings account distributions for family leave. The President's FY2020 budget suggests six weeks of paid leave. The President's FY2020 budget proposes to provide six weeks of financial support to new parents through state unemployment compensation programs, following a similar approach taken by the Clinton Administration in 2000. The Birth and Adoption Unemployment Compensation rule allowed states to use their UC programs to provide benefits to parents taking unpaid leave after the birth or adoption of a child."
