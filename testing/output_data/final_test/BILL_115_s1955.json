    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Preserving Liu Xiaobo Legacy of Freedom & Gold Medal Act\". The Congress finds that Liu Xiaobo was China's leading advocate for democracy, human rights, and peaceful political reform. He symbolized two generations of Chinese reformers and called for the government to uphold constitutional and international human rights agreements. Liu Xiaobo, a prominent advocate for freedom and human rights in China, was sentenced to eleven years in prison for \"inciting subversion of state power\" in 2009. His imprisonment was criticized by the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in 2011. Liu Xiaobo, a Nobel Peace Prize nominee, was imprisoned by the government in China, which violated human rights. He passed away in 2017 while in state custody, becoming the first Nobel laureate to die in such circumstances since 1935. Liu Xiaobo, a symbol of the pro-democracy movement in China, represents the international community's conscience on human rights. Awarding him the Congressional Gold Medal would recognize his peace efforts and inspire millions in China. Liu Xiaobo's ideals of freedom would inspire millions of Chinese. SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL. The Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate will arrange for the presentation of a gold medal to Liu Xiaobo and others who have advocated for democracy and human rights in China. The medal will be designed and struck by the Secretary of the Treasury. Following the award of the gold medal to Liu Xiaobo and other democracy advocates in China, it will be given to the Smithsonian Institution for display and research. Congress suggests that the medal should also be displayed at locations related to the Tiananmen Protests of 1989. The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates of the gold medals in bronze under regulations, at a price covering costs. Medals are considered national medals and numismatic items under specific codes. SEC. 4. Holding Chinese officials accountable for complicity in Liu Xiaobo's imprisonment. The sense of Congress is to seek the release of political prisoners in China, including Liu Xia, condemn censorship and intimidation of Liu Xiaobo's family, identify officials involved in their detention, and hold accountable those complicit in the torture of human rights advocates. The Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act can be used to sanction officials complicit in the torture or arbitrary detention of political prisoners in China, including those advocating for human rights and legal reforms like Quanzhang and others following Liu Xiaobo's footsteps. Funds should be authorized for fellowship programs and awards in Liu Xiaobo's honor to preserve his legacy and ideas until Chinese people can do so freely. This aims to promote freedom, democracy, and human rights in China and globally."
