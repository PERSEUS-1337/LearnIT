    "content": "The \"National Advisory Commission on Tax Reform and Simplification Act of 2001\" establishes a commission to study and provide recommendations to Congress on simplifying, reforming, or replacing the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Congress acknowledges that the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is overly complex, burdensome for individuals and businesses, difficult for the IRS to administer, and in need of fundamental reform and simplification. Taxpayers and experts have repeatedly called for a simplification of the tax code to alleviate misunderstandings and difficulties faced by taxpayers. The current tax code is overly complex, leading to burdens for individual filers and the need to seek professional help. Congress is urged to consider fundamental reform and simplification due to the annual uncertainty caused by modifications to the Code. The Federal Government's budget surplus provides a unique opportunity for tax law reform efforts. Recent efforts to simplify or reform the tax laws have faced challenges in gaining broad-based, nonpartisan support for proposed changes. Establishment of a National Commission on Tax Reform and Simplification. The National Advisory Commission on Tax Reform and Simplification, established within the legislative branch, consists of 15 members appointed by various leaders from the executive and legislative branches, as well as private life. Appointments to the National Advisory Commission on Tax Reform and Simplification should include 2 members appointed by the minority leader of the House of Representatives, with expertise in various tax issues. Appointments must be made within 45 days of the enactment of the Act. SEC. 5. RULES OF THE COMMISSION. The Commission shall consist of nine members for a quorum. After 60 days of enactment, if 5 or more members are appointed, they can select a Chair to start operations. The Commission may establish additional rules and fill vacancies in the same manner as initial appointments. Meetings can be held in executive session if deemed appropriate by the Chair or majority of members. Any individual appointed to the Commission can continue as a member for up to 30 days after leaving their position. SEC. 6. DUTIES OF THE COMMISSION. The Commission's duties include conducting a review of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for up to 18 months and submitting a report to Congress with recommendations for reform and simplification. The review will focus on the code's impact on the economy, families, and the workforce. The Commission will review the tax code's impact on the economy, families, and the workforce, including tax burden distribution, predictability, compliance costs, and IRS administration. They will also consider if other countries' tax systems could be more efficient, if income tax should be replaced, and if the tax code can be simplified without major restructuring. The Commission has powers outlined in Section 7. The Commission, its subcommittees, or designated members can hold hearings, take testimony, and administer oaths to carry out the Act. The Commission can enter into contracts to fulfill its duties, and is authorized to obtain information from federal agencies and offices. The Commission can obtain information from federal agencies and offices, including the Treasury Department and General Services Administration for support services. The General Services Administration provides administrative support services to the Commission on a nonreimbursable basis. The Joint Committee on Taxation staff can offer legal, economic, or policy analysis to the Commission. Other departments and agencies can also provide services, funds, and support as needed. The Commission may use the United States mails and accept gifts or donations of services or property in carrying out its duties as authorized by law. SEC. 8. STAFF OF THE COMMISSION. The Chair of the Commission may appoint staff without following typical government hiring rules, with a salary limit. Federal employees can be detailed to the Commission without extra cost. The Commission can retain regular employment rights and hire consultants at rates not exceeding level IV of the Executive Schedule. SEC. 9. COMPENSATION AND TRAVEL EXPENSES. Members of the Commission may be compensated at a daily rate not exceeding the annual rate of basic pay for a position at level IV of the Executive Schedule. Exceptions apply for members who are officers or employees of the United States or Members of Congress. Travel expenses, including per diem, are allowed for Commission members while away from their homes or regular places of business. The Commission members are allowed travel expenses, including per diem, in the same manner as intermittent government employees under section 5703(b) of title 5, United States Code. SEC. 10. REPORT OF THE COMMISSION; TERMINATION. The Commission must submit a report to the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on Finance within 18 months of its first meeting. The report will include recommendations for simplifying the tax code and describe the expected impact on the economy. The Commission will terminate 90 days after submitting the report. The Commission may use a 90-day period to conclude its activities, including testifying to Congress and disseminating the report. Authorization of appropriations is granted for necessary funds, with $2,000,000 available from fiscal year 2001 funds until specific appropriations are made."
