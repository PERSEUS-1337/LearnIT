    "content": "The \"Women's Progress Assessment Act\" may be cited as the short title. The Act includes findings related to women's progress. The Congress recognizes the importance of timely and reliable data on women's situation in the US and globally for implementing the Platform for Action and evaluating assistance programs. Existing statistics on women are not easily accessible or comprehensive, hindering a complete understanding of women's health and roles in society. Many gender-related topics are not adequately covered by current statistical indicators. Efforts are needed to improve data collection on gender issues such as access to resources, time-use, family responsibilities, and effectiveness of programs. Standard methodologies for gender statistics should be integrated into national and international statistical services to support program and policy development. The text chunk discusses the addition of a new chapter in Title 13, United States Code, requiring periodic surveys on the status of women. The new chapter in Title 13, United States Code mandates the collection and publication of statistics on the status of women and girls in the US and abroad, focusing on areas like labor force participation, family structure, fertility behavior, and additional categories as determined by the Secretary. The new chapter in Title 13, United States Code mandates the collection of information on women and their roles in foreign countries and refugee camps by the United States Agency for International Development and the Secretary of State. They will develop internationally comparable measures and methodologies for data collection in both large-scale quantitative and in-depth descriptive manners. The State Department, Bureau of the Census, and Development will incorporate measures and methodologies for data collection efforts. Reports will be published every second year for the US and every fifth year for foreign countries, including historical and interpretive comparisons on the status of women. Reports will be submitted to Congress. The Secretary shall establish a Federal Forum on Women's Statistics to exchange information on data collection initiatives, identify gaps, and carry out designated activities. Reports under this section shall be submitted to Congress. The Secretary will establish a Federal Forum on Women's Statistics for data exchange and activities. The table of chapters in title 13, United States Code, will be amended accordingly. Collection and publication of information on the status of women will be conducted as part of the Federal Forum on Women's Statistics."
