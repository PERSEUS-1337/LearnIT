    "content": "The \"Child Safety Act\" is the short title of this legislation. It includes findings related to child safety. The problem of family violence persists even after legal separation or divorce, with child custody becoming a new arena for abuse. Current laws are flawed, assuming equal power between parents and often working against the protection of children and abused spouses. Perpetrators may use children to manipulate the abused party post-separation. Approximately 1,000 to 5,000 children are killed by their parents annually in the United States. In 1988, 354,100 children were abducted by family members violating custody agreements, with most victims aged 2 to 11. Around 160,000 children suffer serious injuries or impairments due to abuse or neglect each year. Reports of child abuse and neglect have increased by over 200 percent from 1976 to 1986. About 90 percent of children in homes where their mothers are abused witness the abuse. Women and children are at a heightened risk of violence during and after separation. Risk for violence during and after separation is high, with 50-70% of men who abuse their partners also abusing their children. Up to 75% of domestic assaults occur post-separation, and in spousal homicide cases, over half of male defendants were separated from their victims. Additionally, 73% of battered women seek emergency medical services after separation. The purpose of the section is to address the high risk of violence during and after separation, especially for women who are victims of domestic abuse. The Act authorizes funding for supervised visitation centers to provide supervised visitation in cases of abuse, evaluation of visitation for child protection services, and a safe location for custodial parents. A safe environment for custodial parents to transfer custody of children to non-custodial parents in cases of domestic violence or protection orders. It also serves as a safeguard against abuse, provides healthy interaction activities for families, and offers parent and child education and support groups for healing and learning new skills. DEMONSTRATION GRANTS FOR SUPERVISED VISITATION CENTERS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services can award grants and contracts to public or nonprofit entities to establish supervised visitation centers. Factors considered include the number of families served, local need for such centers, applicant need, and capacity to utilize the assistance effectively. The Secretary of Health and Human Services can award grants and contracts to establish supervised visitation centers for economically disadvantaged individuals. Perpetrators of family violence will be responsible for costs associated with supervised visitation. The Secretary must approve grant applications for projects related to family violence, with specific criteria to be met. Grants will be awarded based on regulations set by the Secretary. Additionally, evaluation of demonstration projects will be conducted. The recipient of a grant must submit a report to the Secretary within 30 days after each fiscal year. The report should include information on the number of families served, categorized by reasons for supervised visitation, and the number of visits per family categorized by court-required supervised visitation. The report should include information on supervised visitation arrangements categorized by reasons such as court-mandated, risk of abuse, foster care, and order of protection. It should also cover terminated visitation arrangements due to violations, protective temporary custody transfers, and parental abduction cases in a judicial district using supervised visitation services. The report on supervised visitation services should include details on safety incidents, families turned away due to high demand, protection measures for children and abused partners during visitations, and any other relevant information specified by regulations. Additionally, entities receiving grants must have a collateral agreement with the court and child protection services. The recipient of a grant, contract, or cooperative agreement must collaborate with various entities to evaluate the supervised visitation center. They must also demonstrate the need for continued funding within the first 3 years of the project. Special grants are provided to study the impact of supervised visitation on sexually or severely physically abused children. The Secretary is authorized to award special grants to collect clinical data for supervised visitation centers to study the impact on sexually or physically abused children. The Secretary may award grants for supervised visitation centers to study the impact on abused children, focusing on the type of abuse, and the need for specialized treatment programs for abusive spouses. Entities seeking grants must demonstrate clinical expertise in child abuse treatment and prevention. The grantee must submit a report with clinical data collected under the grant to the Secretary annually. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress every 18 months, containing information from reports received under sections 6 and 7, along with recommendations on reauthorizing supervised visitation center programs. Authorization of appropriations is also addressed. Authorization of appropriations for grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements under this Act: $30,000,000 for fiscal year 1994, $40,000,000 for fiscal year 1995, and $50,000,000 for fiscal year 1996. Distribution: 80% for grants, contracts, or agreements under section 5, and 20% for grants under section 7. Disbursement through 10 regional offices of the Department of Health and Human Services."
