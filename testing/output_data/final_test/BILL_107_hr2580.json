A drug treatment alternative to prison program funded by a grant must have a State or local prosecutor administering it. Eligible offenders can only participate with the prosecutor's consent and will be sentenced to a residential substance abuse treatment provider instead of incarceration. Failure to complete treatment will result in imprisonment for the underlying crime. The residential substance abuse provider treating offenders under the program must make periodic progress reports to the prosecutor and court. An enforcement unit of law enforcement officers supervised by the prosecutor is responsible for ensuring compliance with the program. The program requires the prosecutor to verify offender's information, locate and apprehend absconded offenders, and return them to court for sentencing. The application process for grants under this program requires State or local prosecutors to submit a certification to the Attorney General. The distribution of grant awards aims to be equitable across different jurisdictions, including rural, suburban, and urban areas. Additionally, reports and evaluations are required to assess the effectiveness of the program. Each recipient of a grant must submit a report on the effectiveness of activities funded by the grant to the Attorney General annually. The report should include an evaluation as required by the Attorney General. The dates for submitting these reports will be specified by the Attorney General. The term 'State or local prosecutor' refers to officials with authority to prosecute criminal offenses. An 'eligible offender' is someone convicted of a crime requiring imprisonment, with no prior violent felony or major drug offense convictions. The term 'felony crime of violence' and 'major drug offense' are defined in specific sections of the United States Code.
