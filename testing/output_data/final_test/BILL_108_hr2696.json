    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Southwest Forest Health and Wildfire Prevention Act of 2004\". Congress acknowledges the increasing threat of wildfires to millions of acres of forest land and rangeland in the United States. Land management practices, including fire prevention efforts and failure to thin overstocked stands, have led to degradation. Approximately 39,000,000 acres of National Forest System land in the interior West are at high risk of wildfires. The Forest Service has spent a significant amount on wildfire suppression in the interior West, where the number, size, and severity of wildfires are on the rise. The interior West is experiencing an increase in wildfires, with a significant portion of timberland in Arizona and New Mexico having small diameters. The population in the interior West grew rapidly in the 1990s. Catastrophic wildfires pose threats to homes, communities, watersheds, soils, and endangered species habitats. A 1994 assessment highlighted a limited window of 15 to 30 years for effective wildfire management intervention. The uncontrollable wildfire has become widespread, and it is crucial to maintain healthy forest ecosystems to reduce the risk of wildfires, improve wildlife habitats, and enhance watershed values. Sustaining the long-term ecological and economic health of interior West forests requires preventing severe wildfires and allowing natural, low-intensity ground fires. Achieving more natural fire regimes necessitates reducing excess fuels and thinning subdominant trees. Ecologically based forest and woodland ecosystem restoration on a landscape scale aims to improve community protection, minimize wildfire suppression needs, enhance resource values, strengthen ecological integrity, reduce rehabilitation costs, prevent habitat loss, and safeguard forests for future generations. However, scientific understanding of landscape scale treatments is limited, highlighting the need for rigorous, objective, and applied scientific information for effective design, implementation, monitoring, and adaptation. The curr_chunk discusses landscape scale restoration treatments, wildfire management, environmental review process, and collaboration with affected entities. The curr_chunk states the purposes of the discussed topics, including landscape scale restoration treatments, wildfire management, environmental review process, and collaboration with affected entities. The Act aims to enhance forest restoration treatments to reduce wildfire risk and improve ecosystem health in the interior West. It also focuses on synthesizing scientific findings for landscape-scale restoration, transferring interdisciplinary knowledge on wildfire impacts, and collaborating with Federal agencies for ecological restoration treatments. The Act aims to design, implement, monitor, and revise wildfire treatments based on adaptive ecosystem management. It also assists land managers in treating acres with restoration-based applications and using new management technologies to achieve the goals outlined in the National Fire Plan and other related reports. The Western Governors' Association's strategy aims to reduce wildland fire risks through collaborative efforts, providing technical assistance for ecosystem management restoration treatments and educating the public on fire management in dry forest ecosystems in the interior West. The Western Governors' Association's strategy focuses on reducing wildland fire risks through collaborative efforts, technical assistance for ecosystem management, restoration treatments, and public education on fire management in dry forest ecosystems in the interior West. The Act defines adaptive ecosystem management as a natural resource management process that integrates planning, implementation, monitoring, research, evaluation, and new knowledge to modify future management methods and policy based on scientific findings and societal needs. The term \"affected entities\" includes land managers, stakeholders, concerned citizens, and the States of the interior West. The term \"dry forest and woodland ecosystem\" refers to ecosystems dominated by ponderosa pines. The term \"Institute\" refers to an Institute established under section 5(a). The term \"interior West\" includes the States of Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah. The term \"land manager\" means a person or entity practicing or guiding natural resource management. The term \"land manager\" includes Federal, State, local, or tribal land management agencies. \"Restoration\" is a process to move an ecosystem towards sustainable structure or conditions supporting natural species and processes. The \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture, and \"Secretaries\" include the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior. A \"stakeholder\" is any person involved in the process. (10) Stakeholder.--A person interested in forest or woodland management.\n(11) Subdominant trees.--Trees smaller and less vigorous than dominant trees.\n(12) Overstocked stands.--Exceeding natural tree capacity per acre.\n(13) Resilience.--System's ability to absorb disturbance without major changes. SEC. 5. ESTABLISHMENT OF INSTITUTES. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, shall establish Institutes to promote adaptive ecosystem management in the interior West to reduce wildfire risk and restore forest health. Institutes will receive assistance to promote collaborative processes. One Institute will be established in each of the States, including Arizona at Northern Arizona University. Each Institute in Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado will conduct research on restoration-based hazardous fuel reduction treatments to reduce wildfire risk and improve forest health in the interior West. They will also implement these treatments on a landscape scale using an adaptive ecosystem management framework. Each Institute in Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado will conduct research on restoration-based hazardous fuel reduction treatments to reduce wildfire risk and improve forest health. They will implement these treatments on a landscape scale using an adaptive ecosystem management framework, translate scientific knowledge to affected entities, assist with adaptive management approaches, and provide peer-reviewed annual reports. The Institutes must have capabilities in natural, physical, social, and policy sciences and cooperate with researchers and extension programs at colleges. The Institutes in Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado will conduct research on restoration-based hazardous fuel reduction treatments to reduce wildfire risk and improve forest health. They must cooperate with researchers and extension programs at colleges, community colleges, and universities in the interior West. Additionally, they will develop annual work plans in consultation with the Secretary to ensure the proposed work serves the informational needs of affected entities. If the Secretary determines that the Institute model established in Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado could benefit other interior West States, they may establish 1 institute in each of those states. SEC. 6. COOPERATION BETWEEN INSTITUTES AND FEDERAL AGENCIES. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, shall provide financial and technical assistance to the Institutes, encourage Federal agencies to use information and expertise from the Institutes, promote cooperation between Federal programs on ecological restoration, wildfire risk reduction, and wildfire management technologies, and may enter into contracts and agreements to carry out the Act. The Secretaries may accept funds from other Federal agencies, support internships for qualified individuals, encourage professional education and public information activities, and promulgate necessary regulations to carry out the Act. SEC. 7. MONITORING AND EVALUATION. The Secretary must evaluate Institute programs every 5 years to ensure they meet the Act's goals, including ecosystem management and cost reduction. The Secretary evaluates Institute programs every 5 years to ensure they meet goals such as ecosystem management and cost reduction. If an Institute does not qualify for further Federal assistance, it will not receive any until qualifications are reestablished to the satisfaction of the Secretaries. SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. $15,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated annually for this Act, with a limitation that funds cannot be used for facility construction costs."
