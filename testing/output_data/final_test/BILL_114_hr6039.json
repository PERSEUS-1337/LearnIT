The Act redistributes unused residency positions to address shortages in states with health professionals. Amendments include adding new paragraphs for distribution of additional residency positions. The Secretary will make reduction determinations for each hospital based on their reference resident level during a specific measurement period. The Secretary will make reduction determinations for hospitals based on their reference resident level during a specific measurement period, if the reference resident level is less than the applicable resident limit for the hospital and period. During the consequence period, a hospital's resident limit will be reduced by 65 percent of the difference between the applicable resident limit and the reference resident level for that period. During the consequence period, a hospital's resident limit will be reduced based on specific criteria. The hospital must meet certain requirements to avoid a reduction in their resident limit. During the consequence period, a hospital's resident limit may be reduced based on specific criteria, except for hospitals in rural areas with fewer than 250 acute care inpatient beds. The Secretary must make reduction determinations by March 31 of each year for qualifying hospitals, increasing resident limits accordingly. The Secretary approves limits for hospitals submitting applications, adjusting resident limits based on reduction determinations. Increases in resident limits offset reductions estimated by the Secretary. The Secretary may determine if a hospital has met requirements for increased resident limits during a consequence period. Capacity considerations are taken into account when redistributing increases in resident limits among hospitals. The Secretary considers hospital capacity and likelihood of filling positions when redistributing resident limit increases among qualifying hospitals. The Secretary redistributes resident limit increases among qualifying hospitals based on hospital capacity and likelihood of filling positions, with 70% of positions available to hospitals in low resident-to-population States and 30% to hospitals in high resident-to-population States. The Secretary prioritizes distributing additional residency positions to hospitals in high HPSA-to-population States, with a focus on filling positions with individuals from residence programs in the same State. The Secretary prioritizes distributing additional residency positions in hospitals, with approved FTE per resident amounts based on hospital per resident amounts for primary care and nonprimary care. The term 'reference resident level' refers to the resident level for cost reporting periods of the hospital. The term 'resident level' is defined as per paragraph (7)(C)(i), and 'otherwise applicable resident limit' refers to the limit on resident level without considering certain factors. The term 'low resident-to-population State' refers to a state with a smaller number of residents compared to at least 75 percent of all states. The 'applicable number' is calculated by dividing the number of residents in a state by the number of individuals residing in that state. The term 'high HPSA-to-population State' refers to a state with a larger applicable number than at least 90 percent of all states. The 'applicable number' is determined by dividing the number of designated areas in a state by the number of areas designated by the Health Resources & Services Administration. The Department of Health and Human Services designates Health Professional Shortage Areas based on the number of residents in the state. Hospitals affiliated under the same group are subject to certain provisions. Section 1886(d)(5)(B)(v) of the Social Security Act is amended to include subsection (h)(9). The Social Security Act is amended to include a clause regarding additional payment amounts for resident positions in hospitals. The indirect teaching adjustment factor will be computed in the same manner as provided under clause (ii) for such resident positions. The Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 is amended to include additional paragraphs (7), (8), and (9) as per the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act."
