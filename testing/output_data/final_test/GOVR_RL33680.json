S. 2590, introduced by Senator Tom Coburn, received extensive bipartisan support in both the Senate and House, ultimately being signed into law by President Bush on September 26, 2006. The bill was cosponsored by 47 Senators, passed unanimously in the Senate, and by voice vote in the House. President Bush expressed his support for the bill in a press release, indicating his intention to sign it. The Senator's supporters for S. 2590 included a diverse range of groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, American Society of Newspaper Editors, and OMB Watch. The bill had bipartisan backing and was a companion to H.R. 5060, which passed in the House on June 21, 2006. The bill aimed to increase accountability and transparency in federal awards by creating a public database with recipient information. S. 2590 and H.R. 5060 had similar goals but differed in key aspects. Contracts were excluded from the House bill's database, while S. 2590 included them, which critics argued was essential for public oversight. The House bill, H.R. 5060, passed without contracts in the public database, while the Senate bill, S. 2590, included them. House members preferred the Senate version for its comprehensive coverage, including funding for subrecipient information. Uniform data collection on subgrantees and subcontractors is lacking, leading to potential costs for recipients of federal financial assistance. The Senate bill, S. 2590, includes provisions for recipients and subrecipients of federal assistance to recover costs associated with new reporting requirements. It directs OMB to conduct a pilot program to determine the most cost-effective approach to implementing a government-wide subaward reporting process. This feature was added after concerns were raised about the potential administrative and financial burden. H.R. 5060, without a pilot program, faced criticism for being burdensome on grant recipients. The database mandated by the act had to be implemented in two phases, covering various entities by 2008 and including subgrantees and subcontractors by 2009. Individual recipients and organizations with less than $300,000 were excluded from the requirements. The act mandated a database to provide comprehensive information on federal financial assistance, covering grants, contracts, subgrants, subcontracts, loans, and more. Special provisions exempted transactions under $25,000 and delayed inclusion of credit card transactions. The database was required to include details such as the recipient's name, award amount, type of award, funding agency, and NAICS code for contracts. The S. 2590 act mandated a searchable database for federal financial assistance, including grants, contracts, loans, and more. It required details like recipient name, award amount, funding agency, NAICS code, and CFDA number. The database had to be accessible through a website for easy user search and to determine total funding awarded by fiscal year. The S. 2590 act mandated a searchable database for federal financial assistance, including grants, contracts, and loans. It required information to be provided in a downloadable format and posted within 30 days of award. The website had to allow public input and recommendations for improvements. Three major financial assistance databases were identified as sources of information for the website. The bill emphasized the need to access information from all three databases in a single search, rather than just providing links to different websites. The S. 2590 act mandated a searchable database for federal financial assistance, including grants, contracts, and loans. S. Con Res. 114 modified the \"single search\" provision, allowing grants and contracts to be searched separately on the new public website. The Government Accountability Office is required to provide Congress with a compliance report on P.L. 109-282 by 2010. The act delayed the inclusion of information on subcontractors and subgrantees until January 1, 2009, due to inconsistent data collection. OMB was tasked with implementing a pilot program to address gaps in data on subawards. The S. 2590 act mandated a searchable database for federal financial assistance, including grants, contracts, and loans. It allowed federal award recipients and subrecipients to be reimbursed for data collection costs. The act required OMB to submit an annual report to Congress and post it online. The FFATA required OMB to launch USAspending.gov, a website for detailed information on grants, contracts, loans, and assistance. Data quality and completeness are questioned, with unclear costs to improve. Information on subcontractors and subgrantees must be available by January 1, 2009. Identifying earmarks through the website is limited, and the usefulness of the database depends on the quality of information it contains. The new public database, USAspending.org, draws data from existing databases like FAADS and FPDS-NG, but the reliability of information from Grants.gov is unclear. Critics point out significant weaknesses in FAADS and FPDS-NG, such as incomplete and inaccurate data, requiring substantial changes for reliability. Users lack confidence in FPDS-NG data, as noted in a 2005 GAO report. The 2005 GAO report highlighted that FPDS-NG users lacked confidence in the data due to inaccuracies and incompleteness. Errors in the database were attributed to human error and varying levels of data entry by different agencies. Users also reported issues with identifying contracts related to Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts. The reliability of FPDS-NG as a database was questioned by a panel of procurement experts. The FPDS-NG data gaps in USAspending.gov have not been fixed, with $70 billion in FY2007 contracts possibly awarded without competition. Agencies are not submitting required contract information, leading to incomplete and inaccurate data in FAADS for grant awards. Problems are attributed to lack of resources, knowledge of reporting requirements, and agency compliance. Agency program officials lacked knowledge of FAADS reporting requirements and agencies had not implemented sufficient oversight for accurate data submission. Census Bureau official noted that data elements required by S. 2590 are not uniformly captured by federal agencies or grant recipients. Agencies are required to update FAADS quarterly, making it challenging to meet the 30-day update requirement of S. 2590. OMB estimates show agencies have only submitted 53% to 65% of required grants data under FFATA. Members of Congress have expressed concerns about FPDS-NG and FAADS accuracy. During the House debate on bill S. 2590, supporters emphasized the importance of improving oversight of Federal funds through enhancements to FPDS-NG and FAADS. Concerns were raised about the significant problems with these systems and the need for the Administration's commitment to ensure the legislation's effectiveness. OMB issued guidance on improving data quality for agency submissions to meet FFATA requirements, with agencies required to submit plans to address data gaps by a specified deadline. Agencies were required to provide data on grants, contracts, and loans to address deficiencies and implement internal controls for accuracy. Compliance with FFATA data reporting would be evaluated through OMB's scorecard initiative. Concerns were raised about the costs of implementing USAspending.gov and the reliability of databases, but OMB assured that the new database would meet requirements within the established timeframe. The new public database for federal assistance, launched before the statutory deadline, is incomplete and raises questions about meeting FFATA objectives. The CBO estimates it will cost $15 million to establish and maintain the database between 2007 and 2011, based on OMB's assurance that existing data can be combined. The new public database for federal assistance, launched before the statutory deadline, is incomplete and raises questions about meeting FFATA objectives. Experts warn of the need for extensive data cleanup in systems like FPDS-NG and FAADS to correct inaccurate information. The National Association of State Auditors, Comptrollers, and Treasurers (NASACT) expresses concerns about the financial and administrative burden on state and local governments to comply with the bill's reporting requirements, particularly in collecting data on subgrantees. NASACT expressed concerns about the financial burden on state and local governments to comply with reporting requirements for federal grant funds, especially in collecting data on subgrantees. Trade groups, like CODSIA, have also raised issues about the collection of subcontractor information. The FFATA requires detailed subcontractor information, which poses a burden on contractors and subcontractors. The legislation aims to identify congressional earmarks, but the database may not effectively achieve this goal. Additionally, not all grants, loans, or contracts are congressionally directed, limiting the database's value for earmark identification. The description of funding actions in the \"award title\" field may lead to different public perceptions of federally funded projects. The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act aims to increase transparency in federally funded projects to reduce wasteful spending. The online database provides information on awards to prevent funding earmarks and questionable projects. Maximum transparency is crucial, covering a broad range of financial assistance categories. The FFATA database aims to provide transparency by including all federal financial assistance, contracts, subcontractors, and subgrantees. President Bush, OMB's deputy director, and Senator Coburn support the database's implementation, emphasizing its importance in empowering taxpayers to demand fiscal discipline. The act is seen as a crucial step towards increasing accountability in federal spending. President Bush and the Administration are committed to implementing the FFATA database to increase transparency and accountability in federal spending. Senator Coburn emphasizes the need for oversight to ensure progress in accordance with the legislation. The new law may also focus on improving transparency in federal fiscal operations. Legislation seeking to increase transparency in the tax code, as supported by Senators Coburn and Lautenburg, aims to extend government accountability beyond spending. Senator Obama also emphasized the importance of transparency in targeted tax benefits to improve government performance. This objective aligns with the efforts to enhance transparency and accountability in federal spending through the FFATA database."
