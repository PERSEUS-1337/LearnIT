    "content": "Interstate transport of air pollutants has been a longstanding challenge for air quality protection. The Clean Air Act assigns states the responsibility to limit emissions within their borders to meet federal air quality standards, but emissions from upwind states can impact downwind states. This makes it difficult for some states to attain standards for ozone and PM 2.5, which are formed by precursor emissions like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. Regional emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) contribute to the formation of PM 2.5 and ground-level ozone, which can travel long distances through the atmosphere. Studies have shown that these pollutants can impact air quality in multiple states, with upwind states contributing significantly to downwind states' ozone and PM 2.5 concentrations. These regional emissions are associated with health issues such as aggravated asthma, chronic bronchitis, heart attacks, and premature death. The Clean Air Act's \"Good Neighbor\" provision requires states to prohibit emissions that contribute significantly to air quality problems in other states. The Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) is the current program addressing interstate air transport. The Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) is an emissions trading program for 28 states in the eastern US, established by the EPA to limit interstate transport of power sector emissions. CSAPR has led to significant reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions from power plants, helping states comply with air quality standards. Despite progress, some areas still do not meet federal air quality standards for pollutants like ozone and particulate matter. EPA designated 52 areas in 2018 as not meeting these standards. In 2018, EPA designated 52 areas with approximately 200 counties as \"nonattainment\" for the 2015 ozone standard. Members of Congress from downwind and upwind states are interested in how the Good Neighbor provision of the Clean Air Act is implemented. Downwind states attribute ozone violations to emissions from upwind states, expressing concerns about air pollution's impact on health and economic growth. The EPA's approach to emissions reductions has caused disagreement among upwind states, with Ohio's environmental agency criticizing it as flawed and unfair. This report provides background on interstate transport issues, discusses the CSAPR program, Good Neighbor determinations for ozone standards, and highlights key issues for Congress to consider under the Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act (CAA) requires EPA to establish national standards for criteria pollutants that may endanger public health or welfare. These standards, known as National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), aim to protect public health and welfare by defining clean air levels for pollutants. NAAQS are measured in parts per million (ppm), parts per billion (ppb), and micrograms per cubic meter of air (\u00b5g/m3). EPA must design primary NAAQS to protect public health and secondary NAAQS to protect public welfare from adverse effects. Since January 1997, EPA has completed reviews for all six criteria pollutants, with standards being made more stringent for five of them. Most revisions were for ozone and particulate matter standards. States are responsible for attaining and maintaining NAAQS within their borders as per the Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act requires states to submit an infrastructure SIP to EPA within three years of a NAAQS promulgation or revision, outlining how they will implement and enforce the standards. This SIP must also address interstate transport obligations under the CCAA, known as the \"Good Neighbor SIP,\" which prohibits certain emissions of air pollutants. EPA reviews the basic structural requirements of each state's air quality management program in light of the NAAQS. The Clean Air Act requires states to submit an infrastructure SIP to EPA within three years of a NAAQS promulgation or revision, outlining how they will implement and enforce the standards. This SIP must also address interstate transport obligations under the CCAA, known as the \"Good Neighbor SIP,\" which prohibits certain emissions of air pollutants to protect air quality in other states. EPA reviews SIPs to ensure compliance with statutory requirements and has authority to require revisions. If a state fails to submit an adequate SIP, EPA can impose sanctions and issue a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP). The 1990 CAA Amendments established regional planning provisions for ozone transport, including the creation of the Ozone Transport Region (OTR) to address challenges with ozone pollution. The Clean Air Act established the Ozone Transport Region (OTR) in the northeast, comprising 12 states and Washington, DC. The OTR requires states to impose controls on sources regardless of attainment status, including vehicle inspection programs and control technology for VOCs. EPA can establish transport regions to address regional pollution issues and must form a commission for each region to make recommendations on appropriate actions. The Clean Air Act established the Ozone Transport Region (OTR) in the northeast, comprising 12 states and Washington, DC. EPA can establish transport regions to address regional pollution issues and must form a commission for each region to make recommendations on appropriate actions. EPA and state officials work together in each transport region to recommend mitigation strategies. The CAA provides two statutory authorities for compliance with the Good Neighbor provision: SIPs process under Section 110 and a petition process under Section 126(b). These authorities aim to enforce the Good Neighbor provision by requiring states to revise inadequate SIPs through a \"SIP call\" procedure. EPA issues a SIP call when the state's sources do not meet NAAQS or CAA requirements. States can petition EPA under Section 126(b) for major sources violating the Good Neighbor provision. EPA must decide within 60 days and sources must comply with emission controls or cease operations. EPA's Section 126(b) petition allows states to address major sources violating the Good Neighbor provision, with EPA making a decision within 60 days. Unlike a SIP call, the 126(b) petition is limited to major stationary sources and can result in direct EPA regulation of upwind sources. EPA's review of 126(b) petitions has coincided with the SIP call process in some cases. EPA coordinated a SIP call and acknowledged the distinction between CAA authorities for the 126(b) petition process. States submitted 126(b) petitions ahead of Good Neighbor SIP deadlines. EPA approved New Jersey's 126(b) petition in 2011 before Pennsylvania was addressed. This approval reflected a broader interpretation of Section 126. EPA approved New Jersey's 126(b) petition before Pennsylvania completed its Good Neighbor SIP for the 2010 SO2 NAAQS revision, setting an 81% emissions reduction target with a three-year compliance deadline. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld EPA's Section 126 interpretation in 2013, allowing independent Section 126 findings. States like Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, and New York have submitted 126(b) petitions for ozone interstate transport compliance with 2008 and/or 2015 NAAQS. EPA has denied Connecticut's petition and proposed to deny Delaware and Maryland's petitions. EPA denied Connecticut's petition for ozone interstate transport compliance, citing outdated emissions data and the use of natural gas with low NOx emissions at the named power plant in Pennsylvania. EPA's analysis found no basis for violation of the good neighbor provision with respect to the 2008 ozone NAAQS. EPA denied Delaware and Maryland's petitions for ozone interstate transport compliance, citing insufficient analyses and outdated emissions data. Concerns were raised about the named source potentially switching back to coal, despite EPA's expectation of continued natural gas use. Delaware disagreed with EPA's proposed denial on grounds of insufficient modeling for attaining ozone standards by 2021. EPA also proposed to deny Maryland's petition due to disagreement on NOx limits for named sources based on emissions rates. Maryland disagreed with EPA's assessment of NOx emissions rates from different years and plans to oppose the denial, including potential litigation. EPA considers the third lowest coal-fired power plant NOx rate as the most representative of achievable emission rates. Enforcement of the Clean Air Act's interstate transport provisions is a key issue. Enforcement of the Clean Air Act's interstate transport provisions under Section 110(a)(2)(D)(i) relies on determining if one state \"significantly contributes\" to air pollution in another state. The interpretation of this phrase by the EPA has been contentious, leading to regulatory actions and litigation. The current framework sets a screening threshold of 1% of the NAAQS for identifying states with excessive interstate pollution. The EPA uses a screening threshold of 1% of the NAAQS to identify upwind states with sources that may significantly contribute to air quality issues in downwind states. Further evaluation considers cost and air quality factors to determine if emission reductions are necessary. Market-based programs targeting regional emissions of SO2 and NOx have been implemented by EPA and states. Emissions trading, a type of market-based program, sets a cap on total emissions in a defined area and requires covered entities to surrender allowances. Market-based programs, such as emissions trading or \"cap-and-trade,\" set a cap on total emissions in a specific area or sector. Covered entities must surrender allowances for each unit of emissions, with the option to sell unused allowances to those facing higher emission-reduction costs. The distribution of allowances can vary, including free allocation, auctioning, or a combination of strategies. Some programs allow entities to bank surplus allowances for future use. The Acid Rain Program (ARP) was established under Title IV of the 1990 CAA Amendments to reduce power sector emissions causing acid rain. It targeted SO2 emissions through cap-and-trade and NOx emissions through an emissions-rate-based program, achieving significant reductions in regional pollutants at lower costs. This program served as the basis for subsequent interstate pollution programs. The Acid Rain Program (ARP) was established under Title IV of the 1990 CAA Amendments to reduce power sector emissions causing acid rain. It targeted SO2 emissions through cap-and-trade and NOx emissions through an emissions-rate-based program, achieving significant reductions in regional pollutants at lower costs. The ARP included two phases, with the first phase covering 110 high-emitting coal-fired power plants from 1995 to 1999, and the second phase expanding to include more coal-fired power plants as well as those firing oil and natural gas starting in 2000. The annual SO2 emissions cap was set at 9.97 million allowances in 2000 and has since been decreased. The ARP remains in effect today with an annual SO2 cap of 8.95 million tons per year, roughly half of the SO2 emitted by the power sector in 1980. EPA distributed SO2 allowances based on statutory formulas, historical emission rates, and fuel consumption. The Acid Rain Program (ARP) established under the 1990 CAA Amendments aimed to reduce power sector emissions of SO2 and NOx. Power plants received free allowances for existing units, while new units had to purchase allowances. Unused allowances could be sold or banked. The market value of allowances incentivized emission reduction. The NOx portion of the ARP used boiler-specific emission rates. Compliance flexibility was provided, such as emissions rate averaging plans for units under common control. The Acid Rain Program (ARP) established under the 1990 CAA Amendments aimed to reduce power sector emissions of SO2 and NOx. The NOx portion of the ARP encouraged the installation of advanced NOx combustion controls and new power plant designs with lower NOx emission rates. Additional reductions were needed to meet ambient air quality standards under the CAA and address the Good Neighbor provision. EPA revised the NAAQS for ozone and particulate matter in 1997 to be more stringent, leading to the development of programs to achieve these reductions. In the mid-1990s, market-based programs targeted NOx as an ozone precursor. Two regional trading programs between 1999 and 2009 aimed to reduce NOx emissions: the Ozone Transport Commission NOx Budget Program (1999-2002) and the NOx Budget Trading Program (2002-2009). The OTC developed the NOx Budget Program to set regional caps on NOx emissions from utilities and industrial boilers during the ozone season. The Ozone Transport Commission NOx Budget Program (1999-2002) required states to adopt regulations, allocate NOx allowances, and ensure compliance, while EPA approved regulations and tracked emissions. Sources had to meet CAA emission standards and cap-and-trade began in 1999, reducing ozone season NOx emissions by 60% below 1990 levels. The NOx Budget Trading Program replaced the OTC NOx Budget Program and aimed to reduce NOx emissions from electric utilities and nonutility sources. It covered a wider geographic area and was implemented between 2003 and 2009 under the NOx SIP Call to address regional ozone transport issues. EPA set NOx ozone season budgets for states and required upwind states to adopt SIPs for NOx emission reductions. EPA implemented the NOx SIP Call to reduce NOx emissions from various sources across a wide geographic area, aiming to address regional ozone transport issues. The agency collaborated with the Ozone Transport Assessment Group (OTAG) to develop strategies for emission reductions, particularly focusing on utilities and nonutility sources through a trading program. EPA implemented the NOx SIP Call to reduce emissions from utilities and nonutility sources through a trading program. Cost-effective controls were identified for electric utility and nonutility sectors to establish NOx emission budgets. Other sectors like area sources, nonroad engines, and highway vehicles did not have cost-effective controls identified. States could require compliance with emissions budgets or participate in a regional cap-and-trade program like the NOx Budget Trading Program. EPA developed a model rule for the trading program to assist interested states. The NOx Budget Trading Program was adopted by 20 states and the District of Columbia, resulting in a 9% reduction in emissions below the 2008 cap. This represented a 75% reduction compared to 1990 levels and a 62% reduction compared to 2000 levels. EPA noted a decrease in ozone season NOx emissions between 2003 and 2008, attributing it to the installation of NOx controls. Variability in emissions was observed due to factors like weather and electricity demand, with reductions in 2007-2008 primarily attributed to lower electricity demand. The NOx Budget Trading Program led to a reduction in ozone season NOx emissions despite increased electricity demand. EPA reported a 44% decrease in NOx emission rate on peak electricity days from 2003 to 2008. Ozone concentrations decreased by 10% from 2002 to 2007 in NBP states. Areas with the greatest NOx reductions saw improvements in ozone levels. However, some NBP areas remained in nonattainment status with ozone standards by 2008. EPA also found that interstate transport of SO2 and NOx contributed significantly to ozone and PM2.5 in 2005. EPA found that interstate transport of SO2 and NOx from multiple states contributed significantly to ozone and PM 2.5 nonattainment. This led to the creation of the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which was later replaced by the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) in 2015. The Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) was replaced by the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) in 2015. CAIR established a regional cap-and-trade program to reduce power sector SO2 and NOx emissions through emission budgets for each state. States could achieve their budgets by participating in the cap-and-trade program, which included annual emissions caps for SO2 and NOx and an ozone season cap for NOx. The programs were implemented in 2009 and 2010. The CAIR program, implemented in 2010, focused on electric generators for reducing SO2 emissions. Nonutility sources were not required to reduce NOx and SO2 emissions under CAIR due to lack of reliable data on control costs. EPA needed more information to determine cost-effectiveness for nonutility sources. The CAIR program, implemented in 2010, focused on reducing SO2 emissions from electric generators. Nonutility sources were not required to reduce NOx and SO2 emissions under CAIR due to limited emissions data and cost information. EPA believed that states should decide on additional control requirements for non-utility sources. However, CAIR was challenged in court, with the U.S. Court of Appeals finding flaws in the program, including the lack of measurable emission reductions in each upwind state. The court found flaws in the CAIR program, leading to its remand to the EPA in December 2008. CAIR remained in effect while EPA developed a replacement rule, resulting in the implementation of CSAPR in 2015. CSAPR aims to reduce interstate transport of ozone and PM 2.5 by setting emission reduction targets for 27 states. CSAPR sets annual SO2, annual NOx, and ozone-season NOx budgets for covered states, allowing emissions trading. It introduced a new state-specific approach to measuring significant contributions under Section 110(a)(2)(D). Despite legal challenges, this framework remains in effect for assessing the Good Neighbor provision with each NAAQS revision. EPA developed a multi-step framework to assess states' obligations under CSAPR. EPA developed a multi-step framework to assess states' Good Neighbor obligations in CSAPR by identifying downwind air quality issues, linking upwind states to downwind sites, determining significant contributions, and assessing cost-effectiveness of emission control measures. EPA modified the way it considered costs under CSAPR to measure significant contributions based on cost and air quality improvement. The last step of the Good Neighbor assessment framework requires the adoption of \"permanent and effective emission reductions.\" The EPA implemented the last step of the Good Neighbor assessment framework through the promulgation of FIPs, allowing states to replace them with SIPs. Legal challenges delayed the implementation of CSAPR, but the Supreme Court upheld EPA's approach. EPA designed air quality-assured interstate emission trading programs to implement CSAPR, allowing for interstate trading with provisions for emissions reduction. The CSAPR trading programs include interstate trading with provisions to ensure emissions reductions in each state. EPA established four trading programs for affected power plants: two for annual SO2, one for annual NOX, and one for ozone-season NOX. These programs aim to help downwind areas meet air quality standards. The first phase started in 2015 to address PM2.5 and ozone NAAQS, while the second phase (CSAPR Update) began in 2017 to address the 2008 ozone NAAQS. Total emissions budget for each program equals the sum of emissions from participating states. The CSAPR trading programs include interstate trading to ensure emissions reductions in each state. Affected power plants receive allowances based on the emission budget for the trading program in the state. They can comply by reducing emissions, selling surplus allowances, or buying more on the market. The CSAPR Update updated the ozone season NOx program for the 2008 ozone NAAQS, with new FIPs for 22 states. The updated trading program began in 2017, replacing the original program. EPA's modeling analysis showed emissions reductions from 10 states. The EPA updated the CSAPR ozone season NOx trading program for 22 states to comply with the 2008 ozone NAAQS. EPA's modeling analysis showed emissions reductions from 10 states, leading to a petition for review of the update. The CSAPR does not address the Good Neighbor provision for the 2012 PM 2.5 NAAQS or the 2015 ozone NAAQS. States and EPA are evaluating interstate ozone transport for the 2015 ozone NAAQS. EPA concluded that most states will be able to develop good neighbor SIPs to comply with the 2012 PM 2.5 NAAQS. Currently, nine areas are designated nonattainment with the standard, with power sector emissions declining since 2005. Other programs, such as state NOx emission control programs, have also contributed to emission reductions. The trend of declining emissions from 2009 to 2016, attributed to the use of pollution control technologies on coal-fired power plants and increased generation at natural gas-fired units with low SO2 emissions. EPA reported an 81% decrease in SO2 emissions rate for units under CSAPR or ARP compared to 2005 rates, mostly from coal-fired units. The EIA reported a 73% reduction in national power sector SO2 emissions from 2006 to 2015, attributed to changes in the electricity generation mix, installation of pollution control technologies, and lower use of the most-polluting power plants. The eastern region of the United States had the largest share of capacity retirements. The eastern region of the United States, excluding Texas, saw the highest capacity retirements between 2008 and 2017. Emissions in 2016 were below total budgets for CSAPR trading programs, leading to low allowance prices. Preliminary data for the 2017 ozone season showed NOx emissions below budget. Emission allowance prices are influenced by various factors including supply, demand, program design, and legal uncertainties. Recent analyses of ozone season NOx emissions in the power sector have highlighted the impact of summer weather, such as higher temperatures increasing electricity demand. Compliance strategies, including the use of control technologies and switching to lower emitting fuels, affect ozone season allowance prices. In the CSAPR Update trading program, allowance prices were reported to be lower than the cost of reducing NOx emissions, with prices ranging from $150 to $175 per ton. This could result in some pollution controls not being utilized fully, leading to higher emissions. The marginal cost of reducing NOx emissions was estimated to be around $300 per ton. The EPA considered various cost thresholds for ozone season NOx reductions, ranging from $800 to $6,400 per ton, but based the CSAPR Update emission budgets on achieving reductions at $1,400 per ton. Control strategies at this cost threshold included optimizing existing SCR controls, activating idled controls, and installing advanced combustion controls. EPA reported air quality improvements attributed to these strategies. The EPA has reported improvements in air quality, attributing progress to regional SO2 and NOx transport programs. Many areas in the eastern United States originally designated as nonattainment for PM 2.5 and ozone standards now show concentrations below those standards based on 2014-2016 data. Revisions to the NAAQS trigger the SIPs review process for Good Neighbor obligations. EPA has not yet finalized its Good Neighbor determinations for the 2008 and 2015 revisions. The EPA has not finalized its Good Neighbor determinations for the 2008 and 2015 revisions to the ozone standards. The 2016 CSAPR Update did not fully satisfy the EPA's obligation to address the Good Neighbor provision for 21 states. EPA projected air quality problems at downwind monitors in 2017, even with implementation of the CSAPR Update. The EPA proposed that the CSAPR Update fully addresses most Good Neighbor obligations for the 2008 ozone standards, based on updated air quality modeling projecting to 2023. The EPA projected air quality in 2023 for the eastern United States, showing no nonattainment or maintenance monitors for the 2008 ozone standard. The selection of 2023 as the analytic year was based on downwind attainment deadlines and the need for expedited emission reductions. The potential for \"over-controlling\" emissions was also considered in the decision. The EPA projected air quality in 2023 for the eastern United States, showing no nonattainment or maintenance monitors for the 2008 ozone standard. EPA considered downwind states' obligation to attain ozone standards promptly and the need to avoid unnecessary over-control of upwind state emissions. The timing of EPA's determination for 2023 was influenced by a court order. The EPA's proposed determination on interstate ozone transport was driven by court orders, with deadlines set for five states by June 30, 2018, and finalization by December 6, 2018. Additional court-ordered and statutory deadlines exist for addressing the Good Neighbor provision for the 2008 ozone standard and requirements for eight CSAPR Update states in 2018 and 2019. Evaluation of interstate ozone transport for the 2015 ozone NAAQS is ongoing, with air quality modeling results issued in March 2018 for states to use in developing Good Neighbor SIPs. States can use modeling results to develop Good Neighbor SIPs for the 2015 ozone standard by October 1, 2018. EPA will evaluate SIPs and may require additional steps to address ozone transport. EPA's March 2018 memorandum outlines potential flexibilities for SIP development, including considerations for international ozone contributions. Feedback is sought on evaluating international contributions to NAAQS maintenance. EPA is considering potential flexibilities for SIP development, including evaluating international ozone contributions to NAAQS maintenance. SO2 and NOx emissions have decreased, with regional programs reducing interstate transport of PM2.5 and ozone in the eastern US. The EPA is evaluating potential flexibilities for SIP development, including international ozone contributions to NAAQS maintenance. Emissions of SO2 and NOx have decreased, with regional programs reducing interstate transport of PM2.5 and ozone in the eastern US. Uncertainty remains about whether emissions will stay below CSAPR budgets due to low allowance prices for ozone season NOx and banked allowances. Stakeholder views on interstate air pollution transport vary, reflecting disagreements on emission reduction levels and responsibilities among sources and states. EPA has not yet determined if ozone transport contributes to air quality issues under the 2015 ozone standard. Some stakeholders are concerned about interstate transport harming air quality, specifically with ozone and ozone precursor emissions. EPA has denied some states' petitions for additional upwind reductions in ozone precursors, citing disagreements with technical analysis. A regional organization disagreed with EPA's rejection of Connecticut's petition, stating that existing Clean Air Act tools have not been used effectively to address interstate ozone transport. EPA has not effectively addressed interstate ozone transport using existing Clean Air Act tools. Stakeholders question the feasibility of further reducing ozone precursors and are concerned about international or natural sources contributing to ambient ozone levels. NOx emissions mainly come from power plants, industrial facilities, and vehicles, with expected future declines due to various emissions reduction programs and market changes. EIA projects a decline in coal-fired power generation but stable NOx emissions in the power sector. EPA notes nonpower-sector sources may be better positioned to reduce NOx emissions cost-effectively. Uncertainty remains about nonpower-sector NOx control strategies. The impact of federal and state programs on improving air quality in areas not meeting the 2015 ozone standard is yet to be determined. EPA projected existing rules would reduce ozone precursor emissions in 2015. The EPA proposed changes to existing rules for reducing ozone precursor emissions, including freezing fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards for passenger cars and light trucks. The Affordable Clean Energy proposal for power plants would increase carbon dioxide, SO2, and NOx emissions compared to the Clean Power Plan. These changes could impact air quality levels. The EPA is considering changes to regulations on ozone precursor emissions, which could impact ozone NAAQS implementation. Current NOx allowance prices may lead to higher emissions, raising concerns about meeting emission reduction goals. State-specific emission budgets may not be enough to meet Good Neighbor obligations under the 2015 ozone standard. Additional regulatory incentives may be necessary for states to comply. Some states are urging EPA for additional regulatory incentives to fulfill Good Neighbor obligations, such as Delaware's 126(b) submission. The Trump Administration's air quality initiatives, like the \"NAAQS Reform\" and Ozone Cooperative Compliance Task Force, may impact states' obligations. The EPA created an Ozone Cooperative Compliance Task Force in response to stakeholder concerns about international ozone transport and monitoring issues. Limited information is available about the task force's actions. In March 2018, the EPA reiterated its interest in ozone issues by publishing air quality projections for Good Neighbor evaluations related to the 2015 ozone standard. The EPA sought comments on potential flexibilities for developing Good Neighbor SIPs, including considerations for international ozone transport assessment."
