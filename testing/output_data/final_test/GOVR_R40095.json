    "content": "For four decades after the Korean War, US strategy towards North Korea focused on deterring attacks on South Korea by limiting economic contact. In the 1990s, US aid to North Korea increased due to nuclear weapons development and food shortages. Assistance included energy, food, and medical supplies, totaling over $1.2 billion. US aid has decreased since 2009. The Obama Administration has not provided assistance to North Korea since early 2009. Discussions about resuming food aid have been episodic. The US offered energy and economic assistance if North Korea dismantles its nuclear program. However, due to strained relations, it is unlikely that assistance will be provided in the near future. In 1994, the US and North Korea negotiated an Agreed Framework for shutting down the nuclear program in exchange for light water nuclear reactors and heavy fuel oil. Over $400 million in fuel oil was provided between 1995 and 2003 through KEDO. The George W. Bush Administration halted energy assistance to North Korea in 2002 due to the country's secret uranium-based nuclear program. Assistance resumed in 2007 as progress was made in the Six-Party Talks. The United States provided technical assistance for nuclear disablement until 2009, when North Korea's second nuclear test effectively halted the process. North Korea's nuclear tests in 2009 and 2013 halted U.S. energy assistance discussions. North Korea has faced food shortages since the 1980s, with the U.S. being a major food aid provider after a 1995 appeal. DPRK authorities have imposed restrictions on foreign workers distributing food aid, tightening them twice since 1995. In 1995, Pyongyang tightened restrictions on food aid distribution. The United States responded by providing little to no food aid in FY2006-FY2007 and from FY2010 onwards. In February 2012, the Obama Administration agreed to resume food assistance in exchange for North Korean promises on nuclear and missile programs. However, the agreement fell apart within a month. In March 2014, Assistant Secretary of State Danny Russel mentioned the possibility of humanitarian actions with North Korea, but did not indicate any plans for food aid. Despite an improved harvest in 2013, malnutrition rates in North Korea remain high, especially among young children. The issue is likely due to inequities in the distribution system and governmental priorities, rather than food shortages. Noland estimates that a $20 million import of food could fill the 40,000 MT gap in grain supply and demand in North Korea. South Korean President Park Geun-hye's new food aid policy aims to delink humanitarian assistance from diplomatic issues, with Seoul donating $6 million to UNICEF and WHO in 2013 for North Korean aid programs. South Korean President Park Geun-hye has allowed NGOs to provide aid to North Korea, with over a dozen groups offering $8 million in assistance. President Obama supports Park's approach, including humanitarian aid and potential investments in North Korean infrastructure for reunification. The United States has provided various forms of assistance to North Korea, including medical aid and relief items. This aid has included funding for hospitals, medical equipment, training, and energy assistance under the 1994 Agreed Framework. The United States, Japan, and South Korea formed the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO) to provide energy aid to North Korea. The aid included building two light-water nuclear reactors and supplying 500,000 metric tons of fuel oil annually. However, fuel oil shipments were halted in 2002 due to a dispute over North Korea's uranium enrichment program. North Korea then expelled inspectors, withdrew from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, and resumed nuclear operations at Yongbyon, leading the Bush Administration to seek an end to the KEDO program. In 2005, the KEDO program was terminated, and foreign workers left the LWR construction site in North Korea. The Bush Administration and China worked on a multilateral forum to address the North Korean nuclear issue. Energy assistance was promised to North Korea by the Six-Party Talks members to persuade them to end their nuclear program. In 2005, the Six-Party Talks agreed to promote economic cooperation, including energy assistance, with North Korea. Talks were stalled after a nuclear test in 2006 but resumed in 2007 with a Denuclearization Action Plan, including shutting down nuclear facilities and providing fuel oil. The Six-Party Talks agreed to provide economic, energy, and humanitarian assistance to North Korea, including 1 million tons of heavy fuel oil. Shipments were to be divided equally among the five parties, but disagreements between Pyongyang and Washington slowed the process. Before the talks broke down in 2009, North Korea had received 500,000 tons of fuel oil and equipment. Congress has influenced administration policy by placing conditions on aid to North Korea, including requirements for progress in nuclear and missile negotiations. Funds were provided for energy assistance in the FY2008 Supplemental Appropriations Act, giving the President authority to waive sanctions on Pyongyang for denuclearization aid. However, this waiver was not used after the 2009 North Korean nuclear test. Congress has supported funding for denuclearization of North Korea, but energy assistance was not proposed in the Administration's budget requests from FY2011-FY2015. The Obama Administration previously sought over $150 million for North Korea-related energy and denuclearization assistance in FY2009, but these requests were rejected by House and Senate appropriators due to North Korea's actions. Since 2009, Congress has prohibited energy assistance to North Korea. The Act (P.L. 113-76) prohibits funds for assistance to North Korea unless specifically appropriated. The State and Energy Departments worked on disabling nuclear facilities at Yongbyon complex, funded through the Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund. Approximately $20 million in FY2007 and $25 million in FY2008 was approved for this purpose. NDF funds can be used without restriction and DOE's NNSA provided technical advisors. The NNSA provided technical advisors and teams overseeing disablement measures at Yongbyon, spending $15 million by July 2008. The estimated cost for full nuclear dismantlement in North Korea was $575 million over four years. Sanctions were triggered by North Korea's 2006 nuclear test, prohibiting DOE funds from being spent in the country. The DOE funds could not be spent in North Korea due to sanctions triggered by a nuclear test in 2006. Funding for disablement efforts came from the State Department's NDF fund with waiver authority. Congress passed language in FY2008 allowing the President to waive restrictions for eliminating North Korea's WMD programs. The Bush Administration considered waiving sanctions for denuclearization aid in 2008 but did not exercise the authority. The waiver authority for providing aid to North Korea was not exercised in 2008 due to a nuclear test in 2009, nullifying the waiver under P.L. 110-252. Senator Richard Lugar proposed using Department of Defense funds for denuclearization work in North Korea through the Cooperative Threat Reduction program. Authorization for CTR funds to be used globally, including for denuclearization activities in North Korea, was granted in the FY2008 Defense Authorization Act. The FY2010 Defense Authorization bill (P.L. 111-84) provided CTR program authority for funds to address urgent proliferation threats globally, including potential work in North Korea with Secretary of State approval. No DOD CTR funds have been used in North Korea. The US, Japan, and the EU have contributed funds to the IAEA for monitoring activities at Yongbyon, where North Korea expelled inspectors in 2009. North Korea initially invited IAEA monitoring as part of a 2012 agreement. The Obama Administration requested funds for denuclearization work in North Korea in FY2009. The House Appropriations Committee approved $23.5 million for the State Department's Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $77 million for the NDF, with $50 million allocated for border security in Gaza. If IAEA verification is needed in the future, extra-budgetary contributions may be required. The FY2009 funding requests for denuclearization work in North Korea included $25 million for the Global Threat Reduction Initiative and $9.5 million for disablement and dismantlement support. However, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees later removed all Department of Energy funds for North Korea, stating that assistance could be reconsidered if North Korea changed its policies. Subsequent budget requests did not specifically allocate funds for denuclearization in North Korea. The 2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act and subsequent appropriations bills did not provide denuclearization assistance to North Korea. Since 1995, the international community has donated food aid to help alleviate food shortages in North Korea, with over 12.5 million MT donated. U.S. food assistance to Pyongyang has declined dramatically over the years. Since 1995, the international community, including China, South Korea, the United States, and Japan, has been major contributors to food aid for North Korea. U.S. food assistance to Pyongyang has declined significantly, with over 90% channeled through the WFP. North Korea has been adept at seeking assistance from various donors with less stringent terms, such as China and South Korea historically. In the mid-2000s, North Korea relied on food aid from various countries, allowing them to reduce the influence of the WFP. In 2008, as relations soured with South Korea, North Korea sought food aid from the United States, leading to increased monitoring conditions. Some Members of Congress have supported aid for North Korea on humanitarian grounds, but opposition has also been voiced. In the 112th Congress, an amendment was passed to restrict U.S. food aid to North Korea, but it was later replaced with a requirement for adequate monitoring and controls. President Obama signed the bill into law in November 2011. In 2012, the Senate passed an amendment prohibiting federal food aid to North Korea as part of the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2012. In the 112th Congress, an amendment was passed to restrict U.S. food aid to North Korea, later replaced with monitoring requirements. In the 113th Congress, the Senate passed a bill prohibiting food aid to North Korea, but the House version had no such provision. In February 2014, the bill with no provision for conditioning food assistance on North Korean cooperation was signed into law by President Obama. The 111th Congress had previously included language in an appropriations act to determine North Korea's debt for U.S. food aid distributed by NGOs. The Korean government provided food aid to vulnerable women and children in northwestern North Korea. If the Obama Administration resumes food aid, they could use uncommitted food aid or tap into the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust. This trust is a financial reserve that can be used when other sources of aid are unavailable. The Administrator of USAID would likely consult with Congress before making a decision. US policy officially separates food aid from strategic interests, but diplomatic factors still influence aid decisions for North Korea. The Clinton, Bush, and Obama Administrations have all used food aid as a tool in negotiations with North Korea. While the Obama Administration claims to prioritize humanitarian considerations, diplomatic factors also play a significant role in aid decisions. The February 2012 agreement on food assistance to North Korea was seen as linked to expected concessions from North Korea. The United States has provided food aid to North Korea, which has raised moral and policy dilemmas. Pyongyang resists economic and political reforms that would improve food distribution. There are concerns about food diversion for resale, but little evidence of systematic diversion to the military. The North Korean military diverts U.N. food donations and receives the first cut of the national harvest. China, a major food aid source, lacks monitoring systems. The government's control over the country is tied to the food crisis, with elite residents in Pyongyang facing fewer shortages. North Korea relies little on foreign currency for food imports. North Korea relies on the international community for food imports and has imposed state controls over farmers and markets since 2007. A UN report in 2014 accused the government of using food as a means of control, leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths and crimes against humanity. The government's failure to distribute food equitably exacerbates the crisis. Despite the government's failure to distribute food equitably, food aid has helped feed millions of North Koreans and possibly prevented a repeat of famine conditions in the 1990s. Some argue that the North Korean people should not be punished for their government's behavior and measures can be taken to limit abuses of food aid. For example, the United States has shipped food aid to Northern provinces and considered sending nutritional products like high-protein biscuits. Food aid shipments of \"nutritional\" products like high-protein biscuits can help prevent diversion and support market expansion in North Korea. Providing aid can also serve diplomatic goals, but caution is advised against linking food to security concessions. WFP assistance peaked in 2001 but declined due to donor fatigue until a large U.S. contribution in 2008. The WFP faced challenges in meeting its food aid goal for North Korea from 2006-2008 due to donor fatigue and other global emergencies. Despite this, China and South Korea provided direct assistance, and improved harvests in North Korea helped fill the gap. In 2006, the WFP had to scale down its program due to new restrictions imposed by the North Korean government. The WFP faced challenges in providing food aid to North Korea from 2006-2008 due to donor fatigue and global emergencies. Despite assistance from China and South Korea, the WFP had to scale down its program in 2006 due to new restrictions imposed by North Korea. A new agreement was negotiated to feed 1.9 million people, cutting WFP expatriate staff by 75% to 10 people based in Pyongyang. Food shortages worsened in 2008 due to poor agricultural planning, floods in 2007, and decreased aid from China and South Korea. In 2008, North Korea sought new food aid as aid from China and South Korea declined. The United States announced resuming food assistance, providing 500,000 MT for one year. 400,000 MT would go through the WFP, and 100,000 tons through NGOs. This was possible due to improved monitoring and access, following a breakthrough in the Six-Party Talks. In June 2008, the WFP signed an agreement with Pyongyang to increase personnel and monitoring access for food aid delivery. The agreement allowed WFP to expand operations into famine-risk regions and monitor shipments to ensure food reached its intended recipients. Following the agreement, WFP issued an emergency appeal for over 600,000 MT for 6.2 million North Koreans. Operating conditions for WFP worsened in late summer 2008. In 2008, operating conditions for the WFP in North Korea worsened as the government did not fully implement parts of the agreement. The United States halted food shipments to the WFP after disagreements with Pyongyang. The WFP announced scaling back its program due to lack of donations, feeding incomplete rations to only 2 million of the 6.2 million targeted. Donors provided less than 25% of the target for the 2008-2010 emergency appeal. There were reports of mismanagement in the WFP program in North Korea, following incidents of fund misuse by another U.N. agency. Despite improvements in cooperation, North Korea asked the U.S. and NGOs to shut down their program in March 2009, earlier than scheduled. Speculation arose that this was due to deteriorating relations with the United States. The WFP closed its food aid program in North Korea due to deteriorating relations with the United States and South Korea. The program delivered 71,000 MT of food to over 900,000 people. North Korea requested additional aid as reports of worsening food situation emerged. Prices for staples in markets were soaring, prompting speculation about government motives. In 2011, the WFP launched an emergency appeal for food aid in North Korea, targeting over 3.5 million vulnerable people. Despite negotiations with North Korean counterparts, only 100,000 MT of food was provided due to lack of donor support. The operation concluded in 2012, and the WFP resumed targeting 2.4 million women and children in 2013. In early June 2013, the WFP reported a 40% funding shortfall for its North Korea program. Despite this, a new two-year operation was launched to assist 2.9 million people, mainly children and pregnant women, with over 200,000 MT of food. By February 2014, donations were still below 40% of the targeted amounts. The decision to resume food aid to North Korea involves considering various options, including linking aid to progress in security-related talks. The Obama Administration was considering linking food aid to progress in security-related talks with North Korea, but the Leap Day deal fell through. This approach has had some short-term successes in the past, but it is unclear if it leads to long-term changes in North Korea's behavior on security issues. There is a risk that it could prioritize concessions on other issues over demands for improved monitoring of food aid delivery. The United States has linked food aid to North Korean concessions in the human rights sphere, such as releasing political prisoners. The 2008 program was initiated after an agreement on improved monitoring, ensuring food reached intended recipients. Aid was shipped to Northern provinces to prevent diversion to wealthier areas. The US could insist on Pyongyang honoring concessions from 2008, harmonize policy with Seoul on food aid to North Korea, and consider tougher humanitarian demands like the previous South Korean government. Relations with North Korea have become firmer after the 2010 shelling incident, prompting discussions on providing food and fertilizer. Park Geun-hye's government is open to humanitarian assistance regardless of diplomatic tensions, but it is uncertain if they will continue the previous government's monitoring requirements. There is a suggestion for the US and South Korea to establish minimum standards for aid, and a consideration for pressuring China to monitor their food aid to North Korea. China provided significant food assistance to North Korea in 2012, totaling over 240,000 MT. The US has historically channeled most of its food aid to North Korea through the WFP. If the Obama Administration decides to resume food aid, there may be a need to reconsider the allocation between the WFP and NGO channels. The Bush Administration decided to channel one-fifth of the 2008 aid package through NGOs due to their success in monitoring assistance and gaining access to aid recipients in North Korea. The United States has also responded to humanitarian disasters in North Korea by sending aid through NGOs like Samaritan's Purse and Mercy Corps. The aid for North Korea was distributed through U.S. NGOs Samaritan's Purse and Mercy Corps. In 2008, the Bush Administration allocated $4 million to improve rural hospitals in North Korea. Various U.S. officials hinted at more aid if North Korea addressed security concerns. The Obama Administration has also shown interest in providing aid. The Obama Administration has indicated a \"comprehensive\" aid package would be forthcoming if North Korea takes positive steps on the nuclear front. U.S. development assistance programs offer flexibility in providing aid, with the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 allowing up to $50 million per country annually. However, changes in U.S. law would be needed for longer-term initiatives, as the 2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act specifically bans many forms of direct aid to North Korea. If North Korea is designated as a country involved in drug production and trafficking, it would be ineligible for most U.S. development assistance. U.S. representatives in international financial institutions are required by law to vote against any support for North Korea due to its nuclear weapons programs."
