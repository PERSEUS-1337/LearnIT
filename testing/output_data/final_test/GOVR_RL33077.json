    "content": "Witnesses in federal criminal cases may be arrested, held for bail, and sometimes imprisoned until they testify, as per 18 U.S.C. 3144. This practice has been in place since the early days of the Republic and has not been directly challenged for constitutionality. The Supreme Court has acknowledged the importance of disclosing knowledge of crimes, stating that even innocent individuals can be detained as material witnesses without bail. The federal material witness statute allows for the arrest and detention of individuals who are considered material witnesses in federal criminal cases. Critics argue that the statute has been abused, especially since September 11, 2001, with many individuals, mostly Muslims, being detained without proper cause. The federal material witness statute allows for the arrest of individuals whose testimony is crucial in a criminal proceeding. If securing their presence becomes impracticable, a judicial officer may order their arrest. Detention is not allowed if their testimony can be obtained through deposition, and further detention is unnecessary to prevent a failure of justice. Release may be delayed until their deposition can be taken. An arrest warrant for a witness with crucial evidence in a federal criminal proceeding can be issued by federal or state judges. Section 3144 allows for arrest at the request of any party in a criminal trial, but its application in grand jury proceedings is less clear. The purpose of the statute is to preserve evidence for criminal proceedings, and potential defendants have no right to present evidence to the grand jury. The government may claim benefits of section 3144 in the case of grand jury witnesses. A section 3144 arrest warrant requires probable cause to believe the witness can provide material evidence and it will be impracticable to secure their attendance simply by subpoena. The term \"material\" evidence is understood to have a natural tendency to influence the decision-making body. At the grand jury level, the government can establish probable cause to believe a witness can provide material evidence through an affidavit. Impracticality to secure the witness' attendance with a subpoena can be shown by evidence of possible flight, refusal to cooperate, or difficulty in serving a subpoena. At the grand jury level, the government can establish probable cause to believe a witness can provide material evidence through an affidavit. Evidence of difficulties serving a grand jury witness may not always justify an arrest warrant. Federal bail laws apply to material witnesses arrested under section 3144, with release favored, followed by release with conditions, and detention as a last option. Defendants are entitled to counsel during bail proceedings. The court may release a material witness on recognizance or bond if assurances are sufficient for appearance and safety. Factors considered include deposition, character, health, and community ties. If unable to comply, witness may be detained unless testimony can be secured by deposition without preventing justice. The federal deposition rule allows a detained material witness to request their deposition. The court must order the deposition and prompt release if it is shown that further detention is unnecessary to prevent a failure of justice. This mechanism provides a way for a detained witness to secure their own release. The federal deposition rule allows a detained material witness to request their deposition for release. However, exceptional circumstances and the interest of justice must be shown for a government or defendant's request for a witness' deposition. The decision to authorize depositions for a detained witness varies among Circuits, with the requirement that the court may allow depositions to be taken sua sponte in compliance with a local standing order. The admissibility of such depositions in later criminal proceedings is uncertain. The government must periodically report to the court on the justification for holding an incarcerated material witness. A material witness is entitled to daily witness fees while in custody and may receive transportation and subsistence upon release. Failure to appear after release may result in prosecution, especially if it involves avoiding testifying in a felony case. Witnesses at Congressional hearings have criticized the potential misuse of authority under 18 U.S.C. 3144. Congressional oversight hearings criticized the misuse of authority under 18 U.S.C. 3144 post-9/11, leading to indefinite incarceration of potential terrorist suspects without constitutional protections. Witnesses were held in solitary confinement, interrogated without counsel, and many were never brought to testify. The government has apologized for wrongful arrests and detentions. The government has apologized for wrongfully arresting and incarcerating individuals due to relying on false information. Congressional hearings criticized the misuse of authority post-9/11, leading to indefinite incarceration of potential terrorist suspects without proper legal protections. The Justice Department clarified that the material witness statute is a long-standing law and not a creation of the USA PATRIOT Act. The Patriot Act amended section 1001 to require the Justice Department Inspector General to review detentions under section 3144, including length, access to counsel, and appearances before a grand jury. The Inspector General's designee must also advertise availability to receive information on such activities. The Patriot Act amended section 1001 to require the Justice Department Inspector General to review detentions under section 3144, including length, access to counsel, and appearances before a grand jury. The Inspector General's designee must also advertise availability to receive information on such activities. Additionally, OMB announced support for H.R. 3199 but strongly opposed section 12, which would allow the Inspector General to investigate the use of material witnesses, citing concerns about violating Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The rule of grand jury secrecy aims to protect suspects, shield the grand jury from corrupt influences, and encourage witnesses to be forthcoming. There are exceptions to the rule, such as disclosure to Congress and certain executive branch officials. Congress has created additional exceptions to the rule in the past. The OMB has raised concerns about potential violations of Rule 6(e) in a proposed amendment. The OMB has raised concerns about a proposed amendment not being in compliance with Rule 6(e) due to potential wholesale disclosures that may conflict with the purpose of the rule. Rule 6(e) may not necessarily prohibit disclosure of certain information to designated parties like the Justice Department's Inspector General or Judiciary Committees. It is only relevant to matters before the grand jury, not information on trial witnesses' detention or details that do not identify specific witnesses. However, without section 12, Rule 6(e) would likely apply to disclosing witness identities. Section 12, Rule 6(e) may not prevent disclosure of identities of incarcerated grand jury witnesses or offenses considered by specific panels. The provision was removed from H.R. 3199, and no similar provision was found in subsequent legislation. Senator Leahy's S. 1739 revises section 3144, preferring to postpone arrest until after serving a material witness. The proposed changes include postponing arrest until after serving a material witness with a summons or subpoena, allowing arrest by officers without physical possession of the warrant, limiting detention to 5-day increments for a maximum of 30 days, and requiring the Attorney General to report on material witness warrants annually. The existing statute allows for the release of material witnesses if their testimony can be secured by deposition and further detention is not necessary to prevent a failure of justice. The proposed amendment does not include a similar provision. The proposed bill, S. 1739, would eliminate the reporting requirement for material witnesses' detention without further judicial approval. The proposed amendment to 18 U.S.C. 3144 would require biweekly reporting to the court on material witnesses held in custody for more than 10 days, stating reasons for their continued detention. A judicial officer may order the arrest of a material witness if they fail to appear after being served with a summons or subpoena. A judicial officer may waive the summons or subpoena requirement if there is clear evidence that the person may flee or cannot be secured for appearance. A warrant for a material witness must contain their name or a description, specify the need for their testimony in a criminal case, command their arrest, and inform them of their right to counsel. A warrant issued for a material witness must be executed upon arrest, with the officer showing the warrant to the witness. After execution, the warrant must be returned to the judicial officer. An unexecuted warrant can be canceled at the request of the US attorney. Upon arrest, a material witness warrant must be executed and shown to the witness, then returned to a judicial officer for cancellation. The witness must be brought promptly before a judicial officer for an initial appearance, where they will be informed of the warrant, their rights to counsel, and given the opportunity to consult with an attorney. Upon the appearance before a judicial officer, a material witness arrested under a warrant must be released or detained based on the judicial officer's decision. The witness is entitled to consult with counsel and may be transferred to a different district if necessary. The judicial officer can order the release of the witness on personal recognizance or with certain conditions unless determined otherwise. The judicial officer may order the detention of a material witness for up to 5 days if no conditions will assure their appearance, or until their testimony can be secured by deposition or court appearance. The judicial officer may order the detention of a material witness for up to 5 days, extendable for additional periods of up to 5 days, or until testimony can be secured by deposition or court appearance. The total detention period may not exceed 30 days for a criminal case or 10 days for a grand jury proceeding. A motion must show good cause for why testimony couldn't be secured earlier. The judicial officer may order the detention of a material witness for up to 5 days, extendable for additional periods of up to 5 days, or until testimony can be secured by deposition or court appearance. The total detention period may not exceed 30 days for a criminal case or 10 days for a grand jury proceeding. A release order must comply with specific requirements, and a detention order must ensure the witness is held separately from criminal offenders under the least restrictive conditions possible. The Attorney General is required to report to the Senate and House Judiciary Committees. The Attorney General must provide an annual report to the Senate and House Judiciary Committees on the use of a specific section by the US Government in the past year. The report includes the number of warrants sought and granted or denied, the number of material witnesses arrested, and the average detention period. Several articles have been written on the unconstitutionality of \"Hold Until Cleared\" and the reexamination of material witness detentions post September 11th. Authors such as Boyle, Carlson, Iraola, Levinson, Margulies, Studnicki, and others have discussed the issues surrounding the detention of material witnesses in the context of terrorism and the rule of law.
