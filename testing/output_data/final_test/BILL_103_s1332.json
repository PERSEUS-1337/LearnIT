    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Farmington Wild and Scenic River Act\". It includes findings related to the Act. The Farmington Wild and Scenic River Act authorized a study of two segments of the West Branch of the Farmington River in Massachusetts and Connecticut for potential inclusion in the wild and scenic rivers system. The study found both segments eligible based on their free-flowing condition and outstanding values. The towns abutting the Connecticut segment of the Farmington River have shown support for national wild and scenic river designation through town meetings and protective measures like river protection overlay districts. The Upper Farmington River Management Plan was prepared by the National Park Service to protect the river's values and resources. The Farmington River Study Committee unanimously adopted the plan and recommended including the Connecticut segment in the wild and scenic rivers system. If town votes do not support designation, no action will be taken. The Upper Farmington River Management Plan was prepared to protect the river's values and resources. The plan recommended including the Connecticut segment in the wild and scenic rivers system. If town votes do not support designation, no action will be taken regarding wild and scenic river designation of the Massachusetts segment. The Upper Farmington River Management Plan recommends including the Connecticut segment in the wild and scenic rivers system. If town votes do not support designation, no action will be taken regarding wild and scenic river designation of the Massachusetts segment. SEC. 3. WILD, SCENIC, AND RECREATIONAL RIVER DESIGNATION. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act is amended to designate the 14-mile segment of the Farmington River in Connecticut as a recreational river, to be managed by the Secretary of the Interior in cooperation with the Farmington River Coordinating Committee. The Farmington River Study Committee established a Plan on April 29, 1993, satisfying the requirement for a comprehensive management plan. A Farmington River Coordinating Committee was formed to assist in long-term protection and implementation of the Plan, with specific membership and administrative procedures outlined in the Plan. This Committee is not a Federal advisory committee and is not subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Director of the National Park Service represents the Secretary in implementing the Plan for the Farmington River segment. They review federally assisted water projects that could impact the segment's values and can enter into cooperative agreements with Connecticut and local towns. The Director of the National Park Service can provide assistance and funding for the implementation of the Plan for the Farmington River segment. The segment designated shall not become part of the National Park System or be subject to its regulations. Water resources projects that may impact the segment's values are reviewed to prevent adverse effects. The Secretary will consider the project's consistency with the Plan when including a segment in the national wild and scenic rivers system. Congress finds that the operation of certain hydroelectric facilities will not adversely affect the designated segment's values. The Act allows the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to license or relicense the Colebrook Dam and Goodwin Dam hydroelectric projects without affecting the designated river. The inclusion of the segment in the wild and scenic rivers system will not impair the operation of the Colebrook Dam and Reservoir for flood control purposes. The Plan's instream flow analysis is crucial for project operations. The Plan's instream flow analysis is essential for maintaining instream resources and assessing compatibility between resource protection and water supply withdrawals. Zoning ordinances in certain Connecticut towns satisfy standards for land management under the Act. The Act prohibits Federal acquisition of lands by condemnation, except for other purposes or using Federal funds administered by State or local agencies. The Federal Government shall not manage lands not owned by them along the segment and its tributaries. No distinct lateral boundary shall be established for the designated river segment. The Act prohibits Federal acquisition of lands by condemnation, except for other purposes or using Federal funds administered by State or local agencies. No distinct lateral boundary shall be established for the designated river segment. Authorization of appropriations is provided for carrying out the designated river segment."
