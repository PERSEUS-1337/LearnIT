    "content": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been recognized as a significant issue for servicemembers and veterans returning from deployments. The Traumatic Brain Injury Act of 2008 led to collaboration between the CDC, NIH, DOD, and VA to improve TBI diagnosis and treatment. Congressional attention to TBI among veterans has also continued. The report focuses on the VA's efforts to understand and treat TBI among veterans, including programs for OEF/OIF veterans. TBI is defined as brain function alteration caused by external force, with military TBI often from explosions or head trauma. The DOD reported 27,324 servicemembers sustained TBI in 2013, with the total number of veterans with TBI unknown due to difficulty in identification. TBI encompasses a range of conditions classified as focal or diffuse, open or closed, and mild, moderate, or severe. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can be classified as open or closed, and mild, moderate, or severe. Severity is determined by factors like loss of consciousness, post-traumatic amnesia duration, and Glasgow Coma Scale scores. Individuals with TBI may experience a range of problems, including changes in physical functioning, cognition, sensory processing, communication, and behavior. Approximately 40% of patients develop postconcussion syndrome with symptoms like headaches, dizziness, memory problems, and anxiety. Symptoms may depend on the severity of the TBI, the injured brain part, age, and general health. Individuals with TBI may experience physical signs like headaches, fatigue, dizziness, and cognitive problems such as memory issues, difficulty concentrating, and impaired judgment. Moderate to severe TBI can also cause symptoms like repeated nausea, seizures, numbness, and coordination loss. Individuals with mild TBI may experience sensory problems like vision, hearing, taste, smell, or touch. Vision issues can affect driving or operating machinery, while hand-eye coordination difficulties may lead to clumsiness. Communication problems, including speaking and understanding, can cause confusion and frustration for individuals with TBI. Individuals with TBI may struggle with communication, writing, reading, and behavioral problems such as depression, anxiety, aggression, and impulsive behavior. They may also experience mood swings, sleep problems, and comorbid conditions like PTSD and depression. Some studies suggest a link between TBI and increased alcohol or drug use. Individuals with TBI are at risk of developing epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy can result from repetitive head blows, leading to cognitive and motor impairments. Post-traumatic hypopituitarism may cause other neuroendocrine disorders. Sleep disturbances are common in individuals with TBI. Individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) may experience various complications such as sleep disturbances, obstructive sleep apnea, incontinence, sexual dysfunction, metabolic dysfunction, and musculoskeletal dysfunction. Treatment for TBI depends on the severity of the injury and may include surgery, medication, rehabilitation, psychotherapy, and case management. Severe TBI can result in long-term physical or mental disabilities requiring ongoing rehabilitation and nursing care in different settings. The transition from acute care in a hospital to home-based rehabilitation services for individuals with moderate to severe TBI involves changing treatment types and care settings over time. Acute care includes surgical interventions, medication, and other interventions to address the TBI and any other injuries, typically provided by a multidisciplinary healthcare team. The multidisciplinary team for individuals with moderate to severe TBI includes neurosurgery, neurology, physical medicine, psychiatry, and neuropsychology. Ancillary services like therapy should start during acute care for better outcomes. The duration of acute care varies based on TBI severity, functional impairment, comorbid conditions, and age. Acute care continues until medical stability before transitioning to post-acute care. Post-acute care for individuals with moderate to severe TBI involves intensive rehabilitation in various settings tailored to their needs in physical, occupational, and speech therapy, mental health care, and social support. Long-term services aim to maintain or improve physical functioning and quality of life by addressing limitations in performing daily activities independently. Long-term services and supports for individuals with moderate to severe TBI involve assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs) due to physical or cognitive limitations. This may include help with tasks like preparing meals, doing laundry, and medication management. Support can be provided through special equipment, assistive devices, or technology. Services may be offered in institutional settings, community-based centers, or private homes, and can be formal (paid) or informal (unpaid). Long-term services and supports for individuals with moderate to severe TBI involve assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs) due to physical or cognitive limitations. This may include help with tasks like preparing meals, doing laundry, and medication management. Support can be provided through special equipment, assistive devices, or technology in various settings such as adult day health care centers or private homes. Formal caregivers, including licensed health care workers like nurses and therapists, or non-licensed workers like nursing assistants and aides, may provide these services. Informal caregivers, such as family members and friends, also play a significant role in providing long-term care. VA spending for TBI in FY2014 was $229 million, with $55 million allocated for OEF/OIF veterans, and is estimated to be $234 million in FY2015. In FY2015, VA spending for TBI is estimated to be $234 million, with $61 million allocated for OEF/OIF veterans. The 10-year costs of TBI from FY2016 to FY2025 are projected to be $2.2 billion, including $0.5 billion for OEF/OIF veterans. Treatment for TBI depends on the severity of the injury, with mild cases often resolving without medical attention. Moderate or severe TBI requires immediate treatment, starting at the site of the event for servicemembers and continuing at military or VA medical facilities. The VA provides programs and services for TBI, including coordinating care transition from DOD, screening, acute and post-acute care, and long-term support. Coordination between DOD and VA facilities is essential for servicemembers transferring. VA conducts TBI research independently and collaboratively. VA Liaison Program, OEF/OIF Care Management, and Federal Recovery Coordinator Program assist in the transition to VA health care facilities for veterans with TBI and other qualified individuals. The VA Liaison Program provides onsite consultation about VA resources at military treatment facilities for veterans with TBI and other qualified individuals. OEF/OIF Care Management teams at VA Medical Centers coordinate and track care for severely ill or injured OEF/OIF servicemembers and veterans. Program managers, clinical case managers, and transition patient advocates are part of the care management team. Transition patient advocates serve as personal advocates for patients navigating the VA health care system. The Federal Recovery Coordination Program (FRCP) was established in 2007 to coordinate services for veterans and servicemembers with TBI. It allows self-referral or referral by clinicians, family members, or veterans service organizations. Each enrollee is assigned a Federal Recovery Coordinator for care coordination. As of December 2012, there were 24 coordinators and 902 active clients, including 412 veterans. The FRCP faced challenges in coordinating with other programs, as most enrollees are also in other wounded servicemember or veteran programs. The Interagency Care Coordination Committee (IC3) was established in November 2012 to monitor DOD and VA care coordination activities for wounded servicemembers and veterans. It found that over 50 programs were operating with more than 240 agency policies. In January 2013, a feasibility assessment of a \"Lead Coordinator\" concept was launched at two VA medical centers and one military treatment facility. Since 2007, VA policy requires screening all OEF/OIF veterans for possible TBI to ensure cases are not overlooked. A screening instrument from the DOD is used in the VA health care system to prompt further evaluation and specialized treatment for those who test positive. The VA health care system uses a screening instrument to prompt further evaluation for veterans who test positive for possible TBI, as symptoms can overlap with PTSD. Specialized training is required to conduct a Comprehensive TBI Evaluation, including determining the origin of the injury and preparing a treatment plan. The VA Office of Inspector General found that most VA staff informed veterans of TBI screening results, referred positive cases for evaluations, and made efforts to reschedule missed appointments. However, some cases lacked timely comprehensive evaluations, assigned case managers, care plans, or documentation of care plan sharing. Veterans with moderate or severe TBI can receive care through the VA Polytrauma/TBI System of Care. The Polytrauma System of Care (PSC) was established in 2005 to provide specialized treatment for veterans with traumatic injuries. It operates within the VA health care system and consists of four components: Polytrauma Rehabilitation Centers, Polytrauma Network Sites, Polytrauma Support Clinic Teams, and Polytrauma Points of Contact. In FY2013, the PSC served over 50,000 unique patients in outpatient clinics and inpatient units. The Polytrauma System of Care (PSC) includes five regional Polytrauma Rehabilitation Centers that serve as referral centers providing acute inpatient medical and rehabilitation services. Each center has an interdisciplinary treatment team including various healthcare professionals. Additionally, there are twenty-three Polytrauma Network Sites that provide continued medical care and rehabilitation services to veterans, servicemembers, and families following discharge. The Polytrauma System of Care includes regional Polytrauma Rehabilitation Centers and Polytrauma Network Sites that offer medical care and rehabilitation services to veterans, servicemembers, and families. Polytrauma Support Clinic Teams extend care to VA medical facilities without specialized centers. VA medical centers have designated Polytrauma Points of Contact for treatment coordination. The VA has designated Polytrauma Points of Contact to coordinate treatment for veterans at facilities lacking specialized care. These points of contact also offer a limited range of rehabilitation services and assist with case management and referrals. Long-term services and supports are provided through various programs with different eligibility criteria, with TBI being one qualifying condition. The VA prefers home or community-based treatment over institutional care when possible, and there is a pilot program for assisted living services for veterans with TBI. The VA offers institutional and noninstitutional long-term care services for eligible veterans, including those with TBI, who require nursing home level of care. These services can be provided in VA Community Living Centers, private nursing homes, or state veterans' homes. Veterans may stay temporarily or permanently in these settings. Noninstitutional care services are also available for veterans who can live independently with some assistance for their health conditions. The VA offers various long-term care services for eligible veterans, including those with TBI. These services can be provided in different settings such as VA Community Living Centers, private nursing homes, or state veterans' homes. Veterans can receive assistance for their health conditions through programs like community residential care, adult day health care, home-based primary care, skilled home care, and more. The VA also has a pilot program for assisted living services for veterans with TBI, administered through contracts with non-VA residential care facilities specializing in TBI rehabilitation. The AL-TBI pilot program, established under the National Defense Authorization Act, was extended through the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act. The program was further amended by the Veterans Traumatic Brain Injury Care Improvement Act, allowing the VA to contract with non-VA facilities to provide community-based brain injury residential rehabilitative care for OEF/OIF veterans with TBI. The VA has proposed legislation to authorize payments for care in VA-approved Medical Foster Homes (MFHs) for veterans who would otherwise need nursing home care. Currently, over 600 VA-approved caregivers provide MFH care to more than 700 veterans in 43 states. The VA estimates the 10-year costs would be $176 million. The VA proposed legislation to establish a program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers of eligible veterans with serious injuries. The program offers a monthly stipend, medical care, mental health care, and respite care. Additional services include training, travel payment, and counseling. The estimated 10-year costs would be $176 million. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the VA underestimated demand for services in the caregiver program, leading to delays in delivering benefits. The VA's general caregiver support program provides limited benefits to a larger group of veterans, open to caregivers of any veteran needing personal care services. The VA caregiver support program offers services such as information, training, respite care, and counseling for caregivers of veterans. Post-9/11 military caregivers differ from those of previous eras, being younger, more diverse, employed, and often caring for individuals with mental health or substance use disorders. Military caregivers, especially post-9/11, experience worse health outcomes, strains in family relationships, and workplace problems. The VA supports TBI research through the Office of Research and Development and the Mental Health Strategic Healthcare Group, focusing on developing treatments and studying brain changes. The VA collaborates with the Department of Education's NIDRR to develop the Traumatic Brain Injury Veterans Health Registry for OEF/OIF veterans with TBI. They are also working on establishing a database to facilitate research collaboration and program evaluation. Congress has encouraged VA to collaborate with other entities involved in TBI research. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 required the VA to collaborate with various entities involved in TBI research, including the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center, NIDRR grantees, and other governmental entities."
