The Act is titled the \"Coastal Barrier Resources Reauthorization Act of 2000\" and includes guidelines for recommendations and determinations regarding the addition of areas to the Coastal Barrier Resources System. The Secretary must consider factors such as low development density and existing infrastructure when determining if a coastal barrier is undeveloped. The subsection outlines the requirements for structures in designated coastal barrier areas, including access roads, wastewater disposal systems, electric service, and fresh water supply for each building site. The term \"structure\" is defined as a walled and roofed building above ground covering at least 200 square feet. This subsection does not override official maps referenced in a previous section. SEC. 3. VOLUNTARY ADDITIONS TO JOHN H. CHAFEE COASTAL BARRIER RESOURCES SYSTEM. The Secretary may add undeveloped coastal barriers to the System upon written request from the owner of the parcel. Technical amendments are made regarding the additions of excess property. The U.S.C. 3503 is amended in paragraph (1) as part of the voluntary additions to the John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System. The U.S.C. 3503 is amended to change \"one hundred and eighty\" to \"180\" and remove \"shall\" in subparagraph (B). The Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1990 is amended to make changes to subsections and conforming amendments are made to Section 4. Additionally, a new subsection (f) regarding maps is added to show boundary modifications. The Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1990 is amended to include provisions for boundary modifications and additions of real property to the System. Maps reflecting these changes must be available for public inspection and provided to relevant government entities. The Coastal Barrier Resources Act is amended to include undeveloped coastal barriers and areas identified on maps dated October 24, 1990, which may be modified under specific provisions of law enacted after November 16, 1990.

A digital mapping pilot project is established.\" The Secretary of the Interior will conduct a pilot project to create digital versions of the John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System maps. The project will include digital maps for 50 to 75 units of the System, with a portion being otherwise protected areas. The Secretary will use existing digital spatial data from State, local, and Federal agencies for the pilot project. Federal agencies must provide data upon request at no cost. If necessary data is missing, an agreement with the US Geological Survey will be made to obtain it. The Director, in collaboration with other Federal agencies, will provide necessary data to the Secretary for implementing this section. Data used must comply with national standards and those set by the Federal Geographic Data Committee. Determinations regarding the System should not rely on digital maps. The Secretary must submit a report to the Committee within 3 years of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress within 3 years of the Act's enactment, detailing the results of a pilot project on digital mapping for the entire System. The report will cover cooperative agreements, data availability, additional data needs, boundary line accuracy, and funding requirements for completing digital mapping. The Secretary of the Interior will provide an economic assessment of the John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System to Congress within one year of the Act's enactment. This assessment will analyze the impact of the Coastal Barrier Resources Act on Federal expenditures, including the avoidance of such expenditures. Authorization of $500,000 for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2004 is provided for digital mapping of the entire System. The economic assessment of the John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System will analyze the impact on Federal expenditures, including disaster relief, flood insurance, and development assistance for infrastructure.
