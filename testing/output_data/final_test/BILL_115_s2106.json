The total payment to a State is calculated based on the voting age population compared to all States, with a minimum payment of one-half of 1 percent of the total appropriation. Pro rata reductions may be made to comply with this requirement, and funds remain available to the State after appropriation. Authorization of $325,000,000 for payments under this subsection without fiscal year limitation. Enforcement through civil enforcement and private rights of action under the National Voter Registration Act. No authorization for prohibited conduct under other laws.

Definitions in the Act include terms like \"Commission,\" \"election,\" \"Federal office,\" and \"State.\" State registration portability allows a registrant who has moved within the same state to vote at their current address or a central location within the same registrar's jurisdiction, even if they failed to update their address before the election. This amendment will take effect on January 1, 2019."
