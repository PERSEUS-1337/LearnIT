Federal contract dollars awarded to ANCs and their subsidiaries increased significantly between FY2000 and FY2008, with ANC-owned firms receiving a substantial increase in contract dollars through the 8(a) Program. Critics are worried about the impact of these increases on other minority-owned businesses in the program. Supporters of contracting programs for Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs) argue that even with recent increases in federal contract dollars, contracting with ANCs and their subsidiaries still represents a small percentage of total federal contract dollars. They emphasize that profits from federal contracts are crucial for improving the economic well-being of Alaska Natives. Legislation has been introduced in the 112th Congress (H.R. 598, S. 236) to subject ANC-owned firms in the 8(a) Program to the same treatment as individually owned firms, including limiting sole-source awards to $4 million ($6.5 million for manufacturing contracts). The Small Business Administration's 8(a) minority contracting program slightly predates the creation of Alaska Native Corporations. ANCs were created under the authority of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) in 1971 to settle Alaska Natives' aboriginal land claims. Congress's intent in passing ANCSA was shared by Alaska Native tribes. Congress passed the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) in 1971 to settle Alaska Natives' land claims without creating permanent racially defined institutions or a reservation system. ANCSA authorized Native corporations, not tribes, to receive lands and monies for economic development, holding the lands in fee simple for development without federal approval. The functions of the state-wide Alaska Native Investment Corporation have been assigned to the Regional Corporations. The Investment Corporation aims to conduct profitable business activities and provide long-term dividends to Native stockholders. ANCSA created various types of Alaska Native Corporations, including 12 regional corporations based on specified regions and village corporations for communities with populations of 25 or more. ANCSA created various types of Alaska Native Corporations, including 12 regional corporations based on specified regions and village corporations for communities with populations of 25 or more. The settlement provided for the conveyance of 40 million acres and $962.5 million to the ANCs, mainly the regional and village corporations, based on acreage and population. Group and urban corporations also received a set number of acres each. The settlement under ANCSA provided for the conveyance of 40 million acres and $962.5 million to the ANCs, including regional and village corporations, based on acreage and population. The ANCs were to hold their lands in private fee title, subject to taxation, and distribute funds to village corporations. Regional corporations were to operate as for-profit entities, and village corporations as either for-profit or non-profit entities, with investment revenues subject to taxation. In 1975, Congress included regional and village ANCs in the definition of \"Indian tribe\" in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. This definition was later used in amendments to the Small Business Act. In 1978, an amendment allowed small businesses owned by Indian tribes to be eligible for the loan program under Section 7(a) of the Small Business Act. In 1986, economically disadvantaged Indian tribes and ANCs became eligible for the 8(a) Program using the 1975 definition. These amendments were made in response to complaints from Indian tribes about eligibility for the programs. Tribes and ANCs still had to prove economic disadvantage for 8(a) Program eligibility. In 1988, ANCSA specified ANCs as \"minority business enterprises\" under federal law. In 1988, ANCSA specified ANCs as \"minority business enterprises\" under federal law. However, ANCs were not deemed economically disadvantaged by the SBA despite being designated as minority business enterprises. The distinction between disadvantaged business enterprises and minority business enterprises led to Native corporations not qualifying as DBEs for SBA programs. In 1992, Congress clarified that Native Corporations were considered \"economically disadvantaged\" for all federal law purposes. ANCs have increased their involvement in the 8(a) Program since 1988. ANCs were intended to be the engines for economic development of Alaska Natives, but variations in regions and villages led to differences in settlement funds and land conveyance among ANCs. Since 1971, Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs) have varied in their initial funding, land resources, and economic development opportunities. They have also shown differences in business success, growth, income, and losses, with a pattern of loss, recovery, and gradual expansion. ANCs organized, selected land, and received payments in the 1970s, with the last major payments made in 1980. Investments in various businesses like hotels, seafood processing, and oilfield services were made in the 1970s and 1980s. The regional Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs) experienced significant financial losses between 1971-1985, particularly in non-resource business operations. Economist Steve Colt noted that the ANCs collectively lost money every year except for 1974 and 1985, with a total loss of about $380 million between 1973-1993. Additionally, the ANCs faced challenges with costly litigation related to the interpretation and application of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA). The regional Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs) faced financial losses between 1971-1985, with challenges in land selections, enrollment, ANC elections, and revenue-sharing. ANCs briefly sold net operating losses (NOLs) between 1986-1988, generating $410 million for regional ANCs and $500 million for village ANCs. Congress allowed this opportunity by adding a provision to the Internal Revenue Code, which was later repealed in 1988. The regional Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs) faced financial losses between 1971-1985, but NOL sales proceeds provided a cash infusion equal to two thirds of the original ANCSA payments. ANC income from NOL sales recapitalized struggling regional corporations, allowing them to benefit from the economic boom in the early 1990s. ANCs made profitable investments in various industries, including tourism, oilfield services, communications, and federal contracting through the SBA's 8(a) Program. The SBA's 8(a) Program was beneficial for Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs), with ANCs becoming economically disadvantaged for federal programs in 1992. By 1997, ANCs like Aleut Corporation and Chugach Alaska Corporation were earning most of their revenues from 8(a) contracts. A 2006 GAO report showed a steady increase in the number of ANCs with 8(a) subsidiaries, reaching 49 ANCs and 154 subsidiaries by December 2005. As of 2005, most regional ANCs had 8(a) subsidiaries, along with village and urban ANCs. Various authorities govern contracting between federal agencies and ANCs or ANC-owned firms, including general contracting authorities, small business authorities, Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act, Native American authorities, and appropriations riders. The Armed Services Procurement Act of 1947 and the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 give defense and civilian agencies broad contracting authority. Agencies can make awards to the lowest qualified bidder, including ANCs and their subsidiaries. Sole-source awards to ANCs or ANC-owned firms can be made under specific circumstances, such as when only one source can supply the goods or services, there are compelling circumstances, or national security considerations are involved. Sole-source awards to Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs) or their subsidiaries can be justified in writing and require approval from superiors. ANCs may not always qualify as \"small\" under size standards, but can still receive awards under general contracting authorities, regardless of profit status. Non-profit ANCs could receive awards under general contracting authorities when they do not qualify under small business authorities. Contracts can be awarded to small Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs) or ANC-owned firms under general small business authorities. Special authorities for contracting with small businesses are provided by Section 15 of the Small Business Act of 1958, along with Sections 2711 and 2723 of the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984. Agencies can \"set aside\" contracts for small businesses under certain conditions, either totally or partially. Sole-source awards to small businesses can also be made under specific circumstances authorized by general contracting authorities. ANC-owned firms contracting under general small business authorities are subject to notice, justification, and approval requirements. Certain affiliations with the parent ANC or its subsidiaries are excluded when determining the size of an ANC-owned firm, unless it results in unfair competitive advantage. The SBA and agencies rarely exercise authority within an industry category. ANC-owned firms must be for-profit and self-certify as \"small\" to be awarded contracts under small business authorities. Self-certifications may not be closely scrutinized, but misrepresentation can lead to severe penalties. The Small Business Act of 1958 authorizes set-asides and sole-source awards to socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns, including firms owned and controlled by ANCs, Indian tribes, NHOs, or CDCs. Contracts below the competitive threshold can be awarded on a sole-source basis without competition among 8(a) firms. Contracts exceeding the competitive threshold must be set aside for competitions among all 8(a) firms, unless there is not a reasonable expectation of at least two eligible firms submitting offers at a fair price. Agencies also have the authority to make sole-source awards to ANC- or group-owned firms under Section 8(a) in certain circumstances. This authority does not stem from the Competition in Contracting Act, so the requirements for justifications, approvals, and notices differ from other sole-source awards. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY2010 changed requirements for sole-source contracts awarded under Section 8(a), with justifications, approvals, and notices now needed for contracts over $20 million. However, contracts valued between $4 million and $20 million do not require these. Agency discretion is broad, but firms must meet eligibility requirements for the 8(a) Program. The 8(a) Program has specific requirements for ANC-owned firms, including being small under SBA's size standards, unconditionally owned by the ANC, demonstrating potential for success, and increasing non-8(a) income over time. These firms are subject to scrutiny due to perceived special procurement advantages. ANC-owned firms participating in the 8(a) Program must meet specific requirements, including demonstrating potential for success and increasing non-8(a) income over time. They must submit extensive documentation for their application and annual updates, which may reveal issues such as joint ventures that raise concerns about their eligibility for 8(a) contracts. However, there are doubts about the SBA's ability to thoroughly review these firms, as highlighted in a 2008 GAO report. The SBA's resources for reviewing 8(a) firms are questioned, with a GAO report stating that the SBA may struggle to implement new rules to strengthen 8(a) firms' role in joint ventures. Provisions incentivize contracting with ANCs and their subsidiaries, with bonuses for federal prime contractors who subcontract with them. Congress authorized bonuses for federal prime contractors who subcontract with ANCs or ANC-owned firms in 1988 to address concerns about the lack of incentive to use Indian-owned subcontractors. The Department of Defense received appropriations for subcontracting bonuses, with the amount increasing to $15 million per year during the 110th Congress. Other agencies have the same authority but have not received similar appropriations. Prime contractors must make efforts to give Indian organizations and enterprises maximum subcontracting opportunities to be eligible for bonuses. The federal government encourages subcontracting with Indian organizations and enterprises, including Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs) and their subsidiaries. Subcontracts awarded to ANCs or Indian tribes count towards subcontracting goals for small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses, regardless of their size or certification status. Challenges to eligibility are referred to the Bureau of Indian Affairs for determination. The Small Business Act requires federal agencies to negotiate subcontracting plans with successful bidders on prime contracts, setting goals for awarding subcontracts to small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses. Failure to comply could result in contract termination or liquidated damages. Subcontracts with other firms must also meet SBA regulations for small business qualification. Until October 3, 2008, firms had to be certified SDBs for subcontracts to count towards contractors' goals. All 8(a) firms were considered SDBs, but other firms owned and controlled by disadvantaged individuals could also be certified. Large ANCs or ANC affiliates can qualify as \"small disadvantaged businesses\" for DOT contracts if they obtain necessary certifications. The TEA-21 originally required at least 10 percent of funds to be allocated. The TEA-21 initially mandated that a minimum of 10 percent of funds be allocated for small business concerns owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. However, later regulations interpreted this as an \"aspirational goal\" rather than a requirement, allowing large ANCs to qualify as small disadvantaged businesses for DOT contracts. This is significant as the definition of \"small business\" under TEA-21 differs from the Small Business Act. The definition of \"small business\" under TEA-21 differs from the Small Business Act, potentially making some non-ANC-owned firms ineligible for DOT programs. Women-owned firms are included in the category of \"small disadvantaged businesses\" under TEA-21, which could create conflicts with ANC-owned firms. Women-owned small businesses must prove they are socially disadvantaged to qualify for SBA programs. The Department of Defense can contract functions to ANCs without restrictions. The Department of Defense can contract functions to ANCs or ANC-owned firms without going through the competitive sourcing process required under OMB Circular A-76. This allows DOD to avoid restrictions on outsourcing by contracting functions out to firms owned by ANCs, Indian tribes, or NHOs. The 106th Congress made modifications to a rider that restricted outsourcing using the A-76 process, exempting direct conversions to firms owned by ANCs, Indian tribes, or NHOs. The exemptions for direct conversions remained unchanged since the 106th Congress. The 112th Congress introduced legislation to remove special rules for contracting with ANC-owned 8(a) firms, subjecting them to eligibility requirements like individually owned 8(a) firms. This would amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act to ensure ANCs are treated similarly to other 8(a) firms. H.R. 598 and S. 236 aim to amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act to remove special contracting rules for ANC-owned firms, making them subject to the same eligibility requirements as other 8(a) firms. This would prevent ANCs from receiving sole source awards over $4 million under the 8(a) Program. The proposed legislation would amend Section 8(a) to subject ANC-owned firms to competitive thresholds, count all affiliations of ANC-owned firms when determining size, and limit ANC participation in the 8(a) Program to one time. It would also prevent ANC-owned firms from receiving additional sole-source awards exceeding $100 million, prohibit exemptions from time limitations, and require ANCs to report revenue and benefits paid to shareholders annually. The proposed legislation H.R. 598 and S. 236 aim to amend regulations for the 8(a) Program, specifically targeting ANC-owned firms. The changes include prohibiting ANCs from waiving requirements for management control, limiting ANC participation to one firm at a time, and restricting ownership interests in other 8(a) firms. Additionally, SBA amended rules on February 11, 2011, affecting eligibility for ANC-owned 8(a) firms. The SBA amended rules on February 11, 2011, affecting eligibility for ANC-owned 8(a) firms. The new rules require ANCs to report annually on benefits to Alaska Natives, prohibit non-8(a) firms from forming joint ventures for sole-source contracts over $4 million, and shift ANC-owned firms' 8(a) Program applications to the San Francisco Division for processing. The SBA amended rules on February 11, 2011, affecting eligibility for ANC-owned 8(a) firms. These changes generally took effect on March 14, 2011, with the requirement for ANCs to report on benefits provided to Alaska Natives being delayed."
