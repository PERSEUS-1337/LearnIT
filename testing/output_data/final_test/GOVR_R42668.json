    "content": "Congress has shown ongoing interest in patent assertion entities (PAEs) or \"patent trolls.\" The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011 called for further study of PAE litigation. Hearings have been held on abusive patent litigation and PAEs. The International Trade Commission has seen a rise in patent complaints. The AIA and a Supreme Court ruling prompted action, but Congress passed only a few provisions addressing PAEs, leaving other related issues unresolved. The PAE business model focuses on buying and asserting patents against companies that have already begun using them, gaining notoriety with lawsuits over technologies like wireless email and digital video streaming. Despite attention from Congress and the public since 2006, successful court victories for PAEs are rare. BlackBerry wireless service. PAEs typically lose 92% of merits judgments, leading to settlements due to the high costs and risks of litigation. The AIA may reduce meritless lawsuits, but concerns remain about extracting undue royalties from defendants. Post-grant examination and restrictions on joinder may help address these issues. Reform advocates are concerned about the negative impact of PAEs on innovation and the economy, with studies showing significant costs to defendants and licensees. PAE activity could harm competition by imposing costs on rivals. Defenders argue that PAEs promote invention by managing investment risks. PAEs promote invention by managing investment risks and compensating small inventors. Universities and non-practicing entities benefit from PAEs as buyers for their patents. Concerns about unintended consequences and collateral effects of changes to the law have been raised. The Federal Trade Commission and scholars suggest that the costs of PAE activity outweigh the benefits under current law. Congress is considering rebalancing any disparity in Section 34 of the AIA. The AIA instructed the Government Accountability Office to study the costs and consequences of litigation by non-practicing entities and patent assertion entities, but the study has not been released. The report reviews the debate surrounding PAEs, reasons for the rise in litigation, and legislative options for Congress. Patent law is based on the U.S. Constitution and the Patent Act of 1952, granting inventors the right to exclude others from using their inventions for 20 years. Inventors can acquire patents by submitting an application to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) for inventions, granting exclusive rights for 20 years. The application includes claims defining the patent property right and a detailed specification of the invention. Claims must be for a patentable subject matter and meet requirements of novelty, nonobviousness, and utility. The patent holder can enforce its rights. The patent holder can enforce its rights by filing infringement suits in federal court against anyone who makes, uses, sells, or imports the patented technology. Courts presume patents granted by the PTO are valid, but accused infringers can argue invalidity or unenforceability. Patent litigation is costly, with the average suit costing $1.6 million through discovery and $2.8 million through trial. If infringement is found, a federal court may issue an injunction or award monetary damages. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has national jurisdiction over most patent appeals from district courts. Patent holders can enforce their rights by filing complaints with the International Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion orders blocking importation of infringing products. Patent litigation rates have increased due to \"patent assertion entities\" (PAEs) profiting from patents without developing technologies themselves. Arbitrageurs in the IT sector exploit the gap between patent costs and infringement value. PAEs, often called \"patent trolls,\" seek to license patents ex post facto to fund infrastructure investment. They argue that collecting fees is necessary for bridge construction. Defendants often use technology covered by their patents after it has become standard in the industry. PAEs enforce patent rights but face controversy over the validity of their claims. Studies show PAEs have a low success rate in litigation. Studies suggest that PAEs have a low success rate in litigation, with just an 8% win rate on the merits compared to 40% for other entities. Despite this, they persist with litigation, supported by licensing fees. Contrary to popular belief, PAEs do not necessarily lose more due to weaker patents, as their patents are found to be on par with others in terms of quality and value. PAEs often struggle to show infringement, possibly due to overly broad interpretations of their patent claims. PAEs are described as critical intermediaries, offering \"department stores\" for patents. They enable inventors to earn returns on their patents and reduce transaction costs. However, they are criticized for speculating on patents and using \"trolling\" tactics. Other non-practicing entities are seen as more efficient in serving these functions. PAEs focus on high-risk high-yield acquisitions of patents and offer licenses only after infringement has begun. They transfer only a legal right not to be sued for using a technology, unlike other NPEs that transfer technologies. PAEs acquire patents outright and assert them on their own behalf, diverging from other NPEs that provide services and collect fees. PAEs have been accused of imposing a \"tax on innovation\" and undermining patent law incentives, but they are also defended for promoting invention by adding liquidity and getting more royalties for small inventors. However, the FTC and experts suggest that PAEs currently do more harm than good to innovation and the patent system. The extent of this imbalance and whether Congress should recalibrate it remains unclear. The FTC warns that investing in disputed technology can deter innovation by raising costs and risks for companies and investors. This can lead to lower profit margins, reduced returns on investment, and a shift away from funding R&D projects. Startups and small businesses may struggle to secure funding due to potential demands from PAEs. Investors are shifting towards investing in PAEs to hedge against the risk of being sued, as they offer better returns than startups. PAEs argue they promote investment in invention, with Intellectual Ventures CEO comparing their role to that of venture capital and private equity markets. The main benefit of PAE activity is increased liquidity. PAEs provide increased liquidity and risk management for investments in research and invention by creating a secondary market for patents. They help patentees, especially small inventors and NPEs, recoup costs by selling patents and retaining future royalties. Universities benefit directly from PAE activity by obtaining and selling patents in the secondary market. The FTC warns that while PAEs benefit inventors by increasing licensing fees, it may not necessarily lead to more innovation. PAEs could discourage firms from investing in the development process to bring inventions to market, as they may face lawsuits for investing in R&D. Additionally, the profits of firms utilizing patented technologies may be affected by the money PAEs pay out for patents in the secondary market. PAEs impose costs on defendants, with only a fraction going towards innovation. Studies show minimal benefits for small inventors and startups, as most losses do not reach them. PAEs mainly target small- and mid-sized businesses, leading to significant direct costs. The proliferation of PAEs is linked to the information explosion in recent years. The proliferation of PAEs in the past decade is attributed to the growth of the IT industry and challenges in patent law adaptation. PAEs focus on high-tech patents, especially in software and business methods, due to inadvertent infringement and bargaining power advantages. The high value of these patents, coupled with low acquisition costs, creates opportunities for arbitrage. The breakdown of the notice function in the IT sector has led to the rise of PAEs and patent litigation. In an optimal patent regime, clear and easily determined patent property rights enable people to avoid infringement and maximize efficiency. The success of the pharmaceutical patent system is attributed to manageable volumes of clearly defined claims, while the IT sector faces notice failure with claims having fuzzy boundaries that lead to uncertainty and litigation. The \"definiteness\" requirement in patent law aims to limit ambiguity in claim language to establish clear patent property rights. Critics argue that this provision has lacked enforcement since 2001, leading to uncertainty and litigation in the IT sector. The Federal Circuit replaced a test for patent claims, widening the zone of uncertainty. The boundaries of patent claims are clarified by accompanying disclosures, which should provide a detailed description of the invention. Critics argue that IT patents undergo less stringent review, allowing for more abstract patents. The Federal Circuit's replacement of a test for patent claims has widened the zone of uncertainty, allowing for more abstract patents in the IT sector. Critics argue that less stringent review of IT patents may lead to patents that exist only on paper, with patentees having less incentive to provide detailed disclosures. In the IT sector, it is often too late for manufacturers to clear patents incorporated in a product when the first notice is the filing of a lawsuit, giving leverage to PAEs. The IT sector is facing challenges with a \"patent thicket,\" where numerous overlapping patents make it difficult to commercialize new technology. The sheer number of patents and components in IT products create a complex landscape, leading to a risky and futile endeavor to review all relevant patents. The doctrine of willful infringement further complicates matters, criticized for creating disincentives for defendants. The doctrine of willful infringement has been criticized for creating disincentives for defendants by exposing them to enhanced damages for looking at patents they later infringe. Even with a thorough search, some patent claims remain hidden at the PTO, allowing firms to develop infringing products. Continuation practice is used to keep patents pending longer, and clearing the patent thicket does not prevent weak or baseless suits brought by PAEs. PAEs often settle their patent infringement assertions, with defendants facing high litigation costs and risks, leading to asymmetric bargaining power. Settlement is often the most cost-effective option for defendants, even if they believe they are not infringing. The AIA provisions aim to improve the speed and availability of post-grant examination to address this issue. The speed and availability of post-grant examination are expected to improve the challenge of invalid patents granted after 2011. Patent holdup issues arise when PAEs leverage injunction threats in royalty negotiations, capturing more value than their invention's worth. This problem is acute in the IT sector due to the numerous patented features in products. In 2006, the Supreme Court decision in eBay v. MercExchange addressed the patent holdup problem by allowing lower courts to deny injunctive relief to PAEs and only award monetary damages for infringement. This overturned the Federal Circuit's automatic injunction rule, leading to a four-factor balancing test that limits PAEs' ability to obtain injunctions. Concerns have been raised that PAEs are now turning to the International Trade Commission for exclusion orders to stop infringing products from entering the US, but data shows that only 8% of post-eBay ITC investigations involve complaints by PAEs. The data shows that only 8% of post-eBay ITC investigations involve complaints by PAEs, with just one obtaining an exclusion order. PAEs have an advantage in litigation as they do not risk disruption to their core business, unlike product firms who may face counterclaims of patent infringement. This dynamic gives PAEs much to gain by litigating aggressively. The plaintiff's products may infringe and counterclaim, leading to a dynamic of mutual assured destruction that evens bargaining power, increases settlement likelihood, and reduces the appeal of litigation. PAEs have incentives to pursue weak suits to strengthen their bargaining position, relying on the threat of costly litigation to extract licensing fees. They have less to lose if a patent is invalidated, as their revenue depends on credible litigation threats. The America Invents Act's joinder limitations may reduce the leverage of PAEs in extracting royalties from defendants. Section 19 restricts suing multiple defendants based solely on patent infringement allegations, increasing costs and validity assessments for PAEs. This could lead to a decrease in the number of defendants sued but an increase in the number of suits filed. The Saving High-Tech Innovators from Egregious Legal Disputes (SHIELD) Act of 2013 aims to hold Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs) accountable for paying court costs and attorney's fees if they lose an infringement case. This would reduce PAEs' leverage in demanding licensing fees, especially if they cannot follow through with suing all firms that refuse to buy a license. The SHIELD Act of 2013 targets Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs) by requiring full litigation costs to be awarded to the prevailing party if the party alleging infringement does not meet specific conditions. This aims to reduce PAEs' leverage in demanding licensing fees. The SHIELD Act of 2013 aims to hold Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs) accountable by requiring them to cover full litigation costs if they fail to meet specific conditions. This is to reduce the leverage of PAEs in demanding licensing fees. The SHIELD Act of 2013 aims to hold Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs) accountable by requiring them to cover full litigation costs if they fail to meet specific conditions. Critics question the definition of \"substantial investment\" in the exploitation of patents and raise concerns about potential loopholes for PAEs to avoid financial responsibility. The SHIELD Act of 2013 aims to hold Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs) accountable by requiring them to cover full litigation costs if they fail to meet specific conditions. Critics question how the bond requirement would work practically, including determining the \"full costs\" amount for each suit and who would provide the required bonds to NPEs. The SHIELD Act of 2013 aims to address Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs) in the IT sector by requiring them to provide bonds for litigation costs. Critics question how NPEs, who are typically asset-free, would provide the required collateral. Suggestions for legislative reforms focus on targeted changes in the patent system, particularly in the realm of IT patents related to software, the Internet, and electronics. International agreements may limit the precision of these reforms. The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) administered by the World Trade Organization requires patents to be available without discrimination in the field of technology. However, there is flexibility in interpreting this requirement, and differentiation for legitimate reasons is allowed. Congress should consider international obligations when making changes to the patent system. Improving notice for IT patents is a key goal for patent reform advocates. The complexity and volume of IT patents make it challenging for firms to avoid infringement. Clearing patents ahead of time is hindered by disincentives and obstacles. Scholars suggest using \u00a7112 rules to invalidate ambiguous IT patents, which could reduce negative effects of PAEs and improve the patent system. Congress may need to legislatively overrule Federal Circuit standards allowing ambiguity in IT patent claims. Reform proposals aim to reduce ambiguity by weeding out claims with multiple interpretations. Some suggest current doctrine is sufficient but not enforced properly. Reforms targeting continuation practice could prevent patent owners from hiding their invention's true nature. Some scholars propose eliminating the \"willfulness doctrine\" to improve notice and remove a tool Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs) use to raise defendants' costs and risk. Congress might consider legislation to delay pleading willfulness until infringement is found, preserving deterrent functions while enhancing notice. PAEs have shifted to threatening ITC exclusion orders on defendants' products as a bargaining tool, prompting calls for Congress to prevent such orders. This shift has reduced the leverage PAEs can exert through federal court injunctions. Other proposed changes could also reduce PAEs' bargaining power in litigation. Some scholars suggest eliminating the presumption of validity for patents to reduce costs for defendants and leverage for PAEs. Changing royalty calculation rules is another common suggestion to address disproportionate damages. Legislation has been considered in Congress, but nothing has been passed yet. Observers indicate that IT interests support changes in legislation to address patent issues, while pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and NPE or PAE interests oppose it. Congress could consider IT-specific royalty reforms, targeting practices like sitting on a patent until infringement occurs. One proposed idea is to decrease the patent period for IT patents, which are quickly outdated. A study by Brian J. Love suggests that a shorter term may primarily harm PAEs, as product companies enforce their patents soon after issuance. NPEs typically assert their patents late in the term, while product companies enforce theirs early. High-tech patents are often litigated in the final years, with NPEs accounting for the majority of suits. Love's study suggests that shortening the patent term may impact PAEs more than product companies. Shortening the patent term could involve changes to maintenance fees paid by patent holders to keep their rights in force. Fees may increase over time or with each renewal, targeting inactive patents, entities with large portfolios, or IT-related patents. Another option is cost-shifting in the latter half of the term, with repercussions for neglecting to use, develop, or license patents. Non-use for a set period could be considered abandonment, requiring proof of intent to use before pursuing infringement suits. Reforms to address patent non-use include requiring patent owners to provide evidence of efforts to develop, commercialize, or license the patent before proceeding with infringement suits. Options for addressing non-use range from cancellation to shifting costs onto PAEs, diminishing their leverage. Other proposed reforms include removing the presumption of validity, imposing heightened pleading requirements, or freezing the patent until it is used. Additionally, there is advocacy for requiring publication of patent assignment and license terms. The publication requirement for patent assignment and license terms aims to create a more efficient market for patents, allowing for transparency in pricing and reducing the ability of patent owners to exploit innovators. Lemley and Myhrvold suggest that mandatory disclosure of licenses would not deter patent holders from licensing their patents, stating that only those exploiting the current lack of transparency would lose out."
