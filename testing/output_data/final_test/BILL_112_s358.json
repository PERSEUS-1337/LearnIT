The Act, known as the \"Regulatory Responsibility for our Economy Act of 2011,\" defines key terms such as \"agency\" and \"regulation.\" The term \"agency\" refers to any U.S. authority, including independent regulatory agencies. \"Regulation\" is defined as an agency statement with the force of law, implementing policies or procedures. The term \"regulatory action\" refers to any substantive action by an agency that leads to the promulgation of a final regulation, excluding certain types of regulations. The term \"significant regulatory action\" refers to any regulatory action likely to result in a regulation with a significant impact on the economy, environment, public health, safety, or government operations. The term \"significant regulatory action\" refers to any action by an agency that could have a major impact on the economy, environment, public health, safety, or government operations. Such actions may affect entitlements, grants, user fees, loan programs, national debt, or raise new legal or policy issues. SEC. 3. AGENCY REQUIREMENTS. The Federal regulatory system aims to protect public health, welfare, safety, and the environment of the United States while promoting economic growth and innovation. It is based on the best available science, allows for public participation, promotes predictability, and considers both benefits and costs in a transparent manner. Each agency must propose or adopt regulations based on a cost-benefit analysis, minimize societal burdens, and choose approaches that maximize net benefits, including economic, environmental, and public health considerations. Regulations should be accessible, consistent, written clearly, and measurable for actual results. The regulations must consider potential economic, environmental, public health, and safety advantages, distributive impacts, and equity. They should specify performance objectives, assess alternatives to direct regulation, and use the best available techniques to quantify benefits and costs. SEC. 4. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. Regulations must involve public participation and be based on the open exchange of information among various stakeholders. Each agency must provide the public with an opportunity to participate in the regulatory process and comment on proposed regulations through the Internet for at least 60 days. Each agency must provide timely online access to the rulemaking docket on regulations.gov for proposed and final rules, including scientific and technical findings. Proposed rules should allow for public comment on all pertinent parts of the docket, including relevant scientific and technical findings, before issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking. The agency must delay implementation of an interim final rule until a court makes a final decision if the rule was exempted from notice and public procedure and is challenged in court. The delay will continue until the court reaches a final decision. SEC. 5. INTEGRATION AND INNOVATION. Congress acknowledges the need for greater coordination among agencies to reduce redundant regulatory requirements and promote innovation. Each agency is required to promote coordination, simplification, and harmonization in regulatory actions. SEC. 6. FLEXIBLE APPROACHES. SEC. 6. FLEXIBLE APPROACHES. Each agency must consider regulatory approaches that reduce burdens, maintain flexibility, and provide clear information to the public. SEC. 7. SCIENCE. Agencies must ensure the objectivity of scientific information used in regulatory actions. SEC. 8. RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSES OF EXISTING RULES. To promote periodic review of regulations, agencies should conduct retrospective analyses to identify outdated, ineffective, or burdensome rules and make necessary modifications. Agencies can collaborate with private organizations for these analyses every 5 years, with results published online. Each agency must develop a preliminary plan within 180 days of this Act's enactment to review significant regulatory actions every 5 years for potential modifications, streamlining, expansion, or repeal to enhance effectiveness and reduce burdens. Each agency must submit a report to congressional committees after reviewing significant regulatory actions, detailing any modifications, streamlining, expansions, or repeals made, along with reasons for these actions or inaction."
