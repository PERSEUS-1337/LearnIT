    "content": "Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act provides federal aid to local educational agencies for disadvantaged children in pre-kindergarten through grade 12. It is the largest federal education assistance program, serving over 90% of LEAs, 48% of public schools, and 33% of pupils, including those in private schools. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 extended and revised the ESEA. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLBA) extended and revised the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) by building upon Title I-A provisions from the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994. This act required states to adopt curriculum content and pupil performance standards, assessments linked to these standards, and identified low-performing schools and LEAs. It aimed to target funds on high-poverty LEAs and schools while increasing flexibility. ESEA programs are authorized through FY2008, with potential amendments and extensions expected in the future. The 110th Congress will consider legislation to amend and extend the ESEA, focusing on aspects substantially amended by the NCLBA. Major amendments included pupil assessment, AYP requirements, program improvement, allocation formulas, staff qualifications, flexibility, and services to private school pupils, staff, and parents. The 110th Congress will consider legislation to amend and extend the ESEA, focusing on pupil assessment, AYP requirements, program improvement, allocation formulas, staff qualifications, flexibility, and services to private school pupils, staff, and parents. Implementation issues and debates may arise as Congress considers a new High School Initiative. The IASA of 1994 required states to develop curriculum standards, pupil performance standards, and assessments linked to mathematics and reading/language arts. The 110th Congress will consider legislation to amend and extend the ESEA, focusing on pupil assessment, AYP requirements, program improvement, allocation formulas, staff qualifications, flexibility, and services to private school pupils, staff, and parents. The IASA of 1994 required states to develop curriculum standards, pupil performance standards, and assessments linked to mathematics and reading/language arts for Title I-A participants and all other pupils in the state. These standards aimed to raise expectations and align the program with standards-based reforms in most states. States had deadlines for adopting content and performance standards by the 1997-1998 program year and assessments by the 2000-2001 program year. States were given several years to meet requirements for curriculum standards, pupil performance standards, and assessments linked to Title I-A participants and all other pupils. The U.S. Department of Education reviewed evidence that state standards and assessments met these requirements, with 46 states approved. Some states received timeline waivers to develop necessary assessments. Compliance agreements were also established. The U.S. Department of Education negotiated compliance agreements with three states to meet assessment requirements. P.L. 107-110 expanded Title I-A assessment provisions, requiring assessments in reading, math, and science at various grade levels by specific school years. States must ensure assessments meet technical quality standards and participate in NAEP tests. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) tests are required for 4th and 8th-grade students in reading and math every two years, with costs covered by the federal government. There are conflicting rules on participation in NAEP tests by schools. Students in U.S. schools for at least three years must be tested in English, and states must assess the English proficiency of LEP students annually. The revised ESEA provides grants to states for meeting assessment requirements under Title I-A. The NCLBA authorizes state assessment grants for developing and improving assessments of English language proficiency for LEP pupils. Minimum annual amounts are appropriated for these grants, with additional funds available for enhanced assessment instruments. Competitive grants are also provided for activities to improve assessment quality, validity, and reliability beyond Title I-A requirements. For assessment development grants, excess funds are used for enhanced assessment grants. In FY2002, $17 million was allocated for this purpose. In FY2003, $4,484,000 was available for assessment enhancement grants, but no funds were available in FY2004. For FY2005, $11.68 million was allocated for assessment development grants, and $7.6 million for FY2006. The Department will contract an independent organization to study state assessments and accountability policies under Title I-A. Key issues include the cost of assessments and the sufficiency of federal grants to cover them. The Bush Administration has requested funding for a High School Initiative in conjunction with its FY2006 and FY2007 Budgets. Details of the proposal are not available yet, and the impact of requiring state participation in NAEP on NAEP, state standards, and assessments is being questioned. The major benefits and costs of expanded ESEA Title I-A pupil assessment requirements are also being considered, along with the impact on educational achievement and curriculum focus. The High School Initiative (HSI) proposed by the Bush Administration for FY2007 includes multifaceted aspects such as assessment requirements for states participating in ESEA Title I-A and targeted initiatives to improve low-performing high schools. A total of $1.475 billion has been requested for this Initiative. States receiving Title I-A grants would need to administer state-developed assessments in reading and mathematics in two additional high school grades by the 2009-2010 school year. Additional grants would be available to states. The Administration has requested additional funding for NAEP for FY2007 to develop new 12th-grade assessments. Unanswered questions include whether high school exit tests will be included, if states can use different tests for different academic programs, and if Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate tests can meet assessment requirements. States and LEAs participating in the revised ESEA Title I-A must report assessment results and other data through \"report cards.\" These report cards must include academic performance data disaggregated by race, ethnicity, gender, disability, migrant status, English proficiency, and economic disadvantage. Additionally, they must show progress towards meeting educational indicators and graduation rates, as well as identify schools failing to meet AYP standards. The report cards for schools must include graduation rates, schools failing to meet AYP standards, teacher qualifications, and additional information like class size and school violence. These report cards are to be shared with parents and the public. Many states have not fully complied with these requirements, and there is uncertainty about the extent of changes they will bring compared to previous practices. Most state report cards do not meet all NCLBA requirements, raising concerns about their usefulness to parents. The NCLBA expands Title I-A standards for AYP, aiming to identify and address underperforming schools through various corrective actions. These provisions were a response to perceived flaws in the 1994 IASA requirements. The NCLBA focuses on specific disadvantaged pupil groups, requires continuous improvement towards a goal, and applies to Title I-A schools and LEAs. Before the NCLBA, states had varying impacts of their AYP standards, with some identifying many schools needing improvement while others had few. AYP is based on aggregate scores on state assessments, with additional academic indicators required under the NCLBA. The NCLBA requires AYP standards to be applied to specific disadvantaged pupil groups, including economically disadvantaged pupils, LEP pupils, pupils with disabilities, and major racial and ethnic groups. State AYP standards must also be applied to all public schools, LEAs, and states overall, with corrective actions for failing to meet AYP standards applied to Title I-A schools and LEAs. The goal is for all pupils to reach a proficient or advanced level of achievement within 12 years. The NCLBA requires AYP standards to be applied to specific disadvantaged pupil groups, with a \"uniform bar\" approach for setting threshold levels of achievement in reading and math. An alternative safe harbor provision allows schools to meet AYP if they show a 10% reduction in the achievement gap for specific pupil groups. The NCLBA requires AYP standards for disadvantaged pupil groups to meet a \"uniform bar\" in reading and math. An alternative provision allows schools to show progress on academic indicators for specific pupil groups. A third AYP model is the individual/cohort growth model, focusing on pupils' achievement over time. Growth models track pupils' progress individually but aggregate results for accountability. Growth models credit steps towards proficiency, unlike status models. The Secretary of Education announced a growth model pilot program in November 2005, allowing states to use growth models for AYP determinations. Two states, North Carolina and Tennessee, have been approved to participate in the pilot program. Schools must have at least 95% participation in assessments to meet AYP standards. The data available on schools and LEAs failing to meet AYP standards for 2002-2005 is incomplete and subject to change due to data corrections and appeals. Reports focus on schools failing AYP for multiple years and those identified for school improvement. The data on schools failing to meet AYP standards for 2002-2005 shows wide variation among states, with percentages ranging from 2% to 66%. On average, 26% of public schools failed to meet AYP standards. Based on data from 2002-2005, there was wide variation in the percentage of public schools failing to make AYP standards, ranging from 2% to 66%. In 2004-2005, 25.6% of all public schools failed to meet AYP standards, with changes in the percentage of failing schools compared to the previous years. In February 2006, 12.9% of public schools, totaling 11,524 schools, were identified as needing improvement based on assessment results from 2004-2005. This included schools failing to meet AYP standards for consecutive years, with 13% of all public schools identified for improvement through 2004-2005. Based on assessment results from 2004-2005, 18% of Title I-A schools were identified as needing improvement, with large urban LEAs and schools with high poverty rates most likely to be identified. A survey found that on average, 14% of public schools were identified as needing improvement, with wide variations among states. State differences in school identification may be influenced by underlying achievement levels. Improvement in schools is influenced by differences in achievement levels, rigor of state performance standards, and minimum size of demographic groups for AYP determinations. Low participation rates in assessments also contribute to schools failing to meet AYP. About 8,600 schools have not met AYP even before NCLBA. Approximately 8,600 schools have failed to meet AYP even before NCLBA. Concerns have been raised about the high number of schools labeled as \"failing\" and the strain on resources for corrective actions. Random test score variations and diverse student enrollments are factors that could lead to more schools failing to meet AYP standards. ED officials have addressed these concerns. The ED officials have emphasized the importance of identifying and improving underperforming schools, regardless of the number. They have also highlighted flexibility in taking corrective actions for schools that fail to meet AYP standards. Regulations and policy guidance have been issued to provide flexibility and reduce the number of schools failing to make AYP. On March 29, 2004, it was announced that schools could meet the requirement of 95% pupil participation in assessments. The new guidance allows schools to meet the 95% pupil participation requirement based on average rates over the last few years. It also permits exclusion of students with significant medical emergencies from participation rate calculations and emphasizes make-up tests for missed assessments. States have the authority to determine the minimum size of demographic groups for AYP determinations. The new guidance allows schools to meet the 95% pupil participation requirement based on average rates over the last few years. States have the authority to determine the minimum size of demographic groups for AYP determinations, including participation rates. In some states, up to 20% of schools failing to make AYP did so based on assessment participation rates alone. Two new policies were announced regarding LEP pupils, requiring participation in English language proficiency and math tests for those attending schools in the US for less than 10 months. Optional participation in reading tests and inclusion of test scores in AYP calculations for first-year LEP pupils. In AYP determinations, schools and LEAs have the option to exclude first-year LEP pupils' scores but must still consider their test participation. Formerly LEP pupils can be included in the LEP demographic category for up to two years after proficiency, but not for meeting the state's minimum size threshold. This may improve average test scores for LEP pupils and reduce AYP failures based on LEP groups. LEAs may adopt alternate assessments for pupils with significant cognitive disabilities, limited to 1.0% of all tested pupils, to meet AYP standards. Regulations clarify the application of standards and assessments for these pupils. SEAs may request exceptions to exceed the 1.0% cap on alternate assessments for pupils with disabilities at the state and LEA level. Waivers were granted to several states in 2003-2005 to go slightly above the limit. A new ED policy affecting more pupils with disabilities was announced in April 2005. The new policy announced in April 2005 focuses on pupils with \"persistent academic disabilities\" and is divided into short-term and long-term phases. It allows schools to add a certain percentage of pupils with disabilities to their proficient group for assessments based on modified achievement standards. The new policy announced in April 2005 allows schools to include 2.0% of pupils with disabilities in the proficient group for assessments based on modified achievement standards. This policy applies to schools and LEAs that would otherwise fail to meet AYP standards solely due to pupils with disabilities. 31 states have been authorized to implement this short-term flexibility. Eligible states with modified achievement standards can also count proficient scores for pupils with disabilities, capped at 2.0% at the LEA and state levels. The new policy announced in April 2005 allows schools to include 2.0% of pupils with disabilities in the proficient group for assessments based on modified achievement standards. This policy applies to schools and LEAs that would otherwise fail to meet AYP standards solely due to pupils with disabilities. On December 15, 2005, ED published proposed regulations embodying the longer-term policy for pupils with disabilities, affecting standards, assessments, and AYP for a group of pupils with disabilities unlikely to achieve grade-level proficiency within the current school year. States can develop \"modified achievement standards\" and alternate assessments for pupils with disabilities, aligned with grade-level content but with reduced breadth or depth. These standards must provide access to grade-level curricula without hindering students from earning a regular diploma. There is no direct limit on the number of students taking alternate assessments, but proficient or advanced scores on these assessments can only be counted within certain limits for AYP determinations. Based on modified achievement standards, scores exceeding 2.0% of all pupils tested at the state or LEA level would be considered \"non-proficient.\" The 2.0% cap does not apply to individual schools, and states could exceed this cap only if they did not reach the 1.0% limit for pupils with the most significant cognitive disabilities. Proficient or above scores on alternate assessments based on modified standards cannot exceed 3.0% of all pupils tested. States are no longer allowed to request a waiver of the 1.0% cap for pupils with significant cognitive disabilities. The proposed regulations aim to standardize AYP determinations by prohibiting varying minimum group sizes for different pupil groups, allowing the use of the highest test score for pupils who take tests multiple times, and including former pupils with disabilities' scores in the disability subgroup for up to two years. Eligible states and LEAs can count these scores as \"proficient or above\" in AYP determinations. Following the proposed regulations, states and LEAs can include proficient or higher scores of up to 1.0% of tested pupils on alternate assessments based on alternate achievement standards, and up to an additional 2.0% on assessments based on modified achievement standards in AYP determinations. There is no limit for individual schools on the percentage of pupils in these categories, and no limit on the number or percentage of pupils who can take alternate assessments. Additionally, officials of states and LEAs affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita have shown interest in waiving some NCLBA assessment and accountability requirements due to the damage caused by the storms. The Secretary of Education has announced policy revisions and potential waivers for schools affected by natural disasters, allowing flexibility in implementing improvement designations and corrective actions. Waivers may be granted for heavily impacted LEAs or schools with large numbers of evacuee pupils. Additionally, states and LEAs can include proficient scores of up to 1.0% on alternate assessments and up to 2.0% on modified assessments in AYP determinations. Officials are considering waiving NCLBA assessment and accountability requirements for areas affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The Secretary of Education has announced policy revisions and potential waivers for schools affected by natural disasters, allowing flexibility in implementing improvement designations and corrective actions. Waivers may be granted for heavily impacted LEAs or schools with large numbers of evacuee pupils. All affected LEAs and schools could establish a separate subgroup for displaced students in AYP determinations based on assessments administered during the 2005-2006 school year. Pupils would appear only in the evacuee subgroup, not in other demographic subgroups. Waivers could be requested in 2006 to allow schools or LEAs to meet AYP requirements if only the test scores of the evacuee subgroup would prevent them from making AYP. According to recent reports, 23.7% of LEAs failed to meet AYP standards for the 2004-2005 school year. Of these, 12.4% were identified for improvement due to consecutive failures. Additionally, an estimated 20% of LEAs failed to meet AYP standards for the 2004-2005 and preceding school years. The odds of failing to meet AYP standards were higher for urban LEAs (50%) compared to rural (11%) and suburban (26%) LEAs. Limited analyses have been conducted on the consistency of state accountability plans with statutory requirements. Some analysts suggest that ED is allowing increased flexibility in approving state plans, which closely mirror statutory provisions. Special attention is given to the pace of proficiency improvement in state AYP plans. The evolving issues in AYP standards include the pace of improvement, criteria for identifying schools in need of improvement, length of time for identifying LEP pupils, minimum size of pupil groups for AYP determinations, giving credit for score improvements, and the use of statistical techniques like confidence intervals. Some states may lower standards to meet AYP goals, redefining \"proficient\" performance levels to reduce failing schools and increase pupil achievement percentages. Some states have faced public criticism for potentially lowering standards to hide low school performance, prompting the Secretary of Education to express concern about reducing proficiency standards. This could hinder progress and equal opportunity as required by the NCLBA. The NCLBA requires states and LEAs to identify schools that fail to meet AYP standards for consecutive years and take corrective actions. Title I-A schools failing AYP for two years must be labeled as needing improvement, affecting a large majority of LEAs and 58% of public schools. The NCLBA mandates identifying schools not meeting AYP standards for consecutive years and implementing corrective actions. Schools labeled as needing improvement must receive technical assistance based on research, funded through reserved grants and additional funds. Parents must be informed, and schools must allocate 10% of Title I-A grants for staff development. Students in schools failing AYP for two years can choose other public options. Public school choice options must be provided to students in schools not meeting AYP standards for two consecutive years. Transportation must be offered, and students can remain in the chosen school until completing the highest grade. LEAs may establish agreements with other LEAs for expanded options if all schools in the district need improvement. States must identify and provide approved providers of supplemental instructional services for Title I-A schools that fail to meet AYP standards for three consecutive years. These services can include public or private schools, LEAs, commercial firms, or other organizations. The cost per child for supplemental services is capped at the LEA's Title I-A grant per child, with funds for transportation being up to 20% of Title I-A funds. LEAs must allocate up to 20% of their Title I-A funds for transporting students who choose public school options and for supplemental services. They can also use funds from Innovative Programs or state reserves to cover additional costs. If there are not enough funds, services may be limited to the lowest-achieving students. The requirement for supplemental services can be waived if no approved providers are available. Title I-A schools failing to meet AYP standards for a fourth year must take corrective actions such as replacing staff or implementing a new curriculum. If AYP standards are not met for a fifth year, restructuring must occur, which may include alternative governance actions like reopening as a charter school. State and/or LEA discretion determines which specific actions are taken. The Education Commission of the States (ECS) report in 2005 found that states vary in their involvement in school restructuring processes, with most opting for mild to moderate actions like changing curriculum or management structure rather than strong measures like closing or converting to a charter school. Political challenges have arisen in cases where restructuring is necessary. States vary in their involvement in school restructuring processes, with most opting for mild to moderate actions like changing curriculum or management structure rather than strong measures like closing or converting to a charter school. Political challenges have arisen in cases where stronger forms of restructuring have been applied, and some options could not be implemented due to state law restrictions. LEAs that fail to meet AYP standards may face corrective actions based on Title I-A schools. Title I-A grants require LEAs failing to meet state AYP standards for consecutive years to receive technical assistance and corrective actions from the state educational agency. Corrective actions may include reducing funds, implementing new curriculum, replacing staff, or allowing students to transfer to higher-performing schools. The No Child Left Behind Act requires states to establish a peer review process to evaluate if they have met their AYP goals. States failing to meet their goals must provide technical assistance and implement corrective actions, such as allowing students to transfer to higher-performing schools. Performance bonuses and sanctions for states were not included in the final version of the law. Numerous schools and a smaller number of LEAs have consistently failed to meet state AYP standards since the 1995-1996 school year. Previous corrective actions were limited due to less specific provisions in the 1994 ESEA. The 2000-2001 school year saw the adoption of final standards and assessments meeting the requirements of the 1994 IASA, a first for any state. Exceptions were made for public school choice options for certain Title I-A schools not meeting AYP standards. Schools and LEAs have faced challenges with varying AYP standards, but can be removed from improvement status by meeting state AYP standards for two consecutive years. Data on school choice and supplemental services usage in most states during the 2003-2004 school year were recently published. Data on school choice and supplemental services in most states during the 2003-2004 school year were recently published by Education Week. The data show low utilization rates for both options, with only 11.3% of eligible pupils receiving supplemental services and 1.0% taking advantage of school choice. Individual state rates varied, with Utah having the highest rate at 49.1%. Only 1.0% of eligible pupils utilized school choice options under the NCLBA, with rates ranging from zero to 94.4% across states. Low participation rates may be due to various factors such as delayed implementation, lack of parental interest, and limited availability of alternative schools or services. Concerns have been raised about the potential identification of a large number of public schools for corrective actions under Title I-A. The ambitious goal of having all pupils proficient or advanced by 2013-2014 may limit states and LEAs in providing necessary resources for corrective actions. This goal could lead to schools failing to meet AYP, lower performance standards, or strategies to limit school identification for improvement. However, it may also stimulate improvements in public education quality and equity. The NCLBA aims to improve public education quality and equity by offering school choice options and supplemental services to eligible families. Questions arise about the availability and effectiveness of these services, as well as the willingness of entities to provide them within the funding constraints. Additionally, concerns exist about the implementation of corrective actions and restructuring for schools that fail to meet state AYP standards. ESEA Title I-A has four separate formulas for allocating funds to states and LEAs, which are then combined and used for the same program purposes. The rationale for using different formulas is to provide varying shares of funds to different localities based on distinct allocation patterns. Some formulas have important incentive effects or symbolic significance. The ESEA Title I-A allocation formulas have common elements, including a population factor for children aged 5-17 in poor families, neglected or delinquent institutions, and foster homes. These factors impact allocation patterns and have symbolic significance. The ESEA Title I-A allocation formulas include a population factor for children in poor families, neglected or delinquent institutions, and foster homes. This factor is multiplied by an expenditure factor based on state average expenditures per pupil, with special provisions for Puerto Rico. High-spending states receive up to 50% more per child than low-spending states, reflecting differences in the cost of providing public education. The ESEA Title I-A allocation formulas include a spending index that reflects ability and willingness to spend on public education, with hold-harmless provisions and minimum eligibility thresholds for LEAs to receive grants. Each formula has a state minimum grant level and a minimum annual grant level for LEAs. The Title I-A formulas have unique features such as assigning weights based on each LEA's poverty rate and number of poor school-age children, resulting in higher grants per child in areas with higher poverty rates. The Title I-A formulas assign weights based on poverty rates and numbers of poor children in LEAs, with higher weights for areas with higher poverty rates. The EFIG formula includes unique factors like an equity factor and an effort factor, in addition to population and expenditure factors. The equity factor measures the disparity in expenditures per pupil among LEAs in a state. The coefficient of variation (CV) is used to measure expenditure disparities among LEAs in a state, with a lower CV indicating lower disparities and a higher multiplier. The effort factor compares state expenditures per pupil for education with state personal income per capita, resulting in an index number above 1.0 for states spending more than the national average and below 1.0 for states spending less. Narrow bounds of 0.95 and 1.05 are placed on the index number. The EFIG formula for state grants limits the multiplier effect with narrow bounds. It differs from other formulas by using unique factors and being a two-stage process. Maximum grants are calculated based on population and expenditure factors, with adjustments for equity and effort factors. Grants are then allocated to LEAs based on a weighted population factor, subject to funding availability and minimum grant provisions. The NCLBA made changes to Title I-A formulas, including Basic, Concentration, Targeted, and EFIG grants. FY2002 appropriations funded all formulas, not just Basic and Concentration as in previous years. The EFIG formula underwent major revisions, retaining a two-stage structure. The NCLBA made changes to the EFIG formula, introducing a new substate allocation formula based on the Targeted Grant formula with varying degrees of targeting. The allocation within states depends on each state's equity factor, with disparities in expenditures per pupil influencing the degree of targeting. The NCLBA made changes to the EFIG formula, introducing a new substate allocation formula based on the Targeted Grant formula with varying degrees of targeting. The allocation within states depends on each state's equity factor, with disparities in expenditures per pupil influencing the degree of targeting. Additionally, changes were made to the population factor in the allocation of funds to states, resulting in a pattern of allocations that is more similar to other formulas. A variant of the state expenditure factor used in other Part A formulas was also added to the EFIG formula. The EFIG formula under the NCLBA had changes to the expenditure factor, with narrowed floor and ceiling bounds. The equity and effort factors for EFIG grants remained mostly unchanged. States with different equity factors will use variations of the Targeted Grant formula for fund allocation. The Targeted Grant formula will apply in most states with an equity factor between 0.10 and 0.20, with the highest degree of targeting in states with an equity factor of 0.20 or above. Puerto Rico's share of funds will increase due to NCLBA amendments, gradually eliminating a provision that reduced their expenditure factor below the minimum for other states. The NCLBA gradually increases the minimum expenditure factor for Puerto Rico to match that of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Additionally, the cap on the population factor for Puerto Rico under the Targeted Grant formula is marginally raised. The NCLBA gradually increases the minimum expenditure factor for Puerto Rico to match that of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The cap on the population factor for Puerto Rico under the Targeted Grant formula is marginally raised, resulting in a substantial rise in Title I-A grants to Puerto Rico in recent years. The NCLBA applies a hold-harmless rate of 85%-95% of previous year grants to allocation formulas, with increased state minimum grants. Hold-harmless provision applies to Concentration Grants for all LEAs that received grants in the preceding year. State minimum grants are increased from up to 0.25% to up to 0.35% above the FY2001 level. The Census Bureau began publishing annual updates of population data on school-age children in poor families in November 2003. The NCLBA revised thresholds for applying weights to poor children in different poverty rate ranges. The primary issue with Title I-A allocation formulas is the targeting of funds on high-poverty LEAs, with over 90% of LEAs receiving grants under ESEA Title I-A. Some LEAs are eligible for Title I-A grants but choose not to participate due to perceived administrative burdens outweighing grant value. Table 1 shows grant distribution among LEAs based on poverty rates. The distribution of Title I-A funds among LEAs varies significantly based on poverty rate ranges, with Basic Grants and Concentration Grants showing relatively constant shares for eligible LEAs. The lowest-poverty quintile receives a much lower share of Concentration Grants due to eligibility thresholds. The distribution of Title I-A funds among LEAs varies based on poverty rate ranges, with constant shares for eligible LEAs. Grants per child are similar for all LEAs meeting initial eligibility criteria, but differ under Targeted and EFIG formulas. Grants increase steadily from lowest to second-highest poverty quintile, then decline somewhat. Grant per formula child continuously increases under Targeted and EFIG formulas. The FY2002 appropriations legislation for ED, P.L. 107-116, provided $10.35 billion for Title I-A, with initial funding for the Targeted Grant and EFIG formulas. The distribution of funds among LEAs is influenced by the school-age child poverty rate and total number of children counted in the formulas. The share of funds going to LEAs in the 4th quintile is slightly higher than those in the 5th quintile due to the strong influence of high numbers of formula children and the expenditure factor. For FY2003, the Bush Administration requested $11.35 billion for Title I-A grants to LEAs, with an increase of $1.0 billion (9.7%). The final appropriations legislation provided $11,684,311,000 for Title I-A, with increases split between Targeted and EFIG formulas. FY2003 appropriations were affected by across-the-board reductions. The Administration requested $12.35 billion for Title I-A in FY2004, a 5.7% increase from FY2003. The proposed allocation favored Targeted Grants over EFIG grants, leading to a significant reduction in EFIG funding. Different versions of the FY2004 L-HHS-ED Appropriations bills were passed by the House and Senate, with the primary difference being the distribution of funds between Targeted and EFIG formulas. Both versions of the bill allocated $12.35 billion for ESEA Title I-A, mirroring the Administration's request. The House and Senate bills for FY2004 L-HHS-ED Appropriations differed in how they allocated funds between Targeted and EFIG formulas. The Senate bill would have prohibited ED from updating population data for FY2004 grants, requiring the use of data as of July 1, 2003. The Census Bureau shifted to annual updates for estimated school-age children in poor families in LEAs starting in 2000. The Senate bill for FY2004 L-HHS-ED Appropriations would have prevented the use of updated population data for allocating funds, but the final legislation allowed for a transition to annually updated population estimates starting in FY2004. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 provided funding for Title I-A programs, with Basic Grants slightly below FY2003 levels and Concentration Grants remaining the same. Targeted and EFIG grants received equal funding under the final legislation. In FY2005, the Administration proposed a $1 billion increase for ESEA Title I-A, with funds allocated as Targeted Grants and a cut in funds for the EFIG formula. The House passed a bill with an aggregate FY2005 appropriation for Title I-A matching the Administration's request, with equal amounts allocated as Targeted and EFIG grants. In contrast to the Administration's proposal, equal amounts would be allocated as Targeted and EFIG grants under S. 2810 for FY2005 appropriations for ED. The total funding for Title I-A grants to LEAs would be $13,557,607,000, $215,298,000 above both the Administration request and the House amount. Approximately one-third of this difference consists of funds that would be used during the 2004-2005 school year. These funds would be allocated to 10 states that currently are receiving less for FY2004 than they received for FY2003 under Title I-A overall. The Senate bill for FY2005 appropriations for ED allocated more funds under the EFIG formula than the Targeted Grant formula, in contrast to the House bill and Administration request. The difference in aggregate funding between the Senate bill and the House/Administration request was $43,741,000 (0.3%). The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005, signed into law as P.L. 108-447 on December 8, 2004, provided $12,739,571,000 for Title I-A for FY2005, representing a 3.2% increase over FY2004. The Senate bill's provisions for additional funds and school improvement grants were not included in the final version. Equal amounts were allocated for Targeted and EFIG Grants, while Concentration Grants remained at the FY2004 level and Basic Grants were reduced for FY2005. The FY2005 budget for Title I-A was reduced from $7,037,592,000 to $6,934,854,000. The FY2006 budget request remained the same as FY2005, with an increase in Targeted Grants. The House passed H.R. 3010 for FY2006 appropriations for ED and related agencies. The FY2006 appropriation for ESEA Title I-A under H.R. 3010 would have been $12,839,571,000, an increase of $100 million over the FY2005 level. The increase would be devoted to Targeted and EFIG Grants, with each rising by $50 million. However, separate appropriations legislation resulted in a 1% reduction in most FY2006 appropriations, leading to a total for Title I-A of $12,713,125,290, slightly below the FY2005 level. The FY2006 appropriation for ESEA Title I-A increased by $100 million over the FY2005 level, with funds allocated to Targeted and EFIG Grants. However, a 1% reduction in most FY2006 appropriations resulted in a total of $12,713,125,290 for Title I-A, slightly below the FY2005 level. For FY2007, the Administration requested $12,913,125,000 for Title I-A, with additional funding for school improvement grants. The House and Senate bills also proposed similar funding levels, with slight variations in the allocation for school improvement grants. The Senate bill proposes $100 million for school improvement grants and suggests eliminating a prohibition on reducing an LEA's funding below the previous year's amount when applying a 4% reduction. Some states struggle to reserve the full 4% due to stagnant funding levels, leading to potential cuts in grants for some LEAs. Title I-A funding levels for FY2006-FY2007 are slightly lower than previous years. The FY2006 Title I-A grants were lower for many states and LEAs compared to FY2005 due to various factors such as changes in poverty estimates and increased deductions for program improvement activities. Approximately 58% of LEAs received smaller grants in FY2005 than in FY2004, and this trend continued into FY2006. In FY2006, 25 states received higher Title I-A grants, while 58% of LEAs received smaller grants, 35% received higher grants, and 8% received the same amount as the previous year. States and LEAs with lower grants in FY2006 had reductions in the number of school-age children in poor families. This contrasts with the FY2002-FY2006 period when most large and high poverty LEAs saw grant increases. The NCLBA authorizes specific amounts for each year, starting at $13.5 billion for FY2002 and increasing to $25 billion for FY2007. It establishes new requirements for teacher qualifications in Title I-A, including expanded requirements for teacher aides paid with Title I-A funds. LEAs are required to use between 5% and 10% of their Title I-A grants for instructional staff in FY2002-FY2003. The NCLBA requires LEAs to allocate a portion of their Title I-A grants for professional development activities, with specific percentages for schools failing to meet AYP standards. It also mandates that teachers hired with Title I-A funds be \"highly qualified\" and sets deadlines for all public school teachers to meet this qualification. The NCLBA mandates that teachers funded by Title I-A grants must be \"highly qualified\" by the 2005-2006 deadline, with a possible extension to 2006-2007 for some states based on evidence of effort towards compliance. Criteria for teacher qualification include consistency with regulations, reporting requirements, data quality, and equitable distribution in high vs low poverty schools. The criteria for teachers to be considered \"highly qualified\" are outlined in Title IX, Part A of the ESEA, as amended by the NCLBA. This includes holding a bachelor's degree, obtaining state certification, and having a license to teach. Teachers in public charter schools must meet state charter school law requirements. Alternate certification programs meeting specific criteria also qualify teachers as \"highly qualified.\" Teachers in alternate certification programs meeting specific requirements can be deemed \"highly qualified\" by demonstrating subject area knowledge and teaching skills through state tests or academic qualifications. Existing public school teachers can also meet this criteria by showing competence in all subjects based on state evaluation standards. Paraprofessionals, funded by Title I-A grants, provide instructional and non-instructional services in high-poverty LEAs and schools. Some concerns exist regarding their lack of educational credentials and supervision. The NCLBA established requirements for paraprofessionals funded by Title I-A grants, including the need for higher education or an associate's degree. These requirements apply to all newly hired paraprofessionals after January 8, 2002, and will be enforced for all staff by the end of the 2005-2006 school year. Paraprofessionals funded by Title I-A grants must have at least two years of higher education, an associate's degree, or meet a rigorous standard of quality set by their LEA. They must demonstrate knowledge in reading, writing, and math through a formal assessment. All paraprofessionals in Title I-A programs need a high school diploma or equivalent, except those engaged in translation or parental involvement activities. Decisions on paraprofessional qualifications, including assessment options and passing scores, are left to state and LEA discretion. States are making progress in meeting NCLBA requirements, with some exceeding them. 12 states have stricter requirements, and five states apply them to all paraprofessionals. Under the NCLBA, some states have extended certification requirements to all paraprofessionals, not just those in Title I-A programs. States use various tests to assess paraprofessional qualifications, with potential funding sources available to help cover education costs for meeting Title I-A requirements. Under the NCLBA, paraprofessionals in Title I-A programs may qualify for federal grants and loans to cover education costs. Baseline data from 2002-2003 showed that around 40% of paraprofessionals met qualification requirements, with percentages varying by state. The qualification percentages for paraprofessionals in Title I-A programs ranged from 4.5% to 99.0% across individual states. A survey of AFT-member paraprofessionals found that 54% met NCLBA qualification requirements based on educational levels alone. However, this survey may not be representative of all Title I-A paraprofessionals. Education Week also published state data on paraprofessional qualifications during the 2003-2004 school year, covering 42 states and the District of Columbia. In the 2003-2004 school year, the percentage of paraprofessionals in Title I programs meeting NCLBA qualification requirements varied from 27% in Massachusetts to 99% in Iowa. Paraprofessionals paid with Title I-A funds can be assigned various responsibilities outlined in the NCLBA, including tutoring, classroom assistance, parental involvement, and instruction under teacher supervision. Concerns exist about high-poverty schools meeting teacher qualification requirements and attracting highly qualified staff. The NCLBA provisions regarding paraprofessional qualifications are ambiguous and their impact will depend on how states and LEAs interpret and implement them. Possible effects include changes in certification procedures for paraprofessionals and a reduction in the use of Title I-A funds to hire aides. Another significant change in Title I-A since 1994 has been the growth of schoolwide programs. The growth of schoolwide programs in Title I-A since 1994 has increased significantly, with approximately 45% of schools and 60% of funds being allocated to these programs. The eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs has decreased to 40% low-income pupils, allowing for the use of funds from various federal aid programs if certain requirements are met. This change aims to provide assistance to all disadvantaged students in high-poverty schools, rather than just the lowest-achieving pupils, to improve overall school services. The NCLBA has reduced the eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs in high-poverty schools, which may raise questions about the impact on schools just meeting the new threshold. There is limited evidence on the achievement effects of this expansion. LEAs can transfer grants among different programs, with limitations for those failing to meet state AYP requirements under Title I-A. Under Title I-A, LEAs can transfer 30% of their grants to address AYP standards. States can consolidate funds for various ESEA programs under State Flex, impacting selected LEAs with high child poverty rates. Under Title I-A, LEAs can transfer funds to address AYP standards. States can consolidate funds under State Flex, impacting selected LEAs with high child poverty rates. Up to 80 additional LEAs may be eligible for the local flexibility authority (Local Flex), allowing funds to be used for any ESEA program. One state has qualified for State Flex authority (Florida) and one LEA has qualified for Local Flex authority (Seattle, WA) under NCLBA. The NCLBA makes changes to Title I-A provisions for services to private school pupils, families, and staff. It requires timely services, expands consultation requirements, and includes methods for LEAs to determine the share of pupils from low-income families attending private schools. Title I-A of the NCLBA includes provisions for LEAs to determine the share of low-income private school pupils for Title I-A grants. LEAs can use the same measure of low income as public schools, conduct surveys, apply the percentage of low-income public school pupils to private school pupils, or use a different measure adjusted proportionally. These provisions align with policy guidance. The NCLBA includes provisions for LEAs to determine the share of low-income private school pupils for Title I-A grants, aligning with policy guidance. The authorization for grants to pay \"capital expenses\" for Title I-A services to private school pupils was moved to the Fund for Improvement of Education. Debate has arisen over the federal role in K-12 education and the costs and benefits of participating in Title I-A and other ESEA programs. Some states have considered bills to address these issues. Some states are taking legislative actions to limit or terminate participation in ESEA Title I-A to avoid certain requirements. This includes resolutions, requests for exemptions, and bills to prevent state funds from being used for NCLBA implementation costs. A national association has filed a court suit for relief from Title I-A requirements that would require non-federal funds. Some states are passing legislation to limit or end participation in ESEA Title I-A to avoid certain requirements. This includes bills prioritizing state accountability over federal requirements and discouraging the use of non-federal funds for Title I-A. Utah passed a bill in 2005 requiring schools to prioritize state goals and minimize state resources used for federal programs. Some states are passing legislation to limit or end participation in federal programs beyond the provided funding. The practical implications of this state legislation, along with legal actions by the National Education Association and potential suits by state attorney generals, focus on the provisions of ESEA Section 9527(a) regarding federal control over curriculum and funding allocation. The NEA and Connecticut are seeking relief from Title I-A requirements that would require state and local funds. Connecticut specifically wants a waiver for standards-based assessments in certain grades. States can opt out of Title I-A, but would lose significant funding. States and LEAs may choose to opt out of Title I-A program to avoid implementing certain requirements, but they would still be subject to assessment, AYP, and report card obligations. Opting out would release them from corrective action requirements. If an LEA opts out of the Title I-A program, they would be released from corrective action requirements, potentially losing funds from various ESEA programs based on Title I-A allocations."
