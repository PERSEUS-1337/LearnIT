The \"Sportsmanship in Hunting Act of 2008\" includes findings that highlight the ethical concerns of fair chase in hunting, the issue of commercial canned hunt operations where exotic animals are shot in fenced enclosures, and the potential spread of disease due to the transportation of captive exotic animals. The \"Sportsmanship in Hunting Act of 2008\" addresses ethical concerns regarding fair chase in hunting and the issue of commercial canned hunt operations where animals are shot in fenced enclosures. The Act does not limit licensed hunting of native mammals or birds, nor does it criticize hunters who pursue animals outside of fenced areas. It also does not prohibit slaughterhouse activities or routine euthanasia of farm animals. SEC. 3. TRANSPORT OR POSSESSION OF EXOTIC ANIMALS FOR PURPOSES OF KILLING OR INJURING THEM. Sec. 50 of Chapter 3 of title 18, United States Code, prohibits the transfer, transport, or possession of confined exotic animals for entertainment or trophy collection purposes in interstate or foreign commerce. Violators may face fines, imprisonment, or both. Exceptions apply for killing or injuring exotic animals in natural reserves for habitat restoration. The law prohibits the captivity of non-native species in the US, defining captivity as confinement for the majority of the animal's life or at least 1 year. Enforcement is authorized by the Secretary of the Interior through the US Fish and Wildlife Service Director. The law allows the US Fish and Wildlife Service to arrest violators without a warrant, execute warrants issued by a court, and seize animals taken illegally. Seized animals are forfeited to the United States upon conviction. The Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service may utilize personnel and services from other Federal or State agencies to enforce the law. Technical amendment to the US Code allows for this collaboration. \"Sec. 50. Exotic animals.\""
