Maduro, who took office in 2013 after Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's death, faces economic challenges and protests. His regime is accused of human rights abuses, creating a humanitarian crisis, and engaging in corruption. The economy heavily relies on oil, leading to instability. Venezuela's economy heavily relies on oil, accounting for over 90% of exports. The 2014 oil price collapse caused a 35% contraction in the economy since 2013, worse than the Great Depression in the U.S. The crisis includes inflation, shortages, debt default, and deteriorating living conditions. Congress is interested in U.S.-Venezuela relations and economic crises affecting U.S. interests. This report analyzes Venezuela's economic crisis, its causes, government responses, and impact on U.S. economic interests. Venezuela's economy heavily relies on oil, accounting for over 90% of exports. The 2014 oil price collapse caused a 35% contraction in the economy since 2013. Economic conditions have deteriorated rapidly under President Maduro, with the government facing a dire fiscal situation. Venezuela's economy is built on oil, which funds the government budget and provides foreign exchange for importing consumer goods. In November 2017, Venezuela announced plans to restructure its debt due to the government's dire fiscal situation. The country benefited from high oil prices during the 2000s, with President Ch\u00e1vez using oil revenues to fund social programs and subsidies. Ch\u00e1vez borrowed against future oil exports, leading to a significant increase in public debt. Between 1999 and 2013, Venezuela's public debt more than doubled from 28% to 58% of GDP under President Ch\u00e1vez. He used oil to expand influence abroad through programs like PetroCaribe, while also implementing widespread expropriations and nationalizations. Despite reducing poverty rates, economic mismanagement led to long-term consequences such as discouraging foreign investment and hindering economic productivity. When Nicol\u00e1s Maduro became President in 2013, Venezuela's economy was already struggling due to its heavy reliance on oil exports. The government's lack of preparation for a drop in oil prices worsened the situation, as they had not built up reserves or a stabilization fund. This economic mismanagement, along with expropriations and nationalizations, discouraged foreign investment and hindered economic growth and poverty reduction in the country. The crash in oil prices caused a sharp decline in government revenue, leading to a broad economic crisis in Venezuela. The government's policy choices, including printing money to address the budget deficit, resulted in high inflation rates. Unemployment is forecasted to reach 26% in 2017, more than triple the level in 2012. Venezuela's unemployment rate is forecasted to reach 26% in 2017, more than triple the level in 2012. The Maduro government's commitment to repaying debts led to tight resources, restrictions on foreign currency access, price controls, and reduced imports. Legal challenges from creditors could result in the seizure of Venezuela's overseas assets. Venezuela's imports of goods dropped significantly from $62.9 billion in 2013 to $21.4 billion in 2016, leading to severe shortages of food and medicine. To fill funding gaps, the government sought financing from allies like China and Russia, securing loans to be repaid through future oil exports. In May 2017, the Venezuelan central bank raised funds by selling $2.8 billion in PdVSA bonds to Goldman Sachs Asset Management at a discount. The government struggled to find buyers for similar transactions as foreign exchange reserves dwindled. Venezuela's official reserves decreased from $21.5 billion in 2013 to $10 billion in Q3 2017. New U.S. sanctions in August 2017 limited Venezuela's borrowing and access to financial markets. President Maduro announced on November 2, 2017, that Venezuela would seek to restructure its debt due to its dire fiscal situation. The government plans to introduce a new currency called \"petros\" backed by oil, gas, gold, and diamonds to bypass sanctions. Venezuela owes approximately $64 billion to bondholders, $20 billion to China and Russia, $5 billion to multilateral lenders, and additional debts to importers and service companies in the oil industry. President Maduro blames U.S. sanctions for the need to restructure, citing difficulties in finding new financing. The restructuring process is expected to be complex due to the involvement of numerous parties, legal challenges from bondholders, and potential geopolitical factors influencing lending from China and Russia. Venezuela's debt restructuring faces challenges from bondholders seeking to seize assets like CITGO, differences in legal provisions between sovereign and PdVSA bonds, and U.S. sanctions prohibiting engagement with key negotiators. Maduro's pledge to continue debt service aims to avoid legal disputes, but missed payments in mid-November raised concerns. Economic reforms and an IMF program are lacking in Venezuela's restructuring efforts. Venezuela's debt restructuring efforts faced challenges as PdVSA missed bond interest payments in mid-November, prompting default notices. The government organized a bondholders meeting in Caracas on November 13, 2017, but it provided little insight into negotiations with creditors. Critics questioned the appointment of sanctioned individuals to lead the negotiating team, and analysts tried to decipher Maduro's strategy for dealing with bondholders. The value of Venezuelan bonds decreased following default notices. The restructuring and default notices on Venezuelan debt led to a decrease in its value in secondary markets. There is speculation that the government may strategically default on government bonds but not PdVSA bonds. Russia agreed to restructure $3.15 billion in debt owed by Venezuela, easing fiscal pressures. China and Russia are taking divergent approaches to Venezuela's fiscal problems. In late November, a U.S. subsidiary of Sinopec sued PdVSA for late payments, showing Venezuela's need to maintain good relations with China. Venezuela also secured a $400 million credit line from CAF to keep its finances afloat. In December 2017, projections for Venezuela's economy worsened with a forecasted contraction of 11.9% in 2018 and 5.4% in 2019. The country is facing a large budget deficit, estimated at 18.5% of GDP in 2017, and uncertainty surrounds the impact of debt restructuring or default on its finances. The Venezuelan government is considering suspending debt repayments during negotiations, which could redirect funds to domestic objectives in the short term. However, this could lead to a substantial loss of government revenue in the long term if creditors seize oil exports or funds tied to oil exports. The economic crisis in Venezuela has implications for U.S. economic interests, with a contraction in U.S.-Venezuela trade and some major U.S. firms leaving or reducing operations in the country. U.S. investors holding Venezuelan government and PdVSA bonds could suffer losses. The Venezuelan government and PdVSA bonds pose risks for U.S. investors, potentially leading to legal disputes. Concerns also arise over Rosneft potentially acquiring partial ownership of PdVSA's CITGO subsidiary. U.S. trade with Venezuela has sharply declined due to low oil prices, Venezuela's oil production decline, and the country's political and economic crisis. U.S. commodity exports to Venezuela fell by 60% from 2013 to 2016, while imports decreased by about two-thirds. The trade contraction is more impactful for Venezuela than the United States. In 2016, the United States was Venezuela's largest trading partner, accounting for 22% of Venezuela's exports and 26% of imports, mainly dominated by oil trade. The value of U.S. oil imports from Venezuela has significantly decreased from $43.3 billion in 2011 to $10.9 billion in 2016. The United States exports refined oil and light crude oil to Venezuela, along with machinery, cereals, organic chemicals, and electrical machinery. The value of these exports has dropped significantly since 2013. U.S. service exports to Venezuela, including transportation and intellectual property, have remained steady. Despite Venezuela accounting for less than 1% of total U.S. direct investment overseas, many U.S. companies have subsidiaries or manufacturing facilities in the country. Many U.S. companies have subsidiaries or manufacturing facilities in Venezuela, with over 500 represented in mid-2016. However, due to political and economic instability, some large U.S. companies have left, reduced operations, or restructured to minimize exposure. Examples include Bridgestone, Colgate, Delta, GM, Kimberly Clark, Mondelez, Pepsi, and United Airlines. Analysts see a high risk of expropriation in Venezuela. The U.S. lacks a bilateral investment treaty or free trade agreement with Venezuela. The lack of a bilateral investment treaty or free trade agreement with Venezuela poses risks for U.S. investors. Recent tensions, including the detention of CITGO executives, may deter U.S. economic activity in Venezuela. Concerns about Venezuela's debt obligations have led some investors to sell their holdings, with nearly 41% of U.S.-based emerging-market debt funds having zero exposure to Venezuela. Following Venezuela's announcement of debt restructuring, bondholders are organizing for potential negotiations or legal challenges. U.S.-based firms like Cleary Gottlieb, Greylock Capital, Institute of International Finance, and Millstein & Co. are involved in advising creditors. Some firms are also exploring advising the Venezuelan government in the restructuring process. The restructuring efforts for Venezuelan government and PdVSA bonds are complicated by U.S. sanctions. Bondholders may seek repayment through legal challenges in the U.S. legal system, similar to the Argentine government's case. Venezuela's restructuring is expected to be complex due to significant overseas assets that could be seized by creditors. Companies expropriated by Venezuela also seek claim to Venezuelan assets in the U.S. The Venezuelan government is seeking claim to Venezuelan assets in the United States, potentially compensating U.S. bondholders facing losses. PdVSA used 49.9% of its CITGO shares as collateral for a $1.5 billion loan from Rosneft. If PdVSA defaults, Rosneft could gain control of CITGO, raising concerns about U.S. energy security and sanctions compliance. In May 2017, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin mentioned that any transaction involving Rosneft would be reviewed by CFIUS. The Trump Administration is prepared to block a reported deal where Rosneft would swap its CITGO collateral for oilfield stakes. Venezuela awarded licenses to Rosneft for offshore gas fields in December. Congress is considering humanitarian aid for Venezuela, but it is uncertain if the government would accept U.S. assistance. The government in Venezuela may undergo policy changes, prompting U.S. policymakers to consider providing economic support. This could involve lifting sanctions, seeking assistance from the IMF, and questioning the legitimacy of debt incurred by the National Constituent Assembly. If Venezuelan policies remain unchanged, the U.S. may impose harsher sanctions. IMF programs are crucial for aid packages in crisis situations, serving as a seal of approval for a government's policies. The IMF has a tenuous relationship with Venezuela, as the Venezuelan government has not allowed routine surveillance for over a decade. In 2017, the IMF found Venezuela in violation of its commitments, potentially leading to expulsion. The international community may consider normalizing relations between Venezuela and the IMF, with the United States likely playing a key role in negotiations. Questions remain on how to design an effective IMF or international assistance program for Venezuela. There are concerns about using international assistance funds to repay Venezuela's creditors, including private bondholders, and the Chinese and Russian governments. Some argue that IMF funds should be tied to debt restructuring. Estimates suggest Venezuela may need $30 billion annually in financial aid for several years, potentially requiring IMF resources above normal limits. IMF's procedures for extending loans beyond normal limits have faced scrutiny post-Eurozone crisis. The Eurozone crisis raised concerns about IMF lending practices, particularly regarding exceptional access granted to certain countries. The potential for a large IMF program for Venezuela is uncertain, given the magnitude of the crisis and humanitarian issues. If there is a change in government, the concept of \"odious debt\" may become relevant, suggesting that debt incurred by an illegitimate regime may not be enforceable. This concept, although not legally binding, has been discussed by policy experts and Venezuelan opposition members. Members of the Venezuelan opposition argue that a new government could declare debts incurred by the National Constituent Assembly as odious debt to secure relief. This strategy, if successful, could help alleviate Venezuela's fiscal challenges, but its feasibility and implications are uncertain. The country's economic crisis, intertwined with a political crisis, presents complex challenges with no immediate resolution in sight. The economic challenges in Venezuela, including collapsed output, inflation, and unsustainable debt, have been worsened by inadequate government policies. The international community typically offers financial assistance and debt restructuring in such crises, but Venezuela's government has not pursued this option. Given the political situation, it is unlikely that international help will be forthcoming. The Maduro regime in Venezuela faces a severe economic crisis, with questions about its sustainability. Maduro has consolidated power over the opposition, despite U.S. sanctions that have limited Venezuela's access to the financial system. These sanctions are controversial, as they are opposed by many Venezuelans and could potentially strengthen support for Maduro. Some analysts advocate for stronger sanctions to prompt a change in government, but others warn of potential harm to both Venezuelans and U.S. investors. Some caution against potential harm to both the Venezuelan people and U.S. economic interests."
