    "content": "The Upper Mississippi River Basin Protection Act includes the establishment of a sediment and nutrient monitoring network, data collection responsibilities, collaboration with existing monitoring efforts, reporting requirements, and a national research council assessment. Additionally, it involves computer modeling and research. The Upper Mississippi River Basin Protection Act includes provisions for computer modeling and research of sediment and nutrient sources, a communication plan for information distribution, and reporting requirements. Authorization of appropriations and cost-sharing requirements are also outlined in the act. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\nIn this Act, the terms \"Upper Mississippi River Basin\" and \"Basin\" refer to the watershed portion of the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois River basins, including the Kaskaskia watershed along the Illinois River and the Meramec watershed along the Missouri River. The terms \"Upper Mississippi River Stewardship Initiative\" and \"Initiative\" denote the activities authorized by this Act to monitor nutrients and sediment in the Basin. Federal investments in the Upper Mississippi River Basin must rely on scientific knowledge, using documented methods for data collection and analysis, peer review, and studies to identify nutrient and sediment sources. The Act establishes a monitoring network for sediment and nutrient management. The Secretary of the Interior will establish a sediment and nutrient monitoring network for the Upper Mississippi River Basin to identify sources, quantify processes, and coordinate data acquisition for computer modeling. The Secretary of the Interior will establish a sediment and nutrient monitoring network for the Upper Mississippi River Basin to aid in computer modeling, with the United States Geological Survey playing a key role in carrying out this task. The Secretary of the Interior will establish guidelines for data collection and storage responsibilities related to sediment and nutrient monitoring in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. Data collected will be released to the public using generic identifiers, with privacy considerations for monitoring stations on private lands. This is in relation to existing sediment and nutrient monitoring and assessment efforts. The Secretary of the Interior will inventory and integrate existing sediment and nutrient monitoring efforts from various entities to create a baseline understanding and develop a monitoring network. Maximum use of existing data and ongoing programs will be utilized in this process. The Secretary of the Interior will coordinate with the long-term estuary assessment project to develop a sediment and nutrient monitoring network in collaboration with nongovernmental entities. The Secretary of the Interior will collaborate with various monitoring programs to establish a sediment and nutrient monitoring network. They will report to Congress on the network's development within 180 days. The National Research Council will assess the Upper Mississippi River Basin's water resources within 3 years. SEC. 201. COMPUTER MODELING AND RESEARCH OF SEDIMENT AND NUTRIENT SOURCES. The Upper Mississippi River Stewardship Initiative requires the development of water-quality models to identify sediment and nutrient sources in the basin at a subwatershed scale. Computer modeling will pinpoint significant sources for targeting management efforts related to sediment and nutrients. The models will link nutrient and sediment sources to landscape, land use, and management practices. The Upper Mississippi River Stewardship Initiative requires the collection of ancillary information in GIS format to support modeling and management use of modeling results. This includes data on land use, soils, elevation, hydrologic modifications, sediment and nutrient management actions, and estimates of nutrient loads from various sources. The Director of the US Geological Survey will establish a communication plan within 180 days to distribute information on sediment and nutrient management in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. Reporting requirements are also outlined. SEC. 203 of the Act mandates the Director of the US Geological Survey to provide annual reports to Congress and the public on nutrient and sediment concentrations in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. Additionally, every five years, a progress report assessing changes in these concentrations will be submitted. Authorization of appropriations for the United States Geological Survey activities is set at $6,250,000 annually, excluding section 106. An additional $650,000 is allocated for the National Research Council to conduct the required assessment. Cost-sharing requirements apply to funds for the Cooperative Water Program."
