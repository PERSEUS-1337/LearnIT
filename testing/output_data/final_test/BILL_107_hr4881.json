    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Anti-Pyramid Promotional Scheme Act of 2002\". The Congress finds that pyramid promotional schemes, chain letters, and related schemes are fraudulent enterprises that victimize individuals of limited means by promising large returns for investments taken from newly attracted participants. These schemes pose a threat to interstate commerce and the financial well-being of U.S. citizens, especially with the global reach of the Internet. In this Act, \"compensation\" refers to payments made to induce participation in a pyramid scheme, excluding sales of goods or services. \"Consideration\" involves cash payments or purchases of goods/services, excluding certain transactions. The term \"participant\" refers to someone who pays to join a pyramid scheme and recruits others for compensation. A \"person\" can be an individual, corporation, partnership, or organization. \"Promote\" means to encourage others to join a pyramid scheme through various means. A pyramid promotional scheme involves participants paying for the opportunity to earn compensation primarily from recruiting others, rather than from selling goods or services. The scheme limits the number of participants who can join to control compensation eligibility. The scheme limits the number of participants who can join to control compensation eligibility based on receiving goods, services, or intangible property in addition to compensation. The Federal Trade Commission will establish a rule within a year to prohibit pyramid promotional schemes. It will be deemed unfair or deceptive for anyone to promote or sell participation in such schemes. State enforcement is also addressed. State enforcement allows authorized State officials to take action in State court for violations of State laws. The attorney general of any State can bring a federal court action to stop pyramid promotional schemes and obtain relief for residents. Temporary restraining orders or injunctions may be granted."
