    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Ninth Circuit Reorganization Act of 1999\" establishes a divisional organization for the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Federal Ninth Circuit Reorganization Act of 1999 establishes regional divisions for the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, including Northern, Middle, Southern, and Circuit Divisions. The Act also outlines the review process for district court decisions within the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is divided into regional divisions for different districts. Appeals from specific districts are assigned to the Northern, Middle, or Southern Division based on their location. Additionally, the Court handles appeals from the Tax Court and petitions to enforce administrative agency orders. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is divided into regional divisions, with each division consisting of 7 to 11 active judges. Judges assigned to a division must reside within the division's jurisdiction. Senior judges may also be assigned to divisions based on court policies. The judge assigned to a division may be temporarily assigned to another division by the chief judge for effective functioning. The presiding judge of each regional division is designated following specific rules, and only judges residing within the division are eligible. Panels of a division can hear cases at any location within the division's judicial districts. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has regional divisions governed by Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. A Circuit Division is also established with the chief judge and 12 other circuit judges chosen by lot from each regional division. The decisions of one regional division do not set binding precedents for others. The Circuit Division of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals consists of the chief judge and 12 other judges serving nonrenewable, staggered terms of 3 years each. If a judge is unable to serve, a replacement is randomly selected from the division. The Circuit Division has jurisdiction to review, affirm, reverse, or modify cases. The Circuit Division of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to review, affirm, reverse, or modify final decisions that conflict on an issue of law with a decision in another division. The Circuit Division may review decisions only if en banc review has been sought and denied by the division, and it decides cases through adopted procedures for expeditious conduct. The Circuit Division of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals operates without panels and decides legal issues based on opinions, briefs, and records in conflicting decisions. En banc proceedings apply to each regional division, allowing for additional briefing or oral arguments if necessary. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals operates under a divisional plan where en banc hearings are not allowed. The clerk of the court can have offices in each regional division. The Federal Judicial Center will study the effectiveness of the divisions. The Federal Judicial Center will conduct a study on the effectiveness and efficiency of the divisions in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. A report will be submitted to the Judicial Conference of the United States within 3 years, evaluating the divisional structure and making recommendations to Congress. SEC. 2. ASSIGNMENT OF JUDGES; PANELS; EN BANC PROCEEDINGS; DIVISIONS; QUORUM. Section 46 of title 28, United States Code, is amended to specify the assignment of judges on the court of appeals and its panels. Cases and controversies will be decided by panels of 3 judges, with at least 2 judges from the court, unless circumstances prevent their participation. Emergency situations may allow for appeals to be heard by panels of 2 judges from the court. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit determines the rotation of judges on panels to ensure a representative cross-section of cases. A majority of judges in regular active service can order a hearing or rehearing before the court en banc, consisting of all circuit judges in regular active service. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit allows judges to participate in en banc court reviews of decisions made by panels they were part of. Courts with more than 15 judges can organize into adjudicative divisions with exclusive appellate jurisdiction over assigned appeals. The presiding judge of each division is chosen from the active judges within that division. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit allows judges to participate in en banc court reviews of decisions made by panels they were part of. When organizing into divisions, a court of appeals establishes a circuit division with a chief judge and additional circuit judges, not exceeding 13, to review and resolve conflicts in decisions among the court's divisions. The circuit division has jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify final decisions conflicting on an issue of law with decisions in other divisions. The circuit division of a court of appeals decides cases through procedures for efficient and cost-effective conduct, without functioning through panels. It resolves conflicts in decisions based on opinions, briefs, and records, with the option for additional briefing or oral argument in special circumstances. This section applies to each division as if it were the court of appeals, with en banc hearings or rehearings only applicable to the divisions, not the court as a whole. The court of appeals operates through divisional plans, with en banc procedures not applicable to the court as a whole. A majority of judges constitutes a quorum for decision-making. Technical amendments are made to the table of sections for chapter 3 of title 28, United States Code. The Federal Judicial Center will monitor the implementation of section 46 of title 28, United States Code for 3 years and report relevant information to the Judicial Conference. The judicial council of each circuit may establish a district court appellate panel service composed of district judges to hear and determine appeals. Appeals will be heard by a panel of 2 district judges and 1 circuit judge, with the circuit judge presiding. District judges on the panel cannot review decisions from their appointed district court. The judicial council may establish a district court appellate panel service composed of district judges to hear appeals. The panel can sit at any place within the circuit and has exclusive jurisdiction over specified cases, with the authority of the court of appeals. The district court appellate panel may transfer a case to the court of appeals if it involves a question of law. The court of appeals can assume jurisdiction over the case for all purposes. Final decisions of district court appellate panels can be reviewed by the court of appeals at its discretion. Review procedures in district court appellate panels are governed by specific rules. After establishing a district court appellate panel service, the chief judge of a circuit can request the Chief Justice of the United States to assign district judges from another circuit to serve on the panel if needed. The Chief Justice has the authority to designate and assign such judges for this purpose. The Federal Judicial Center will monitor the implementation of district court appellate panels for 3 years and report relevant information to the Judicial Conference for assessment of effectiveness and efficiency."
