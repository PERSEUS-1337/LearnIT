The \"EMPLEO Act\" establishes a federal minimum wage requirement for eligible Puerto Rico employees and provides a wage subsidy for Puerto Rico workers under SEC. 6433. The \"EMPLEO Act\" establishes a federal minimum wage requirement for eligible Puerto Rico employees and provides a wage subsidy for Puerto Rico workers. Participating employers making qualified wage subsidy payments to eligible Puerto Rico employees are treated as having paid payroll taxes equal to the subsidy amount. The \"EMPLEO Act\" requires employers to provide information about wage subsidy payments to employees and submit details to the Secretary for advance payment. This includes estimates of the number of workers and payroll taxes for the applicable period. The \"EMPLEO Act\" mandates employers to provide details of wage subsidy payments for advance payment, including estimates of Puerto Rico employees, hourly rates, and total subsidy payments. The \"EMPLEO Act\" requires employers to make qualified wage subsidy payments on time or face penalties. An eligible Puerto Rico employee must be a U.S. citizen with a social security number and certify residency to the employer. The \"EMPLEO Act\" mandates employers to provide qualified wage subsidy payments to eligible Puerto Rico employees. These employees must be U.S. citizens, have a social security number, and declare residency in Puerto Rico for at least the next 6 months. The subsidy payment is 50% of the difference between the median hourly wage for Puerto Rico and the employee's hourly wage. The median hourly wage for Puerto Rico is $10 for 2017 and 2018, with adjustments for subsequent years. The hourly wage of an employee is determined based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data for each calendar year after 2018. The wage is calculated without considering any qualified wage subsidy payments. Each hour worked at a different rate is treated separately, and for salaried employees, the hourly wage is determined by dividing the salary by the number of hours worked. The term 'payroll taxes' refers to deductions for FICA employee taxes and taxes imposed for FICA employer taxes. The 'applicable period' is defined as a calendar quarter for most employers, except those filing returns less frequently. The Secretary determines periods for payroll tax returns. Excess wage subsidy payments are credited or refunded as overpayments. Participating employers may receive advanced payments equal to qualified wages. The text discusses how excess wage subsidy payments are compared to payroll taxes for a specific period. If the subsidy payments exceed the payroll taxes, the employer's taxes will be increased by the excess amount. This aims to ensure that Social Security Trust Funds are not negatively impacted. In order to protect the Social Security Trust Funds, section 6433 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is excluded when determining transfers or appropriations. Additionally, amendments are made to ensure proper accounting for funds under the Social Security Act. Amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to include a wage subsidy for Puerto Rico workers. Reporting requirements for wage subsidy information and penalties for failure to provide information to employees are also addressed. Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 include penalties for failure to provide wage subsidy information, with fines of $50 for each failure and $100 for negligence or intentional disregard. The effective date for these amendments is after December 31, 2016."
