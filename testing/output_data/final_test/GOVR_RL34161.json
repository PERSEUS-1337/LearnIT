    "content": "Economic and trade relations between the United States and India have fluctuated since India's independence in 1947. The US was a major trading partner in the 1950s and 1960s, but ties weakened when India aligned with the Soviet Union after the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. Relations remained cool for 40 years until a strategic partnership was pursued in 2004. India's rapid economic growth has attracted US companies for investment, while the Indian government continues economic reforms initiated in 1991. The Indian government is continuing economic reforms started in 1991 to shift towards a more market-oriented economy. The US is concerned about the slow progress of these reforms. Bilateral trade between the US and India has grown significantly, with both countries aiming to improve trade relations. President George W. Bush and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh endorsed doubling bilateral trade in three years. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Bush endorsed doubling bilateral trade. President Bush signed the United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act of 2006, signaling intent to waive restrictions on civil nuclear cooperation. Economic and trade issues remain between India and the United States, with both seeking greater market access and changes in legal and regulatory policies. Significant differences exist in the stances of the two countries in multilateral trade fora. The report provides a summary of India's current political climate, economic condition, bilateral trade trends, and key economic and trade issues with the United States. Congress may consider changes in laws related to agricultural goods, pharmaceuticals, technology, and immigration to enhance trade relations with India. Comparisons with China are also included for a different perspective on U.S. relations with both nations. India is the world's most populous country. India is a federal republic with a diverse population and geography. The prime minister holds executive power, while the president has limited authority. The country spans various ethnic groups, religions, and castes, with a wide range of landscapes from deserts to mountains. India dominates the Asian Subcontinent with diverse geography, from the Himalayas in the north to the Deccan Plateau in the south. The majority of the population is engaged in agriculture, with a significant portion living in the densely-populated northern states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, as well as Maharashtra in the west. The Lok Sabha is the center of national political power, with representatives from all states and union territories. India's political system includes a lower house, the Lok Sabha, with representatives from all states and union territories, and a smaller upper house, the Rajya Sabha. The country's political landscape is dominated by two major parties engaging in coalitional politics. India has one of the largest and fastest-growing economies globally, with a 9.2% GDP growth rate in 2006, making it the third-largest economy in Asia. India's recent economic success is attributed to internal economic reforms and external factors like a strong global economy and trade liberalization policies. Despite growth in manufacturing and services sectors, job creation remains low, and the agricultural sector has slow growth. This poses challenges to India's future prosperity. India's economic growth is hindered by inflationary pressures, impacting the standard of living for India's rural and urban poor. Additionally, barriers to economic growth include lack of infrastructure, bureaucratic obstacles, and environmental degradation. India's large population and industrial growth are straining its environment, worsening issues with clean water and air. Despite economic strength, India faces challenges with unequal distribution of benefits from reforms, leading to persistent poverty, especially in rural areas. Critics call for more aggressive economic reforms to address these issues. In March 2007, Prime Minister Singh discussed India's economy, emphasizing the need for additional reforms in banking, financial systems, labor markets, and public service delivery mechanisms to sustain rapid growth. The Bush Administration urges India to accelerate economic reforms, citing a pause in the reform process. U.S. Ambassador David Mulford highlights the need for privatizations and reform in key sectors to attract more private sector investment in energy and infrastructure development. Investment in energy and infrastructure development in India requires better governance, market-sensitive regulatory regimes, liberalization of the financial sector, and timely resolution of investor-state disputes. Meaningful reforms in the agricultural sector are crucial for realizing the country's economic potential, including rural infrastructural improvements, land reform, and allowing foreign direct investment. India's economic and trade policies have seen a pattern of gradual adjustments following significant changes over the last 60 years. Following India's independence in 1947, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's government emphasized rapid industrialization, import substitution, and high government involvement in economic production. State monopolies were established in key industries, while private companies faced licensing requirements and operational constraints. The agricultural sector received subsidies, price controls, and transport restrictions under the First Five Year Plan. Labor laws protected workers but limited mobility, and both exports and imports were regulated through licenses. During the First and Second Five Year Plans in India (1951-61), economic policies focused on rapid industrialization, import substitution, and high government involvement. State monopolies were established, private companies faced restrictions, and agriculture received subsidies. Real GDP grew at 3.6% and 2.5% annually, with a rise in agricultural and manufacturing output. However, growing trade deficits depleted foreign reserves, leading to a shift towards self-sustained growth in the Third Five Year Plan (1961-66). In the Third Five Year Plan (1961-66), India shifted from rapid industrialization to self-sustained growth and efficient substitution of imports in trade policy. The economic policy adjustment lasted until the end of the Seventh Five Year Plan in 1990. In 1990 and 1991, India faced political and economic shocks, including the assassination of ex-Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and the formation of a coalition government led by Prime Minister V.P. Singh. In response to economic challenges in 1990 and 1991, Prime Minister Rao implemented major reforms to restore faith in the rupee, replenish international reserves, and stimulate economic growth. These reforms, overseen by Finance Minister Manmohan Singh, aimed to reduce fiscal deficits and open up sectors reserved for the public sector. India underwent significant economic reforms in the early 1990s, reducing sectors reserved for the public sector to just three. This included liberalizing international trade, financial markets, and attracting foreign direct investment. The reforms led to a boost in real GDP growth rate from 3-4% in the 1980s to 5-7% in the early 1990s, but growth started to slow towards the end of the decade due to incomplete reforms. Since the early 1990s, India has implemented significant economic reforms, including the termination of state monopolies, elimination of the \"License Raj,\" abolition of import licenses, reduction in tariff rates, and restructuring of the economy. These reforms have sparked debates over their impact on economic growth and led to a second phase of gradual reform in the late 1990s. India has implemented economic reforms since the early 1990s, including ending state monopolies and restructuring the economy. Some Indians are skeptical about reforms, posing a challenge for the government. The ruling coalition, UPA, continues to follow a path of liberalization voluntarily. The 2004 election in India unseated the NDA coalition led by the BJP. Sonia Gandhi nominated Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister instead of taking the position herself. The Left Front, led by the CPI-M, had its best-ever national showing and provided crucial support to the UPA coalition. The CPI-M was militant in opposing the BJP's privatization efforts. The CPI-M, with its stronghold in West Bengal and Kerala, had a significant presence in the 2004 parliament with 43 seats. Investor concerns over a coalition government involving communists impacting economic reforms led to stock market losses, but reassurances from INC leaders and Indian industrialists helped restore confidence. The Chief Minister of West Bengal, a CPI-M member, actively sought corporate investments. The Congress-led coalition, while supportive of reforms, slowed down certain economic initiatives after coming to power. The Congress-led coalition has slowed economic reform programs, suspended disinvestment and special economic zone initiatives, possibly to appease the Left Front. Despite Prime Minister Singh and party chief Gandhi's popularity, INC candidates were defeated in state elections, leading to speculation that national economic policies and inflation are hurting the ruling coalition. The UPA's \"neoliberal policies\" may be damaging its electoral position, with the emergence of a new \"Third Front\" led by Jayalalithaa in Tamil Nadu. Political wrangling between the UPA and Left Front allies continues. The UPA government in India is facing political instability due to disagreements with Left Front allies over civil nuclear cooperation with the U.S. Key economic players in the government include Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, INC President Sonia Gandhi, and Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram. Key economic players in the UPA government in India include Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram, Commerce and Industry Minister Kamal Nath, Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, Oil Minister Murli Deora, and Power Minister Sushilkumar Shinde. Key economic players in the UPA government in India include Shinde, a former Chief Minister of Maharashtra; Karat, the General Secretary of CPI-M and a vocal critic of economic reforms; Singh, the President of BJP and a Hindu nationalist; FICCI, a nationwide grouping of corporations; and CII, a nongovernmental industry group with a large membership. The political landscape in India has seen a shift from INC dominance to the emergence of other influential parties since the 1970s. This led to coalition governments in the 1980s, with no party winning a national election outright since 1984. The UPA coalition relies on leftist forces that oppose economic reform, contrasting with the centralized economic planning of Prime Minister Nehru and the INC. The UPA coalition in India, led by the INC, includes leftist forces opposing economic reform. The BJP, in power from 1998 to 2004, implemented \"second generation\" reforms despite some members' skepticism of neo-liberal policies. The UPA is perceived as center-left, with INC holding majority seats and key cabinet positions. A \"Common Minimum Program\" was created to form the government. The UPA coalition in India, led by the INC, created a \"Common Minimum Program\" outlining governance principles. Left Front support for the UPA is based on alignment with this program. The INC's economic agenda for the 2004 elections aimed for up to 10% annual GDP growth and a more inclusive growth pattern. The INC in India promises to address societal issues like hunger, unemployment, poverty, and illiteracy through public investments in rural infrastructure. The BJP-led NDA, dominated by the BJP, advocates for domestic and foreign investment to boost the economy. The BJP's emergence in the 1990s rejected state-directed economic planning and the INC's secular version of Indian nationalism. The BJP in India advocated for liberalization efforts and economic reforms, including privatization of public sector enterprises. They initially influenced INC government policies in the 1990s but later moderated their stance due to tensions between Hindu nationalism and globalization. The party's 2004 economic agenda focused on continued economic reforms with some support for trade protectionism and \"calibrated globalization.\" Their goal was to eradicate poverty and unemployment while promoting economic growth. The NDA continued economic reform efforts with a focus on various sectors, criticizing the INC for slowing down reforms and entering into a civil nuclear cooperation agreement with the US. Hindu nationalist groups, like the Swadeshi Jagaran Manch, resisted proposed economic reforms. The Swadeshi Jagaran Manch (SJM), a leading Hindu nationalist organization, advocates for self-reliance and opposes Western globalization. The swadeshi lobby has some support in India and welcomed the UPA's Common Minimum Program in 2004. India's major communist parties now support the INC-led ruling coalition to prevent the BJP from gaining power. The Left Front alliance, led by the CPI-M and the Communist Party of India, holds 85% of its 60 Lok Sabha seats. India's communist parties, part of the Left Front alliance, hold 85% of its 60 Lok Sabha seats. Initially opposed to New Delhi's reform efforts, they now seek investments in West Bengal, focusing on economic policies while championing minority groups and farmers. The Left Front in India, part of the communist parties, opposes foreign direct investment limits, privatization, and Special Economic Zones. They hold power in Kerala and West Bengal, leading strikes against inflation and unemployment. Accusing the UPA government of violating the Common Minimum Program, they criticize disinvestment from public sector undertakings. The Left Front in India opposes neoliberal policies of the UPA coalition, particularly its pro-U.S. foreign policy tilt. They vehemently oppose U.S.-India civil nuclear cooperation. India's political and economic situation is complicated by regional disparities, with some areas being prosperous while others are underdeveloped and impoverished. Western India is relatively prosperous. Western India, including Maharashtra and Gujarat, is relatively prosperous with high urbanization rates. Maharashtra, home to Mumbai, ranks high in health, education, and infrastructure despite urban poverty. Gujarat is known for its productive agricultural sector and lucrative investment environment. Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh rank in the middle range, while Goa has the highest per capita income in the country. The state of Goa in India has the highest per capita income, while Delhi is the most affluent administrative district. Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, and Haryana form India's prosperous region. Uttar Pradesh is populous but among the poorest states. Jammu and Kashmir faces religious-based insurgency but has low poverty rates. Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh are fast-growing states attracting global attention. The southern region of India, particularly Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, is leading in the country's software and information technology boom. Bangalore and Hyderabad are emerging as high-tech hubs and BPO centers. Kerala is known for its social infrastructure and high literacy rate, while Tamil Nadu is praised for its governance and industrial capital of Chennai. Despite infrastructural challenges, the southern region is considered the most livable in India. The eastern region of India faces historical and geographical disadvantages, leading to underdevelopment and poor infrastructure. Bihar, Orissa, Jharkhand, and Chhattisgarh struggle with development challenges, while West Bengal is a key commercial and industrial center. The \"Seven Sisters\" in the northeast are sparsely populated and connected to the rest of India by a narrow corridor. India's eastern region, including states like Bihar, Orissa, Jharkhand, and Chhattisgarh, faces underdevelopment and infrastructure issues. The area is plagued by armed tribal conflicts and separatist movements, including the Naxalites, Maoist insurgents fighting for landless laborers and tribals. Prime Minister Singh has called the Maoist insurgency the biggest internal security challenge in India's history. The Maoist insurgency in India is considered the biggest internal security challenge, threatening democracy and economic development. The insurgents have grown in sophistication and lethality, operating in half of India's states. Violence caused over 700 deaths in 2006, with concerns raised by U.S. investors. The Maoist insurgency in Andhra Pradesh raised concerns, but area business leaders provided reassurance about the investment climate. Maoist attacks on infrastructure can hinder development in affected areas, especially in states with significant coal reserves, posing a threat to energy security. India's GDP saw significant growth from 2002 to 2007, with projections for further increase in 2007. India's GDP saw significant growth from 2002 to 2007, reaching $4.4 trillion in 2006 and projected to increase to $4.7 trillion in 2007. The expansion of the manufacturing and service sectors has been a key driver of this growth. The services sector experienced higher growth than manufacturing, leading to a decline in the agricultural sector's contribution to GDP. Despite the dominance of the services sector, agriculture remains important, especially in rural areas where 71% of the population lived in 2006. India's economy has seen growth in non-agricultural employment, but two-thirds of the male population still primarily work in agriculture. Job creation has been low despite economic restructuring, with only about 27 million jobs in the organized sector over the past decade and a half. This is attributed to the dominance of higher-skilled, professional jobs in manufacturing and services. India's economy has seen growth in non-agricultural employment, with higher-skilled, professional jobs dominating the manufacturing and services sectors. However, India's restrictive labor laws are seen as a barrier to job creation. Living conditions in rural areas have improved, but many still lack access to basic amenities like tap water and electricity. A government study found that a large percentage of Indians live on less than 20 rupees per day, highlighting the income disparity in the country. India ranked 126th out of 177 countries on the 2006 human development index. India's middle class has grown in size and affluence since the implementation of economic reforms. Estimates indicate that less than 20% of India's households are in the middle class, with a substantial number of wealthy people and a growing urban middle class. India surpassed Japan in 2007 as the home of the most billionaires in Asia. The rapid growth in India's trade in goods and services has led to a sectoral shift in the domestic economy. Between 1990 and 2005, there was a significant increase in both merchandise and service trade. India's total merchandise trade doubled in value from 1990 to 1999, while its trade in services trebled in value. Since 1999, there has been an acceleration in international trade growth, with total merchandise trade and imports of services nearly tripling in value between 1999 and 2005. However, this growth has also resulted in a growing trade and current account deficit, with India's merchandise trade deficit projected to reach $63.7 billion in FY2007, up from $13.7 billion in FY2004. India's balance of trade deficit has grown significantly, reaching a projected $63.7 billion in FY2007 from $13.7 billion in the past. The current account balance has shifted from a surplus to an estimated deficit of $14.1 billion in FY2007. The rise in merchandise exports is driven by oil, ores, metals, motor vehicles, and machinery. In 2006, oil became India's top exported commodity, with a focus on high-speed diesel and other fuels. Exports of ores, slag, and ash also saw a substantial increase, particularly in iron ore exports to China. Motor vehicles and parts exports have grown, with automotive parts accounting for a significant portion. India's top exports in 2006 include automotive parts worth $1.257 billion, automobiles valued at $1.501 billion, and motorcycles totaling nearly $319 million. Despite the decline in clothing exports, jewelry remained India's top export commodity. In 2006, jewelry remained India's top export, with diamonds being the primary export. The top markets for India's diamonds were Hong Kong, the United States, Belgium, and the United Arab Emirates. India's top imports included oil, jewelry, machinery, and electrical machinery. Oil was the top import, with the majority being crude oil, while jewelry imports consisted of gold and diamonds for the jewelry manufacturing industry. India's merchandise trade saw rapid growth, with a significant increase in services exports and imports. The value of services exports rose by 250% between 2000 and 2005, reaching $108.3 billion in total trade value. India's services trade surplus in 2005 was $3.9 billion, driven by strong growth in transportation and travel services, as well as other service sectors. Over 15 years, India's services exports grew significantly from $4.6 billion in 1990 to $56.1 billion in 2005, a 12-fold increase. The sectoral composition of services imports also showed growth, with the import of other commercial services experiencing the greatest increase. India's services imports grew almost nine-fold from $5.9 billion in 1990 to $52.2 billion in 2005. The structural changes in India's economy, decline in poverty, emerging middle class, and rapid growth in foreign trade are driving economic growth. Concerns are rising that India's economy may be growing too fast, potentially leading to a sharp economic downturn. India's rising inflation rate is a concern for its fast-growing economy. In 2006, the consumer price index (CPI) in India exceeded 7%, with further increases in 2007. Despite efforts by the Reserve Bank of India to control inflation through interest rate hikes, economic growth remains strong. Analysts predict that inflation will stay above 6%, while the UN projects a 9.0% growth rate for India in 2007, only slightly lower than the previous year. In 2007, India's economy is projected to grow by 9.0%, slightly lower than the previous year. The IMF recommends reducing public debt, lowering the government deficit, and promoting job growth to prevent overheating. The RBI's anti-inflation efforts have led to a stronger rupee, impacting exports, especially in jewelry and clothing. The UPA coalition in India promised sustained economic growth with a focus on generating employment through guaranteed 100-day jobs, public investment in social programs, agriculture, and rural sectors. They also prioritized developing physical infrastructure and continuing economic reforms with a human face to stimulate growth, investment, and employment, particularly in rural areas. The UPA economic priorities aim to improve rural prosperity, public services, and quality of life for citizens. Analysts suggest shifting focus from GDP growth and FDI to address the needs of common citizens, especially in rural and agricultural sectors. This approach also aligns with the economic challenges highlighted in a World Bank report, emphasizing the importance of enhancing core public services like healthcare, education, and infrastructure for all citizens. Prime Minister Singh prioritized development in the UPA government, focusing on reducing poverty, increasing employment, and sustaining growth through fiscal and trade deficit management. Privatization was not part of the UPA ideology, and major public sector concerns were not to be sold off. The appointment of Palaniappan Chidambaram to head the Finance Ministry and the UPA Common Minimum Program emphasizing economic growth and increased investment were well-received by business interests. The Singh government has focused on economic growth and investment, with efforts to privatize and reform labor expected to slow. The government has aimed to maintain its coalition by avoiding sharp shifts in economic policies, leading to modest and uneven implementation of reforms. Opposition to economic reform may come from both the Left Front and ordinary Indians. Resistance to economic reform among ordinary Indians is fueled by distrust of the corrupt political class. The Singh government's attempts at economic changes have been gradual, with federal expenditures at 11.2% of GDP in FY2006/2007. The UPA's budgets have been praised by business interests for being progressive and forward-looking. The Indian government's budget for FY2007/2008 addresses criticisms of economic reforms by focusing on social spending and anti-poverty measures. The Left Front criticizes the government for not doing enough for the poor, while the opposition BJP accuses them of slowing down economic reforms. The budget includes efforts to reduce poverty, with ongoing debates on the effectiveness of these measures. In August 2005, India's Parliament passed a $9 billion jobs bill for poverty reduction, criticized for diverting resources to failed efforts. The World Bank supported the policy, aiming to sustain growth. In February 2006, the government launched an anti-poverty initiative providing guaranteed jobs for rural households. India faces budgetary challenges due to underinvestment in infrastructure and tax evasion limiting funds for public services. India faces budgetary challenges due to tax evasion limiting funds for public services. Only 30 million Indians pay taxes, with 15% of federal revenue coming from tax collection. Strategic sectors like railroads, nuclear power, and military remain state monopolies. The privatization program overseen by the Department of Disinvestment has faced opposition within the government, leading to a slowdown in privatization decisions. The Indian government faced criticism for abandoning plans to privatize state-owned companies, seen as a gesture to Left Front parties. Despite this, efforts to join a disinvestment process involving power companies were renewed in 2007. Labor laws in India are perceived as biased against employers, hindering high-risk investments due to strict government oversight and numerous laws regulating the labor market. The Indian government's labor sector faces challenges with millions of lost human-days of labor each year and a backlog of pending disputes in the courts. Prime Minister Singh acknowledged the need for labor reforms in 2005 but faced obstacles from Left Front allies. The U.S.-India CEO Forum highlighted India's poor infrastructure as a key barrier to increased trade and investment relations. Finance Minister Chidambaram acknowledged India's need for major investments in infrastructure such as roads, ports, and electricity generation to boost bilateral trade and investment relations. He emphasized the importance of a more liberal policy on foreign capital. Electricity shortages and poor infrastructure were highlighted as key obstacles hindering India's economic potential. The government is working to address these issues. The Singh government is addressing underinvestment in infrastructure, estimating a need for $350 billion in investment over the next five years. Funding may come from foreign exchange reserves and foreign investors. Reforms in the financial sector are crucial for raising capital. The central government plans to spend over $46 billion on infrastructure development in FY2007/2008, including projects like widening national highways and building a dedicated freight railway. India is investing in infrastructure with plans for national highways, a dedicated freight railway, seaport renovations, airport modernization, telecommunication network expansion, and new power plants. Special economic zones (SEZs) are controversial, aiming to create industrial areas for rural employment and foreign exchange earnings. The Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in India aim to attract investment from public and private companies, including foreign ones, with various incentives. Currently, 234 SEZs have been approved by the government, but the policy faces criticism for land acquisition issues, where farmers have been displaced from their land without adequate compensation. This has led to opposition from various interest groups. Some critics argue that building SEZs on fertile agricultural land will impoverish farmers without proper compensation. Opposition from both the political left and right, including INC chief Sonia Gandhi, has raised concerns about exposing farmers to unscrupulous developers. India's finance minister warns of potential loss of billions in tax revenues due to special concessions for firms in SEZs. Violent protests and deaths have occurred in SEZ establishment, with incidents in Nandigram, West Bengal resulting in multiple fatalities in 2007. 11 more protesters were killed in Nandigram during demonstrations against the SEZ, leading Prime Minister Singh to put the SEZ policy on hold. India's trade policies shifted from a restrictive import licensing system to a tariff-based system post-1990s economic reforms, favoring certain imports while deterring others. Import tariffs gained significance as a result of these policy changes. India's import tariffs became crucial for the federal budget after a change in trade policy. Tariffs contributed significantly to India's tax revenue in 1996/97. India has been simplifying import policies by reducing tariffs and eliminating licensing requirements to align with ASEAN levels. Despite lowering import barriers, India has been actively filing antidumping measures with the WTO since the 1995 Customs Act amendment. India had 174 antidumping measures in force as of June 30, 2006. India had 174 antidumping measures in force on products from 30 different WTO members, including 11 measures on U.S. products. India's tariff system was known for being complex and opaque with a high average tariff rate and a dispersed range of tariff rates. There were many exemptions to the standard tariff rate, making it challenging for foreign companies to determine the correct tariff rate for their exports. Enforcement of tariff laws was uneven, and there were claims of arbitrary evaluation of imported goods. However, improvements have been made with the lowering of the average tariff rate and simplification of the tariff schedule. In fiscal year 1991/92, India had an average tariff rate of almost 130%, which decreased to 19.5% by 2005. The tariff rates for most goods in 2006/07 were 30% for agricultural goods and 12.5% for non-agricultural goods, with peak rates of 100% and 182% respectively. Textiles and clothing were exceptions to the tariff reduction and simplification efforts. In April 2001, India introduced specific duties on fabrics and apparel, with tariffs as high as 63%. In fiscal year 2006/07, products in HS chapters 50 to 63 still face a two-track duty system. Some goods are prohibited, controlled, or monitored due to international obligations or health concerns, such as the ban on live poultry imports in March 2007. India regulates imports of various products through stringent regulations and monitoring import flows. The United States has expressed concerns about India's trade policy, including trade-distorting subsidies for DAP fertilizer, extensive documentation requirements by Indian Customs, and discretionary customs valuation criteria. Additionally, the US is worried about India's standards and certification requirements, particularly regarding sanitary measures. The United States has concerns about India's standards and certification requirements, seeing them as potential trade barriers. Despite past issues, current economic and trade relations between the two countries are relatively friendly. U.S. policymakers view India's political system positively, leading to improved relations. India's trade and investment reforms in the last 15 years have also helped enhance trade relations. Indian officials believe that both economies have complementary business interests. The trade relations between India and the United States have improved significantly over the last 20 years, despite occasional political differences. Bilateral trade value has increased from $4.0 billion in 1986 to $31.9 billion in 2006. However, the relative importance of each nation in their total trade has declined since the late 1960s. The value of India's exports to and imports from the United States has shown fluctuations over the years, with a recent strong growth in trade flows. Despite the decline in the relative importance of the U.S. for India's imports over the last 40 years, India's exports to the United States have dramatically increased. In 2006, the United States became India's largest export market, purchasing 17.4% of India's exports but only supplying 5.9% of its imports. U.S. trade statistics with India show a similar pattern, with low and flat exports and imports until the mid-1980s, followed by a rapid increase in imports from India in the early 1990s. U.S. exports to India started to increase in value in the early 1990s, but not as rapidly as imports from India. India's role in U.S. trade has also changed, with India supplying 1.2% of U.S. imports and receiving 1.0% of U.S. exports in 2006. There are discrepancies in the top traded commodities between the two countries based on official trade data. In 2006, the top traded commodities between the United States and India differed in value and ranking. Both countries reported discrepancies in the top five exports, with disagreements on the value and ranking of machinery, electrical machinery, optical & medical instruments, and aircraft from the U.S. to India. India's top exports to the U.S. included jewelry, woven apparel, knitted apparel, and miscellaneous textile articles. There were differences in the last commodity in their respective top five exports. In 2006, discrepancies in the top five exports between the United States and India were noted. India listed jewelry as its top export to the U.S., while the U.S. data indicated machinery as its top export to India. Both countries recognized China as a rising competitor in trade. China became India's leading import source in 2004, surpassing the U.S. By 2006, U.S. exports to India were $9.9 billion, while China's exports to India had risen to $6.0 billion. In 2006, U.S. exports to India totaled $9.9 billion, while China's exports to India reached $15.6 billion. India's exports to the United States more than doubled from $9.3 billion in 2000 to $18.7 billion in 2005. India's exports to China also increased significantly from $0.7 billion to $7.8 billion during the same period. Overall, India's total trade with the United States increased from $12.2 billion in 2000 to $28.6 billion in 2006, and its total trade with China rose from $2.2 billion to $23.3 billion. This shows a rapid increase in bilateral merchandise trade flows, with India's exports to the United States outperforming U.S. exports to India. India's trade with China has grown rapidly in the last five years, surpassing the United States as India's leading source of imports. China may soon become India's largest trading partner. Bilateral trade in services between the United States and India has potential for rapid growth, with a proposal for a U.S.-India free trade agreement in services. In 2005, bilateral service trade between the United States and India was nearly balanced, with significant growth in transportation and professional services. U.S. foreign direct investments in India also saw a dramatic increase during this period. Between 2001 and 2005, U.S. investments in India saw a significant increase, rising from $2.4 billion to $8.5 billion. Despite this growth, India remains a relatively small destination for U.S. investors, accounting for less than one-half of one percent of U.S. direct investment overseas in 2005. India ranked 31st in 2005 for overseas U.S. direct investments, with the United States being the second biggest investor in India. India's large, educated, English-speaking workforce may attract U.S. companies looking for investment opportunities, with a focus on manufacturing. In recent years, Indian companies like the Tata Group have been actively involved in overseas acquisitions. For example, Tata Group purchased Tetley Tea in 2000, Eight O'Clock Coffee in 2006, and Corus in 2007. India and the United States do not have a bilateral trade agreement, relying on multilateral organizations like the WTO and IMF for trade relations. India's non-signatory status to the 1968 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty has hindered its access to nuclear materials for over three decades. The 1974 \"peaceful nuclear explosion\" led to the creation of the Nuclear Suppliers Group and tighter U.S. export laws. In 2005, a policy shift aimed at granting India benefits of civilian nuclear energy cooperation with the U.S. President Bush worked on achieving full civilian nuclear energy cooperation with India, which required changes in U.S. law and NSG guidelines. India agreed to place its nuclear reactors under international oversight by 2014. The 109th Congress passed the Henry J. Hyde United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act of 2006, making procedural changes to the original proposal. The 109th Congress made changes to the Administration's original legislative proposal for civilian nuclear cooperation with India, including retaining congressional oversight and requiring future approval of a completed agreement. Proponents believe the initiative can bring India into the nonproliferation mainstream, benefit global energy markets, reduce carbon emissions, and enhance the U.S.-India partnership. India seeks U.S. nuclear technology to improve its energy infrastructure, while U.S. business interests are eager to benefit from the agreement. The U.S. is looking to export nuclear reactors, fuel, and services to India through a national program to improve energy infrastructure. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce predicts potential contracts worth $100 billion and 27,000 new American jobs annually for a decade. However, foreign companies like Russia's Atomstroyexport and France's Areva may have an advantage in the Indian market. U.S. nuclear suppliers are hesitant due to the lack of nuclear liability protection in India. In July, the United States and India announced the conclusion of negotiations on the 123 Agreement, despite initial dissatisfaction from New Delhi over certain conditions. The deal was hailed as a \"historic milestone\" in the bilateral strategic partnership, with India securing reprocessing rights, assured fuel supplies, and no automatic termination in case of further nuclear weapons tests. Domestic political pressures in India, including opposition from influential political elements, had initially constrained Indian leaders' maneuvering on the issue. The 123 Agreement between the United States and India includes concessions to Indian demands and may face resistance in Congress. Civil nuclear cooperation is pending NSG approval and India's safeguards agreement with the IAEA. President Bush pledged a Verified End User program for India to facilitate controlled U.S. exports. The Verified End User (VEU) program aims to provide Indian companies with faster access to U.S. technology products. India is urged to strengthen its export control systems to meet international standards, although this is not a requirement for the VEU program. The U.S. may exclude certain chemicals and items if India does not tighten its export controls. India benefits from the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) Program, which offers duty-free tariff treatment to designated developing countries. In 2006, India received GSP preferential treatment for $5.7 billion of its exports to the United States, with $2.4 billion being jewelry or jewelry-related products. Some in the 109th Congress considered removing India from the GSP Program due to its stance on the Doha Round negotiations. Despite calls to revise the program to exclude advanced developing countries like India, no action was taken by the Bush Administration. During the Indian prime minister's visit to Washington in July 2005, he and President Bush agreed to revitalize the U.S.-India Economic Dialogue, which includes four main fora. They also agreed on three new initiatives and reconstituted the High Technology Cooperation Group. The Economic Dialogue aims to resolve economic and trade issues, develop administrative capacity, and provide technical assistance through meetings involving government officials and private sector representatives from both nations. India and the United States interact on economic and trade issues in various multilateral organizations. While the United States is a member of APEC, India is not but has shown interest in joining. India is a member of EAS and SAARC, while the United States is not. The United States and India are on opposing sides in WTO discussions about the Doha Round, with key issues including trade in agricultural goods, NAMA, trade in services, and trade remedies. A core group consisting of the United States, India, the European Union, and Brazil is working to resolve these issues, with agricultural trade being the main focus. Successful completion of the Doha Round requires resolution of all outstanding issues. Issues must occur for a successful outcome to the Doha Round, with India blaming U.S. intransigence for the collapse. U.S. urged India to match offers, but talks later collapsed due to lack of convergence. Trade Representative Schwab criticized India and Brazil for being rigid, suggesting some countries may not want a Doha round outcome. Interest in alternative trade promotion grew during the suspension of negotiations. Interest in alternative trade promotion grew following the suspension of the Doha Round negotiations. The United States proposed the creation of a Free Trade Association of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) at the 2006 APEC meetings. A pan-Asian free trade association was also discussed at the East Asian Summit, which would include ASEAN members plus Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, and possibly Russia. The United States was not considered for membership in the pan-Asian FTA due to not being an Asian nation. India had already expressed interest in alternative means of trade promotion. India supports the pan-Asian FTA idea, while the United States prefers the FTAAP model. Both countries are members of the Asian Development Bank, with India receiving significant assistance for infrastructure projects. The United States has pledged $461 million to the ADB's Asian Development Fund between 2005 and 2008, with Congress setting support at $99 million for FY2006 and FY2007. The Bush Administration requested $133.85 million for FY2008, including $18.6 million for arrears. The ADB is considering creating an Asian Currency Unit (ACU) for regional settlement of payments. India is interested in joining the ACU, but Finance Minister Chidambaram acknowledges it won't happen quickly. Chidambaram admits the Asian Currency Unit won't happen quickly. India faces resistance from ASEAN nations. The US has concerns about \"mission creep.\" Sectoral issues include improving market access for agricultural goods. India imported over $42 million in prepared foods from the US, while the US imported $1.3 billion in agricultural goods from India. Import restrictions and cultural norms in India hinder exports of live animals and animal products from the US. Tariff rates as high as 100% keep out products like coffee, tea, and most grains. Additionally, a 2007 report stated that US wheat was deemed unfit for import due to pervasive weeds. On March 6, 2007, the US and the EU requested WTO consultations with India over high customs duties on wine and spirits, reaching up to 550%. India committed to limiting tariffs to 150% but blocked the EU's attempt to create a dispute settlement panel. The WTO Dispute Settlement Board approved a panel on April 24, 2007, to address the United States' concerns about India's sanitary and phytosanitary regulations on U.S. exports. The U.S. questions the scientific basis and international standards of India's regulations, as well as its timely notification of changes. India, in turn, is dissatisfied with U.S. regulations on Indian agricultural goods, including a long-standing ban on the import of Indian mangoes. The tension between the United States and India revolves around the 17-year ban on importing Indian mangoes. President Bush promised to lift the ban during his trip to India in 2006. The U.S. Department of Agriculture issued a rule in 2007 allowing mango imports from India, but compliance costs make Indian mangoes uncompetitive. India is also concerned about U.S. farm subsidies being viewed as trade-distorting export subsidies. India rejects proposed U.S. farm assistance limit of $22 billion, citing 2006 support level of $19 billion as already below offer. Discussions on agricultural support programs ongoing in reinvigorated Doha Round negotiations with U.S., Brazil, and EU. Trade in clothing and textiles a key issue in U.S.-India relations due to top five India exports to U.S. and restructuring of global manufacturing post-WTO's Agreement on Textiles and Clothing termination in 2005. The termination of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing in 2005 led to expectations of China and India becoming major production sites for clothing and textiles. This shift was predicted to increase U.S. imports from India and China, potentially causing a spike in the U.S. bilateral trade deficit with India. While clothing imports from India surged in 2005, textile imports remained steady. The U.S. bilateral trade deficit with India did not significantly increase despite a rise in imports from India. The trade deficit grew unevenly between 2000 and 2006, with a notable increase in 2004-2005. The strengthening of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar negatively impacted India's clothing and textile exports to the United States. The Indian rupee appreciated by 9.1% against the U.S. dollar in less than four months, causing a decline in textile and clothing exports to the United States. This has been attributed to a slowdown in U.S. demand and the strengthening rupee, which is harming India's textile industry. The recent appreciation of the rupee is making it difficult for India to remain competitive in the clothing and textile industry. Supply side problems like unworkable labor laws, high transaction costs, and infrastructure weaknesses are causing production inefficiencies. The forthcoming Verified End Users (VEU) Program is expected to increase trade in dual-use technology and military equipment between the United States and India. India's defense procurement budget could reach $35 billion over the next two decades, with the country being a significant market for U.S. military equipment and technology. Arms transfer agreements worth $20.7 billion were signed from 1998 to 2005, mostly with Russia. Both U.S. and Indian officials emphasize the importance of increasing defense trade in future bilateral relations. In recent years, U.S. arms sales to India have increased significantly. The Pentagon negotiated a $190 million deal for 12 counter-battery radars in 2002, the largest bilateral arms deal at the time. India also purchased the USS Trenton for $44 million in 2006, along with six surplus Sikorsky helicopters for $39 million. Additionally, there was a potential sale of six C-130J Hercules transport aircraft worth over $1 billion in 2007. Overall, military sales agreements with India totaled $336 million from FY2002-FY2006. American defense firms are eager to expand business ties with India, with 52 U.S. companies showcasing their products at India's air show in 2007. U.S. Ambassador to India Mulford mentions the expectation of favorable treatment for U.S. companies, despite denying any negotiated agreements related to civil nuclear cooperation. Some Indian officials are concerned about the reliability of the U.S. as a partner. India has a list of desired U.S.-made weapons, including PAC-3 anti-missile systems and electronic warfare systems. The Bush Administration's \"new strategy for South Asia\" in 2005 welcomed Indian requests for information on purchasing F-16 or F/A-18 fighters. India plans to issue a tender for 126 new fighter jets in 2007, with Lockheed Martin and Boeing competing against other countries. U.S. defense companies are interested, despite concerns about India's Offset Policy for defense contracts. India's Offset Policy requires foreign defense contracts over 3 billion rupees to include a 30% offset purchase, investment, or technology transfer. U.S. companies object to this policy and must comply with export regulations, including securing licenses for dual-use products and post-shipment verification for certain exports to India. The BIS maintains a list of entities to which the export of dual-use technology is generally prohibited, including four Indian entities. There were discussions about potentially removing Indian companies from the list and relaxing restrictions on dual-use technology trade with India. Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration signaled a willingness to consider a relaxation of export restrictions. The United States may want India to tighten its export control regime before any changes are made. The United States may want India to tighten its export control regime before relaxing export controls on India. U.S. firms have shown strong interest in investing in India, with significant investments made in recent years by companies like Microsoft, Dell, Oracle, and IBM. Annual foreign direct investment to India has increased significantly, reaching over $11 billion in 2006. India restricts foreign ownership in many industries, making FDI less attractive to U.S. companies. Prohibited sectors include retail trade, atomic energy, lottery, gambling. FDI limits in other sectors range from 26% to 100% equity, with potential administrative approval. New legislation on FDI is being considered, covering entry conditions, dispute settlement, and incentives. The Indian government is considering creating uniform FDI limits within sectors and raising current limits. In March 2007, the FDI limit for the telecommunications industry was increased from 49% to 74%. Investment opportunities in India's retail sector are closely monitored, with a focus on ensuring incremental economic benefits. New Delhi commissioned a report on FDI in the retail sector in January 2006. In January 2006, India announced new regulations allowing foreign investors to own up to 51% of retail outlets selling single-brand goods. The U.S. Trade Representative listed India on the U.S. Special 301 Priority Watch List in 2007, urging improvements in India's IPR regime. The United States also called for stronger protection for copyrights, trademarks, and patents in India. India is urged to join WIPO's Internet Treaties and improve enforcement against copyright piracy. Concerns are raised about the impact of data exclusivity clauses on India's generic drug industry. India participated in a successful anti-piracy operation in 2007. In 2007, a successful anti-piracy operation called \"Operation Trident\" seized millions of pirate DVDs and VCDs in multiple countries, including India. This operation coincided with India hosting the first International Meeting on Intellectual Property and Development, focusing on the relationship between intellectual property rights and economic development. Additionally, a \"Bollywood-Hollywood\" anti-piracy initiative was implemented by the U.S.-India Business Council and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry. The \"Bollywood-Hollywood\" anti-piracy initiative aims to stop illegal copying and distribution of U.S. and Indian entertainment videos to reduce video piracy in India and the United States. India has been interested in the relationship between intellectual property rights (IPR) and economic development for years, with discussions at the WTO on technological transfer and the TRIPS agreement. The U.S. response to a paper on technological transfer and the TRIPS agreement was favorable, becoming the focus of WTO discussions in 2006 and 2007. The U.S. pharmaceutical industry is actively seeking improved IPR protection in India, particularly in patent protections. India's pharmaceutical industry opposes the U.S. push for stronger IPR protection, fearing it will hinder the introduction of generic drugs. India is a major exporter of jewelry, with diamonds being a significant import for the U.S. due to depletion of domestic mines, leading to concerns about sustainability. In 2005, India imported $10.6 billion worth of diamonds, raising concerns about \"conflict diamonds.\" India endorsed the Kimberley Certification Process to ensure diamonds are not from conflict zones. There were discussions to lower the FDI limit for diamond mines to prevent the import of conflict diamonds. Despite efforts, uncut conflict diamonds are still entering India, particularly in Surat. This raises the risk of conflict diamonds entering the U.S. market. India's growing economy has led to increased demand for oil, with production nearing capacity while demand continues to rise. India's oil demand is increasing, leading to a growing energy deficit. To fill the gap, Indian national oil companies are seeking overseas sources of crude oil, with ONGC Videsh Ltd. being the most active, holding interests in projects across 15 countries. Indian companies, including ONGC Videsh Ltd., are actively involved in Sudan's oil industry and the operation of the major oil pipeline in Port Sudan. India's increasing oil demand, along with China's, is tightening the global petroleum market and raising crude oil prices. Competition for energy resources in Asia is pushing nations to develop trade relations outside the region, such as India's pursuit of closer ties with Burma for energy cooperation and to counterbalance China's influence. The United States is also exploring ways to cooperate with friendly nations in the global petroleum market. Legislation on energy cooperation with India has been introduced in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Cooperation with India in the Indo-U.S. service trade, particularly in the IT sector, has seen significant growth. U.S. companies have been outsourcing IT work to India, with projections indicating a substantial increase in the value of IT outsourcing in the coming years. Studies suggest a shift towards more sophisticated IT activities and a potential shortage of IT skills among government employees driving the outsourcing trend. U.S. companies are expanding outsourcing activities in India beyond IT to include financial services. Citigroup announced job cuts and relocation to low-cost locations, with plans to move 5,000-8,000 jobs to India. India's IT industry is moving towards higher value-added services. Many U.S. companies are setting up tech centers in India to benefit from the market. Many U.S. companies are establishing tech centers in India to leverage the availability of Indian engineers and lower costs. Leading Indian IT companies are also expanding their international IT service capacity. The growth in IT services trade has strained the U.S. H-1B visa program, which allows temporary employment of foreign workers with equivalent qualifications. Despite an annual quota of 78,200 visas, exemptions have led to over 100,000 H1-B visas being issued in 2004 and 2005. Recipients can stay in the U.S. for up to six years (ten for Defense Department work) as long as they remain with the same employer. Both U.S. and Indian companies have raised concerns about the current visa quota. The current H1-B visa quota is seen as too restrictive by U.S. and Indian companies, hindering their ability to hire enough engineers and technicians. Some companies propose a new visa category for short-term work/training in the U.S., but there is opposition to expanding the H1-B program. Concerns about fraud and abuse in the program have been raised by U.S. Senators, impacting the relationship between the U.S. and India. Most economic and trade issues between India and the United States have developing trends with few direct legislative implications. However, there are bills before Congress concerning U.S.-Indian energy cooperation, such as the United States-India Energy Security Cooperation Act of 2007 (H.R. 1186) aimed at promoting global energy security through increased cooperation in diversifying energy sources and improving energy efficiency. The Energy Diplomacy and Security Act of 2007 and the Renewable Fuels, Consumer Protection, and Energy Efficiency Act of 2007 aim to establish a U.S. petroleum crisis response mechanism with China and India. The International Climate Cooperation Re-Engagement Act of 2007 includes provisions for promoting U.S. exports in clean energy technologies in India and China. The New Direction for Energy Independence Act also contains similar provisions, along with civil nuclear cooperation with India endorsed by the 109th Congress. The 110th Congress is considering the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which would change H-1B visa eligibility requirements and limit market-based visas to 115,000 per year. However, this falls short of the desired levels by Indian and U.S. tech companies. The bill does not address the industry's request for a new visa category for short-term training of foreign nationals in the U.S. Many provisions of the current omnibus farm bill are set to expire in 2007. The 110th Congress is considering legislation pertaining to the expiration of certain aspects of the current U.S. farm program, which India, along with Brazil and other nations, argue are \"trade distorting.\" The recently introduced H.R. 2419 provides for the continuation of the expiring farm programs, but may not be in compliance with any new WTO obligations from the current Doha Round discussions. The 110th Congress is considering legislation related to the operation of CFIUS, which oversees security implications of foreign investments in the US. Proposed legislation would require CFIUS to investigate all foreign investment transactions involving entities owned or controlled by foreign governments. This could potentially cause tension with India due to their increasing FDI in the US and impact efforts to persuade India to lower barriers to FDI. The current barriers to FDI in the US are a concern for many workers, with outsourcing to countries like India being a major issue. US laws provide some assistance to displaced workers through programs like the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program. Calls have been made to strengthen these programs to protect US workers from job losses due to outsourcing. There are two bills in Congress offering additional assistance to displaced workers, such as the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act (H.R. 1729). The Worker Empowerment Act (S. 1330) would provide wage insurance for dislocated workers, in response to the growth in clothing and textiles imports from India."
