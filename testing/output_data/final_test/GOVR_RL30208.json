    "content": "The FY2000 Act, signed by the President on October 9, 1999, allocated $50.2 billion for the Department of Transportation. However, a government-wide rescission of 0.38% will result in a $179 million cut from DOT funding levels. Despite this, the final funding level still represents a nearly 6% increase over the FY1999 Act appropriations. The largest reductions will impact the Federal Highway Administration, Airport Improvement Program, Federal Transit Administration, and the Coast Guard. Transportation is Function 400 in the annual unified congressional budget. The Department of Transportation (DOT) budget is funded mainly by transportation trust funds and Federal Treasury general funds. The trust funds include the highway trust fund, transit account, airport and airway trust fund, and inland waterways' trust fund. Highway and transit funding make up the majority of DOT appropriations, with contract authority linked to the highway trust fund. This is significant for budgeting purposes. The contract authority linked to the highway trust fund is significant for budgeting purposes. It allows authorized funds to be automatically available at the beginning of each fiscal year without the need for appropriations legislation. Transportation appropriators face the opposite situation compared to other federal programs, as the authority to spend for their largest programs already exists. Changes in spending in the annual transportation budget component were made in the FY1999 Appropriations Act. The FY1999 Appropriations Act achieved changes in spending in the annual transportation budget component by combining changes in budget/contract authority and placing limitations on obligations. This allowed appropriators to allocate funds between various federal transportation activities, including agencies like the Coast Guard and the Federal Aviation Administration. The inclusion of highway and transit programs in the discretionary budget provided additional flexibility in fund allocation among the 13 standing appropriations subcommittees in the House and Senate. TEA-21 brought about these changes. TEA-21 changed the budgetary procedure by creating new budget categories for highway and mass transit, with statutory limitations on obligations from FY1999 to FY2003. This resulted in a predetermined level of funding for core highway and transit programs, ensuring a discretionary spending guarantee. TEA-21 established discretionary spending guarantees for highway and transit programs, known as \"firewalls,\" to ensure minimum funding levels. The House and Senate appropriations committees' roles in determining annual spending levels were altered, limiting their ability to set obligations and adjust program spending levels. The TEA-21 firewalls restrict the appropriations committees' flexibility in adjusting DOT agency budgets. Reductions in spending for Function 400 must be allocated to agencies/programs outside the firewalls. Concerns have been raised for FAA, Coast Guard, and Amtrak, which lack firewall protection. H.R. 1000, the Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century, takes the aviation trust fund off budget, giving it a status similar to the Social Security trust fund in the annual budget debate. The budget treatment of the aviation trust fund has become a key issue in the 106th Congress. Concerns arise due to large unobligated balances expected in the fund unless spending increases or tax revenues decrease. This has led to calls for budgetary protection for aviation, with supporters of the Coast Guard also expressing concerns. The Coast Guard, not funded by a trust fund, may seek additional funding from the military side of the budget if transportation appropriations do not increase. Amtrak lacks a similar option. The debate over FY2000 DOT appropriations focused on allocating funds among competing programs. The DOT appropriations process involves allocating funds among competing programs and balancing a unified budget with earmarked activities. Priorities include safety, infrastructure, and innovation in transportation. Monies support various agencies like the NTSB and STB for diverse purposes such as Coast Guard expenses and infrastructure needs. The DOT emphasizes priorities such as safety, infrastructure, financing, and environmental enhancement. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century guides the appropriations process for surface transportation programs. Congress aims to ensure that Federal fuels taxes are used for highway and transit needs, with specific funding protections in place. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) established firewalls to protect specific funding levels for selected programs, sparking a debate between authorizers and appropriators over spending authority. These firewalls guarantee minimum funding for certain programs but may limit funding for others. A similar initiative in H.R. 1000 for air transportation drops the firewall provision while retaining off-budget provisions. TEA-21 also includes a provision allowing the Department of Transportation to redistribute excess trust funds. The FY2000 DOT appropriations act (P.L.106-69) disallowed the Administration's proposed redirection of RABA funds to other DOT initiatives. Total DOT funding almost doubled from FY1988 through FY2000. The Department of Transportation appropriations from FY1988 to FY2000 varied due to user fee collections. Actual amounts from FY1988 to FY1998 included initial funding levels enacted by Congress, while FY1999 and FY2000 figures were mostly from conference report tables. A rescission in FY2000 reduced the enacted level to just under $50 billion. President Clinton signed the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies appropriations on October 9, 1999. President Clinton signed the FY2000 Department of Transportation Appropriations Act, which had a total funding of $50.174 billion, representing a 6% increase over FY1999 levels. The Act mandated a rescission of over $179 million, reducing the funding provided in the Act. The FY2000 Department of Transportation Appropriations Act mandated a reduction of over $179 million, with limitations on the amount that could be cut from any activity. The Office of Management and Budget provided criteria for allocating the reduction, emphasizing targeted recommendations over across-the-board cuts. Reductions could only be made from discretionary budget authority and obligation limitations. The Department of Transportation faced reductions in funding, with the Coast Guard being particularly affected due to increased responsibilities and an aging fleet. The Administration requested $4.1 billion for Coast Guard discretionary funds in FY2000, which was $358 million less than the previous year. Additionally, there were mandatory funds of $64 million for State Boating Safety grants. The House and Senate approved a $4.0 billion budget for the Coast Guard in FY2000, with an additional $200 million in emergency funding. The total appropriation could be interpreted as $4.224 billion. Coast Guard programs are authorized every two years, with ongoing congressional consideration for authorization bills. The government wide rescission in P.L. 106-113 will cut the Coast Guard's budget by $1.6 million, with reductions in various accounts. The Coast Guard's budget request of $4.126 billion was proposed for drug smuggling activities and fleet recapitalization. The Senate, House, and conference agreed on a budget allocation of $2.781 billion, with $300 million for defense-related activities. The budget request for the Coast Guard was $2.781 billion, with $300 million allocated for defense-related activities. The Administration sought $350 million for acquisition, construction, and improvement, a decrease from FY1999. The agency requested $22 million for research in FY2000, an 83% increase. The Senate approved $730.3 million for Coast Guard retirement, while the House approved $721 million. The full House approved $721 million for Coast Guard retirement, while the conference agreed to $730.3 million. The Administration requested $72 million to support a military Selected Reserve Force and provide surge capacity for emergencies. A major issue was the Coast Guard's planned replacement of aging vessels and aircraft, with nearly $10 billion in purchases anticipated over a 20-year period starting in FY2002. The General Accounting Office criticized the Coast Guard's management at committee hearings in February and March 1999. The House Appropriations Committee criticized the Coast Guard's handling of the replacement program. The Senate included provisions in the bill for new aircraft purchases and disposal of Coast Guard facilities. Proceeds from facility sales would go to the Deepwater Replacement Project Revolving Fund. The House also included language for crediting sales. The House Appropriations Committee criticized the Coast Guard's handling of the replacement program and included provisions for new aircraft purchases and disposal of facilities. The House also specified the crediting of sales of disposed property to the appropriation account and required a comprehensive capital investment plan with the FY2001 budget justification. The budget anticipated using $41 million from new user fees for vessel recapitalization, information management, and shore infrastructure. The Administration proposed legislation for user fees on commercial cargo vessels and cruise ships to collect $41 million in FY2000 and $165 million annually when fully operational. Controversy surrounded proposals for user fees on traditional Coast Guard services. The Senate and House passed bill language prohibiting the Coast Guard from implementing new user fees in FY2000. The Administration requested $678 million for the FRA, down from previous years. The enacted legislation provided $735 million in funding. In FY2000, the Department of Transportation (DOT) cut $179,000 from the enacted level of $735 million. The largest reduction was for the Next Generation High Speed Rail Program (-$103,000), with cuts also to Rhode Island rail development and Alaska railroad rehabilitation. Amtrak saw a significant $38 million reduction from the previous year. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) received about $77.3 million in FY1999 for safety expenses, with a request for $95.5 million in FY2000. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 2084 recommended $91.8 million and the House-passed version recommended $94.4 million for salaries, travel, training expenses, and information systems monitoring in the railroad safety program. The conference agreement specified $94.3 million for these activities. The last railroad safety reauthorization statute was enacted in 1994, and funding authority expired in FY1998. FRA continues safety programs using existing authorities and annual appropriations. Deliberations during the 105th Congress did not result in a consensus on enacting a new law. The 106th Congress deliberated on railroad safety issues but did not reach a consensus on enacting a new law to authorize funding for FRA's regulatory activities. Following a tragic crash in March 1999, attention was focused on railroad-grade crossing safety. Questions were raised about the adequacy of FRA's grade crossing activities, state assistance, and budget for FY2000. Congressional reaction to these issues was anticipated. The 106th Congress deliberated on railroad safety issues, focusing on grade crossing safety and FRA's budget for FY2000. Congressional reaction influenced the railroad safety budget for FY2000, with increased funding for Operation Life Saver and a national public service campaign. The FRA conducts R&D on various topics including employee fatigue and positive train control. The requested budget for railroad R&D in FY2000 was $21.8 million, with a conference agreement specifying $22.5 million. The 106th Congress allocated $22.5 million for railroad R&D funds in FY2000. FRA requested $12 million for the Next Generation High Speed Rail Program and $10 million for Maglev. TEA-21 authorized $20 million for Maglev in FY2000. The Senate rejected the Administration's request for liquidating authority. The 106th Congress allocated $22.5 million for railroad R&D funds in FY2000, with $12 million for the Next Generation High Speed Rail Program and $10 million for Maglev. The Senate and House rejected the Administration's request for Maglev funding, maintaining the $20 million authorized in TEA-21. The enacted legislation specified $27.2 million for the Next Generation Program, with a reduction of $103,000 due to a government-wide rescission. Amtrak's budget authority was $609 million in FY1999, compared to $594 million in FY1998, with an additional $1.1 billion in funds from the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. The Administration, Senate, and House all requested $571 million for Amtrak in FY2000. The enacted legislation (P.L. 106-69) provides $571 million for Amtrak, whose financial condition remains weak. Amtrak may not survive FY1999 without a change in legislation allowing the use of \"capital\" grants for maintenance. Federal operating aid to Amtrak will end after FY2002. The DOT Inspector General predicts Amtrak will continue to need federal financial assistance. The DOT Inspector General estimates that Amtrak will need $2.7 billion to $4 billion in federal funds for new equipment and track improvements, including upgrades between Washington, DC, and New York City. Additional federal funding will be required for the foreseeable future. The Amtrak Reform Council's budget authority was $450,000 in FY1999, with a request for $750,000 in FY2000. The Senate recommended $950,000 and the House recommended $450,000 for the council's funding. The enacted legislation (P.L. 106-69) provides $750,000 for the Amtrak Reform Council, which was created in FY1998 to assess Amtrak's labor agreements, productivity, and ability to operate without federal assistance after September 30, 2002. If the council determines that federal assistance will be needed after this date, they must submit a reorganization plan to Congress. The FY2000 Act provides the FHWA with $28.9 billion in total budgetary resources, a $2.1 billion increase over FY1999. Funding for FY2000 is over $10 billion more than in FY1995. The Act largely follows TEA-21 provisions but includes waivers from the formula guidance. Funding was reduced by $105 million due to a government-wide rescission. The FY2000 Act reallocates RABA funds from allocated programs to core highway programs, increases specific project funding levels, and includes earmarking, which was opposed by the House leadership. The FY2000 Act, particularly the Senate-passed version of H.R. 2084, included changes to program structures and spending guarantees, with a focus on research and intelligent transportation systems. The Senate Act differed from the Clinton Administration proposal in its treatment of RABA funding. Total budgetary resources for FHWA were just under $29 billion. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 2084 distributed RABA funds of $1.46 billion based on TEA-21 formulas, rejecting the Administration's proposal for non-highway activities. The House bill honored TEA-21 guarantee levels and slightly reduced budgetary resources for FHWA. It also excluded smaller programs from RABA distribution and rejected the Clinton Administration's redistribution plan. The House bill rejected the Clinton Administration's proposal to redistribute RABA funds for non-highway activities. The Administration's request for FHWA funding at $27.3 billion was not supported by Congress, including the proposal to reprogram RABA funds for transportation programs outside the highway firewall. The Administration's suggestions for additional funding for highway research, safety, transit, and rail activities did not gain congressional support. TEA-21, the largest surface transportation program in U.S. history, continued most highway and transit programs from its predecessor legislation. It included some new funding initiatives, but the majority of funding was reserved for existing programs, particularly the major federal aid highway programs. Highway funding is divided into core programs like NHS, IM, STP, bridgereplacement, and CMAQ, apportioned annually. There is also an \"exempt\" category with guaranteed funding and emergency relief. Allocated programs are controlled by FHWA or other entities. TEA-21 links highway revenues to spending through programs controlled by FHWA or other governmental entities. It includes various programs like federal lands highway, high priority projects, Appalachian roads, minimum guarantee funds, national corridor planning, and border infrastructure. The Act requires an annual evaluation of revenues and spending, with adjustments made based on a formula called Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA). The FHWA requested $641 million for research, development, and technology programs in FY2000, with $370 million for traditional highway programs and $271 million for the National ITS program. Earmarking of funds is a significant issue, with appropriators designating funds for ITS deployment. In FY1999, the entire deployment account was earmarked for specific cities or states. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees earmarked funds for the ITS deployment program in their FY2000 recommendations, with the majority of the deployment account being earmarked in the conference agreement. Many Members and proponents of ITS prefer competitive awarding of deployment funds. The Administration proposed allocating $250 million of RABA funds to supplement the RD&T program, seeking flexibility in allocation according to its priorities. The Administration proposed allocating $250 million of RABA funds to supplement the RD&T program, seeking flexibility in allocation according to its priorities. However, the Senate and the House did not accept the proposal to use RABA funds to increase RD&T activities by 72%. In FY2000, FHWA requested approximately $55.4 million for the motor carrier safety program, with an additional $5.8 million requested later. These funds primarily cover salaries and expenses for staff conducting audits or reviews. In FY2000, funds were allocated for motor carrier safety operations, with debates on the effectiveness of the current program and the need for a new administrative structure. Congressional committees conducted hearings on the U.S. Department of Transportation's truck and bus safety program. The House appropriated about $70.5 million for motor carrier safety operations. The FY2000 DOT Appropriations Act prohibits certain motor carrier safety functions by the FHWA and transfers funds to a new entity, the Office of Motor Carrier Safety. The FHWA budget request includes funds for the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) and other safety initiatives. The MCSAP program provides grants to states for commercial vehicle inspection programs. Funding for MCSAP in FY1999 was $100 million, with differing amounts proposed by the House and Senate for FY2000. The Clinton Administration proposed $6.1 billion for transit in FY2000, with TEA-21 authorizing $6.8 billion, including $5.8 billion guaranteed. Additional funding for transit would come from highway gasoline tax revenues. The reallocation of RABA funds to transit was opposed by highway proponents and APTA. APTA believed additional funds could be found within the discretionary budget category. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 2084 provided FTA with $5.8 billion in total budgetary resources, complying with TEA-21 budgetary firewalls and rejecting additional transit funding. The Senate deadlock occurred over a provision limiting state transit funding to 12.5% of total formula grant transit funding, which was withdrawn due to opposition. The FY2000 Act provided $5.8 billion for FTA, exceeding FY1999 funding by $407 million. In FY2000, FTA programs received funding increases, reaching $5.8 billion, a 7.6% increase from FY1999. DOT cut $17.6 million due to a government-wide rescission, mainly affecting capital investment grants. The Major Capital Investment Program and Urbanized Area Formula Program are the two major transit programs. In FY2000, FTA programs received a funding increase of $5.8 billion, a 7.6% increase from FY1999. The Urbanized Area Formula Program (Section 5307) received $3.05 billion, an 8.9% increase from FY1999, allocated for urbanized area capital and operating needs. These funds are distributed based on a formula process tied to population. In FY1999, FTA programs received increased funding through a formula process based on population and transit service data. Additional funding was allocated to smaller formula and planning programs, including the Nonurbanized Area Formula Program and the Elderly and Persons with Disabilities Program. A new Clean Fuels Formula Grant Program was authorized for purchasing clean fuel vehicles in urbanized areas, with $100 million appropriated in FY1999 and FY2000. Additionally, a Job Access and Reverse Grant Program was established to assist welfare recipients. The Job Access and Reverse Grant Program aims to assist welfare recipients and low-income individuals with transportation to suburban areas for work. The program had an initial funding level of $75 million for FY1999, with a funding request of $150 million for FY2000. However, funding for FY2000 remained at $75 million. With the enactment of TEA-21, operating assistance funding was eliminated for urbanized areas with 200,000 or more population. Preventive maintenance is now allowable under an expanded capital grants formula program. Urbanized areas under 200,000 population, including rural areas, can use formula funds for capital or operating purposes. The Administration proposed funding the FAA with a combination of excise taxes and user fees, increasing the budget to $10.13 billion for FY2000. The focus was on safety initiatives and upgrading air traffic control automation. The FY2000 DOT appropriations bill provided $10.081 billion for the FAA, slightly less than the requested amount. The FY2000 DOT appropriations bill provided $10.081 billion for the FAA, slightly less than the requested amount. The FAA's Operations and Research accounts received increases over FY1999 levels, but lower than the Administration requested. The Airport Improvement Program was funded at the same level as FY1999, while the Facilities and Equipment budget was reduced. The FAA will be funded entirely from the aviation trust fund with no contribution from the general fund for the first time. The FAA's budget for FY2000 is $10.081 billion, funded entirely from the aviation trust fund. The FAA reauthorization legislation, H.R. 1000, failed to pass in the first session of the 106th Congress, affecting the Airport Improvement Program. The Act includes $5.900 billion for FAA operations, a 6% increase from FY1999. The FY2000 FAA budget is $10.081 billion, funded from the aviation trust fund. The increase in FAA operations budget will fund additional field maintenance technicians and air traffic control equipment. The F&E account received $2.075 billion, $10 million less than last year's appropriation. The reduction in operations budget will slow hiring for safety and security positions. The FY2000 FAA budget is $10.081 billion, with the F&E account receiving $2.075 billion, $10 million less than the previous year. Concerns about the FAA's modernization efforts led to cuts in funding for programs like the Wide Area Augmentation System and the Local Area Augmentation System. The agency's poor record in modernizing the air traffic control system and lack of accountability were cited as reasons for the reductions. The FY2000 FAA budget is $10.081 billion, with the F&E account receiving $2.075 billion. Reductions in the F&E account will constrain funding for modernization of the air traffic control system and may increase air travel delays. The RE&D account is provided with $156.495 million, $6 million more than last year but $17 million less than the request. The Airport Improvement Program has a limitation on obligations of $1.95 billion for AIP. The FY2000 Act provides a limitation on obligations of $1.95 billion for AIP, the same as in FY1999. The Administration requested $1.6 billion, but due to budget reductions, the AIP has been on hold since October 1, 1999. Passenger rights issues emerged during Senate debate on H.R. 2084, leading to language in the appropriations Act requiring an investigation into unfair practices by air carriers. Domestic and foreign air carriers are engaging in \"unfair or deceptive practices\" and \"unfair methods of competition\" when selling tickets on overbooked flights or offering different low fares through various channels. The Office of Inspector General (OIG) is required to report on barriers to consumer access to price and service information from independent sources, as well as on air carriers denying travel to consumers with non-refundable tickets. The FY2000 Act also suggests doubling the penalty for involuntary passenger bumping. The Senate version of the FAA reauthorization bill (H.R. 1000) includes consumer protection provisions and budget increases for safety and technology programs in FY2000. The Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) requested $85.8 million for various safety programs, including $38 million for pipeline safety and $18.2 million for hazardous materials transportation safety. RSPA aims to prevent damage to pipelines and increase grants to support state efforts in reducing environmental damage from spills. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 2084 recommended budgetary resources for RSPA of $76.656 million for FY2000, including funding for hazardous materials transportation safety and pipeline safety programs. The House-passed version recommended $82.953 million in new budget authority for RSPA. The conference agreement in P.L. 106-69 provides $67.7 million for RSPA, with specified funding for pipeline safety and hazardous materials transportation safety programs. The NHTSA requested an appropriation of $406 million for FY2000, with $125 million from RABA funds. The Administration proposed using RABA funds for motor vehicle safety activities. Last year, the appropriations committees funded the entire NHTSA account using highway trust fund monies. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended combining $72 million of contract authority with other authorized funds for a total of $161.4 million for operations and research activities in FY2000, which is $38 million less than the Administration's request. The House Appropriations Committee criticized the Administration's proposal to use RABA funds for NHTSA programs, stating it shows a lack of commitment to safety and reliable funding sources. The agency's safety programs, including the \"Buckle Up America\" initiative, are supported by a reliable funding source. The Senate Appropriations Committee has expressed concerns about safety issues such as children getting locked in auto trunks and has directed NHTSA to prepare a report on the frequency of these incidents. Funding for the trunk lid study is not allocated. The report discusses the incentive funds for 0.08 BAC laws, with $80 million in contract authority provided for FY2000. Currently, 16 states qualify for these funds, which are used for behavioral-oriented traffic safety activities. States are encouraged to adopt specified laws through these incentive programs. States prefer incentive programs over \"disincentive\" programs to encourage adoption of specified laws. Total budgetary resources for selected agencies and programs are outlined in Table 5. Sources include FY1999 enacted figures, FY2000 requested figures, and OMB data. Department of Transportation figures may not match other sources. Funding levels for FY2000 are calculated using OMB figures provided by the House Committee on Appropriations. The House Committee on Appropriations used FY1999 enacted figures and FY2000 requested figures to calculate final funding levels. The Coast Guard's budget includes funding from the Department of Defense and emergency supplemental appropriations. An additional $200 million was appropriated for FY2000 as emergency funding. The Office of the Inspector General's figure includes a transfer of $9 million from the FTA administrative category. Surface Transportation Board's budget includes estimated offsetting collections for FY1999 and FY2000. Budget reductions were made for various agencies in FY1999 and estimated for FY2000 due to government-wide rescission. Numbers in the table may differ slightly from the text due to supplemental appropriations and other funding actions. Maritime Administration and Federal Maritime Commission funding details can be found in CRS Report RL30209. The curr_chunk discusses various transportation issues in the 106th Congress, including the Airport Improvement Program, Federal Railroad Safety Program, Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, and Surface Transportation Board Reauthorization. It is coordinated by different authors and provides insights into reauthorization legislation and trust fund issues. The curr_chunk provides information on various transportation reports and resources related to airport finance, automobile air bags, traffic safety provisions, transportation trust funds, and environmental protection provisions. It includes reports from CRS and analysis of the FY2000 Coast Guard budget. Relevant links to Department of Transportation and House Appropriations Committee websites are also mentioned. The curr_chunk contains links to resources related to budget and planning for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Senate Appropriations Committee."
