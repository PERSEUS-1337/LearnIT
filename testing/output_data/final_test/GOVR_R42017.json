    "content": "This report provides Congress with official data on transfers of conventional arms to developing nations by major suppliers from 2003 to 2010, including worldwide transactions. It aims to help Congress identify supplier-purchaser relationships in weapons acquisitions and assess the impact of the international weapons trade on U.S. national interests. Maintaining regional stability and ensuring the security of allies have been key elements of U.S. foreign policy. The report provides Congress with data on arms transfers to developing nations by major suppliers from 2003 to 2010. It helps evaluate the impact of international weapons trade on U.S. national interests and assess supplier-purchaser relationships. The focus is on arms transfers to developing nations, where regional military conflicts are more likely to occur. The arms trade during the Cold War was a tool of foreign policy for the US and Soviet Union. Post-Cold War, US arms transfer policy focuses on assisting friendly nations with regional security threats. Global patterns of arms transfers have evolved in response to changing circumstances in the 21st century. In the 21st century, arms sales are driven by economic considerations rather than foreign policy objectives. Developing nations remain the primary focus of arms sales, accounting for a significant percentage of international agreements and deliveries. The report provides data on arms deliveries to developing nations from 2007 to 2010, accounting for a significant percentage of international agreements. The data in this report supersede previous editions and should be used for accurate information. U.S. commercially licensed arms export delivery values are excluded, as well as arms transfers to subnational groups. The report presents data on arms transfer agreements worldwide in 2010, with the United States leading at $21.3 billion and Russia ranking second at $7.8 billion. This marked a significant decrease from 2009, with total agreements valued at $40.4 billion globally. In 2010, Russia led in international arms transfer agreements with a value of over $29 billion, comprising 72% of all agreements globally. The total value of international arms transfer agreements from 2007-2010 was $239.7 billion, a 15.2% increase from 2003-2006. Developing nations accounted for a significant portion of these agreements, with the United States ranking first in arms deliveries worldwide in 2010. In 2010, the United States led in global arms deliveries for the eighth consecutive year, followed by Russia and Germany. The top three suppliers collectively delivered nearly $20 billion, accounting for 57.1% of all arms delivered worldwide. The total value of international arms deliveries in 2010 was nearly $35 billion, a decrease from the previous year. From 2007 to 2010, developing nations accounted for 55.9% of the total value of arms deliveries worldwide. In 2010, developing nations collectively accounted for 62.6% of international arms deliveries, with a total value of $40.4 billion, a significant decline from the previous year. Despite a decrease in worldwide weapons orders, the United States retained its position as the leading arms supplier with a market share of 52.7% in 2010. In 2010, global arms agreements values declined due to the economic constraints, leading to a decrease in worldwide weapons sales. The United States remained the top arms supplier with a market share of 52.7%, while Russia saw a significant decline in its arms agreements values. The market share of major West European suppliers also fell notably. Many purchasing nations faced budget difficulties, resulting in deferred or limited purchases of new weapons systems. Some nations focused on upgrading existing systems or investing in training and support services. The international recession has negatively impacted the arms marketplace, leading to a decline in new arms sales. Competition among sellers has intensified, with some nations focusing on both traditional and new clients. Despite the reduction in demand for major weapons systems, orders for weapons upgrades and support services remain lucrative for weapons suppliers. Arms suppliers are facing challenges in providing competitive weapons due to declining market demand. Limited defense budgets in developing countries have led suppliers to offer flexible financing options and guarantees in contracts to secure new orders. Competition between European nations, the United States, and consortia is intense, especially with more affluent developing nations. European weapons suppliers are focusing on arms contracts with more affluent developing nations in the Near East and Asia. These nations demand cost offsetting elements, transfer of advanced technology, and provisions for domestic production. This is crucial for European suppliers to support their domestic weapons development programs amidst declining arms orders from other developing countries. Developed nations are limiting arms purchases from other developed nations to protect their national military industrial bases. Joint production of weapons systems with other developed nations is being emphasized by major arms suppliers. Some major arms suppliers are focusing on joint production of weapons systems with developed nations to share costs and preserve capacity. Specialized production capabilities give certain nations advantages in niche weapons categories. Competition for contracts has led to consolidation in defense industries. Developing nations with financial assets continue to launch costly weapons-procurement programs. Oil price increases benefit major oil-producing states in funding arms. The rise in oil prices has benefited major oil-producing states in funding arms purchases, causing economic challenges for oil-consuming states. Despite economic volatility, some nations in the Near East and Asia have resumed large weapons acquisitions, primarily by India, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Developing nations in these regions base their arms purchases on the strength of their economies. In Latin America and Africa, some countries are also seeking to modernize key sectors. In recent years, countries in America and Africa have been modernizing their military forces through large arms orders, despite financial constraints. Limited availability of credit and financing for weapons purchases forces these countries to be selective. Arms transfer agreements with developing nations decreased from $49.8 billion in 2009 to $30.7 billion in 2010. In 2010, arms deliveries to developing nations increased to $21.9 billion from $19.2 billion in 2009, the highest since 2006. The United States and Russia dominated the arms market from 2007 to 2010, making 57.6% of all agreements with developing nations. France was the third-leading supplier during this period, making 5.8% of agreements. From 2007 to 2010, arms transfer agreements with developing nations totaled nearly $11 billion, with the United States ranking first in most years. Russia was a strong competitor, leading in agreements from 2004 to 2006 and ranking second from 2007 to 2009. Russia has been a major source of weaponry for key purchasers in the developing world, with significant arms transfer agreements with India, clients in the Near East, Southeast Asia, and a focus on Venezuela in Latin America. Russia offers flexible payment arrangements, including forgiving debts to secure new arms purchases, and enhances follow-on support services for its weaponry. Russia focuses on enhancing follow-on support services for its weaponry to attract more clients. France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and the United States are major arms suppliers to developing countries, with each having success in specific areas such as long-term supply relationships, specialized weapons systems, naval systems, and aircraft sales. The United States is likely to remain the principal supplier to key developing nations. The United States has a large and diverse base of arms equipment clients globally, with a steady stream of orders from upgrades, spare parts, and support services provided to traditional purchasers. This makes the US a logical supplier for new generation military equipment to developing nations, especially those with the ability to afford major weapons. Arms-supplying nations focus on wealthier developing countries for sales efforts, while transfers to less affluent nations are limited by defense budget constraints. The value of arms transfer agreements with developing nations increased from 2003 to 2008, reaching a peak of $54.6 billion in 2008. Sales to more affluent developing nations, particularly key oil-producing states, drove this increase. Non-major arms suppliers, including China, have also secured agreements with developing nations, although at lower levels compared to major weapons suppliers. During 2003-2010, arms suppliers made significant deals, with most agreements having low values individually. They mainly sold older or less advanced equipment, focusing on small arms and light weapons. The United States' arms transfer agreements with developing nations slightly decreased from $15.1 billion in 2009 to $14.9 billion in 2010. In 2010, the U.S. market share of arms transfer agreements with developing nations increased to 48.6% from 30.3% in 2009, totaling $14.9 billion. This was due to new orders from clients in the Near East and Asia, as well as ongoing contracts globally. The U.S. maintains an advantage in defense support due to established relationships with weapons purchasers worldwide. In 2010, the U.S. secured arms transfer agreements with developing nations totaling $14.9 billion, with key deals including F-35 aircraft for Israel, Blackhawk helicopters for Taiwan, tank support for Saudi Arabia, and missile systems for Egypt and Pakistan. In 2010, the U.S. secured arms transfer agreements with developing nations totaling $14.9 billion. Russia's arms transfer agreements with developing nations in 2010 amounted to $7.6 billion, a decrease from $12.6 billion in 2009. Russia's share of all developing world arms transfer agreements also declined slightly from 25.3% in 2009 to 24.7% in 2010. Russia's arms transfer agreements with developing nations have been significant in the last five years, peaking at $16.1 billion in 2006. From 2007-2010, Russia ranked second among all suppliers to developing countries, with agreements totaling $37.1 billion. This reflects Russia's success in overcoming challenges post the dissolution of the Soviet Union and its adaptation to competition from Western arms suppliers. Russia adapted its selling practices in the developing world to regain and sustain a share in the international arms market. They offer creative financing options and engage in counter-trade, offsets, and licensed production agreements. Successful arms sales have been made in Southeast Asia with countries like Malaysia, Vietnam, Burma, and Indonesia. In Asia, Russia has signed arms agreements with Malaysia, Vietnam, Burma, and Indonesia, as well as major deals with Venezuela and Algeria. Russian military equipment remains competitive in the developing world, offering a range from basic to advanced armaments. Despite the attractiveness of Russia's less expensive weapons to less affluent nations, the lack of funding for new research and development hampers long-term arms sales prospects. Other major arms suppliers have advanced more rapidly in developing weaponry, potentially limiting the expansion of Russia's arms client base. Russia's arms sales programs with India and China have been significant, providing sustained business for a decade. Russia sold combat aircraft and tanks to India in the mid-1990s and continues to support these weapons systems. Sales of advanced weaponry in South Asia by Russia have raised concerns for the United States due to tensions between Pakistan and India. The United States aims to prevent an arms race between Pakistan and India by expanding military cooperation with India. Russia has been selling advanced weapons to China, including fighter aircraft, destroyers, and submarines, to enhance its military capabilities in Asia. This raises concerns for the U.S. in ensuring appropriate military equipment for its allies. The U.S. is focused on providing military equipment to allies in Asia to counter potential threats from China. There have been tensions between Russia and China over Chinese military's use of Russian technology. Russia's significant arms agreements in 2010 were with India for MiG-29K fighters and Algeria for Su-30 MKI fighters. Russia signed arms agreements with India for 29 MiG-29K fighters and with Algeria for 16 Su-30 MKI fighters. China emerged as an arms supplier during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, demonstrating willingness to provide arms to both sides. China's arms sales to developing nations averaged over $1.9 billion annually from 2007 to 2010, with the highest value in 2005. China's arms transfer agreements with developing nations peaked in 2005 and 2007 at $2.8 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. In 2010, the total dropped to $900 million, the lowest since 2003. A significant contract with Pakistan for the J-17 fighter aircraft contributed to China's sales figures, which mainly consist of smaller weapons deals in Asia, Africa, and the Near East. Most Chinese weapons for export are less advanced compared to Western or Russian weaponry. China's arms sales to developing nations have decreased in recent years, with a focus on smaller weapons deals in Asia, Africa, and the Near East. China's weapons systems for export are based on designs obtained from Russia, and they are likely to target states in Asia and Africa for small arms and light weapons, rather than major combat systems. China has also been a significant source of missiles in the developing world arms market, supplying anti-ship missiles to Iran and surface-to-surface missiles to Pakistan. China's arms sales to developing nations have decreased in recent years, focusing on smaller weapons deals in Asia, Africa, and the Near East. Reports suggest that China has sold surface-to-surface missiles to Pakistan, and provided missile technology to North Korea and Iran, potentially increasing their capabilities to threaten other countries. These activities raise concerns about China's commitment to missile transfer restrictions, hindering efforts to prevent proliferation of advanced missile systems in politically tense regions. China's arms sales to African states aim to enhance its international political power and access to natural resources, particularly oil. The United States and the United Nations are concerned about the control of small arms and light weapons sales to conflict regions, with efforts to curtail this trade through an Arms Trade Treaty in 2012. The major West European arms suppliers, including France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy, have provided sophisticated weapons to countries that the United States has chosen not to supply for policy reasons. These NATO allies have generally supported the U.S. in restricting arms sales during the Cold War, but their national defense export policies have shifted in the post-Cold War era. During the post-Cold War era, European arms supplying states, particularly France, prioritize national decision-making in arms sales over coordination with the United States. Economic factors drive French arms sales more than foreign policy considerations. France uses foreign military sales to support the development of its own weapons systems. Policy differences between the US and European states on conventional weapons transfers have increased, exemplified by France and Germany's 2004-2005 push to lift the arms embargo on China. The proposal to lift the arms embargo on China by France and Germany in 2004-2005 was opposed by the United States, leading to tension within the European Union. The arms sales activities of major European suppliers, including France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy, are closely monitored by U.S. policymakers due to their capability to sell advanced military equipment to countries of concern. Between 2009 and 2010, the collective share of arms transfer agreements with developing nations by these European suppliers decreased from 24.5% to 13.3%. In 2010, major European arms suppliers saw a decrease in their share of arms transfer agreements with developing nations, dropping from 24.5% to 13.3%. The total value of arms agreements in 2010 was $4.1 billion, with Italy leading at $1.7 billion. France's agreements decreased to $1.3 billion from $7.9 billion in 2009. The four major West European suppliers collectively held a 13.3% share in 2010, with notable years for individual suppliers in the period from 2003 to 2010. In 2010, major European arms suppliers saw a decrease in their share of arms transfer agreements with developing nations, dropping from 24.5% to 13.3%. The total value of arms agreements in 2010 was $4.1 billion, with Italy leading at $1.7 billion. France's agreements decreased to $1.3 billion from $7.9 billion in 2009. The major West European suppliers have enhanced their competitive position in weapons exports through strong government marketing support for their foreign arms sales. The demand for U.S. weapons in the global arms market has made it challenging for West European suppliers to secure large contracts with developing nations. Despite this, major West European suppliers continue to sign significant arms transfer agreements each year. To maintain their market share, European Union member states adopted a new code of conduct for defense procurement practices in 2005, aiming to foster greater cooperation within the European defense equipment sector. The EU aims to enhance European defense firms' competitiveness in the global arms market by promoting intra-European cooperation in defense program planning and contracting. European arms companies are phasing out certain weapons systems and engaging in joint production ventures to sustain their defense industrial bases. Examples include the Eurofighter and Eurocopter projects. A few European suppliers are cooperating in defense production ventures with the United States, like the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), instead of competing directly. This strategy helps them meet their own advanced combat aircraft needs and positions them to share in profits from future sales. Historically, arms markets in the developing world have been focused in the Near East and Asia, with Latin American and African nations making fewer weapon purchases. United States policymakers prioritize maintaining stability in developing regions through arms sales and transfers that support this goal. The curr_chunk discusses arms suppliers' focus on specific regions and clients, highlighting the differing perspectives on appropriate arms sales. Policymakers can use this data to identify potential concerns and review options. The text then reviews arms-transfer agreement activities in the Near East and Asia. The Near East and Asia have seen a surge in arms acquisitions, driven by events like the Persian Gulf crisis. Key purchasers in the region, such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, have increased their demand for advanced weapons systems due to concerns over Iran's strategic threat. GCC states focus on air, naval, and missile defense systems in their military modernization efforts. In the Near East and Asia, there has been a significant increase in arms acquisitions, driven by events like the Persian Gulf crisis. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have boosted their purchases of advanced weaponry, mainly from the United States. Saudi Arabia was the top arms purchaser in the Persian Gulf region from 2007 to 2010, with total arms agreements valued at $28.9 billion. The UAE also made substantial orders during this period, totaling $15.1 billion in agreements. During 2007-2010, the Near East region led in arms agreements with $91.3 billion, followed by Asia with $59.2 billion. The United States dominated in arms agreements with the Near East during this period, accounting for $51.9 billion. Russia and the United Kingdom also had significant shares in arms agreements with the region. In Asia, Russia has been a major supplier of advanced conventional weaponry to China and India, leading to an increase in the region's overall share of the arms market in the developing world. Russia has also expanded its client base in Asia by securing aircraft orders from Malaysia, Vietnam, Burma, and Indonesia. India, while a principal Russian arms customer, has recently diversified its weapons supplier base by purchasing defense systems from Israel. In 2004, India purchased the Phalcon early warning defense system aircraft from Israel and items from France, including six Scorpene submarines. In 2008, India bought six C130J cargo aircraft from the United States. The United Kingdom sold India 57 Hawk jet trainers in 2010 for $1 billion, and Italy sold 12 AW101 helicopters. This shift in Indian arms purchases suggests that Russia may face new competition in the Indian arms market. Russia was excluded by India in 2011 from a competition to supply new combat fighter aircraft. In contrast, the United States made a multi-billion dollar sale to Pakistan in 2006, including F-16 fighter aircraft and upgrades. In 2006, Pakistan purchased new F-16 fighter aircraft, weapons, and upgrades from the United States, while also acquiring an AWACS aircraft from China in 2008. Additionally, Pakistan bought J-17 and J-10 fighters from China in 2007 and 2009 respectively. In the same period, Taiwan bought 60 UH-60M Blackhawk helicopters from the United States in 2010. The data from 2003 to 2010 shows that Asia and the Near East are major regions for arms sales, with Asia accounting for 33.2% of total arms transfer agreements with developing nations. In the period 2003-2006, Asia was the top region for arms transfer agreements, with Russia leading in value at 36.5%. The United States ranked second. In the later period 2007-2010, Russia continued to lead in Asian agreements, with major sales to India and China. The United States ranked second. Saudi Arabia was the top arms purchaser from 2003 to 2010. Saudi Arabia was the leading arms purchaser from 2003 to 2010, with total agreements of $44.3 billion. India ranked first in the 2003-2006 period at $21.1 billion. Saudi Arabia's agreements increased to $28.9 billion in 2007-2010. These reflect military modernization efforts by both countries since the 1990s. Saudi Arabia accounted for 15.5% of all developing-world arms-transfer agreements from 2003 to 2010. During 2007-2010, India ranked second in arms transfer agreements with $17.4 billion, accounting for 10% of all developing-world agreements. The top 10 recipients collectively made up 66.5% of these agreements, totaling $8.1 billion in 2010. This shows a concentration of major arms purchases among a few countries. In 2010, major arms purchases by developing nations were concentrated among a few countries. India led in arms transfer agreements with $5.8 billion, followed by Taiwan with $2.7 billion and Saudi Arabia with $2.2 billion. India also received the most arms deliveries at $3.6 billion, followed by Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The top 10 recipients accounted for $13 billion, or 59.4% of all arms deliveries to developing nations, with six in the Near East and four in Asia. In the Near East and Asia, the top 10 recipients accounted for 59.4% of all arms deliveries to developing nations. The United States, Russia, and major West European suppliers dominate weapons delivery, but other European and non-European suppliers, including China, also play a significant role. Weapons deliveries to the Near East reflect diverse sources of supply and types of conventional weaponry transferred. From 2007-2010, the United States delivered 339 tanks, 71 APCs, 3 minor surface combatants, 38 supersonic combat aircraft, 35 helicopters, and 397 surface-to-air missiles. Russia delivered 270 tanks, 250 APCs, 40 supersonic combat aircraft, 20 helicopters, 3,850 surface-to-air missiles, 10 surface-to-surface missiles, and 40 anti-ship missiles. China delivered 40 tanks, 160 APCs, while major West European suppliers delivered 100 APCs, 30 minor surface combatants, 20 supersonic combat aircraft, 20 helicopters, 400 surface-to-air missiles, and 50 anti-ship missiles. Other European and non-European suppliers also contributed various weapons. From 2007 to 2010, major combat systems were delivered to the Near East region, including tanks, self-propelled guns, armored vehicles, surface combatants, combat aircraft, helicopters, and missiles. The United States, Russia, and European suppliers were the main contributors of these weapons, with a focus on tanks, self-propelled guns, APCs, armored cars, surface-to-air missiles, helicopters, and anti-ship missiles. These weapons categories are particularly costly and represent a significant portion of the arms trade in the region. During 2007-2010, major combat systems like tanks, self-propelled guns, and naval vessels were delivered to the Near East region by the United States, Russia, and European suppliers. These weapons, including anti-ship missiles, possess significant deadly capabilities and can create security threats in the region. For example, West European suppliers collectively delivered 50 anti-ship missiles, Russia delivered 40, and the United States delivered three minor surface combatants. During 2007-2010, major combat systems were delivered to the Near East region by the United States, Russia, and European suppliers.
