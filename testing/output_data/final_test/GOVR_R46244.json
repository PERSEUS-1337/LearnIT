    "content": "The U.S. Congress directs the EPA to implement the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which mandates a minimum volume of renewable fuel in U.S. transportation fuel. Small refineries can be granted exemptions from the RFS if they prove compliance would cause economic hardship. The debate over small refinery exemptions (SREs) has intensified due to an increase in granted exemptions and exempted fuel volume. Key factors in the discussion include statutory requirements, the EPA's issuance process, and the impact of SREs. The debate over small refinery exemptions (SREs) has intensified due to an increase in granted exemptions and exempted fuel volume. Various perspectives exist on SREs, with some expressing dissatisfaction with the Trump Administration's handling of them. Biofuel organizations argue that SREs have undercut demand for biofuel and created market uncertainty. Others argue that SREs alleviate economic burdens for some refineries and are a symptom of a larger policy problem. This report provides information on Small Refinery Exemptions (SREs) for the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) in a Q&A format, discussing congressional and Executive Branch actions. It covers small refineries, the exemption process, challenges to EPA decisions, recent RFS activity, and the new SRE projection methodology. The report notes that much of the EPA's SRE process is confidential. It also summarizes congressional bills addressing SREs and other considerations related to the topic. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requires U.S. transportation fuel to contain a minimum volume of renewable fuel, with annual volume targets increasing from 12.95 billion gallons in 2010 to 36 billion gallons in 2022. The EPA Administrator has authority to determine volume amounts after 2022, outlined in tables for different fuel categories. Both cellulosic biofuel and biomass-based diesel are subsets of advanced biofuel. The total renewable fuel statutory volume required for each year is the sum of conventional biofuel and advanced biofuel. EPA converts this total volume requirement into a percentage standard for each obligated party to meet. RFS compliance is regulated using a tradable credit system where obligated parties submit renewable identification numbers (RINs) for each gallon in their annual obligation. This obligation, known as the renewable volume obligation (RVO), is calculated based on the obligated party's total gasoline and diesel sales multiplied by the annual renewable fuel percentage standards set by EPA. The EPA has the authority to waive RFS requirements based on certain conditions outlined in the statute. This includes waivers for advanced biofuels like cellulosic biofuel and biomass-based diesel. The statute also allows for modifications to the RFS volumes in 2016 and beyond, known as the RFS \"reset\". A refinery is a facility that converts raw materials into finished products, with a \"small\" refinery defined by its average daily crude oil throughput. Based on the statutory definition, a small refinery for the RFS processes no more than about 3.2 million gallons of crude oil per day or 1 billion gallons per year. There were 53 small refineries operating as of January 1, 2019, out of a total of 132 refineries in the US. Small refineries make up about 40% of the total number of operating refineries and about 12% of the total crude oil distillation capacity in the country. Small refineries, comprising 12% of total crude oil distillation capacity in the US, can be exempt from RFS mandates based on economic hardship. EPA granted temporary exemptions until 2011 and extended exemptions for 21 small refineries for 2011 and 2012 due to disproportionate hardship. Small refineries can be exempt from RFS mandates based on disproportionate economic hardship. The EPA Administrator consults with the Secretary of Energy for a DOE recommendation on the exemption petition. Disproportionate economic hardship must involve high compliance costs relative to the industry average and significant impairment of refinery operations. The DOE developed a scoring matrix to evaluate the impact of disproportionate economic hardship on small refiners, which includes structural impact metrics, economic impact metrics, and viability metrics. Congress addressed this issue in the Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the 2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act, directing the EPA Administrator to recommend a 50 percent waiver of RFS requirements for petitioners experiencing hardship. In the 2017 appropriations bill for EPA, Congress directed EPA to follow DOE's recommendation for a 50 percent waiver of RFS requirements for petitioners facing economic hardship. EPA must notify Congress and DOE if they disagree with the waiver recommendation, as per relevant statutes. Petitions for small refinery exemptions must detail the economic hardship faced in meeting transportation fuel requirements. Companies must demonstrate when they can reasonably achieve compliance. To qualify for a small refinery exemption, companies must submit business plans, financial statements, tax filings, and other records to demonstrate eligibility. EPA considers economic factors like profitability and cash flow when evaluating exemption requests. Submissions are not publicly available. The EPA Administrator must act on a small refinery exemption petition within 90 days of receiving it. Small refineries can apply for exemptions for each compliance year separately. EPA will issue a decision within 90 days of receiving complete information for the request. Beginning in the 2013 compliance year, small refineries can petition the EPA annually for exemptions from their Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) obligations. The RFS sets renewable fuel volume requirements through 2022, which are converted into annual percentage standards by the EPA for obligated parties to meet. Obligated parties calculate their Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) based on their total gasoline and diesel sales multiplied by the annual renewable fuel percentage standards. The RVO determines how many gallons of specific renewable fuel types an obligated party must account for to comply with the RFS. The obligated party submits credits to EPA for each gallon in its RVO to demonstrate compliance with the Renewable Fuel Standard. There are four annual percentage standards for different fuel categories, leading to four RVO calculations. The process involves setting a volume amount for a year, EPA announcing the final volume requirement, and obligated parties meeting their RVOs to blend renewable fuel into the transportation fuel supply. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requires obligated parties, such as refiners and importers, to meet a final volume requirement set by the EPA each year. This requirement can be the statutory volume amount or a reduced volume based on EPA's waiver authority. Obligated parties calculate their Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO) by multiplying the annual percentage standard by their operational sales for a particular fuel category. They then obtain Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) to demonstrate compliance with the RFS. Small refineries may receive exemptions from the mandate, allowing them to be exempt from compliance for a given year. EPA confirms that exempted refineries are not subject to the obligations of an obligated party for fuel produced during the compliance year. Small refineries receiving exemptions are not obligated to meet the requirements of an obligated party for fuel produced during the compliance year. The impact of these exemptions on annual RFS requirements depends on the amount of fuel exempted and when the exemption is granted. EPA may account for exemptions in the annual percentage standard calculation if granted before the final rule is released. If granted after, EPA historically did not revise the calculation. The EPA did not include small refinery exemptions in the 2018 renewable fuel percentage standard calculations, but later granted 31 exemptions for that year, totaling nearly 13.4 billion gallons of gasoline and diesel. This led to concerns from stakeholders as these volumes were not redistributed to other obligated parties, impacting the Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs). The EPA granted 31 small refinery exemptions in 2018, totaling 13.4 billion gallons of fuel. This led to concerns about the impact on Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) as the exempted gallons were not redistributed. The number of exemptions granted each year has varied from 7 to 31 since 2013. EPA has not received any Small Refinery Exemption (SRE) petitions for 2020 yet. EPA is required to adjust the annual percentage standard to account for renewable fuel used by exempt small refineries. In 2010, EPA reported that the amount of renewable fuel used by exempt small refineries would be negligible and assigned it a value of zero. CAA section 211(o) requires the small refinery adjustment to account for this volume of renewable fuel, which may reduce the total volume required of others and potentially lower the percentage standards. However, the expected impact on percentage standards is minimal as the amount of renewable fuel used by exempt small refineries is anticipated to be very small. Any renewable fuels blended by small refineries will be reflected as RINs in the market, eliminating the need for a separate adjustment. In 2010, EPA reported that exempt small refineries using renewable fuel would have a negligible impact and assigned it a value of zero. The RIN trading program accounts for renewable fuel used by exempt small refineries, eliminating the need for separate accounting. Stakeholders argue that the amounts exempted in recent years are not negligible. Some stakeholders argue that reallocating exempted volumes could increase total renewable fuel consumption, while others believe it would create an unlevel playing field among refineries. The number of small refinery exemptions granted has changed in recent years, prompting EPA to issue a final rule in December 2019 to adjust the annual percentage standard calculation. In the final rule, EPA adopted a new projection methodology for renewable volume obligations based on exempted volumes from small refineries. This modification leads to higher percentage standards for gasoline and diesel production. EPA made changes to the annual percentage standard calculation to reflect this adjustment. The EPA's new calculation modification results in higher percentage standards to ensure renewable fuel volumes are met when small refineries receive exemptions. The agency plans to issue a single set of standards without periodic revisions, based on projected exempted volumes. Additionally, the EPA intends to grant relief in line with DOE recommendations for petitions starting from 2019. Legal challenges have arisen regarding exemptions granted to small refineries. Legal challenges have arisen regarding small refinery exemptions, with refineries challenging EPA's denial of exemption petitions and methodology for granting exemptions. Courts have generally dismissed methodological challenges on procedural grounds, while individual challenges to exemption denials have had some success. Refineries have specifically challenged EPA's adoption of DOE's scoring index and its independent analysis for granting exemptions. Courts have generally upheld EPA's adoption of the DOE's scoring matrix for small refinery exemptions, focusing on viability metrics to demonstrate \"disproportionate economic hardship.\" However, the Tenth Circuit ruled that EPA cannot give excessive weight to viability, as it could undermine the statutory requirement of \"disproportionate\" economic hardship. EPA has been allowed to rely on DOE's assessments but has faced challenges regarding the interpretation of hardship criteria. Courts have upheld EPA's use of DOE's assessments for small refinery exemptions but have invalidated exemption denials for errors in refinery-specific analyses. Challenges have arisen when EPA blindly adopts DOE's conclusions or relies on flawed reports. Biofuels associations challenged EPA's decision to grant three small refinery exemption petitions, leading to the Tenth Circuit vacating EPA's decisions for three reasons. The Tenth Circuit vacated EPA's decisions on small refinery exemption petitions for three reasons: requiring annual receipt of the exemption, limiting economic hardship to RFS compliance, and considering the ability of refineries to pass on RIN costs to consumers. The court found EPA's failure to address how refineries pass on RIN costs to consumers in small refinery exemption cases arbitrary and capricious. Challenges to EPA's administration of small refinery exemptions have been dismissed or transferred without reaching the merits of the arguments. PRUITT challenged EPA's decision to issue 2018 RINs to two Wyoming refineries whose exemption petitions were granted after a court vacated EPA's initial denials in 2017. EPA issued the 2018 RINs to compensate for the retired 2014 and 2015 RINs used for compliance before the exemptions were granted. Litigation is ongoing regarding EPA's interpretation of small refinery exemptions. The National Biodiesel Board challenged EPA's accounting for exemptions in the 2018 rulemaking, arguing that EPA does not adjust annual standards for exemptions granted after they are set, which violates the statute. EPA's ability to grant exemptions after setting annual standards was not challenged in court. The National Biodiesel Board challenged EPA's accounting for exemptions in the 2018 rulemaking, arguing that EPA does not adjust annual standards for exemptions granted after they are set, which violates the statute. The D.C. Circuit held that NBB had not preserved this challenge to the 2018 rule because it had failed to raise the argument with \"reasonable specificity\" during the public comment period, as the Clean Air Act requires. The D.C. Circuit held that the National Biodiesel Board forfeited the issue of adjusting volumes for retroactive exemptions in the 2018 rulemaking. The American Biofuels Association challenged EPA's decision to modify criteria for granting small refinery exemptions based on media reports of increased exemptions. EPA later issued a formal memorandum with revised standards for granting small refinery exemptions. EPA now only requires small refineries to show disproportionate impacts or viability impairment for exemption, not both as before. Full waivers may be granted when DOE recommends partial waivers. D.C. Circuit dismissed a petition by American Biofuels Association due to lack of jurisdiction. EPA's August 2019 Memorandum is considered a final agency action. Some members of the 116th Congress have introduced bills addressing small refinery exemptions. Some members in the 116th Congress have introduced bills addressing small refinery exemptions, with debates on EPA's authority and transparency in the exemption process. EPA's lack of transparency in evaluating small refinery exemption applications and inconsistent criteria raise concerns for Congress to oversee the process effectively. EPA does not regularly announce when exemptions are issued, citing confidentiality of business information. This opacity makes it challenging for Congress to monitor EPA's authority in granting exemptions. Small refinery exemptions can be requested at any time from the EPA. Once granted, the refinery may not need to meet its Renewable Volume Obligation for that year. However, timing issues may prevent immediate benefit, leading to the use of retired RINs for compliance in future years. The process for submitting a complete petition to the EPA is unclear, contributing to a lengthy decision timeline. The EPA adjusts annual volume requirements based on small refinery exemptions, which can be requested at any time. The agency accounts for exempt refinery volumes in its calculations through the RIN trading program. EPA addresses SREs before and after issuing a final rule, adjusting calculations accordingly. The EPA adjusts annual volume requirements based on small refinery exemptions, accounting for exempt refinery volumes in its calculations through the RIN trading program. EPA does not reflect exemptions granted after the final rule is released in the percentage standards for gasoline and diesel produced or imported in 2019. EPA justifies this policy based on the statutory deadline for setting annual percentage standards and the need to provide certainty to the regulated community. Most or all SREs have been granted after the November 30 deadline. In 2019, EPA changed how it calculates the annual percentage standard to account for exempted volumes of gasoline and diesel. The Trump Administration has approved more small refinery exemptions than the Obama Administration. Congress may need to address the issue of agency discretion in granting these exemptions. The EPA Administrator may modify the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) volumes starting in 2016 due to a \"reset\" triggered for renewable fuel, advanced biofuel, and cellulosic biofuel. It is uncertain how or when the reset will be implemented, and Congress may need to consider its impact on the RFS, including small refinery exemptions. The RFS is a volume mandate, not tied to U.S. gasoline consumption rates, with most vehicles capable of handling E10 fuel. The EPA has the authority to adjust Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) volumes to align with actual gasoline consumption trends. If the RFS cannot adapt to changes in gasoline consumption, meeting renewable fuel targets may become more challenging. The RFS renewable fuel targets may become harder to achieve, leading to concerns about compliance and potential exemptions for small refineries. Congress may need to address market conditions versus projections for renewable fuel use."
