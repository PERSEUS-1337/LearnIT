    "content": "Discretionary spending covers routine activities of federal government agencies, including wages, grants, equipment purchases, and contractor services. Congress controls discretionary funding through annual appropriations acts, granting legal authority for obligations. Outlays are payments made by the U.S. Treasury to fulfill these obligations. This report focuses on trends in outlays. The report discusses the distinction between outlays and budget authority in the federal budget. Budget authority is provided by appropriations legislation for specific programs, while outlays are the disbursed federal funds. Budget authority is like funds deposited into a checking account for federal purposes, while outlays are the actual payments made by the U.S. Treasury. Outlays are disbursed federal funds used for specified federal purposes, recorded when the U.S. Treasury pays for goods, services, employee salaries, benefits, or interest. Outlays lag behind budget authority as agencies may not spend all funds in the year available. Budget analysis focuses on budget authority controlled by Congress, while outlay data assess macroeconomic effects. Federal spending categories include discretionary spending, mandatory spending, and net interest costs. Discretionary spending in FY2014 was $1.17 trillion, mandatory spending was $2.11 trillion, and net interest costs were about $230 billion. Mandatory spending, also known as direct spending, funds entitlement programs like SNAP and other programs controlled by laws other than appropriation acts. Spending levels for mandatory programs depend on eligibility criteria, population size, and participation rates, set up in diverse ways reflecting historical influences and legislative authorities. Mandatory spending funds entitlement programs like SNAP, while discretionary spending supports activities like Medicare health care benefits. Congress allocates discretionary funds annually, while mandatory programs like Social Security are funded separately. The federal budget divides spending into mandatory and discretionary categories, with policy disagreements influencing trends in discretionary spending. Fiscal policy can stimulate economic activity by balancing spending and revenues. Discretionary spending, controlled annually, is more flexible than mandatory spending. Some features of mandatory programs have often been changed to respond to economic conditions, such as eligibility for unemployment insurance benefits during recessions. Tax policy changes are also used to address macroeconomic conditions. Automatic stabilizers help dampen economic shocks by adjusting government outlays and revenues. Balancing short-term economic recovery with long-term fiscal sustainability is challenging, with calls for a package of policies to address both. The financial crisis of 2007 and subsequent recession have influenced current fiscal policy debates. Some policymakers advocate for short-term fiscal stimulus linked with long-term fiscal sustainability measures, while others argue for a return to pre-crisis spending levels. There is a debate on whether the federal government should take immediate action to address the spending-receipts gap or wait. The debate among economists centers on whether to close the spending-receipts gap immediately or wait for a more robust economy. In response to the 2009 recession, Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which included significant discretionary spending on various initiatives like education, state support, infrastructure, and healthcare. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) in 2009 included significant discretionary spending on initiatives like education, state support, infrastructure, and healthcare. The total budgetary effect of ARRA was estimated at $831 billion between 2009 and 2019. The economic recovery following the 2007-2009 financial crisis has been slow, with debates among economists on whether to pursue expansionary fiscal policies to address high unemployment levels. Some advocate for fiscal restraint to tackle longer-term fiscal challenges. The 2012 IMF survey suggests that active fiscal policy can stimulate economic growth when resources are underutilized and monetary policy tools are limited by low interest rates. The U.S. economy is projected to have slightly faster growth in 2014 compared to 2013, with expectations for even faster growth in 2015. Recovery from the 2007-2009 recession remains slower than previous downturns, with risks to economic recovery from the Eurozone and decelerating growth in countries like China. Discretionary spending trends have been controlled by statutory limits. The Budget Control Act of 2011 has set limits on discretionary spending, shaping future trends. These limits are projected to bring discretionary spending to levels below those seen in recent decades. Base defense spending is expected to revert to slightly above its FY2007 level, while non-defense discretionary spending will revert to a level near its 2002 level. The BCA aims to save about $900 billion over the next decade relative to a pre-BCA baseline. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established the \"Super Committee\" to achieve additional savings of $1.2 trillion. The committee failed to reach an agreement, triggering backup enforcement mechanisms to reduce spending. The original BCA caps were replaced by revised caps. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established revised caps on defense and non-defense spending, with further reductions of $109 billion each year from FY2013 through FY2021. Sequestration in FY2013 included pro-rata cuts to discretionary budget authority and Medicare, with most mandatory spending exempt. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set spending caps for discretionary programs, with flexibility for Congress to adjust within those limits. A continuing resolution in FY2013 funded the government at 0.612% above FY2012 levels, with exceptions for defense and disaster relief. Base budget discretionary defense funding was scored at $557 billion. The American Taxpayer Relief Act delayed the sequester triggered by the absence of a Super Committee plan, reducing the FY2013 sequestration cuts from $109 billion to $85 billion, divided equally between defense and non-defense spending. The sequester reductions in defense and non-defense spending were offset by lowering discretionary spending limits for FY2013 and FY2014. ATRA delayed cap enforcement sequester to March 27, 2013, and modified it to apply to security/non-security categories. The discretionary spending limits for FY2013 were modified by ATRA to apply to security/non-security categories instead of defense/non-defense. This change may have shifted the allocation of spending reductions, with security programs facing larger cuts due to the broader category. The cap enforcement sequester would have reduced spending within security programs more than non-security programs. The Budget Control Act (BCA) cap levels were exceeded by defense programs, leading to potential cuts in security and non-security spending. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) postponed sequestration and implemented a less restrictive fiscal policy by extending tax provisions and unemployment benefits. The \"fiscal cliff\" could have significantly reduced the federal deficit but also risked a recession in 2013. Concerns were raised about the consequences of BCA's sequestration measures on federal programs and fiscal policy. The Budget Control Act (BCA) discretionary caps led to defense and non-defense cuts, sparking concerns among Members. Various proposals were made to delay, replace, or modify sequestration, including the Reducing Flight Delays Act of 2013. The House-passed FY2013 budget resolution called for canceling the January 2013 sequester, contingent on achieving savings in domestic programs through reconciliation procedures. Numerous measures were introduced in both the 112th and 113th Congresses to address the BCA sequester. The President's FY2013 budget request adhered to the BCA caps but proposed canceling the January 2013 sequester. President Obama suggested avoiding sequestration through tax increases and targeted spending cuts. In March 2013, a sequester order was signed, cutting $85 billion split between defense and non-defense categories. Defense reductions were mainly from discretionary programs, with Military Personnel accounts exempted. The sequester in FY2013 exempted Military Personnel accounts but required larger reductions in other defense accounts. Non-exempt defense discretionary accounts were reduced by 7.8%, totaling $42.6 billion. War funding was not subject to BCA caps but was not exempt from sequestration. Defense Department protected war funding by finding other cuts. Non-defense discretionary program funding was reduced by 5.0%, totaling $25.8 billion. Non-defense mandatory programs absorbed the remainder of the reductions. In FY2013, the sequester resulted in reductions in Medicare patient care and other non-exempt mandatory programs, yielding budgetary savings. The Super Committee sequester led to a decrease in federal outlays, with a lag in implementing spending reductions. The BCA sequester was estimated to reduce FY2013 outlays by $42 billion. On March 6, 2013, the House passed a measure (H.R. 933) to fund the government for the remainder of FY2013. The House passed H.R. 933 to fund the government for FY2013 by a 267-151 vote, with detailed appropriations for Defense and Military Construction-Veterans' programs. A substitute measure was posted on the Senate Committee on Appropriations website on March 11, 2013, matching the defense provisions of H.R. 933. Both bills conformed with discretionary spending caps and avoided further sequester reductions. The Senate passed an amended version of H.R. 933 by a 73-26 vote on March 20, 2013, which included changes in spending levels for various programs. The House agreed to Senate changes the next day on a 318-109 vote, and the President signed the measure (P.L. 113-6) on March 26, 2013. The Obama Administration's FY2014 budget submission was delayed due to changes enacted by ATRA and the JSC sequester. The budget proposed modifications to BCA caps on discretionary spending, setting FY2014 spending limits at higher levels for defense and non-defense. The Administration also proposed lowering spending limits for FY2013-FY2021 and extending discretionary caps to FY2022 and FY2023. The Obama Administration's FY2014 budget proposed modifications to BCA caps on discretionary spending, setting higher levels for defense and non-defense. Discretionary caps would have been extended to FY2022 and FY2023, with estimated reductions of $202 billion over FY2014-FY2023. The budget plan included $260 billion in unspecified reductions in discretionary spending, mostly for FY2015 through FY2023. The House and Senate responded differently to the budgetary challenges presented by BCA caps during the FY2014 budget cycle. The House and Senate had differing totals for FY2014 discretionary spending, leading to a $90 billion gap. The House set suballocations slightly above BCA lowered caps levels, while the Senate indicated a total consistent with BCA revised caps. The differences resulted in a federal shutdown, which was resolved by a continuing resolution passed on October 16, 2013. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (BBA; H.J.Res. 59; P.L. 113-67) provided funding on an annualized basis of $986.3 billion before adjustments. It set discretionary defense spending caps at $520.464 billion for FY2014 and $521.272 billion for FY2015, with non-defense caps at $491.773 billion for FY2014 and $492.356 billion for FY2015. The mechanism for reducing the revised BCA caps to lowered caps levels was turned off for both FY2014 and FY2015. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (BBA) modified defense and non-defense spending limits for FY2014 and FY2015, increasing levels by $22.4 billion and $9 billion respectively. It extended sequestration for non-exempt mandatory accounts for FY2022 and FY2023, included provisions to reduce improper federal payments, alter federal oil and gas programs, raise transportation fees, and modify funding for federally guaranteed student loans. Additionally, the BBA required higher retirement contributions for new Civil Service and Foreign Service employees and specified a 1% reduction in the cost-of-living adjustment for certain working-age military retirees. The House passed a measure (S. 25; P.L. 113-82) excluding cost-of-living adjustment for Armed Forces before Jan 1, 2014. The Senate agreed on a 95-3 vote, and the President signed it into law on Feb 15, 2014. The measure extended non-defense mandatory sequestration to FY2024. The House and Senate agreed on funding for FY2014 on Jan 13, 2014. The resulting measure (Senate Amendment to H.R. 3547) was accepted by the House on Jan 14, 2014, and by the Senate on Jan 15, 2014. The President signed the measure (P.L. 113-76) on Jan 17, 2014. The Bipartisan Budget Act (P.L. 113-67; Sections 115 and 116) allows for budgetary enforcement if no budget resolution is agreed upon by April 15, 2014. The Budget Committee chairs would then submit budget information after April 15 but before May 15, 2014. The Congressional Budget Office released updated economic and budget projections through FY2024 on February 4, 2014. Discretionary spending as a share of GDP is projected to decrease by 20% over the next decade. The Obama Administration's FY2015 budget proposal was delayed due to late FY2014 appropriations. Agencies were instructed to plan for a 5% reduction in net discretionary funding. The Obama Administration's FY2015 budget proposal aimed to comply with BCA caps on discretionary spending, with an additional $56 billion in funding through the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative for defense and non-defense priorities such as research, clean energy, education, and homelessness mitigation. The Obama Administration proposed $28 billion in program reductions and tax benefit cuts to fund initiatives in energy, education, and homelessness. A $65.8 billion war funding request was submitted to Congress to replace placeholder amounts. House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan released a budget resolution conforming to BCA caps for FY2015 discretionary funding. Defense spending levels would exceed caps in future years, while non-defense spending would be below caps. The House Budget Committee reported a budget resolution (H.Con.Res. 96) on April 4, 2014, which was approved by the House with a 219-205 vote on April 10, 2014. The Senate relied on provisions of the Bipartisan Budget Act for FY2015 budget consideration, with budget totals framing appropriation levels. By mid-July 2014, the House had passed 7 of 12 appropriations bills and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees had reported 8 of 12. The House passed a continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 124) on September 17, 2014, to fund the government until December 11, 2014. The Senate approved the measure the next day, and President Obama signed it into law on September 19, 2014. The resolution provides funding at nearly the same rate as FY2014, except where specified. The FY2015 funding levels provided an across-the-board reduction of 0.0554%, totaling $571 million in budget authority. Table 3 summarizes discretionary funding and modifications of statutory caps on defense and non-defense funding from FY2013 through FY2021. Levels are shown in terms of scored budget authority excluding war, disaster, program integrity, and emergency funding. The Bipartisan agreement in December 2013 enacted modifications of the defense and non-defense caps. The Bipartisan Budget Act of December 2013 modified defense and non-defense caps, turning off the cap-lowering mechanism for FY2014 and FY2015. Discretionary spending has decreased while mandatory spending has increased since the 1960s, with discretionary spending comprising only 33% of total outlays in FY2014. Net interest costs are projected to rise sharply to 14% of federal outlays in FY2024 as interest rates increase and the federal debt grows. Discretionary spending as a share of GDP has decreased, with total federal outlays peaking in FY2009 due to economic conditions and federal interventions. GDP peaked in FY2009 due to the economic situation and federal interventions. Discretionary outlays declined as a percentage of total outlays in FY2009 but rose as a percentage of GDP. Discretionary spending has been falling since 2010, both in dollar terms and as a percentage of GDP. If caps on discretionary spending remain, it will continue to decrease as a share of GDP. CBO projects discretionary spending to fall to 5.2% of GDP by FY2024, 16% lower than its minimum share in the 1990s. The decline in discretionary spending may make it harder for Congress to control the federal budget. The federal budget may become more difficult for Congress as discretionary defense and non-defense outlays each make up about one-seventh of the budget. With mandatory spending and interest payments set automatically, less money is available for other government agencies unless revenues increase or eligibility requirements for mandatory programs are modified. Discretionary funding is easier to target for spending restrictions, while changes to mandatory programs like Social Security and Medicare could disrupt financial plans for retirees. The rising costs of mandatory programs like Social Security and Medicare, driven by the retirement of the baby-boom generation, pose challenges for reducing funding. The trajectory of federal spending on healthcare is unsustainable and could burden future generations. Discretionary spending, divided into defense and non-defense programs, reflects national priorities and plays a role in budget enforcement mechanisms. Discretionary spending is divided into defense and non-defense programs, with separate limits set by the Budget Control Act. Defense spending includes base budget and war funding, while non-defense spending is for everything else. Trends in discretionary defense and non-defense budget authority since FY1977 are shown in Figure 3, with projections conforming to BCA caps. ATRA and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2014 reduced spending constraints for FY2013 and FY2014. Spending trends can also be measured as a share of GDP, reflecting federal spending compared to the economy's size (Figure 4). The text discusses trends in defense and non-defense discretionary budget authority as a percentage of GDP from 1976-2019. It highlights how population changes can impact federal spending, depending on scale economies in governmental services. For some services, an increase in population may not necessarily raise costs, such as information-generating activities like research and national defense. The Reagan Administration aimed to increase defense spending while reducing other expenditures. The Reagan Administration, upon taking office in 1981, focused on increasing defense spending and cutting domestic program expenditures. Budget enforcement measures were implemented in the mid-1980s to control federal deficits, including the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit control legislation in 1985 and the Budget Enforcement Act in 1990. These measures aimed to constrain federal spending, increase revenues, and reduce deficits. However, after the September 11 attacks and the expiration of spending caps in FY2002, both defense and non-defense discretionary spending increased in real terms. Defense spending in real terms has fluctuated over the years in response to national security challenges and policy changes. It increased during the Vietnam War in the 1960s, decreased after troop withdrawals in 1969, grew modestly during d\u00e9tente with the Soviet Union in the 1970s, and surged again after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. Concerns about deficits in the mid-1980s led to constraints on defense spending, which declined after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, defense spending declined. Costs of the first Iraq War (1990-1991) were shared by U.S. coalition partners. Defense spending rose sharply after the September 11, 2001 attacks, with increases in non-war funding. The Iraq War in 2003 led to higher defense spending. War costs have decreased since the drawdown of troops in 2007 and the withdrawal of combat troops from Iraq in 2011. Further reductions in war costs are expected as troops are withdrawn from Afghanistan. Major procurement programs and changes in budget enforcement mechanisms could impact defense spending trends. Defense investment trends have historically been influenced by changes in funding for modernization of weapon systems and RDT&E on new systems. Peaks in investment often follow periods of high support for defense spending, like during wartime or the early 1980s, before declining when support wanes. Base defense spending over the past decade may not fully capture the growth in defense costs, as it excludes around $300 billion in war-related investment. Wartime operating costs, such as personnel training and support, do not contribute to modernization. Discretionary defense spending as a share of GDP has been smaller in recent years compared to past wars like World War II, the Korean War, or the Vietnam War. Defense spending has varied over the years, with peaks during wartime and periods of high support. In recent years, discretionary defense outlays have increased to 4.7% of GDP in 2011, with 53% of the increase going towards war funding. This rise followed a decline in the 1970s, a rapid increase after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and a subsequent fall after the dissolution of the USSR in 1991. Defense spending increased significantly from 2000-2010, with 53% of the rise in discretionary outlays attributed to increased defense spending. In FY2012 and FY2013, defense outlays as a share of GDP decreased due to troop withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan. President Obama announced troop withdrawals from Afghanistan, with agreements signed for counterterrorism and training operations. The Obama Administration requested $12.8 billion for defense operations. The Obama Administration requested $12.8 billion in supplemental appropriations on November 10, 2014, for operations in Iraq and Syria against ISIL. The appropriate size of the defense budget has been a topic of debate, with some calling for a minimum of 4% of GDP for defense spending. There are concerns about the sustainability of current defense budget plans, while others argue that defense expenditures as a proportion of GDP should decrease over time. Geopolitical challenges, wars, and changes in national spending priorities have influenced past swings in defense spending. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Leon Panetta have raised concerns about cost-cutting measures within the Department of Defense (DOD) and the effects of the Budget Control Act on defense spending. The Act aimed to bring discretionary base defense spending back to its FY2007 level, with adjustments made in the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. DOD leaders issued budget guidance in early 2013 to address uncertainties from sequestration and the FY2013 continuing resolution. The DOD budget guidance includes protection of war operations and new strategic priorities, reduction of administrative costs, and deferral of less critical maintenance. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel proposed troop reductions and force structure changes in 2014. The FY2015 budget includes an additional $28 billion for security funding, focusing on weapon modernization and readiness enhancements. Non-defense discretionary spending has typically ranged between 3% and 4% of GDP in recent decades, with fluctuations over the years. In 2010, it rose to 4.6% of GDP, reflecting a decline in GDP. Non-defense discretionary spending rose to 4.6% of GDP in 2010 due to the economic recession and policy responses like the ARRA. It has since declined in real terms and is projected to fall to 2.7% in 2023. The Obama Administration's FY2015 budget proposed additional funding for non-defense initiatives including education, research support, manufacturing institutes, and neighborhood revitalization. In the past decade, international spending (budget function 150) has been strongly affected by wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, reaching its peak of 0.5% of GDP in 1975. Between 2001 and 2010, spending on international programs rose from 0.2% of GDP to 0.3% of GDP, with funding mainly allocated to diplomatic missions, foreign aid, and international finance. The future of international funding may hinge on the evolving role of the United States in Iraq, Afghanistan, and neighboring countries. President Obama planned to withdraw most U.S. troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2014. Security and non-security spending categories have been crucial in federal budgeting since September 2011, with various ways of dividing them used by the Bush and Obama Administrations to communicate budget priorities. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established security and non-security spending categories to prevent shifts between the two. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 changed the caps to security/non-security from defense/non-defense, creating challenges in dividing spending. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established security and non-security spending categories to prevent shifts between the two. The definition of security spending includes Department of Defense-Military, National Nuclear Security Administration, International Affairs, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Intelligence Community Management Account. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established security and non-security spending categories to prevent shifts between the two. Security spending includes Department of Defense, National Nuclear Security Administration, International Affairs, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Intelligence Community Management Account. The Obama Administration includes all Department of Homeland Security funding in its security classification, while the Bush Administration's definition was more limited. Homeland security spending is primarily allocated to the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, and Department of Energy. Other federal agencies also contribute to homeland security tasks, even if it is not their main focus. Some programs, like Coast Guard patrols and research at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, serve both security and non-security objectives. This complexity makes budget analysis of homeland security challenging. The President's budget submission must report homeland security spending, which is defined narrowly to exclude some DOD activities not closely tied to security concerns. OMB's security spending estimates are based on reports from 32 agencies with homeland security responsibilities, providing detailed budget information. Discretionary spending trends are shown in figures for defense, non-defense security, and non-security categories in terms of budget authority and outlays. Changes in outlays tend to be more gradual compared to budget authority, as they can stretch over several years. Non-defense security spending trends can be analyzed to show how its components have evolved over time, with spikes in spending following events like Hurricane Katrina and the September 11 attacks. International program spending decreased in the 1980s and 1990s but rose sharply after 2001, while spending on federal operations within DHS also increased significantly. The costs of discretionary veterans' programs have risen rapidly in the past decade, driven by the aging of Korean War and Vietnam War era veterans. Only a small part of the increase in VA discretionary costs is due to treating veterans from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Federal activities are classified among budget functions, providing a detailed view of how federal spending has evolved. Spending in some policy areas has grown slowly or been cut, while spending in war costs, veterans' programs, international affairs, and Medicare administration has increased. Security-related non-defense spending, including war costs, veterans' programs, international affairs, and Medicare administration, has expanded rapidly in the last decade. This trend could displace funding for other non-defense programs unless restrained or reversed. Discretionary spending, which funds federal agency operations, has been a focal point for efforts to restrain federal spending. Mandatory programs, driven by baby-boom demographics and healthcare costs, are tilting federal spending. Discretionary spending is projected to shrink to 23% of federal outlays by FY2024, with projected spending at $1.4 trillion. Federal deficits are projected to rise each year after FY2015, reaching $1.1 trillion in FY2024. Closing the gap between federal spending and receipts through reductions in discretionary spending may be difficult due to the shift towards mandatory spending. This shift raises concerns as making adjustments in spending levels may become more challenging with the shrinking portion of the federal budget controlled on a year-by-year basis. Mandatory spending requires changes in authorizing legislation and is not normally considered annually. Existing budget enforcement mechanisms are largely designed to constrain discretionary spending. The rise of mandatory programs' share of federal spending reflects an aging population, leading to challenges in reducing mandatory spending. Policy makers may need to adjust the federal budget structure to meet the needs of retired Americans, impacting intergenerational equity and future government responsiveness. National Defense and Non-Defense spending data is shown in Table A-1, excluding funding for Iraq and Afghan wars."
