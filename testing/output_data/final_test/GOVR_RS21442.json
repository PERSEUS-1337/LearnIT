    "content": "President George W. Bush announced a $720 million R&D initiative to promote hydrogen as a transportation fuel in his 2003 State of the Union Address. The Hydrogen Fuel Initiative complements the FreedomCAR initiative, focusing on hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. Funding for research at the Department of Energy remained constant for both initiatives. Funding for research into hydrogen fuel, fuel cells, and vehicle technologies increased by about 30% for FY2004 within the Department of Energy. Funding steadily increased from FY2005 to FY2008, but for FY2009, the Bush Administration requested a 30% decrease in funding for these programs. This decrease would be offset by an increase in basic science research funding. Overall, the request is roughly 4% below FY2008 levels for all related research. The DOE oversees research on hydrogen fuel and fuel cell vehicles through two offices: the Office of FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies (FCVT) and the Office of Hydrogen, Fuel Cells and Infrastructure Technologies (HFCIT). Funding for this research increased from FY2004 to FY2008 but faced a 30% decrease in FY2009. Additional research funding comes from the Office of Fossil Energy (FE), the Office of Nuclear Energy (NE), and the Office of Science (SC). The DOE oversees research on hydrogen fuel and fuel cell vehicles through the Office of FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies (FCVT) and the Office of Hydrogen, Fuel Cells and Infrastructure Technologies (HFCIT). Funding for this research comes from various sources including the federal government, national laboratories, universities, state governments, vehicle manufacturers, energy companies, and industry groups. The Hydrogen Fuel Initiative focuses on researching, developing, and validating fuel cells and hydrogen production, delivery, and storage technologies for transportation and stationary applications. Fuel cell R&D areas include transportation systems, stationary systems, fuel processing, fuel cell components, and technology validation. The focus of hydrogen fuel R&D includes production, delivery, storage, infrastructure, safety, codes, standards, and education. The FreedomCAR and Hydrogen Fuel Initiatives have set goals for 2015, including developing efficient hydrogen-fueled engine systems at competitive costs. FreedomCAR aims to reduce system costs for various technologies, develop electric drive systems with a 15-year life, advanced internal combustion engine systems, electrical energy storage, and materials. The Hydrogen Fuel Initiative aims to improve fuel cell technology, storage, and delivery of hydrogen fuel. Goals include developing durable and efficient hydrogen fuel cell power systems, transportation fuel cell systems meeting emissions standards, efficient hydrogen refueling systems, and improved on-board hydrogen storage systems. This initiative complements the FreedomCAR program's focus on reducing system costs and developing advanced technologies for electric drive systems and energy storage. The creation of FreedomCAR and the President's Hydrogen Fuel Initiatives have sparked debate over the government's role in R&D, funding levels, energy efficiency, and fuel consumption. Environmental groups like the Sierra Club criticize the initiatives for not mandating auto manufacturers to offer fuel cell vehicles by a specific deadline. The Natural Resources Defense Council argues that the initiatives aim to avoid raising national fuel economy standards. However, in 2007, Congress passed stricter fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks. Higher R&D funding is expected to drive advancements in technology. The Administration argues that increased R&D funding for hydrogen and fuel cell technologies is necessary for advancements and affordability for consumers. Some engineers doubt the feasibility of FreedomCAR's efficiency and cost goals within the program's timeframe. Industry groups fear that setting explicit sales goals could hinder R&D on other technologies like hybrids. Supporters criticize the under-funding of FreedomCAR and the President's Hydrogen Fuel Initiative, calling for more government commitments in the form of increased R&D funding and expanded demonstration programs. The Administration calls for increased R&D funding for hydrogen and fuel cell technologies to make them more attractive to customers. Critics argue there are technical and economic hurdles to developing affordable hydrogen technology for automobiles. Other government agencies, like the National Automotive Center, are also involved in fuel cell vehicle research. The Administration's goal was a funding increase of $720 million for FreedomCAR and the President's Hydrogen Fuel Initiative between FY2004 and FY2008. Congress appropriated an additional $600 million for hydrogen, fuel cell, and advanced vehicle programs, with $145 million for other programs. President Bush signed the Energy Policy Act of 2005, authorizing higher levels of appropriations for hydrogen and fuel cell research. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorized $3.3 billion over five years for hydrogen and fuel cell research, along with tax incentives for fuel cell vehicles. Key issues for Congress include affordability, technology selection, and setting deadlines for commercialization. The government is debating whether to focus on long-term research or technologies closer to commercialization in the hydrogen and fuel cell industry. Concerns include affordability, technology selection, and the feasibility of widespread use."
