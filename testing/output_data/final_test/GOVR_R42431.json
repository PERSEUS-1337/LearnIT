Over 40 provisions in ACA require or permit the issuance of rules for implementation. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) delegates rulemaking authority to federal agencies for various provisions, including Medicaid expansion, Medicare amendments, individual health insurance mandate, and insurance exchanges with federal subsidies. Over 40 provisions in ACA require or permit the issuance of rules for implementation, which will have a major impact on how the legislation is implemented. Administrative determination and imagination are crucial for making health care reform a success. The ACA delegates rulemaking authority to federal agencies for various provisions, with over 40 specific rulemaking provisions. Agencies have discretion in crafting rules based on Congress's delegation of authority. The agency head has discretion to issue regulations under the ACA, with at least 23 rules finalized. Rulemaking is used to implement statutory provisions when necessary. In a Legislative-Centered Public Administration, David H. Rosenbloom highlighted the equivalence of rulemaking and lawmaking, stating that agencies effectively legislate when issuing rules. Congressional oversight of rulemaking involves ensuring proper procedures are followed and addressing issues with the rules issued. Having early insight into upcoming regulations under the ACA can aid Congress in overseeing the implementation process. Provisions in the ACA require rulemaking, but some rules lack specific timelines. Congress can track upcoming ACA rules through the Unified Agenda published by the Regulatory Information Service Center. This helps fulfill transparency requirements and aids in congressional oversight of rulemaking. The Flexibility Act and Executive Order 12866 require agencies to publish semiannual regulatory agendas in the Federal Register, outlining significant regulatory actions. The purpose is to involve the public and resolve conflicts early in the regulatory planning process. Agencies must also prepare a \"regulatory plan\" in the fall edition of the Unified Agenda, detailing important regulatory actions expected in proposed or final form. The Unified Agenda lists upcoming regulatory activities by agency in three categories: \"active\" actions (rules in prerule, proposed rule, and final rule stages), \"completed\" actions (final rules or withdrawn rules), and \"long-term\" actions (items under development not expected to be addressed in the next 12 months). Entries include department and agency information. The Unified Agenda provides uniform data elements for all entries, including department and agency details, rule title, Regulation Identifier Number (RIN), action abstract, and timetable. It also indicates the priority of the regulation and helps Congress and the public anticipate upcoming regulatory actions. There is no penalty for issuing a rule without prior notice in the Unified Agenda, and some listed rules may never be issued, reflecting the fluid nature of the rulemaking process. The Unified Agenda provides a systematic method for federal agencies to alert the public about upcoming proposed rules. A report analyzed the January 20, 2012 edition of the Unified Agenda to identify upcoming proposed and final rules expected to be issued in the next 12 months under the ACA. The report analyzed the Unified Agenda to identify upcoming proposed and final rules under the ACA in the next 12 months. It provides details on the expected rules, including the issuing agency, rule title, RIN, abstract, and expected issuance date. The report analyzed the Unified Agenda to identify upcoming proposed and final rules under the ACA in the next 12 months. It provides details on the expected rules, including the issuing agency, rule title, RIN, abstract, and expected issuance date. Agencies compiled information prior to September 9, 2011, but estimates may have been outdated by the time the Unified Agenda was published. CRS searched the Federal Register on March 20, 2012, for the most up-to-date information on proposed and final rules. The rules and actions summarized in the report do not represent all ACA-related rulemaking activity within HHS and other federal agencies. The report analyzed upcoming proposed and final rules under the ACA in the next 12 months, focusing on changes to Medicare payment systems and new benefits. CMS addresses these changes in annual rulemaking updates, with 26 ACA-related actions listed in the \"proposed rule stage\" in January 2012. Fourteen of these rules were expected from components of the Department of Health and Human Services. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and other agencies were expected to issue a total of 26 proposed rules related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) by February 2012. By March 2012, nine of these rules had been published, with the remaining expected to follow. Nine anticipated notices of proposed rulemaking related to the Affordable Care Act had been published by March 2012, including rules on outpatient drugs, overpayments, and accessibility standards for medical equipment.

Three ACA-related rules in the \"proposed rule\" section were expected to impact small businesses or governments and require a regulatory flexibility analysis. These rules include HHS/CMS rule on \"Covered Outpatient Drugs,\" DOL/EBSA rule on \"Filings Required of Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangements,\" and TREAS/IRS rule on \"Special Rules Under the Additional Medicare Tax.\" Additionally, 12 other actions listed in the \"proposed rule\" were undecided on triggering a regulatory flexibility analysis.

Some rules, like food labeling for vending machines and restaurants, and indoor tanning services excise taxes, may trigger Regulatory Flexibility Act requirements for small businesses. Other rules are still pending analysis for potential impacts on small businesses and governmental jurisdictions. The Unified Agenda listed seven rules from CMS, including ones on Medicaid eligibility expansion, administrative simplification for electronic funds transfer, state requirements for exchange, and Medicare shared savings program waivers. Additionally, there were 14 long-term actions related to the ACA, with unclear timelines for implementation. In 11 out of 14 cases, ACA-related long-term actions have undetermined dates. Two actions are expected in December 2012, and one in May 2013.

Congress should oversee agency rules to ensure they align with legislative intent and rulemaking requirements. The Unified Agenda is crucial for early information on rules issued under the ACA. The Unified Agenda is a key tool for providing early information on rules issued under the ACA. Congress has various oversight tools available to ensure agency rules align with legislative intent and requirements, including oversight hearings, confirmation hearings, participation in the rulemaking process, requesting evaluations from the Government Accountability Office, and utilizing the Congressional Review Act. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to overrule federal agencies' final rules by enacting a joint resolution of disapproval. The CRA covers a broad range of documents that agencies want to make binding on the public. Congress can use expedited procedures to disapprove rules, with resolutions needing the President's signature or veto. The CRA has been rarely used in the past 16 years. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) has rarely been used in the past 16 years to disapprove of agency rules. Congress can also use regular legislative procedures to overturn rules, but it may be more challenging. Provisions in agencies' appropriations bills can direct or prevent the development of specific regulations. Regulations in appropriations legislation can restrict certain regulatory activities and control agency actions through the \"power of the purse.\" Congress uses these provisions strategically due to the necessity of appropriations bills passing. The frequency of regulatory appropriations restrictions varies, with less use when Congress and the President are of the same party."
