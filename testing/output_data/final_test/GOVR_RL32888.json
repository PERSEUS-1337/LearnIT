    "content": "The Future Combat System (FCS) was a multiyear, multibillion-dollar program at the heart of the Army's transformation efforts, intended to replace current systems like the M-1 Abrams tank and M-2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle. After Secretary Gates recommended canceling the Manned Ground Vehicle (MGV) portion of the FCS in April 2009, the Army announced a new acquisition strategy in October 2009. The \"BCT Modernization Plan\" aims to provide capabilities packages to Army BCTs every two years and develop a new Ground Combat Vehicle starting in 2017. Key congressional concerns include the transition from the FCS program, spin-out of FCS technologies, impact on budgets, GCV program timeline, NLOS-C replacement, and effects on Army's operational concept and doctrine. Congress's decisions on these issues could be significant. In October 1999, General Eric Shinseki introduced the Army's transformation strategy to convert Legacy Forces into the Objective Force, aiming to make the Army lighter, more modular, and deployable. The deployment goals were to deploy a brigade in 4 days, a division in 5 days, and five divisions in 30 days. The Army adopted the Future Combat System (FCS) as a major acquisition program for this transformation, scheduled to take place over three decades. The Army's transformation plan included the development of Interim Brigade Combat Teams (IBCTs) as a precursor to the Future Combat System (FCS). General Shinseki envisioned the FCS to consist of smaller and lighter ground and air vehicles with advanced offensive, defensive, and communications systems to outsmart heavier enemy forces on the battlefield. General Shinseki initiated the FCS program with DARPA to develop smaller and lighter vehicles with advanced systems to outsmart heavier enemy forces. DARPA awarded contracts to industry teams in 2000, and Boeing and SAIC were chosen as lead systems integrators in 2002. The Defense Acquisition Board approved the next acquisition phase in 2003, and contracts were awarded to 21 companies in 2004 for the FCS's development. The FCS program, initiated by General Shinseki with DARPA, aimed to develop advanced networked \"system of systems\" for Army combat forces. Contracts were awarded to 21 companies in 2004 for designing and building various platforms. The program intended to field 15 FCS BCTs with new manned ground vehicles by FY2025. However, in 2009, Secretary of Defense Gates announced a significant restructuring of the FCS program. Gates announced a restructuring of the FCS program, planning to accelerate the spin out of selected technologies to all brigade combat teams and recommending the cancellation of the manned ground vehicle component. He was concerned about unanswered questions in the vehicle design strategy and the lack of reflection of lessons from counterinsurgency and close-quarters combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. After Secretary Gates criticized the FCS program for not including MRAP vehicles, DOD decided to relaunch the Army's vehicle modernization program with a competitive bidding process. The FCS program was halted, and the ABCTM program was introduced to develop a new ground combat vehicle and transfer FCS technologies to the Army's BCTs. Boeing and SAIC, the FCS program's lead integrators, will not be retained for the GCV program and are expected to receive $350 million in cancellation penalties. The decision to discontinue the FCS program led to Boeing and SAIC facing $350 million in cancellation penalties. The Army transitioned to a modernization program with various integrated acquisition programs, including producing the first seven Spin-Out Early Infantry Brigade Combat Team units. The Army transitioned from the canceled FCS program to a new BCT modernization strategy in 2009. This strategy aims to deliver capability packages to all BCTs by 2025, with key technologies and urgent requirements fielded in two-year increments. Spin-outs from the FCS program, such as the NLOS-LS, will be included in the FY2011-FY2012 capabilities package. The FY2011-FY2012 capabilities package includes NLOS-LS, SUGV, UGS, Class I UAV, and NIK. Upgrades are planned for core Army systems like M777 Howitzer, PAC-3 Patriot Missile, Buffalo Route Clearance Vehicle, SINCGARS/ELPRS, DCGS-A, BIDS, and Stryker. MRAPs will be fully integrated, and a GCV concept will be developed for a versatile platform by 2017. Army Chief of Staff announced the GCV program at Industry Day in 2009. The Army announced at Industry Day in 2009 that the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) program would focus on developing an infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) armed with a remotely operated weapons system. The goal is to field the GCV by 2015-2017 with mature technologies and future capabilities in mind. The Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) program aims to develop an infantry fighting vehicle with mature technologies and future capabilities. The vehicle should have continuous armor development, be designed for current and future network capabilities, and be air transportable on C-17 transports. Possible features include a common chassis, V-shaped hull, side armor for protection against IEDs, and fuel efficiency. Army leadership has suggested the GCV could be tracked or wheeled. The Army is relying on industry recommendations for military equipment like radios and chemical protection systems. The Administration requested $2.981 billion for the Future Combat Systems (FCS) in FY2010, with estimated costs of $24.5 billion through FY2015. The cancellation of the Manned Ground Vehicle program is expected to save $22.9 billion. Budget breakdown for FY2010 includes NLOS-LS: $88.660 million, NLOS-C: $58.216 million, FCS Manned Ground Vehicles: $368.557 million, Systems Engineering & Program Management: $1.067 billion, and Reconnaissance Platforms: $68.701 million. The Army's budget breakdown for FY2010 includes various programs such as NLOS-LS, NLOS-C, FCS Manned Ground Vehicles, Engineering & Program Management, and Reconnaissance Platforms. The cancellation of the Manned Ground Vehicle program is expected to save $22.9 billion. Congress is concerned about the rushed development of the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) and whether key technologies are mature enough to support fielding within five to seven years. The Army's proposed incremental RDT&E strategy for developing the GCV is a point of contention, with opponents questioning its untested process and supporters highlighting its flexibility. Oversight questions include the number of GCV variations envisioned, affordability compared to upgrading current Stryker vehicles, cost targets, and deployability constraints. Potential oversight issues also arise from the cancellation of the MGV program. The potential oversight issues surrounding the cancellation of the MGV program include questions about extending the useful lives of combat vehicles, incorporating MGV technologies into other programs, the impact on the Active Protection System program, and the influence on the defense industry. Additionally, there are concerns about the incorporation of armaments from MGV variants into other combat vehicle designs and the potential increase in developmental costs due to industry uncertainty about DOD's commitment to future ground combat systems programs. The FCS MGVs are being terminated, but elements of the program such as sensors, unmanned vehicles, and the NLOS Launch System will continue in the Army BCT Modernization Strategy. The Army plans to incorporate these systems into all 73 BCTs by 2025. Questions arise about the cost of modernizing all BCTs, the impact on AFORGEN, and the program's long-term viability. The cancellation of the NLOS-C program is also under scrutiny. The potential oversight question regarding the proposed cancellation of the NLOS-C program is whether a new self-propelled artillery system to replace the M-109 Paladin will fall under the GCV program or if the Army plans a separate developmental effort. The Army has invested heavily in developing force structure, operational concepts, and soldier education based on the FCS program's success. Questions arise about the need to revisit these areas following the FCS program restructuring. The House and Senate Armed Services committees endorsed Secretary Gates's recommendation to terminate development of eight new manned ground combat vehicles in the FCS program. The House committee recommended denying $426.8 million for termination costs, while the Senate committee recommended reducing the FCS termination request by $381.8 million. The HASC recommended reducing the FCS termination request by $381.8 million and approving $45 million for developing active protection systems. They suggested fully funding separate FCS program elements at $2.45 billion for FY2010. Additionally, they proposed only $100 million for terminating the FCS MGV program, citing unspent FY2009 funds to cover termination costs. The committee also recommended limiting the procurement of Spin Out Early Infantry Brigade Combat Team equipment sets to one brigade set for thorough testing before full-rate commitment. The SASC recommended reallocating excess FCS termination funds to Army research and development efforts, including the next-generation ground combat vehicle and self-propelled howitzer programs. They also suggested supporting the Paladin Integration Management program for M-109 Paladins' upgrade and modernization. The SASC recommended supporting the President's $2.5 billion budget request for FCS network development and spin-out technologies. The Conference Report authorized $285.9 million for FCS spin-outs procurement and $42 million for advance procurement. It also approved termination costs for MGV and NLOS-C programs. Additionally, it authorized funding for RDT&E for NLOS-LS, Systems Engineering & Program Management, Reconnaissance Platforms, and Unmanned Ground Vehicles under the FCS program. The House bill included a provision to limit Army procurement of Future Combat Systems spin-out equipment for testing. The Senate amendment did not have a similar provision but allowed for increased procurement with certain certifications. The conference report restricted Army Tactical Ground Network spending to 50%. The report limits Army Tactical Ground Network funding to 50% until a report on acquisition strategy is submitted. The GCV program aims to develop a next-generation ground combat vehicle and self-propelled howitzer. The House bill provides $2.67 billion for FCS, cutting $211 million for termination costs. The Senate bill would cut $368 million. The Senate bill would cut $368 million from the amounts requested for FCS programs, including Manned Ground Vehicles. The Manned Ground Vehicles (MGVs) were a series of combat vehicles designed to be air transportable by the U.S. Air Force, equipped with protection systems and sensors for survivability. The Mounted Combat System (MCS) was one of the MGV types cancelled in May 2009, intended to provide direct and beyond-line-of-sight fires with a crew of two and armed with a 120 mm main gun. The Mounted Combat System (MCS) was designed to have a crew of two and be armed with a 120 mm main gun, a .50 caliber machine gun, and a 40 mm automatic grenade launcher. The Infantry Carrier Vehicle (ICV) was planned to have four versions, each with different capabilities. The Non-Line-of-Sight Cannon (NLOS-C) was intended to provide extended-range targeting and precision attack capabilities. The Non-Line-of-Sight Mortar (NLOS-M) was designed to provide indirect fires for FCS companies and platoons with a four-man crew and a 120mm mortar. The Reconnaissance and Surveillance Vehicle (RSV) was equipped with advanced sensors for target detection under various conditions. The Reconnaissance and Surveillance Vehicle (RSV) was designed to carry scouts, ground sensors, a Small Unmanned Ground Vehicle (SUGV), and two Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The Command and Control Vehicle (C2V) served as the hub for battlefield command and control, with a crew of two and the ability to employ UAVs. The Medical Vehicle-Evacuation (MV-E) and Medical Vehicle-Treatment (MV-T) were designed to provide medical support closer to the point of injury for combat forces. The MV-E and MV-T vehicles were designed to provide medical support closer to the point of injury for combat forces. They would enhance the ability to provide Advanced Trauma Management/Advanced Trauma Life Support forward in the battle area, with four-man crews capable of conducting medical procedures and treatments using telemedicine systems. The Field Recovery and Maintenance Vehicle (FRMV) was intended to be the FCS BCT's recovery and maintenance system, with a crew of three and space for up to three recovered crew members. Each BCT was to have a number of UAVs, which could provide various capabilities but also present air space management challenges. The Army faces air space management challenges for its UAVs, including Class I UAVs for platoon-level Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition, and Class IV UAVs for BCT commanders with long endurance capabilities. Class IV UAVs (XM157) provide BCT commanders with long endurance capabilities, staying aloft for 72 hours within a 75 km radius and a ceiling of 16,500 feet. They can interface with other aerial vehicles, take off and land without a dedicated airfield. Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) like the Armed Robotic Vehicle-Assault Light (ARV- AL) were designed for remote reconnaissance, sensor deployment, and direct fire weapons use against various targets. The SUGV is a small, lightweight UGV designed for urban terrain, tunnels, and caves. It weighs 30 pounds, operates for six hours without recharging, and has a 1 km ground range and 200 m tunnel range. Its modular design allows for various payloads for high-risk ISR missions and chemical reconnaissance. The MULE is a UGV supporting infantry with two variants on a common chassis. The XM1217 and XM1218 are two variants of a UGV designed to support dismounted infantry. The XM1217 is a transport variant capable of carrying equipment for infantry in rough terrain, while the XM1218 is a countermine variant equipped to detect and neutralize anti-tank mines. The Tactical UGS (AN/GSR-10) includes ISR and CBRN sensors for intelligence gathering and reconnaissance, with a 48-hour endurance for deployment by hand, vehicle, or robot. The Urban UGS (AN/GSR-9) is designed for situational awareness in urban environments, deployable by soldiers, vehicles, or robots. The Non-Line-of-Sight Launch System (NLOS-LS) (XM501) consists of missiles in a container launch unit with a fire control system and 15 Precision Attack Missiles (PAM) for target acquisition and engagement. The PAM has direct-fire, fast attack, and boost-glide modes, receiving target information before launch and updates during flight. The FCS network program, originally designed to include four interactive components, is likely to be significantly modified due to the cancellation of the MGVs. The System-of-Systems Common Operating Environment (SOSCOE) enables the integration of various software packages into the network, using commercial hardware for interoperability. Battle Command software is crucial for mission operations. Battle Command (BC) Software includes mission planning, situational understanding, battle command, and mission execution. It provides automated capabilities for mission planning, terrain analysis, rehearsals, and after-action reviews. Situational understanding packages help determine enemy locations and intentions. The package includes planning and decision aids for commanders during battle, soldier-generated information display, secure communication network for combat vehicles, and various communication systems like JTRS and Soldier Radio Waveform. The Intelligence, Reconnaissance, and Surveillance System consists of multispectral sensors to provide situational awareness and avoid enemy fires while enabling precision networked fires for the unit."
