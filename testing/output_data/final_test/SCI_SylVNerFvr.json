Through experiments on SCAN tasks, it is shown that the equivariant architecture can achieve compositional generalization in human language understanding, where known concepts are recombined to understand novel sentences. The meaning of sentences relies on language compositionality, where deep learning models struggle to leverage this concept, hindering true natural language understanding. Lake & proposed the Simplified version of the CommAI Navigation (SCAN) dataset to benchmark the compositional generalization capabilities of seq2seq models. SCAN revealed the lack of compositionality in language models and highlighted the challenges in tasks requiring language compositionality. The lack of compositionality in language models was revealed by the Simplified version of the CommAI Navigation (SCAN) dataset. Different approaches were proposed to address this issue, including a seq2seq model by Russin et al. and a meta-learning approach by Lake. However, these methods had limitations. A holistic approach connecting language compositionality in SCAN to models equivariant to group symmetries was suggested in this paper. The main contribution of this work is to propose that language compositionality can be understood as a form of group-equivariance. Tools are provided to construct seq2seq models equivariant to group symmetries, which solve most SCAN tasks. The purpose of SCAN tasks is to benchmark machine translation models for compositional generalization. The curr_chunk discusses compositional generalization in the context of the SCAN dataset, which pairs English sentences with action sequences. It evaluates the abilities of seq2seq machine translation models in tasks like length generalization. The curr_chunk evaluates the performance of seq2seq translation models on tasks like length generalization in the context of the SCAN dataset. It compares the performance of different architectures and methods, highlighting the challenges of compositional generalization. The curr_chunk discusses language compositionality problems in the SCAN dataset and their connection to equivariant maps in group theory. It introduces the hypothesis that models achieving compositional generalization in certain tasks are equivariant with respect to permutation group operations. The text delves into basic concepts of group theory, focusing on permutation groups and their binary group operations. The curr_chunk discusses the concept of equivariant maps in group theory, specifically focusing on local group operations at a word level within sequences or sentences. It introduces the main object of study as equivariant maps and defines the group operations on sets X and Y. The curr_chunk explains local group operations on sequences or sentences within a vocabulary set. It defines a group operation Tg as a permutation of words in the vocabulary and introduces locally equivariant maps. Local group operations on sequences involve a group operation Tg that permutes words in the vocabulary. Equivariant maps are defined as mappings that preserve this permutation. In the context of SCAN, local equivariance allows for compositional generalization in tasks like verb and conjunction replacement. Local equivariance enables compositional generalization in verb replacement tasks, as it corresponds to a local group operation in input and output languages. However, it is insufficient for conjunction replacement, as global equivariance is needed for more complex changes like replacing AND with AFTER. In the following section, a proposed set of tools for implementing equivariant seq2seq translation models is discussed. The model utilizes group convolutions to achieve equivariance, with an encoder-decoder architecture illustrated in Figure 2. The use of global equivariance is necessary for complex changes like replacing AND with AFTER in the input-language. To achieve equivariance in our model, we heavily rely on group convolutions. These convolutions involve learnable filter functions and result in matrices that are equivariant with respect to group operations. By convolving words with filters and group representations, we generate equivariant embeddings. While other methods exist, the approach outlined by Kondor & Trivedi (2018) and Bloem-Reddy & Teh (2019) is particularly effective. The general and expressive convolutional form of Definition 4 is employed for permutation equivariant layers, as demonstrated by Kondor & Trivedi (2018) and Bloem-Reddy & Teh (2019). This approach involves choosing a discrete group G containing permutations of language vocabularies, such as products of cyclic groups on sets of words. The text discusses the use of permutation equivariant layers in convolutional neural networks by choosing a discrete group G containing permutations of language vocabularies. It emphasizes the importance of considering subgroups for efficient computation, using standard group theory notation for composition and inverses. The functional representations of word one-hot encodings are also highlighted for compatibility with the notations used. The text discusses the use of permutation equivariant layers in convolutional neural networks by choosing a discrete group G containing permutations of language vocabularies. It emphasizes the importance of considering subgroups for efficient computation and highlights the functional representations of word one-hot encodings for compatibility with the notations used. The representation is equivalent to one-hot vectors, denoted as w, and the group operation on a word gw can be implemented as matrix multiplication between the permutation matrix g and the one-hot vector w. The binary group operation can be written as matrix multiplication gh between two group members g, h \u2208 G, resulting in another permutation matrix. The transformation process involves encoding an input sequence x (a navigation command in English) into a sequence of actions y. Each input word is transformed into a permutation equivariant embedding using learnable filter functions. The embedding, called G-Embed, is represented as a matrix R |G|\u00d7K. The G-Embed layer is a simple instantiation of Definition 4, where the embedding is represented as a matrix. The embedding function is a function on the group G, requiring learnable filters to also be functions on G. An example is given with the cyclic group permuting the words LEFT and RIGHT. In this case, embedding LEFT results in a 2 \u00d7 K matrix T, with g1 and g2 acting as the identity permutation for JUMP. The word embedding e(wt) is sent to a permutation equivariant Recurrent Neural Network (G-RNN) with cells mimicking a standard RNN but using G-Convs. The G-RNN cell receives inputs (e(wt) and previous hidden state ht\u22121) and returns an output (current hidden state ht). The cell is equivariant due to the sum and pointwise transformation of equivariant representations. The hidden state is initialized as h0 = 0. The equivariant encoder uses G-LSTM cells for best performance. The hidden representations of the input sentence are encoded into h = (h1, ..., hLx). The equivariant decoder, illustrated in Figure 2b, uses G-RNN cells. The decoding process involves the previous hidden state ht-1 and an attention \u0101t over all encoding hidden states h. The equivariant attention mechanism is developed using linear combinations of hidden states from the encoder and the previous decoding hidden state. This mechanism combines attention mechanisms with G-Convolution for language modeling. The decoder uses teacher-forcing during training to provide correct output sequences. The final hidden representation is converted into logits for the output-language vocabulary. Sampling from these logits produces the output word to be appended in the translation. The decoding module includes learnable parameters represented by a matrix. The decoder in the sequence-2-sequence model uses teacher-forcing during training to generate output sequences. The output words are represented as a one-hot vector and transformed by a learnable embedding \u03c8 into R^K. This layer produces a categorical distribution over the output vocabulary, achieving equivariance through parameter-sharing. The complete model, composed of an equivariant encoder and decoder, is itself equivariant to the group G. Further implementation details and empirical evaluation of its equivariant properties are provided in Section 6. In this section, we review state-of-the-art methods for addressing compositional tasks, focusing on two recent models. The syntactic attention model by Russin et al. (2019) suggests that compositional generalization can be achieved through separate processing channels for semantic and syntactic information. Their model uses attention weights based on a recurrent encoding of the input sequence to apply to context-independent word embeddings, aiming to model semantic information. The syntactic attention model by Russin et al. (2019) focuses on context-independent word embeddings to model semantic information. Lake (2019) utilizes a meta-learning approach to generalize across tasks, designing specific procedures for each task. The curr_chunk discusses data augmentation in permutation groups for encouraging equivariance in models. Lake (2019) sets the context set at test-time to provide correct command-to-action mapping. The equivariant seq2seq model is evaluated on SCAN tasks and compared to other models. The curr_chunk discusses models using permutation groups for equivariant seq2seq. Test accuracies for SCAN tasks are compared, showing our model outperforms others. Our model outperforms others in using permutation groups for equivariant seq2seq, with training procedures similar to previous works. Training consists of 200 iterations with a minibatch size of 1, using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-4. Teacher-forcing with a ratio of 0.5 is used, along with early-stopping based on a validation set. The results of the experiments show that the equivariant seq2seq model outperforms other models in tasks that satisfy the local equivariance assumption. It significantly surpasses regular seq2seq and convolutional models, as well as state-of-the-art methods. This supports the main hypothesis of the study. Our equivariant seq2seq model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art Russin et al. (2019) model on tasks like Add jump and Around right SCAN tasks by explicitly exploiting equivariance. Our model surpasses Russin et al. (2019) on Add jump and Around right SCAN tasks, showing robustness. In contrast, Lake (2019) meta-learning model excels in local equivariance tasks but requires a complex model tailored to each task, correct word permutations, and diverse training data. Length generalization remains a challenge in SCAN, especially for generating long sequences. The equivariant seq2seq model struggles with length generalization in the SCAN task due to difficulties in expressing local equivariances on both input and output languages. This issue is also observed in other models like Russin et al. (2019) and Lake (2019). The model can handle known input commands but fails on unseen ones, indicating a lack of understanding of the relationships between commands. The equivariant seq2seq model struggles with length generalization in the SCAN task, as it fails to understand the relationships between commands. Global operations on the output language remain a challenging research question for future work. The work introduces a hypothesis linking group equivariance and compositional generalization in language. An equivariant seq2seq translation model is proposed, achieving state-of-the-art performance on SCAN tasks. The model requires knowledge of permutation symmetries, which can be addressed by grouping words by parts-of-speech, learning groupings from corpora, or parameterizing the symmetry group. Parameterizing the symmetry group and learning operations end-to-end while enforcing the group structure is a fruitful avenue for future research. Computational complexity scales linearly with the size of the group, which may be prohibitive for large groups. More efficient computational layers for permutation equivariance can address this issue. Future research directions include exploring sub-sampling group elements for summation, investigating global equivariances, and studying the relationship between equivariance frameworks and compositionality in formal semantics. These avenues offer exciting possibilities for capturing symmetries in language tasks. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of applying compositionality to more complex permutations in linguistic composition. It also mentions the SCAN dataset and provides details on implementing the G-LSTM model. The G-LSTM cell equations are provided for implementing the model, utilizing hidden state and cell state variables. The cell includes functions for input, forget, output, and cell state updates, with learnable filters for each function."
