    "content": "The \"First-Time Homebuyers' Tax Credit Act of 2003\" allows for a refundable credit for first-time homebuyers under section 36 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"First-Time Homebuyers' Tax Credit Act of 2003\" provides a 10% credit against the tax for first-time homebuyers in the US, limited to $3,000 ($6,000 for joint returns) with adjustments for inflation. The \"First-Time Homebuyers' Tax Credit Act of 2003\" provides a tax credit for first-time homebuyers, with the $3,000 amount adjusted for inflation. The tax credit amount will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $10 if it is not a multiple of $10. If a taxpayer's taxable income exceeds the maximum taxable income for the 25 percent rate, the dollar amounts for the following year will be reduced by the excess amount. Married individuals filing a joint return for the first time will have their tax credit adjusted accordingly. The tax credit amount will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $10 if it is not a multiple of $10. If a taxpayer's taxable income exceeds the maximum taxable income for the 25 percent rate, the dollar amounts for the following year will be reduced by the excess amount. Married individuals filing a joint return for the first time will have their tax credit adjusted accordingly. The credit allowable under subsection (a) can be transferred to pay for downpayment and closing costs related to purchasing a principal residence. The Secretary will establish a credit transfer mechanism to certify taxpayer eligibility for the credit, ensure no previous credit was received for another residence, and determine the transfer amount to be paid to the transferee. The Secretary will issue the credit transfer amount to the transferee within 30 days of receiving the application, and the transferee must notify the taxpayer within 14 days of receiving the amount. The payment issued will include the taxpayer's identification number and the address of the purchased residence. Additionally, the Secretary will pay interest on the transfer amount. The Secretary will pay interest on any unpaid amounts after the 30-day period, at the overpayment rate established under section 6621. This provision does not apply in cases of natural disasters or circumstances beyond the Secretary's control. The subsection allows lenders to adjust loan terms due to market changes between application and credit transfer. The definition of 'first-time homebuyer' is consistent with section 72(t)(8)(D)(i). The definition of 'first-time homebuyer' in this subsection aligns with section 72(t)(8)(D)(i), stating that an individual can only be considered a first-time homebuyer once for a principal residence. For married individuals filing jointly, both spouses must be first-time homebuyers to qualify for the credit. If multiple unmarried individuals purchase a principal residence, each individual must be a first-time homebuyer to claim the credit. The credit for first-time homebuyers is allocated among individuals as prescribed by the Secretary, with the total amount not exceeding the limit for joint filers. The term 'principal residence' is defined similarly to section 121, with exceptions for interests in partnerships, S corporations, or trusts owning a residence. The term 'purchase' for the credit for first-time homebuyers means any acquisition not from a person whose relationship would disallow losses under certain sections. The term 'purchase price' refers to the adjusted basis of the principal residence on the date of acquisition, regardless of how the property was acquired or constructed by the taxpayer. The adjusted basis of the principal residence on the date of acquisition is used to determine eligibility for the credit. No double benefit is allowed, and the basis of the residence is reduced by the amount of the credit. The provisions apply to a principal residence purchased between January 1, 2003, and January 1, 2010. The taxpayer must enter into a binding contract to purchase a residence between January 1, 2003, and January 1, 2010, and occupy it before July 1, 2011. Amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code regarding adjustments to basis for a residence where a credit was allowed under section 36. Amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code by inserting a new item in the table of sections for subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code include a new section for first-time homebuyers and overpayments of tax, effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2002."
