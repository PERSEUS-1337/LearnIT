Congress finds that the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology recommends developing a Government-wide Federal energy policy with regular updates through strategic Quadrennial Energy Reviews. The Department of Energy has conducted a Quadrennial Technology Review of its energy technology policies, serving as a basis for coordination with other agencies. A Quadrennial Energy Review would establish an integrated, Government-wide national energy policy. The Quadrennial Energy Review aims to establish integrated national energy objectives, coordinate actions across Federal agencies, identify resources for energy technologies, and provide analytical support for policy decisions. It is expected to enhance energy security, create jobs, and mitigate environmental harm with substantial input from the executive branch. The Quadrennial Energy Review aims to establish national energy objectives with input from Congress, the energy industry, academia, NGOs, and the public. The Department of Energy Organization Act is amended to include a Quadrennial Energy Review to establish national energy objectives with input from various stakeholders. The definitions in this section include the Director as the head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, Federal Laboratory as defined in the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, an interagency working group, and the Quadrennial Energy Review as a comprehensive examination of energy issues. The Energy Review is a multiyear examination of federal energy programs and technologies. An interagency working group is established every 4 years to coordinate the review, with the Secretary and Director as co-chairpersons. Membership includes representatives from various government departments. The Quadrennial Energy Review involves multiple federal departments and agencies, including the Department of the Interior, Agriculture, Treasury, Transportation, Office of Management and Budget, National Science Foundation, Environmental Protection Agency, and others designated by the President. The review aims to provide an integrated view of national energy objectives and federal energy policy, aligning research programs, incentives, regulations, and partnerships. It must be submitted to Congress by February 1, 2014. The Secretary, in cooperation with the Director, must publish and submit a report on the Quadrennial Energy Review to Congress every four years starting from February 1, 2014. The report should include short-, intermediate-, and long-term objectives for Federal energy policy, anticipated Federal actions, and resource requirements coordinated across multiple agencies. The report on the Quadrennial Energy Review must analyze the roles of various parties in achieving energy objectives across different sectors like buildings, industry, transportation, power, and agriculture. It should also outline the requirements for innovation, adoption, development, and diffusion of energy technologies. The Quadrennial Energy Review report must assess technologies for energy sectors, research on incentivizing actions, policy options for increasing energy supplies, evaluation of storage and transmission needs, Federal Laboratories involvement plan, portfolio assessments for resource deployment, and linkages among basic elements. The Quadrennial Energy Review report includes mapping linkages between basic research and applied programs, identifying demonstration projects, assessing funding needs for energy technologies, evaluating global competitors, and identifying policy gaps. The Quadrennial Energy Review report identifies policy gaps in energy technology adoption, analyzes points of leverage for policy intervention, and provides recommendations for executive branch organization changes to facilitate Federal energy policies. The Secretary shall support the Executive Secretariat for conducting Quadrennial Energy Reviews, and Federal agencies must cooperate by providing necessary assistance and resources."
