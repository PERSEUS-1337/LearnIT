    "content": "The Act titled \"Arizona Land Exchange Facilitation Act of 2000\" is established for the purpose of facilitating land exchanges in Arizona. Congress finds that when Arizona became a state, it was granted over 9,000,000 acres of State trust land for the benefit of Arizona's schoolchildren. The State is also entitled to select additional land to fulfill its entitlement from vacant Federal land. Arizona recognizes the unique value of certain State trust land. The land in Arizona is of unique value and should be conserved as open space for future generations. Currently, there is no mechanism to conserve this state trust land. An exchange of certain Federal and State land will improve land management for both governments. The purpose of this Act is to enhance the manageability of Federal public land and State trust land in Arizona. The Act aims to enhance the manageability of Federal public land and State trust land in Arizona through a land conveyance and exchange between the Federal and State governments. This involves the identification of vacant land for disposal, conveyance of Federal land to the State, and acquisition of State trust land by the Secretary of the Interior in exchange for Federal land. The Act aims to enhance manageability of Federal public land and State trust land in Arizona through land conveyance and exchange. The Act defines key terms such as \"in lieu base land,\" \"Secretary,\" \"State,\" and \"State trust land,\" which includes land granted by the United States and owned by the State for management purposes. The State trust land must be managed for the benefit of the public school system or designated State institutions. SEC. 4. FULFILLMENT OF ENTITLEMENT UNDER THE ENABLING ACT. The Secretary must identify vacant, unappropriated, and unreserved land suitable for disposal under land management plans. The State will select land of equal value to in lieu base land, and upon agreement, the Secretary will convey the selected land to the State. The Secretary will identify land suitable for disposal under land management plans, and the State will select land of equal value for exchange. The Secretary will exchange State trust land for Federal land of equal value, as determined under section 6. The Federal land must be under the Secretary's jurisdiction and available for exchange. The Secretary will acquire State trust land through eminent domain upon final agreement with the State under section 7(a). The State trust land described in paragraph (2) will be managed in accordance with paragraph (3). State trust land is land under State jurisdiction available for exchange. Land acquired by the United States under this section within designated systems will become part of the unit. Any land acquired by the United States under this section shall be subject to applicable laws and regulations. It will be administered by the Bureau of Land Management or may be made subject to special protections for unique ecological value. The land acquired by the Secretary may be subject to special management considerations, such as a conservation easement, to protect it from development and preserve open space. All land acquired is withdrawn from various forms of entry, appropriation, and disposal under public land laws, as well as from mining and mineral leasing laws. SEC. 6. DETERMINATION OF VALUE. All exchanges authorized under this Act must be for approximately equal value. The Secretary and the State will jointly determine an independent appraisal process following nationally recognized standards to estimate land values. Disputes regarding appraisals will be resolved according to the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. Adjustments may be made to achieve equal value after determining land parcel values. The Secretary and the State may add or remove parcels to create a package of equally valued Federal and State trust land. A determination of land value under this section establishes value in eminent domain proceedings. Costs are shared equally between the Secretary and the State. SEC. 7. CONVEYANCES OF TITLE. The Secretary and the State will enter into an agreement for the conveyance of land under this Act, subject to existing rights. Conveyances by the State to the United States will be subject to specified interests, and all conveyances must be completed within 60 days. The conveyance of land under this Act must be completed within 60 days of final agreement between the Secretary and the State. The form of conveyance from the State to the United States must comply with the regulations of the Attorney General. SEC. 8. GENERAL PROVISIONS. SEC. 8. GENERAL PROVISIONS.\n\n(a) Hazardous Waste.-- The State shall remain responsible for environmental remediation, waste management, and compliance activities for conditions existing on land at the time of conveyance to the United States. The United States will also retain responsibility for these activities on the land it conveys to the State. The United States and the State will each bear their own costs for implementing the Act, except for costs under section 6. The State and the Secretary will exchange legal descriptions and maps of land parcels under their jurisdictions. SEC. 9. LAS CIENEGAS STUDY. The Secretary, in consultation with the State, must conduct a study of land values within the proposed Las Cienegas National Conservation Area in Arizona and recommend to Congress whether any State trust land should be acquired by the Federal Government. The study will examine forms of compensation, including cash payments, Federal administrative sites, and water rights. The Administrator of General Services, water rights, and relief from debt payment for the Central Arizona Water Conservation District are addressed. Authorization of appropriations is granted to carry out this Act, with the Secretary's authority for land conveyance and exchange expiring two years after enactment."
