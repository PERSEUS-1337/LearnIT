The economic problems have strained state and local government budgets, leading to actions that undermine federal efforts to stimulate the economy. Emergency federal assistance to prevent budget-related actions by state and local governments would enhance economic recovery efforts. State and local governments should receive the same level of Federal investment for infrastructure and social services as the funds provided to Iraq for relief and reconstruction. SEC. 2. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AUTHORIZED. The Secretary of the Treasury will make payments to States and local governments to align their budget actions with Federal efforts for economic recovery. An amount equal to the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund for fiscal year 2003 is authorized for these payments, in addition to other appropriations. At least one-third of the funds will be available to local governments. The Secretary of the Treasury will allocate funds to States and local governments for economic recovery efforts. At least one-third of the funds will be available to local governments under State laws. The Secretary of the Treasury will establish a formula for allocating payments under the Act based on factors like unemployment rate, duration above national average, median income, population, and poverty rate. Funds under this Act are for priority expenditures only, including maintenance for education, public safety, health, social services, infrastructure, and housing. Capital expenditures must be authorized by law. The Secretary of the Treasury can accept certifications from state and local governments. The Secretary of the Treasury can accept a certification from the chief executive officer of a State or local government regarding the use of funds received under the Act for priority expenditures.
