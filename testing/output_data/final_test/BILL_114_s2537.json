    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"PLO Accountability Act\". The PLO Mission office in Washington, DC was opened in 1994 to implement the Oslo Accords. The Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987 prohibits the establishment of PLO-related offices in the US. The Executive branch has used various authorities in relation to this issue. The Executive branch has waived the provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987. The Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement prohibits any changes to the status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The PLO sent a declaration to the International Criminal Court in 2009. UNESCO admitted the Palestinian Authority in 2011. The State of Palestine was admitted as the 195th full member of UNESCO, leading to anti-Israel rulings. The United Nations General Assembly granted Palestine nonmember observer state status. The PLO joined the Geneva Conventions and other organizations, acceded to the Rome Statute, and the International Criminal Court opened a preliminary examination of alleged crimes in Palestine. The PLO's decision to join the Rome Statute and other international organizations aims to change the status of the West Bank and Gaza. The US opposes Palestinian actions to join the International Criminal Court, stating it is counterproductive and hinders peace efforts. On February 23, 2015, a New York Federal court found the PLO and Palestinian Authority liable for terrorist attacks in Israel, ordering them to pay $218.5 million in reparations. The \"State of Palestine\" joined the International Criminal Court on April 1, 2015. The PLO continues to reward terrorists for attacks. The PLO refuses to disclose its financial assets, including the multibillion-dollar Palestinian National Fund (PNF) belonging to Mahmoud Abbas, which is used to fund various activities, including compensating families of Palestinian terrorists. The Sense of Congress is outlined in Section 3. The Sense of Congress is that the PLO has not upheld its commitments to peace with Israel, while Mahmoud Abbas has blurred lines between the PLO and Palestinian Authority to avoid accountability. The Palestinian actions at the International Criminal Court targeting Israeli nationals are also condemned. The investigation of Israeli nationals for alleged crimes against Palestinians would violate Palestinian commitments to not change the status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A lasting peace can only be achieved through direct negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians, without outside influence. If the Palestinian Authority supports an investigation at the International Criminal Court, the PLO office in the US should be closed for national security interests. SEC. 4. PROHIBITIONS REGARDING THE PLO UNDER THE ANTI-TERRORISM ACT OF 1987. Section 1003 of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987 is amended to make it unlawful for Palestinians to obtain the same standing as member states or full membership as a state outside of an agreement negotiated between Israel and the Palestinians. The President may waive this provision for up to 6 months with certification to Congress. The Palestinians have officially ceased to be members of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and have withdrawn from the Rome Statute. Any preliminary examination or ongoing investigation against Israel initiated by the Palestinians has been withdrawn and terminated. The PLO and the Palestinian Authority no longer provide financial support to Palestinian terrorists imprisoned in Israel or their families. The Palestinians must meet certain conditions to rejoin the International Criminal Court, including ending incitement against the US and Israel or reaching a peace agreement with Israel. Incitement is defined as statements or activities promoting violence, terrorism, or honoring terrorists. The curr_chunk is about designating various locations such as community centers, stadiums, and landmarks for a specific purpose."
