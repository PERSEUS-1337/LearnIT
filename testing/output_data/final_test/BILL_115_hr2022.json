    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Label and Transport Tissues Safely Act of 2017\" or as the \"LATTS Act of 2017.\" The \"Label and Transport Tissues Safely Act of 2017\" requires a non-transplant tissue bank license for introducing human tissue specimens into interstate commerce for medical research or education. Each package must be labeled with the proper name of the specimen, source tissue bank information, donor identifier, tissue type, cause of death, and serological test. Each package of human tissue specimen must be wrapped and packaged to prevent contamination, cross-contamination, safety hazards, leakage, and ensure tissue integrity. The Secretary of Health and Human Services establishes rules for non-transplant tissue bank licenses, including approval based on legal donation, disease screening, proper handling, and donor authorization compliance. The applicant must ensure that each facility handling human tissue specimens meets standards to prevent communicable disease risks and maintain complete records on donors for educational or research purposes. The applicant must maintain records on donors for educational or research purposes, including documentation of consent and information provided to the donor or their agent. The applicant must document whether the body or human tissue specimens will be returned to a relative or personal representative, or if they will handle the disposition. They also need to record the identity and address of entities that previously had possession of the body or specimens. The applicant must document possession and disposition of human bodies or tissue specimens, including recipient details. The Secretary may exempt human tissue specimens from certain requirements, and it is prohibited to falsely label or mark any package containing human tissue specimens. Inspection of facilities related to human tissue specimens is authorized by the Department of Health and Human Services. The Department of Health and Human Services, authorized by the Secretary, can inspect facilities with non-transplant tissue bank licenses. Accrediting bodies can also conduct inspections. Existing authorities like the Attorney General can also inspect these facilities. Recall of specimens presenting hazards or violations is allowed. If a tissue bank licensed under this section poses a public health hazard, the Secretary can issue a recall order for the product. Violating a recall order can result in a civil penalty of up to $10,000 per day. The penalty amount increases annually based on the Consumer Price Index. (e) Prohibitions of Sales and Purchases of Human Tissue Specimen.-- It is illegal to sell, acquire, receive, or transfer any human tissue specimen for valuable consideration if it affects interstate commerce. (f) Penalties for Offenses-- Violators of these provisions may face imprisonment for up to 1 year or a fine. The section outlines penalties for offenses related to the sale and purchase of human tissue specimens. Violators may face imprisonment for up to 1 year, a fine of up to $10,000, or both. The definition of key terms such as \"agent,\" \"donor,\" and \"human tissue specimen\" is also provided. This Act does not affect other provisions of Federal law. The term \"valuable consideration\" excludes reasonable payments for the handling of human tissue specimens, which are legally donated for medical research or education and do not include biological products."
