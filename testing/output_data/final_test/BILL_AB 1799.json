    "title": "AB 1799",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 5100 of the Civil Code in California is amended to require secret ballot elections for assessments, director elections, document amendments, and exclusive use grants in homeowner associations. The rules apply to both incorporated and unincorporated associations, excluding votes by delegates or representatives. In case of conflict with the Nonprofit Mutual Benefit Corporation Law, this article's provisions prevail for elections. Directors may not need to be elected if each interest group has a director or if the election is uncontested. An election is uncontested if the number of candidates does not exceed the positions available, and specific procedures are followed. The election rules required by Section 5105 have been adopted and complied with for the election. All declared candidates were nominated before the deadline and in accordance with the association's governing documents. The inspector of elections confirmed that the number of candidates does not exceed the positions available. The board votes in open session to declare the election uncontested after a hearing during an open board meeting. The association provides general notice to all members at least 20 days before the board meeting for the vote. The board will vote at a regular meeting to declare the election of directors uncontested, disclosing all candidate names and allowing objections before the vote. Meeting minutes will record candidate names, notice to members, objections, and the board's vote on the uncontested election. If the association allows write-in votes, a 15-day period is given for write-in candidates to submit their names. If the total number of candidates does not exceed the number of directors to be elected, the uncontested election results will be sealed immediately, with the new board taking office right after. An association must provide 15 days' notice for a self-nomination process if governing documents do not allow write-in votes on the ballot. This is in accordance with Section 5105 of the Civil Code, which requires associations to adopt rules for election procedures. Ensure equal access to association media, newsletters, and common area meeting space for all candidates and members advocating a point of view during a campaign, including those not endorsed by the board. The association cannot edit or redact content but may include a statement clarifying that the candidate or member is responsible for the content. The curr_chunk specifies qualifications for candidates and voting procedures for board elections, including the selection of independent third-party inspectors. The curr_chunk outlines the process for selecting inspectors, appointing additional persons for verification, and ensuring notification of election procedures to all members at least 60 days in advance. It also emphasizes that members in good standing meeting lawful qualifications cannot be denied the right to vote or run for director positions. The rules adopted may allow nomination of candidates from membership meetings or by other means, including write-in candidates. Section 5145 of the Civil Code is amended to allow members to bring a civil action for violations within one year, with potential remedies including voiding election results for non-compliance with election procedures. A member who wins a civil action under this article can receive attorney's fees, court costs, and a civil penalty of up to $500 per violation. The court may impose only one penalty for identical violations affecting all members equally. An association that prevails cannot recover costs unless the court deems the action frivolous, unreasonable, or unfounded. A cause of action under Sections 5100 to 5130, with respect to access to association resources, ballots, counting, tabulation, or violation of a rule may be brought in small claims court if the demand does not exceed the court's jurisdiction."
