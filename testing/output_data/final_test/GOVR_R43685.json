    "content": "Congress has played a significant role in shaping nuclear weapons policy and funding for decades. It established the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and the Nuclear Weapons Council, rejected certain weapon facility projects, and directed studies on nuclear weapon issues. One ongoing concern for Congress is the production of \"pits,\" which are crucial components of nuclear weapons. During the Cold War, the Rocky Flats Plant manufactured up to 2,000 pits per year. In 1989, pit production was suspended and eventually halted permanently due to environmental crimes. Congress and the Administration searched for ways to make pits, with NNSA proposing a two-track strategy. The NNSA proposed a two-track strategy to resume pit production, with LANL making war reserve pits in 2007. Plans for an industrial-scale pit production facility did not materialize, such as the Modern Pit Facility which lost funding in FY2006. The Administration deferred funding for the Modern Pit Facility, which had a capacity between 125 and 450 pits per year. PF-4, the last U.S. plutonium processing building, had the capacity to manufacture about 10 non-war reserve pits per year as of June 2014. However, most work at PF-4 was halted in June 2013, resulting in zero pit production until work resumed in June 2014. Manufacturing war reserve pits was also at zero capacity due to no requirement for them. Manufacturing war reserve (WR) pits was at zero capacity as there was no requirement for them. Processes to certify pits as WR were suspended after the previous build of W88 pits in FY2011. NNSA plans to manufacture a few pits a year to prepare for WR pit production, with a goal of reaching a capacity of 30 pits per year by 2026 and potentially up to 80 pits per year by FY 2030. The Department of Defense and Department of Energy agree on the need for a near-term pit manufacturing capacity of 10 to 20 pits, increasing to 30 by 2021, and eventually reaching a capacity of 50 to 80 pits per year in the longer term. The Department of Energy plans to achieve a capacity of 30 war reserve (WR) pits per year by 2026, with a goal of 50-80 pits per year by FY 2030. Congress is involved in efforts to increase pit production capacity, with debates on whether a capacity greater than 80 pits per year is necessary. Congress is deeply involved in increasing pit production capacity, with specific directives in the FY2015 defense authorization bill for NNSA to analyze existing facilities and construct modules to support an exit from a 1950s-era plutonium building at LANL by 2019. The House Appropriations Committee recommended increased funding for experimental efforts to understand plutonium properties. The committee recommended $35.7 million for moving activities out of the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research building, operational since 1952, to support pit reuse in future nuclear weapon life extension programs. Questions remain about manufacturing pits at a rate of 80 per year, including facility details and necessary upgrades. Without answers, Congress cannot determine if existing buildings can meet production needs. This report outlines key questions and decisions regarding the manufacturing of 80 pits per year, highlighting the need for data to determine facility requirements. It emphasizes the uncertainty of available resources and questions the validity of extrapolated requirements. The report discusses the need to calculate space and material requirements for manufacturing 80 pits per year. It questions the value of extrapolated requirements and emphasizes the uncertainty of available resources. Decisions regarding analytical chemistry to support pit manufacturing will be necessary. The current pit fabrication line is being upgraded to increase its capacity from 10 to 30 pits per year, with further upgrades needed to reach 80 pits per year. Pit manufacturing involves tasks such as casting hemishells of plutonium, machining them, welding them together, purifying plutonium, certification, material control, waste management, and analytical chemistry. Analytical chemistry is crucial for analyzing plutonium samples at various fabrication stages to determine isotopic composition. Analytical chemistry (AC) is crucial in determining the isotopic composition of plutonium and identifying impurities during pit fabrication. The current facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory performing AC is in poor condition, prompting the need for alternative facilities by 2019. Laboratory floor space is essential for conducting AC, pit fabrication, and other tasks, measured in square feet. \"Material At Risk\" (MAR) quantifies the radioactive materials susceptible to physical stress. The MAR allowance in buildings working with plutonium is expressed in units of plutonium equivalent. Plutonium-239 (Pu-239) is the fissile isotope in pits, while weapons-grade plutonium (WGPu) contains other isotopes making it 1.5 times more radioactive. Plutonium-238 (Pu-238) is 277 times more radioactive than Pu-239 and is relevant to pit manufacturing options. 40% of the MAR allowance in PF-4 is allocated to Pu-238. Moving some or all Pu-238 work out of PF-4, the main plutonium building at LANL, would free up MAR and space for other purposes. PF-4 is the only building in the United States with the necessary attributes for pit manufacturing, such as high security and pit fabrication equipment. LANL has the expertise needed to make pits, as it has been the sole producer since 1989. PF-4 also handles other tasks involving plutonium. PF-4 is the last U.S. plutonium processing facility, located at LANL in Technical Area 55. The Chemistry and Metallurgy Research building is old and structurally unsound, prompting plans to cease operations there by 2019. The Radiological Laboratory-Utility-Office Building, completed in FY2010, is configured for plutonium tasks. The Radiological Laboratory-Utility-Office Building (RLUOB) was completed in FY2010 and is configured for AC equipment to support pit manufacture. An approach called Quantification of Margins and Uncertainties (QMU) was developed by LANL and LLNL to maintain confidence in nuclear weapons without testing. The Quantification of Margins and Uncertainties (QMU) approach was developed by LANL and LLNL to ensure the reliability of nuclear weapons without testing. QMU involves quantifying each step or \"gate\" in a nuclear weapon's functionality and considering margins and uncertainties in energy transmission for detonation. The Quantification of Margins and Uncertainties (QMU) approach developed by LANL and LLNL ensures nuclear weapon reliability without testing. It involves quantifying each step or \"gate\" in a weapon's functionality, considering margins and uncertainties in energy transmission for detonation. Margin is the space available for pit manufacturing exceeding space required, and MAR available for pit. Confidence in weapon functionality is determined by margin exceeding uncertainty at each gate. The Quantification of Margins and Uncertainties (QMU) approach developed by LANL and LLNL ensures nuclear weapon reliability without testing by quantifying margins and uncertainties in energy transmission for detonation. Margin is the space available for pit manufacturing exceeding space required, and MAR available for pit. Congress would need to obtain two numbers: Space required to manufacture 80 ppy, and MAR required to manufacture 80 ppy to determine options for freeing up space and MAR in PF-4 for manufacturing 80 ppy. The QMU approach developed by LANL and LLNL quantifies margins and uncertainties in energy transmission for detonation to ensure nuclear weapon reliability without testing. Congress needs to determine if there is enough space and MAR in PF-4 to manufacture 80 ppy. Uncertainties in margins can change over time due to various factors. The longer the timeframe, the more uncertainties can be expected to emerge in maintaining margin for pit manufacturing. Congress or NNSA could prevent new missions consuming MAR and space in PF-4 to preserve margin. It is crucial to develop multiple means to counterbalance uncertainties to support pit manufacturing capacity. To maintain margin for pit manufacturing capacity, developing multiple means to counterbalance uncertainties is crucial. Determining the necessary MAR and space for manufacturing 80 pits per year would require an industrial process analysis. LANL plans to increase PF-4's capacity to 30 pits per year, providing an upper bound for production capabilities. A study is needed to determine if enough space and equipment can be made available in PF-4 to manufacture 80 pits per year. Efficiencies may allow for less space and equipment than initially thought. Annual reviews of margin and potential factors affecting it could be beneficial. A study is needed to assess the space and equipment availability in PF-4 for manufacturing 80 pits per year. Various organizations like LANL, NNSA, DOD, or independent groups could conduct the study. LANL's familiarity with PF-4 could be beneficial, but there may be a conflict of interest. One approach could be for LANL to conduct the initial study and have an independent group review it, or for LANL to collaborate with LLNL for a joint study and review process. LLNL's expertise could be valuable in evaluating a LANL study on manufacturing capacity for pits. The Nuclear Weapons Council needs to define key parameters such as capacity and operating tempo before the study can begin. The capacity sought and operating shifts will impact cost and equipment requirements. Collaboration between LANL and LLNL could provide added confidence in the study. LANL's study on manufacturing capacity for pits requires defining key parameters such as capacity, operating shifts, and cost considerations. Options include operating at full capacity, in standby mode, or at a steady rate below 80 pits per year. Considerations include moving programs out of PF-4 to create space, associated costs, and tradeoffs between cost and capacity. Collaboration between LANL and LLNL could enhance the study's confidence. The report discusses the cost and feasibility of manufacturing 80 pits per year, totaling $2 billion for construction and $700 million in annual operating costs. It highlights the need for a sensitivity analysis and judgment on the value of the added capacity. The report examines both static and dynamic approaches to pit manufacturing, considering space and margin margins, and the impact of uncertainties on future deviations from the baseline. The report discusses three decisions Congress may consider regarding pit manufacturing and analytical chemistry requirements. Decision 1 focuses on providing enough margin for space and MAR in PF-4. Decision 2 considers maintaining margins for pit manufacturing over decades. Decision 3 addresses the excess space and MAR available for analytical chemistry and the allocation of work between LANL and other sites. Manufacturing 30 ppy in PF-4 would fully consume the available space and MAR allowance. LANL is working on projects to increase the MAR allowance in PF-4 due to concerns about seismic risks. The current MAR allowance is 1,800 kg PE, but upgrades may increase it back to 2,600 kg PE. The space data used is from 2012. LANL's PF-4 building is crucial for nuclear weapons production, with limited space and Material-At-Risk (MAR). Efforts are being made to repurpose space within PF-4 for pit manufacturing. The absolute space limit is 60,000 sf, and if more space is needed for manufacturing, alternatives like building modules or reducing capacity would be necessary. Options are being considered to make more space available in LANL's PF-4 building for pit manufacturing, with varying costs and timelines. The amount of space and MAR needed could change depending on production requirements, and some options may require major construction while others may not. Options are being considered to create additional space in LANL's PF-4 building for pit manufacturing, with varying costs and timelines. Decisions on deployment would depend on space availability and reduction in space margin. Figure 2 shows the 2012 space allocation in PF-4, with available space for immediate repurposing. One option involves building reinforced-concrete modules. One option for creating additional space in LANL's PF-4 building involves building reinforced-concrete modules near PF-4 connected by a tunnel. Each module would provide roughly 5,000 sf of laboratory space for high-MAR tasks like working with plutonium. Moving tasks into these modules could release space in PF-4 for pit manufacturing, adding a total of 26,700 sf for pit work. LANL proposes building reinforced-concrete modules near PF-4 connected by a tunnel to create additional space for pit manufacturing. The modules would allow for expansion of capacity as needed, releasing space in PF-4 for pit work. Other options include building a module for Pu-238 work or pit casting, or moving Pu-238 work to other sites like Savannah River Site or Idaho National Laboratory. The NNSA is considering various options to release space in PF-4 for pit manufacturing, including modifying buildings at Idaho National Laboratory. One option involves repurposing space in PF-4, resulting in 26,300 sf for pit work. Another option is to build modules for lower-MAR activities currently housed in PF-4, which would release about 6,800 square feet of lab space. The feasibility of these options would require evaluating space, MAR at other sites, and associated costs. LANL plans to repurpose space in PF-4 for lower-MAR activities, releasing 6,800 square feet of lab space. This would require Hazard Category 3-level facilities, with costs comparable to Hazard Category-2 modules. The current 12,000 sf available for pit fabrication can produce 30 ppy with upgrades, but space needed for 80 ppy would not increase linearly due to equipment constraints. Each piece of equipment has a specific throughput, impacting the space required for fabrication. Determining space needed for 80 ppy in PF-4 involves analyzing the entire manufacturing process, including infrastructure, material control, and sample analysis logistics. Turnaround time for samples onsite or offsite affects glovebox and storage requirements, impacting space needs. The analysis of space requirements for 80 pits per year in PF-4 must consider the impact of sample analysis logistics on gloveboxes and storage. Plutonium for pit fabrication must be purified from \"old\" sources, such as retired pits, through chemical processes to remove decay byproducts like uranium and americium. Plutonium must be purified for use in new pits by removing uranium and americium through chemical processes. PF-4 uses 10,400 sf for plutonium recycle and purification. The capacity could support how much plutonium per year and how many ppy. More space would be needed for 80 ppy. Pit fabrication generates plutonium scraps that require space for recycle. Producing 80 ppy would require more space than 30. Efficient use of existing space could increase the space margin. LANL is redesigning the existing pit fabrication space in PF-4 to increase production to 30 ppy from 10, which would reduce space requirements for 80 ppy. This involves developing faster work flow processes and repurposing unused space to maximize efficiency. Making use of PF-4's basement for storage and utilities is also being considered. Efficient use of PF-4's basement for nuclear materials vault, shipping, and waste drums. Move equipment like the gas gun to free up space. Consider using two or three shifts a day to reduce space requirements. The Rocky Flats Plant operated using three shifts per day to reduce space requirements. Increasing operating tempo could lead to higher costs, more maintenance, and equipment failures. Different tasks at PF-4 used varying percentages of the MAR allowance, with Pu-238 work using 24.5% and pit fabrication using 16.4%. The total MAR allowance for PF-4 on February 27, 2013, was 1,800 kg PE. The analysis assumes seismic upgrades increase PF-4 MAR to 2,600 kg PE. If the newly-available 800 kg PE of MAR is allocated to pit manufacturing, 57.0% of the MAR in PF-4 would be available for pit work. If adding 800 kg of MAR is not enough to support 80 ppy, other options could release more MAR. Option 1 in Table 3 would relocate 198 kg of MAR from PF-4 by using two modules for Plutonium Recycle and Purification processes. Module 1 would handle aqueous processes, while Module 2 would manage molten plutonium, eliminating PRP within PF-4. This option aims to redistribute MAR within the facility. Option 2 would relocate Pu-238 MAR from PF-4 to one module, freeing up space and releasing 91% of the MAR in those programs. Pit fabrication would receive 72.4% of the MAR in PF-4, requiring fewer modules and releasing more MAR than Option 1. Option 3 would move all Pu-238 work to other locations, freeing up all MAR and more space compared to Option 2. Option 2 suggests strengthening PF-4 seismically to reduce the risk of building collapse and prevent plutonium escape in case of a collapse. Steps include wrapping columns in carbon fiber, anchoring walls and ceilings more securely, installing braces, shear walls, and a drag strut on the roof. Other measures involve using containers designed to withstand collapse in production areas, removing combustible material, and anchoring gloveboxes to the floor more securely. Anchoring gloveboxes more strongly to the floor to reduce the risk of exposure to plutonium in case of an earthquake. Analytical chemistry involves minimal material-at-risk (MAR) using small plutonium samples dissolved in acid. However, it requires more space per unit MAR compared to pit fabrication due to the need for gloveboxes or hoods. Increasing analytical chemistry capacity is necessary to produce 80 pits per year. NNSA plans to halt programmatic operations in the CMR building by 2019. To achieve a capacity of 30 pits per year by FY2026, work currently done in CMR would need to be relocated. Producing 80 pits per year would require additional analytical chemistry (AC) work, as each pit requires multiple samples to be processed. Finding space and material-at-risk (MAR) for AC should be easier than for pit manufacture due to excess capacity in the nuclear weapons complex. The complex has excess space and MAR suitable for AC at various buildings, including LLNL, SRS, and LANL. These facilities have enough space and MAR allowance to support the manufacture of 80 pits per year. R&D efforts may reduce MAR requirements, with LANL validating an AC system that could significantly decrease sample sizes. The issue at hand is determining where AC should be conducted and how much should be done at LANL versus another site. The need for conducting AC for 80 pits per year is being discussed, with the question of whether it should be done at LANL or another site. LANL's primary focus is on laboratory work, and conducting AC on an industrial scale may not significantly enhance its technical competence. Space constraints at LANL, especially with current MAR limits, may make it challenging to accommodate AC for 80 pits per year. Collaboration between LANL and a second site for cross-checking AC measurements and processes is suggested. A second site for conducting AC could provide a backup in case operations at LANL were disrupted, increase confidence in results through cross-checking, and offer additional trained technicians. However, keeping all AC at LANL may be more cost-effective and reduce the risk of accidents associated with shipping plutonium samples. Concentrating plutonium work at LANL would ensure uniform training and procedures among technicians, strengthening the facility's capabilities. LANL could strengthen its position as the nation's plutonium center by concentrating plutonium work there. Data on facility capacities and costs of LANL, LLNL, and SRS options are needed for decision-making. NNSA found that LANL could likely conduct all needed work with proper equipment. NNSA found that RLUOB would have sufficient space for needed equipment, with planning conducted by personnel from NNSA headquarters, Los Alamos Field Office, and Los Alamos National Laboratory. A Radiological Facility like RLUOB can hold up to 38.6 grams of Pu-239E or 26 grams of WGPu, with minimal safety or security measures required. In contrast, a Hazard Category (HC) 3 facility can hold between 38.6 grams and 2,610 grams of Pu-239E or 26 to 1,760 grams of WGPu. NNSA considered various options for raising facility capacities. NNSA considered options to raise the MAR limit in RLUOB, including retrofitting for HC-3 or creating a new Hazard Category 4. The limits on plutonium are based on potential dose to workers and offsite personnel in a worst-case accident scenario. NNSA considered options to increase the amount of WGPu in RLUOB above 26 grams. They calculated that with 400 grams of WGPu, RLUOB could operate as an HC-3 facility without significant modifications, as the dose from a worst-case accident would still be below DOE Orders thresholds. Operating RLUOB as an HC-3 facility would not require congressional approval, with oversight coming through normal reviews associated with the CMRR line item construction project. NNSA plans to include funds for two subprojects in the CMRR line item construction project starting in FY2016, including adding new AC equipment to RLUOB to support 80 ppy. The REI-2 project involves installing equipment for AC and plutonium chemistry. The PEI project includes decontaminating rooms, removing old gloveboxes, and installing new MC equipment for plutonium physics. NNSA aims to complete tasks for CMRR-NF with a projected cost between $3,710 million and $5,860 million. The path forward would cost less by avoiding building a large plutonium facility. The NNSA requested FY2015 funds for the AC and MC subprojects as part of the Program Readiness component of Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities (RTBF) under the Weapons Activities account. The House Appropriations Committee recommended funding these projects under the CMRR line item instead of Program Readiness, in line with previous directives for transparency and accountability in CMR replacement activities. The funding for the CMRR project lacks transparency and accountability. The additional work requested aligns with the original mission need for analytic chemistry and material characterization space. Reconfiguration activities for PF-4 should be limited to equipping lab space previously housed in the legacy CMR building. Construction of new facilities and equipment installation for enhanced pit production capabilities are not directly related to the original project's mission. The Committee does not support including additional activities as subprojects within the existing CMR replacement project. NNSA aims to exit the CMR building due to safety concerns, including seismic vulnerability and structural integrity issues. A comparison shows that having 9 kg of plutonium in CMR poses a greater risk than having 400 grams in RLUOB. LANL could potentially support manufacturing up to 80 ppy with the implementation of NNSA's plan. LANL has provided data on space and MAR for pit manufacturing up to 80 ppy. The key question is whether other sites should also perform AC. Various construction and non-construction options could increase space and MAR margins, but data alone cannot determine which options provide enough margin. Seismic improvements may allow PF 4 to accommodate 80 ppy, or relocating Pu-238 programs could free up enough MAR but not space, or moving programs to another site might be sufficient. Other factors may also play a role. LANL has provided data on space and MAR for pit manufacturing up to 80 ppy. The feasibility of different options for pit manufacturing and AC capacity at LANL is discussed, highlighting the need for data on building condition and cost for upgrades. Figure 8 outlines a decision sequence for downselecting pit manufacturing options. The feasibility of pit manufacturing options at LANL is determined by comparing data on required MAR and space against what each option provides. Feasible options are then assessed for affordability to eliminate unaffordable choices. After downselecting to feasible and affordable options, other criteria are considered for a final decision. Changes in MAR and space margins over time may impact feasibility. Data on MAR margin, space margin, and cost are crucial for decision-making. Congress would need data on MAR margin, space margin, and cost for various pit manufacturing options to determine feasibility and affordability. Questions regarding MAR and space sufficiency for pit manufacturing and supporting AC for 80 ppy need to be answered with data. Data on available space in PF-4 and the space needed for pit fabrication tasks are crucial for decision-making. MAR and space sufficiency for pit manufacturing and Pu-238 work in PF-4 need to be assessed. Moving Pu-238 work to other sites or modules may free up space, but data on MAR distribution and feasibility of manufacturing 80 ppy is needed for decision-making. Assessment of space in PF-4 for pit manufacturing and Pu-238 work is crucial. Moving Pu-238 work to other sites or modules could potentially create unused space in PF-4, but data on MAR distribution and feasibility of manufacturing 80 ppy is needed for decision-making. If the MAR limit for RLUOB is increased to 400 grams of WGPu for AC, how much more MAR and space would be needed for AC at LLNL or SRS? If the 26-gram limit is retained for RLUOB, would it be less costly to perform the remaining AC at LLNL or at SRS? LANL is conducting projects to bolster the seismic robustness of PF-4, which may increase PF-4's MAR allowance from 1,800 to 2,600 kg PE. If 2,600 kg PE is not enough MAR, could additional projects raise the MAR allowance enough to accommodate manufacture of 80 ppy, and what would they cost? LANL is considering the cost and feasibility of manufacturing 80 pits per year. They aim for decreasing costs with each module but acknowledge that some lessons learned may increase costs. Questions arise about the estimated cost of the first and second modules, the sensitivity of pit manufacturing costs to capacity, and potential tradeoffs. Congress would need to assess if there is enough space and MAR margin for 80 pits per year. The report shows available space and MAR for pit manufacturing, but the required space and MAR for 80 pits per year have not been calculated. Congress may request these numbers. The key decisions for Congress include ensuring enough space and MAR in PF-4 for pit manufacturing, maintaining these margins over time, and determining the amount of analytical chemistry (AC) to be done at LANL. Analytical Chemistry (AC) at LANL analyzes plutonium samples from pit manufacturing stages to measure isotopic composition, alloying materials, and impurities. Certification for war reserve use involves validating weapons codes with experimental data supported by PF-4. This includes preparing samples for AC and materials characterization, as well as test items for experiments at the Nevada National Security Site. Materials Characterization (MC) at the Nevada National Security Site measures bulk properties of plutonium for pit design certification, process control, and examining pit conditions. Materials Recycle and Recovery (MR&R) repackages deteriorated plutonium containers for permanent disposition. Pit Disassembly and Conversion in PF-4 converts excess pits to plutonium oxide for storage. Pit Fabrication involves casting hemishells of plutonium, machining them, welding two together to form a pit, and inspecting it with x-ray imaging and physical measurements. Pit Surveillance at Pantex Plant and PF-4 includes monitoring pit condition through physical measurements, gas release checks, corrosion examination, and disassembly for plutonium sampling. Plutonium-238 (Pu-238) Programs involve manufacturing heat sources for space probes and military applications by bombarding neptunium-237 rods with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. PF-4 purifies old Pu-238, removes impurities, and makes plutonium oxide for capsules. Capsules are used for military RPSs or sent to Idaho National Laboratory for space probe RPSs. Plutonium Recycle and Purification (PR&P) area recovers plutonium from scrap for reuse. The PF-4 facility recovers plutonium from scrap materials through chemical processes, producing plutonium oxide for use in weapons and other programs. The facility also houses the Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities (RTBF) program, which supports various functions like shipping, waste management, and material control and accountability."
