    "content": "Bisphenol A (BPA) is a synthetic chemical compound produced in large quantities in the United States for manufacturing certain forms of plastic. It can migrate from containers into food or liquids, prompting concerns about potential toxicity. The National Toxicology Program conducted a review on BPA in 2008, leading to calls for federal restrictions on its use. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates BPA in food containers and previously deemed current uses safe. However, in response to criticism, FDA is reviewing its risk assessment and considering exposures from other products. FDA announced in 2010 that it is evaluating recent scientific evidence and conducting additional studies on the potential health effects of low doses of BPA exposure. The controversy surrounding the potential health effects of low doses of BPA exposure is fueled by mounting animal evidence of harmful effects. BPA can interfere with estrogen action, leading to developmental changes in rodents such as altered brain and behavior, precancerous lesions, and early puberty. Conducting low-dose experiments is challenging due to BPA's ubiquitous presence in the environment, resulting in varying study outcomes. Some scientists argue that existing studies on BPA have inconsistent results and do not warrant stricter regulations, while others believe that well-designed studies on rodents show the toxicity of low doses of BPA, calling for reduced exposure in vulnerable populations. Studies have demonstrated biological effects in rodents at low levels of exposure to estrogenic compounds, raising questions about potential impacts on human health. Recent research suggests that low levels of BPA exposure may have health effects beyond reproduction and development. Studies using animal models, human cells, and epidemiological data have shown potential impacts on metabolic hormones like insulin, possibly increasing the risk of obesity and diabetes. Long-term studies are needed to determine the specific health effects of high BPA levels. The \"low-dose hypothesis\" challenges the traditional toxicology belief that the dose makes the poison. It suggests that some chemicals known to be toxic at high levels may still harm health at lower levels of exposure. Endocrinologists argue that the relationship between dose and effect is not always linear, and health effects at low exposure levels may differ from those at higher doses. Some scientists argue that low-dose exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals like BPA can cause adverse developmental effects, even when higher doses show no adverse effects. Hormones regulate organ responses, and slight changes in hormone levels can impact endocrine systems, potentially affected by low-dose exposure to chemicals like BPA. Exposure to Bisphenol A (BPA) from food and beverages can disrupt hormonal systems, with higher levels found in children. Infants and children have the highest daily intake of BPA, especially through formula feeding with PC baby bottles. BPA exposure levels in humans are similar to levels found in breast milk. Exposure to Bisphenol A (BPA) from sources other than food, such as medical devices, is a concern due to potential health effects, especially in premature or critically ill infants. Other potential sources of exposure are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In July 2010, studies indicated that skin contact with BPA in thermal paper coatings may contribute significantly to human exposure. BPA is potentially regulated by various agencies including EPA, CPSC, OSHA, and FDA. EPA focuses on protecting public health and the environment from risks associated with industrial chemicals like BPA. EPA has a \"chemical action plan\" for BPA released in March 2010. The EPA released a plan in March 2010 to regulate BPA as a chemical of concern due to its potential long-term adverse effects on growth, reproduction, and development in aquatic species. The plan may lead to additional rulemaking and toxicity testing to assess BPA's impact on the environment. The EPA is considering toxicity testing for BPA's effects on environmental organisms at low concentrations. They are also looking into sampling and monitoring water and soil for BPA levels. Collaborative activities aim to reduce BPA releases, with a focus on finding alternatives in thermal paper. The FDA is responsible for the safety of most foods, the primary source of human BPA exposure. The FDA is responsible for regulating BPA in food containers like baby bottles and infant formula cans. They are considering stricter regulations under a new food contact notification program to review safety information provided by manufacturers. Additional studies on low-dose BPA exposure are being conducted by the FDA's National Center for Toxicological Research. A draft technical report is expected by the end of 2011. The FDA is responsible for regulating BPA in food containers and is working on a draft technical report expected by the end of 2011. A final report is expected in 2012. The agency has requested information on BPA in various products and is reviewing proposals to study its effects from drugs and medical devices due to limited information available. The safety debate surrounding BPA has intensified in recent years. In early 2007, NTP convened an expert panel to review scientific literature on BPA. The panel concluded that animal studies raised \"some concern\" about BPA's effects on fetal and newborn neurological development, but had \"minimal concern\" about early puberty or cancer development. Some scientists disagreed with these conclusions. NTP's own scientists reviewed the panel report and additional studies not considered by the panel. NTP reviewed additional studies not considered by the expert panel and issued a draft report expressing higher concern for early puberty and effects on mammary and prostate glands. The report stated that there is \"some concern\" for neural and behavioral effects in fetuses, infants, and children at current exposure levels. Public comments were invited, and the NTP Board of Scientific Counselors voted to lower concerns. The board voted to lower the level of concern for BPA's effects on the mammary gland and puberty in females. The final NTP brief reflects this decision, stating \"some concern\" for brain, behavior, and prostate gland effects in fetuses, infants, and children. FDA formed a task force in April 2008 to review BPA in FDA-regulated products. The FDA formed a task force in April 2008 to review BPA in all FDA-regulated products. In August 2008, FDA published a draft risk assessment of BPA in food contact applications, stating that there is an adequate margin of safety at current exposure levels. Consumer groups and some Members of Congress questioned the findings, raising concerns about industry-sponsored studies and the need for considering more recent evidence. The FDA relied on industry-sponsored studies for assessing BPA in FDA-regulated products, considering them robust evidence due to following good laboratory practices. They also requested information on BPA leaching from various products, including medical devices and biological products. The BPA Subcommittee of the FDA Science Board reviewed FDA's draft risk assessment on various products, including medical devices, biological products, and drugs. The subcommittee agreed with FDA's focus on food and children's exposures but disagreed on other matters, suggesting more emphasis on cumulative and non-food exposures. They concluded that FDA's Margins of Safety were inadequate. FDA responded to the subcommittee's concerns in a letter on December 3, 2008. In December 2008, FDA agreed with the BPA Subcommittee's concerns and planned further assessments, including looking into sources of exposure other than food. In January 2010, FDA expressed concerns about the potential effects of BPA on the brain, behavior, and prostate gland in fetuses, infants, and young children. They are conducting in-depth studies with the National Toxicology Program to clarify uncertainties about BPA risks and are taking steps to reduce human exposure to BPA in the food supply. FDA's struggles with BPA regulation highlight systemic problems within the agency, as identified by the FDA Science Board in a critical report. The board found that FDA's regulatory mission was compromised by inadequate resources, including workforce size and capability, leading to a \"state of crisis\" in the food safety program. Congress increased FDA's food safety budget by 45% from FY2008 to FY2011 to address these issues. FDA has not announced any new findings or changes. The FDA has not made any new findings or changes in its regulatory approach to BPA since January 2010. Many states have enacted legislation to restrict BPA in products for infants and children, while others have authorized studies or expressed support for developing alternatives. Some states have introduced legislation to ban BPA in children's products, but it has failed to advance in several states. Canada was the first country to designate BPA as a toxic substance on October 13, 2010, enabling the Minister of the Environment to propose regulations to manage health and environmental risks. They have taken various actions, such as publishing a risk assessment in April 2008. The Canadian government banned polycarbonate baby bottles in March 2010 due to concerns about BPA exposure to newborns and infants, even though levels were below those that could cause health effects. The European Food Safety Authority has a different stance on the safety of low-level BPA exposures. The European Food Safety Authority panel concluded that there is no new evidence to change the current Tolerable Daily Intake level for BPA, despite some studies showing adverse effects on animals at low doses. The relevance of these findings for human health is uncertain, and there is no convincing evidence of adverse effects on behavior from BPA exposure. The World Health Organization (WHO) and U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) held an expert meeting in November 2010 to assess the safety of BPA. The expert panel concluded that there is insufficient evidence to judge the carcinogenic potential of BPA and further investigation is necessary to address uncertainty regarding its effects on behavior and reproductive endpoints. Ongoing studies are needed to clarify the neurobehavioral effects of BPA exposure. The European Union, China, and Malaysia have banned BPA in certain products. Concerns raised by the NTP prompted companies like Wal-Mart and Nalgene to stop using BPA in beverage bottles. The American Chemistry Council (ACC) urged the FDA to review the safety of BPA in food contact applications, citing extensive scientific studies. In response to concerns, major baby bottle manufacturers stopped selling BPA-containing bottles in the US. The ACC reiterated FDA's assessment that current uses of BPA were safe. The market shifted towards BPA-free alternatives for plastic bottles. Manufacturers of cans argue that suitable alternatives to BPA are not available for can linings, necessary for preventing food spoilage and food poisoning risks. A \"green\" capital management company reported progress in commercializing substitutes for BPA epoxy can linings. In 2009, measurable amounts of BPA were found in food brands labeled \"BPA-free,\" leading to concerns about its ubiquity in the food supply. Proposed bills in Congress aimed to ban BPA in food containers, with some bills also focusing on children's food and beverage containers. H.R. 5820 in the 111th Congress aimed to prioritize BPA for safety assessment and regulation under the Toxic Substances Control Act. The bill required stringent safety standards for BPA use, with conditions to minimize risks to health and the environment. The House passed H.R. 2749, the Food Safety Enhancement Act of 2009, with conditions to minimize risks related to BPA in food and beverage containers. The Senate did not act on the bill, but Senator Dianne Feinstein proposed banning BPA in baby bottles. Senator Dianne Feinstein proposed banning the use of BPA in baby bottles and sippy cups in the Senate bill S. 510, but later abandoned the effort due to opposition. Concerns about the adverse effects of BPA exposure, especially in infants, continue to fuel scientific debate and are expected to impact policy and regulatory decisions."
