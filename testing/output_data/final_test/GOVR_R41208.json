    "content": "The 911 call systems currently in use rely on outdated analog technology, hindering the integration of modern communication innovations. Critics argue that this obsolete system restricts the use of advanced features on devices and hampers the development of specialized equipment and services. As a result, these systems are costly to maintain, at risk of failure, and unable to meet consumer expectations for accurate and timely responses to emergency calls. The 911 system is outdated and in need of modernization to support digital communications. The analog system hinders text messages, causes delays and dropped calls, and loses location information. The National Emergency Number Association (NENA) report highlights the urgent need for modernization. Next Generation 911 technology (NG9-1-1) is seen as the solution for updating hardware, software, data, and operational procedures for emergency services. NG9-1-1 is essential for modernizing the 911 system, with IP-enabled networks sharing capacity with other users. Future decisions must consider resource sharing with other broadband initiatives. Implementation requires changes in operational procedures, training, funding models, and regulations. The National Emergency Number Association (NENA) has been leading the development of NG9-1-1 since 2003, in partnership with various industry, government, and public safety organizations. Support for NG9-1-1 comes from a broad base including state and local emergency communication managers and associations like NENA, COMCARE, NARUC, APCO, and NASNA. Many other national and international associations are also actively involved in supporting NG9-1-1. Various national, state, and local associations, as well as corporations and commercial organizations, are actively supporting NG9-1-1. Partnerships and alliances such as the 911 Alliance, ATIS, IETF, and the E9-1-1 Institute provide support, along with government agencies like the DOT and NHTSA. NENA and DOT have collaborated on NG9-1-1 deployment, including funding proof-of-concept pilots. Several states and the District of Columbia have IP-based networks for emergency communications. The District of Columbia and several states have IP-based networks for emergency communications supporting NG9-1-1 systems. The network overlay for 911 systems enhances interoperability, system resilience, and daily assistance with foreign language support. It also improves connections between 911 call centers, emergency responders, and alert systems, with increased capacity and flexibility for receiving calls in any format. Federal 911 legislative and policy actions are summarized in this section. Federal 911 legislative and policy actions have established a base for the transition to IP-enabled systems. Three major laws supporting improvements in handling 911 emergency calls have been enacted since 1999. Key goals include equality of service and access to 911, improving funding for PSAPs, federal leadership in developing better 911 capabilities, and transitioning to IP-enabled 911 systems. Major bills enacted into law include The Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999 (P.L. 106-81) and The ENHANCE 911 Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-494). The ENHANCE 911 Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-494) and the NET 911 Improvement Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-283) are among the laws supporting 911 improvements. Other legislation includes the 21st Century Emergency Communications Act and the Deficit Reduction Act, providing funding and requirements for emergency communication coordination and backup services for 911. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 and the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 provided financial support for 911 improvements. The Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999 mandated 911 as the national emergency number and required parity of wireless 9-1-1 services with wireline services. The 911 Act mandated the deployment of wireless enhanced 911 service to provide ANI and ALI information to 911 call centers. The FCC worked towards this goal in two phases, with wireless carriers given a year to prepare for PSAP requests in Phase I. The FCC mandated two phases for wireless carriers to implement ANI and ALI capabilities for 911 calls. Delays led to a study commissioned by the FCC, known as the Hatfield Report, which highlighted the importance of location information for first responders in emergencies. The 2007 follow-up study supported by the 9-1-1 Alliance addressed the seriously antiquated infrastructure underlying 911 for emergency calls. The Ensuring Needed Help Arrives Near Callers Employing (ENHANCE) 911 Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-494) responded to concerns raised by the 2002 Hatfield Report and the 9/11 Commission, creating the E-911 Implementation Coordination Office (ICO) to act as a federal champion for 911 deployment. The E-911 Implementation Coordination Office (ICO) was created to oversee a grants program for Phase II E-911 services. In FY2008, DOT budgeted $1.25 million for the ICO's operation. The New and Emerging Technologies (NET) 911 Improvement Act of 2008 extended the duty to provide 911 and E-911 to include IP-enabled voice services. The 911 Act of 1999 extended 911 and E-911 services to include IP-enabled voice services, ensuring parity of access and liability protection for all communication providers. It also mandated a national plan for migration to an IP-enabled 911 network and protected states' rights to levy fees on 911 services. The FCC was already regulating 911 compliance for wireless carriers before the passage of the 911 Act. The FCC established requirements for VOIP service providers to comply with 911 connectivity regulations for wireline and wireless voice. NG9-1-1 implementation involves significant costs for planning, upgrading systems, and maintaining new systems. Policies and legislation may need to address the investments needed for 911 service improvements. The FCC established requirements for VOIP service providers to comply with 911 connectivity regulations for wireline and wireless voice. NG9-1-1 implementation involves significant costs for planning, upgrading systems, and maintaining new systems. Policies and legislation may need to address the substantial investments required to provide improvements, including financial assistance for acquiring needed technology. An analysis by Booz Allen Hamilton found that capital and operating costs for improving the existing 911 system would be comparable to migrating to NG9-1-1, which offers greater opportunities for cost savings and increased operational efficiencies. NG9-1-1 offers greater potential for accessibility, scalability, and safety compared to the current 911 system. Costs for improving 911 infrastructure are divided into four main categories: devices, local networks, call centers, and interfaces with first responders. Funding for these improvements typically comes from communications service providers, state, and local programs. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided grants for investments in broadband infrastructure, including upgrades to local networks for enhanced 911 services. Some areas lack access to up-to-date infrastructure, leading to a lack of basic or enhanced 911 services in those regions. Charges to Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) for communication services may increase as more features are added by local exchanges. The ARRA provided grants for broadband infrastructure investments, including for public safety agencies. While it expanded NG9-1-1 potential reach, long-term funding for a national system was not addressed. The FCC's National Broadband Plan partly addressed upgrading local networks for broadband transmission and funding NG9-1-1 deployment. PSAPs need to invest in equipment for enhanced 911 services, funded by 911 fees. State 911 funds are generated from subscriber fees and used for operating costs, with additional funding sources including state grants and local initiatives. The effectiveness of the 911 system relies on the response network's capacity, which can be limited by outdated equipment and operational constraints. Some states use 911 funds to improve public safety communication networks, separate from 911 system upgrades. The federal grant program administered by the ICO awarded over $40 million in matching grants on September 25, 2009 to help pay for public safety communications networks. Grants were available to all states, Washington, DC, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Territories. Grant funds may be used for purchases of hardware and software for enhanced 911 and IP-enabled systems, training, and alerting systems for wireless devices. Twenty-eight states, Puerto Rico, and American Samoa received grants. Congressional actions and FCC regulations aim to improve 911 infrastructure to support various devices, enhance caller location information, provide wireless support with precision, and accommodate persons with disabilities. Investments in IP-enabled systems support equality and quality goals, especially for groups poorly served by current 911 systems. A digitized system with seamless IP-based connectivity is needed to fully meet the needs of individuals with disabilities, rural residents, and high-rise building occupants. The current analog system can only support text messages to 911 through work-around arrangements. The NET 911 Improvement Act of 2008 mandated the development of a national plan for transitioning to an IP-enabled emergency network capable of receiving all types of emergency communications. This plan aimed to address issues with location identification for 911 calls in both rural and urban areas. The National Plan for transitioning to an IP-enabled emergency network was required to be delivered within 270 days of the bill's enactment. It was to be developed in consultation with various stakeholders and assess trial deployments like NG9-1-1. The plan included steps for governance and recommendations for congressional action to facilitate the transition to IP-enabled technologies for 911 services. The plan for transitioning to an IP-enabled emergency network was submitted without clear federal involvement, potentially relying on state efforts. Congress expected recommendations for action but the plan lacked specific guidance, presented just before the ICO's authority ended. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has been the main federal support for wireless E-911. The Department of Transportation (DOT) has been a key supporter of wireless E-911, creating the Wireless E9-1-1 Steering Council in 2002. In 2005, DOT announced plans for a national framework and deployment plan for an NG9-1-1 system. The program is managed by the Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA) within DOT's Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) program, with assistance from NHTSA and Booz Allen Hamilton. Technical requirements and a concept of operations for NG9-1-1 have been published, along with a strategic outreach plan. The Department of Transportation (DOT) has implemented a strategic outreach plan, developed requirements for the NG9-1-1 system, produced a system design document, and created a transition plan. The primary goal of the NG9-1-1 System is to improve emergency services access and response in the United States, with a focus on saving lives, health, and property. Key features include quicker receipt of robust information, better information from any networked device, geographic-independent call access, increased coordination within the emergency response community, and enhanced data sharing and resources. The emergency response community is focused on increasing data sharing, resources, and standards to improve emergency response. NHTSA is committed to working with stakeholders to support the development of NG9-1-1, including managing a national 911 resource center. NENA has identified six transition policy issues for the transition to NG9-1-1 in a handbook. The handbook outlines proposed actions for establishing a state-level organization for implementing a Next Generation 9-1-1 system, providing resources, updating legislation, and establishing statewide Emergency Services IP networks. It also emphasizes the need for information sharing and confidentiality in delivering data to emergency response organizations. NENA recommends forming regional or state working groups to ensure compliance with confidentiality and liability statutes for NG9-1-1 systems. Local PSAPs will retain decision-making authority for 911 services, while ESInets will require higher governance for coordination and interoperability. Certification and Accreditation programs are being established to ensure full interoperability among system components. NENA established a Certification and Accreditation program for NG9-1-1, sponsoring an Industry Collaboration Event in 2009. The National Broadband Plan (NBP) was submitted to Congress in 2010, including a section on public safety broadband communications. The National Broadband Plan (NBP) submitted to Congress in 2010 included a section on public safety broadband communications, covering NG9-1-1, Emergency Alert System, first responder networks, cybersecurity, and critical infrastructure protection. The plan recommended actions for Congress and other agencies, suggested enacting a federal framework for NG9-1-1, and proposed funding measures to ensure 911 fees are used appropriately. It also urged Congress to reauthorize the ICO for NG9-1-1 deployment. The NBP requested NHTSA to prepare a report on the costs and funding sources for deploying NG9-1-1 by December 1, 2011. The report should detail costs for specific 911 requirements and how they would be shared among PSAPs, broadband service providers, and third-party providers. The FCC proposed including a technical analysis and cost study of different delivery platforms, including VOIP. NHTSA should make recommendations to Congress for public funding based on the report. The NBP also outlined the FCC's plans to address IP-based NG9-1-1 by refreshing a current proceeding on location technology and opening a new proceeding to accommodate various communication technologies beyond traditional voice-centric devices. The plan recommended a national strategy for NG9-1-1 deployment and coordination of emergency communication grants. Regional Emergency Communications Coordination (RECC) Working Groups were formed to include first responders, state and local officials, and 911 call center personnel. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leads the RECC plans. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leads the RECC plans and other emergency communications planning initiatives. The National Emergency Communications Plan (NECP) was issued in July 2008 to provide guidelines and deadlines for emergency managers. Improving 911 systems and PSAP communications is a key objective of the NECP. The National Emergency Communications Plan (NECP) issued by the Department of Homeland Security emphasizes the need for agencies to assess vulnerabilities in communications centers and develop plans for alternative and backup solutions. This includes working with state and local agencies to identify priority vulnerabilities and enhance emergency 911 systems and PSAP communications. The goal is to improve the readiness posture of communications centers and ensure redundant pathways are in place to support communications during emergencies. The Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2007 reorganized FEMA and established Regional Emergency Communications Coordination Working Groups to improve emergency communications coordination among states and various sectors responsible for public safety and security. The Regional Emergency Communications Coordination Working Groups (RECCs) were established in response to public safety community requests to enhance interoperable communications planning for emergency workers. Non-federal RECC members include first responders, state and local officials, emergency managers, and PSAPs. Working groups collaborate with communication providers, hospitals, utilities, and others to shape policies for the transition to NG9-1-1 and coordinate the deployment of new broadband infrastructure for IP-enabled emergency communications. The National Broadband Plan (NBP) sets minimum speeds for broadband services and emphasizes the importance of broadband access for social and economic goals. IP-enabled networks for emergency communications require broadband infrastructure but do not need to connect to the Internet. These networks use the Internet Protocol to provide specific applications for emergency communication needs. The National Broadband Plan (NBP) discusses leveraging federal investment in broadband infrastructure for emergency communications, including first responder networks and emergency alerts. While the plan recognizes common elements of broadband use in emergencies, it does not explicitly address unifying them as a common infrastructure project. The FCC has made recommendations to support the transition to NG9-1-1, but has not provided a policy statement capturing the vision of shared capacity for multiple applications. Others envision the future as a grid or Emergency Services Internet (ESInet). The implementation of IP-enabled NG9-1-1 involves complex decisions on governance, standards, technology, funding, and leadership. Congress aims to address emergency communication needs by recognizing the convergence of technologies and defining the federal role without undermining state or local authority. The Department of Homeland Security plays a key role in guiding policies to sustain and improve 911 as part of its Emergency Communications Plan. This includes reviewing federal regulations to promote competition in network services for PSAPs, designating radio frequency spectrum for connectivity, addressing interface quality with other networks, providing funding solutions, and establishing national guidelines for minimum 911 service levels. Additionally, a program is needed to ensure the steady improvement of 911 services nationwide. A program is essential to improve 911 services nationwide. The full potential of a broadband emergency communications grid, known as the ESInet, must be supported by policymakers. FCC regulations ensure equality of service and access to 911, requiring providers to supply caller information. The 911 Act mandates similar obligations for wireless carriers. The 911 Act and NET 911 Improvement Act extended obligations to wireless carriers and VOIP for transmitting 911 calls. FCC enforces regulations for cell phone, VOIP, and wireline calls to reach the appropriate PSAP. Challenges include providing location information for cell phone and VOIP callers and connections to third-party service providers like telematics systems. The National Emergency Number Association (NENA) maintains a registry of PSAP information for third-party service providers to access. The NET 911 Improvement Act of 2008 authorized the FCC to compile a list of PSAP contact information for public safety benefit. The ENHANCE 911 Act of 2004 extended parity of protection to emergency communications service providers. Location of a caller affects response from a PSAP, with challenges in providing accurate information in rural areas. The Act directed the FCC to grant waivers to Tier III wireless carriers to ensure access to emergency services. The ENHANCE 911 Act of 2004 required the FCC to study Tier III wireless carriers' waiver process for emergency services. The FCC's report in April 2005 did not make technology recommendations. Location information challenges exist in high-density urban areas, where wireless E-911 may only provide a street address, not a floor level. The FCC conducted a test on the accuracy of location information for 911 calls from wireless devices, revealing deficiencies. In response, the FCC proposed rules for carriers to improve location accuracy. Verizon, AT&T, and industry groups questioned the feasibility of the ruling and suggested a 911 working group to establish standards. The FCC withdrew the rules and sought comments on new service rules for location accuracy in September 2008. The FCC is seeking comments on new service rules for location accuracy, as part of the NET 911 Improvement Act of 2008. The Act aims to improve standards and best practices for location identification, including technologies for nomadic devices and buildings. PSAPs and wireless carriers will need to upgrade their technology to meet new requirements, with guidance provided at the state and local level by organizations like NENA and APCO. The NRIC and FCC have provided best practices and guidelines for PSAPs to improve 911 operations, including the development of a common platform for interoperable communications. The NET 911 Improvement Act of 2008 requires a National Plan to ensure an IP-enabled emergency network is available in every community, with a focus on providing 911 support and access for the disabled. The FCC enforces Title IV of the Americans with Disabilities Act for 911 access. Wireless carriers must accommodate TTY calls to 911. The FCC aims to improve 911 support for those with hearing and speech disabilities. The ENHANCE 911 Act of 2004 provided funding mechanisms for 911 with matching grants. Funding authorizations were set up to $250 million annually for program activities and grants. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 authorized the NTIA to borrow up to $43.5 million from spectrum auction proceeds for 911 technology. There are 91 counties in the US without 911 technology. The NET 911 Improvement Act of 2008 amended grant guidelines for 911 technology. The NHTSA will administer the program to help PSAPs install 911 systems. The ENHANCE 911 Act of 2004 penalized states diverting 911 fees for other purposes. The act structured its grants program to refuse funds to jurisdictions misusing 911 fees. The Government Accountability Office prepared a report on state and local 911. The NET 911 Improvement Act of 2008 established reporting requirements for 911 fees to ensure efficiency, transparency, and accountability. It also allows states to collect fees on VOIP services for 911 purposes. The 2008 Farm Bill included provisions for federal funding to improve 911 and emergency communications in rural areas. The bill amends the Rural Electrification Act to include lending authority for expanding or improving 911 access, emergency communications, homeland security communications, transportation safety communications, and location technologies in rural areas. It allows government-collected fees for 911 to be used as surety against loans and permits loans for communications equipment providers. Funding for 911 services is covered by the telecommunications industry and state/local taxes or surcharges on telephone bills. Funding for 911 services comes from the telecommunications industry, state/local taxes, and surcharges on telephone bills. Various sources such as 911 funds, property taxes, and fundraisers support Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs). Federal legislation emphasizes the need for federal leadership in guiding 911 policy. The ENHANCE 911 Act of 2004 recognized the U.S. Department of Transportation's role in supporting 911 services. The FCC regulates wireless communication providers to ensure ANI/ALI information is provided. Public forums have been held since 2003 to discuss 911 deployment. The FCC took action on encouraging states to implement 911 services after the establishment of the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau in 2006. The FCC is taking action to encourage states to develop coordinated statewide deployment plans for emergency communications. They have requested information from each state governor for points of contact and post them on a website. The 2007 appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security required the FCC to submit a report to Congress on the capacity for rerouting 911 calls during disasters. The FCC focused on administrative mechanisms for backup plans in case public safety answering points are disabled during disasters. The report did not address technology limitations or potential improvements. The ENHANCE 911 Act of 2004 mandated coordination between emergency communication systems at federal, state, and local levels. The ENHANCE 911 Act of 2004 mandated coordination between emergency communication systems at federal, state, and local levels, with vendors involved in E-911 services implementation. The act designated the NTIA and NHTSA as co-administrators of an E-911 Implementation Coordination Office to develop a management plan for Congress. Funding from the Deficit Reduction Act allowed the NTIA to move forward with the Next Generation 911 Initiative. The NTIA signed a memorandum with DOT and prepared regulations for grants programs under the Deficit Reduction Act. The NET 911 Improvement Act of 2008 tasked the ICO with creating a National Plan for transitioning to an IP-enabled emergency communications network. This network would support 911 and other citizen-activated calls, improving information-sharing among emergency response entities. The National Plan for transitioning to an IP-enabled emergency communications network was supposed to be delivered in April 2009. It was to be developed in consultation with various stakeholders, including public safety representatives and service providers. The plan aimed to ensure the availability of the emergency network in every community, coordinate at different levels, identify location technology for nomadic devices and buildings, address solutions for those with disabilities, and analyze efforts for automatic location information. Funding barriers were also to be identified and overcome. The curr_chunk discusses the necessary regulatory and funding mechanisms for transitioning to a national IP-enabled emergency network for citizen-activated calls. It includes a proposed timetable, costs, potential savings, and recommendations for legislative changes. Additionally, it assesses information from trial deployments of IP-enabled emergency networks. The curr_chunk discusses the use of 211 and 311 call centers for citizen-activated calls, providing information and assistance in emergency situations. These call centers support various social service hotlines and are used to reduce congestion on 911 lines. Many cities have adopted shared-service communication hubs for these calls. Transitioning to IP-enabled networks could improve service levels and response times for citizen-activated calls, including 211 and 311 calls. Call centers play a crucial role in emergency communications, as seen in the aftermath of events like 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina. Post-disaster evaluations have highlighted the importance of utilizing call centers to assist victims and direct them to necessary resources. The 2005 FEMA evaluation recommended states establish 211 systems for response and recovery. 211 call centers in Florida during the 2004 hurricane season provided various forms of assistance, including managing information, identifying needs, mobilizing resources, and offering long-term support. These call centers also address a wide range of social service needs beyond disaster recovery efforts. In 2008, the Department of Homeland Security awarded a grant to Texas A&M Research Foundation to study 211 calls for disaster response. The study aimed to analyze calls made to 26 211 call centers in Texas before, during, and after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The research could help incorporate 211 call centers into federal emergency response planning and funding. The WERT report after the September 11 attacks recommended national planning for emergency response to include private-sector call centers. Legislation in the 111th Congress proposed funding and improvements for 211 call centers. Questions arose about federal funding for 211 call centers aligning with other priorities like job creation and infrastructure investment. DHS study recommendations might suggest additional funding for 211. The DHS study on 211 may recommend additional funding for emergency response services, providing a new perspective for Congress to consider funding programs. Appendix C lists award recipients of federal grants for 911 programs."
