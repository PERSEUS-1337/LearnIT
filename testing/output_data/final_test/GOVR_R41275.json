    "content": "Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2005, allowing Hamas to become the dominant force in the territory. Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian Authority legislative elections, leading to tensions with Israel and the U.S. designating it as a terrorist organization. Hamas's resistance to peace talks and attacks on Israel have strained relations with Fatah and led to the U.S. cutting off aid to the Palestinians. In 2007, Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip, prompting PA President Abbas to dissolve the government. Israel imposed a blockade on Gaza to prevent arms reaching Hamas and isolate the territory. The blockade in Gaza, imposed by Israel to prevent arms reaching Hamas, has worsened the humanitarian situation in the territory. Operation Cast Lead in 2008-2009 resulted in over 1,000 Palestinian deaths and destruction of infrastructure. Israel tightened the blockade, conditioning its end on the release of IDF Sergeant Gilad Shalit. Israel denies a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, issuing reports on aid transferred into the territory. The Ministry of Defense Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) issues a Weekly Summary of Humanitarian Aid Transferred into Gaza, detailing the number of trucks and persons allowed to enter with food, medicine, and supplies. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Aid (OCHA) reports that the blockade has worsened conditions for Palestinians, deepening poverty and food insecurity, hindering reconstruction, and increasing aid dependence. U.S. non-governmental organizations like CARE and Mercy Corps face challenges in rebuilding Gaza post-Cast Lead. Gazans face difficulties in rebuilding Gaza due to restrictions imposed by Israel, Egypt, and Hamas. Israel controls the delivery of materials needed for infrastructure repair, while Egypt intermittently opens the border crossing at Rafah. Smuggling of goods and weapons through tunnels under the border also occurs. In 2007, smuggling goods and weapons through tunnels under the border helps relieve the blockade, but creates economic distortions. Israeli planes bomb the tunnels, but attacks have not stopped the activity. On May 22, 2010, the MV Mavi Marmara, along with other ships, set sail to deliver humanitarian aid and break the Israeli blockade with about 700 activists from 38 countries. On May 31, Israeli navy intercepted ships carrying activists from 38 countries trying to deliver humanitarian aid and break the Israeli blockade. Commandos took over five ships without incident, but faced resistance on the Marmara where some passengers were armed with weapons. The IDF intercepted ships carrying activists trying to break the Israeli blockade. Passengers on the Marmara were armed with weapons, including broken glass bottles and gas masks. A clash ensued, resulting in nine passengers killed and many injured. The ships were taken to Ashdod for inspection, and Hamas initially refused to allow the aid into Gaza. Hamas initially refused aid into Gaza, stored by Israeli Defense Ministry. U.N. to distribute aid. Israel deported detainees, found weapons on Marmara. Flotilla by Free Gaza Movement and IHH to oppose blockade. The Free Gaza Movement, dedicated to ending the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory, joined forces with the IHH in a \"freedom\" flotilla to Gaza. Former Malaysian Prime Minister raised funds for their participation. Israel intercepted their ships, including the MV Rachel Corrie. The IHH is a humanitarian aid organization with ties to the International Red Cross and operates globally. The IHH, a humanitarian aid organization with ties to the International Red Cross, operates in over 100 countries and has provided aid to various regions including Bosnia, Chechnya, Hurricane Katrina victims, and Haiti earthquake victims. It was involved in the Gaza aid flotilla and contributed two cargo ships to the convoy. Before the raid, an Israeli think tank linked IHH to radical Islamist networks and global jihad elements in the 1990s, but also acknowledged its legitimate humanitarian activities. The think tank released reports alleging IHH used violence on the Mavi Marmara with premeditation. IHH openly supports Hamas and is part of a terrorist organization called Union of Good. IHH has influential connections in Turkey and is believed to be close to the Felicity Party. Turkish government administrators facilitated IHH's aid mission. Yildirim mentioned recent instances of IHH aid workers' \"martyrdom\" in Afghanistan and imprisonment in Israel, with IHH leaders referring to those killed on the Marmara as \"martyrs.\" IHH had about 40 to 50 members aboard the Marmara. Israel's leaders believe that the blockade of Gaza, security measures in the West Bank, and military campaigns against Hezbollah and Hamas have brought about a sense of quiet, if not peace. The Israeli government maintains the blockade on Gaza to prevent weapons from reaching the region, citing past incidents of arms smuggling. Prime Minister Netanyahu insists on the necessity of the blockade to uphold international law and security measures. Netanyahu argued that breaching the blockade would lead to an influx of weapons into Gaza, potentially creating an Iranian port near Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Israeli officials labeled those killed on the Marmara as \"terrorists\" and had previously banned the IHH in 2008. Turkish political parties, including the ruling AKP, supported the IHH's aid efforts for Palestinians, although the Turkish government claimed it was not directly involved. The Turkish government condemned Israel's attack on the flotilla, leading to mass demonstrations in Ankara and Istanbul. Turkey called for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council and criticized Israel for not valuing human lives. Foreign Minister Davutoglu attended the meeting and Turkey also called for NATO representatives in Brussels and the Organization of the Islamic. Turkey condemned Israel's attack on the flotilla, calling it \"banditry and piracy\" and \"murder conducted by a state.\" Foreign Minister Davutoglu criticized Israel's use of force as \"inappropriate\" and \"disproportionate,\" urging the Security Council to condemn Israel's \"act of aggression\" and demand an urgent inquiry. Prime Minister Erdogan described the actions as a \"bloody massacre\" and called for punishment of those responsible. The Israeli government's unfair attack was condemned by Turkey, with Prime Minister Erdogan calling for punishment. Erdogan's anti-Israeli rhetoric has gained regional influence, and his popularity with Arab publics benefits him politically. The anger over the raid is likely to persist, with Erdogan possibly using it for domestic political gain ahead of national elections. Israel's actions have faced near-universal condemnation, with Nicaragua breaking off relations. There has been widespread condemnation of Israel's actions, with several countries taking diplomatic actions and international bodies calling for investigations. The U.N. Secretary General and Human Rights Council have both condemned the violence, while the European Union and China have urged Israel to end the blockade. Russia also called for an impartial investigation. The U.S. voted against an independent inquiry at the U.N. Security Council, which expressed regret over the loss of life during the Israeli military operation in international waters. The UN Security Council condemned the Israeli military operation in international waters against the Gaza convoy, calling for a transparent investigation. It expressed grave concern for the humanitarian situation in Gaza and reiterated the need for sustained flow of goods and humanitarian assistance. British Prime Minister Cameron criticized Israel's actions as unacceptable. Britain, Germany, and France expressed concerns over Israel's actions in the Gaza convoy incident, calling for proportionality and an impartial inquiry into the use of force. The European Union also regretted the loss of life and condemned the violence, emphasizing the need to relaunch the peace process. Israel has launched probes in response to international calls for an investigation into the Gaza convoy incident, appointing former head of the National Security Council Maj. Gen. Giora Eiland to lead an external military probe. The probe will report by July 4 and focus on operational conclusions, including the choice of unit for the operation and military decision-making leading up to it. The Israeli government has appointed Maj. Gen. Giora Eiland to lead an external military probe into the Gaza convoy incident. The probe will focus on operational conclusions and military decision-making. Prime Minister Netanyahu announced the establishment of a special commission chaired by retired Supreme Court Justice Jacob Turkel to inquire into the events of May 31, with foreign observers included. The Israeli government appointed Maj. Gen. Giora Eiland to lead a military probe into the Gaza convoy incident. The commission will investigate the legality of Israel's blockade of Gaza and the actions of those involved in the flotilla. The IDF will provide summaries of the Eiland investigation, and military personnel will not testify. The White House supported Israel's investigation, emphasizing the importance of allowing nations to investigate events related to national security. Turkish Foreign Minister Davutoglu criticized Israel's proposed independent public commission for not being international and demanded a U.N.-supervised international commission with Turkey and Israel's participation for a credible inquiry into the Gaza convoy incident in international waters. Turkish Foreign Minister Davutoglu criticized Israel's proposed commission for not being international and called for a U.N.-supervised international commission with Turkey and Israel's participation for a credible inquiry into the Gaza convoy incident. Turkey threatened to review ties with Israel and implement sanctions if an international commission was not established. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's proposal for an international inquiry remains on the table, with Turkey accepting it and calling on Israel to do the same. Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak expressed reluctance towards the international inquiry. Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak expressed reluctance towards an international probe, while Turkey announced a panel to assess the raid on the Gaza convoy. The United States is navigating between its allies Israel and Turkey, seeking a path that avoids antagonizing either party. State Department urged caution and restraint on Israel before the raid. The White House expressed regret for the loss of life in the incident involving Israel and emphasized the importance of gathering all the facts. The US negotiated with Turkey on a statement condemning the loss of life but did not specifically blame Israel. There was no call for an international investigation due to concerns about bias, referencing past experiences with the U.N. Goldstone Commission. The State Department and U.S. officials support Israel conducting an investigation into the Gaza blockade incident. They criticize the attempt to break the blockade but acknowledge the unsustainable situation in Gaza. The White House and Vice President Biden emphasize finding better ways to provide humanitarian aid to Gaza without compromising Israel's security. Biden also mentions Israel's right to prevent arms smuggling and the Administration's efforts to allow building materials into Gaza. The Administration supports Israel conducting an investigation into the Gaza blockade incident and emphasizes finding better ways to provide humanitarian aid to Gaza without compromising Israel's security. Israel needs a better relationship with the U.S. to make progress in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. The incident at sea led to the rescheduling of a meeting between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Obama. The Administration considered Turkey's support in the Security Council for sanctions on Iran, despite Turkey voting against sanctions due to an agreement with Iran and Brazil. President Obama promised $400 million in aid for the West Bank and Gaza Strip during a meeting with Palestinian Authority President Abbas. The aid allocated for Gaza includes $40 million for UNRWA's Emergency Appeal to improve services, $14.5 million for various projects in Gaza, $10 million for new schools, and $5 million for water system repairs. There is a consensus to lift Israel's blockade on Gaza for economic recovery. President Obama acknowledged the need for Israel to prevent arms from entering Gaza but emphasized the importance of finding new ways to allow for economic development and growth in the region. Hamas is using the flotilla incident for propaganda, and it is crucial for the international community to address the situation in Gaza, which Obama described as \"unsustainable.\" The Israeli government discussed easing procedures at land crossings in Gaza, while Hamas insisted on the release of Palestinian prisoners for any movement on Sergeant Gilad Shalit. One suggestion was to publish a limited list of prohibited goods for security reasons and allow all other goods into the Gaza Strip. The Israeli government agreed to ease procedures for goods entering Gaza, with a focus on security. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and the European Union supported this move. Prime Minister Netanyahu's office announced plans to expand the inflow of civilian goods under international supervision while maintaining security measures to prevent weapons entry. The White House praised the decision as a positive step, but the naval blockade would remain in place. The Prime Minister's Office outlined steps to be implemented quickly, including publishing a limited list of prohibited items limited to weapons and war materiel. The Israeli government agreed to ease procedures for goods entering Gaza, focusing on security. Plans include expanding the inflow of civilian goods under international supervision, adding capacity at land crossings, streamlining entry and exit for humanitarian reasons, and continuing inspections through the port of Ashdod. The White House responded positively to the Israeli government's plans to ease procedures for goods entering Gaza through the port of Ashdod. While some see these measures as a step in the right direction, others, like the Turkish Foreign Ministry and Sergeant Shalit's father, believe more needs to be done to lift the blockade completely. Egypt also announced the indefinite opening of the Rafah crossing, but with restrictions still in place. Some Palestinian Authority officials are concerned about the effectiveness of these efforts. Some Palestinian Authority officials are worried that lifting the blockade could result in a permanently separate Gaza Strip. Prime Minister Fayyad suggested reinstating the 2005 Agreement on Movement and Access, which included EU monitors at the Rafah border crossing. The EU Border Assistance Mission could help the PA reestablish control at the border, but Hamas insists any international intervention must go through them. The Iranian Red Crescent and European groups are planning new aid flotillas to break the blockade on Gaza. The IHH has assembled six ships for a flotilla in July, while the US State Department is discouraging these efforts. Israeli officials warn that ships from Iran and Lebanon will be treated differently. Many believe Israeli-Palestinian peace and an independent Palestinian state are key to preventing future crises in Gaza. U.S. Special Envoy George Mitchell confirms ongoing talks between Netanyahu and Abbas, but prospects for peace remain uncertain due to territorial disputes and divided Palestinian rule. The current crisis marks a significant shift in Turkish-Israeli relations, with President Abdullah Gul stating that relations can never be the same. The friendship between the two countries dates back to the 1990s, when bilateral relations improved alongside Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. Despite the Justice and Development Party (AKP) coming to power in 2002, relations remained stable, with joint military exercises becoming routine. Israel trusted Ankara to mediate peace talks with Syria in 2008, but suspicions arose when the AKP hosted Hamas leader Khalid Mish'al in 2006. Turkish officials support Hamas as a democratically elected group and criticize the international community's double standard on nuclear weapons. Erdogan often mentions Israel's nuclear arsenal when discussing Iran's nuclear ambitions. The widening gap between Turkey and Israel began after Israel's military campaign against Hamas in 2008-2009. Prime Minister Erdogan felt insulted by Israel's actions and took offense at President Peres's defense of the operation. Erdogan's actions gained him popularity in the Arab world. Erdogan's actions, including storming off stage and criticizing Israel, led to a rift between Turkey and Israel. This rift escalated with Turkey canceling Israel's participation in a military exercise and demanding an apology for insults. Erdogan continues to condemn Israel's treatment of Palestinians and warns against changing the character of Jerusalem. After Israel's raid on the flotilla, Turkey's Erdogan declared a turning point in history, recalling its ambassador from Israel and canceling various joint activities. Turkey demands an apology and compensation from Israel, linking improved relations to an international probe and lifting the Gaza siege. Despite this, Turkey does not plan to cancel military contracts with Israel for arms purchases and joint production of vehicles. After the flotilla incident, Israeli defense industries withdrew engineers and flight officers training Turkish forces for the Heron drones. Turkish-Israeli bilateral trade, valued at $2.5 billion in 2009, mainly consisted of Turkey's purchase of military equipment from Israel. A Turkish military delegation tested the last four drones scheduled for delivery in Israel. Foreign Minister Davutoglu threatened to isolate Israel internationally if an international investigation was not established. The flotilla crisis strained relations between the two countries. The flotilla crisis strained relations between Turkey and the United States, with some in Turkey wanting the US to choose between Israel and Turkey. Despite its NATO membership, Turkey is becoming more independent on the international stage, reflecting its growing power and ambition. President Obama conveyed condolences to Prime Minister Erdogan for the sea tragedy. Ankara is pursuing a \"multidirectional\" foreign policy, criticizing the US for its cautious reaction to the flotilla incident and expecting full solidarity. There was a disagreement over Turkey's agreement with Brazil and Iran, with Turkey insisting it followed Obama's guidance. Turkey's foreign policy is multidirectional, criticizing the US for its response to the flotilla incident and seeking solidarity. There was a disagreement over Turkey's deal with Iran, with Turkey claiming it followed Obama's advice. U.S. officials may face challenges in accommodating Turkey's independent foreign policy. The Senate supports Israel's right to self-defense and condemns extremist actions on the Mavi Marmara. H.R. 5501, the American Stands with Israel Act, aims to prevent US participation in the UN Human Rights Council and contributions to UN investigations related to the flotilla incident."
