The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 is amended to allow for optional multiperil coverage for damage from flood or windstorm in the United States, subject to certain limitations and community participation requirements. Optional multiperil coverage for flood or windstorm damage in the United States is allowed under the amended National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, with limitations and community participation requirements. Adequate land use and control measures must be adopted by a public body to be consistent with comprehensive criteria for land management and use related to windstorms. Multiperil coverage cannot duplicate flood insurance coverage for any structure, covering only physical damage from flooding or windstorms. Optional multiperil coverage for flood or windstorm damage in the United States is allowed under the amended National Flood Insurance Act of 1968. This coverage provides for approval and payment of claims upon proof of loss from either windstorm or flooding without the need to identify the specific cause. Actuarial rates ensure that coverage is available on an actuarial basis for the type and class of properties covered. The Director will establish terms of coverage for properties eligible for multiperil coverage, including types, classes, locations, nature and limits of loss or damage, and classification criteria. The regulations for multiperil coverage include classification, limitation, and rejection of risks, minimum premiums, loss deductibles, and other necessary terms and conditions. The aggregate liability for coverage shall not exceed the replacement cost or specified amounts for residential structures. The regulations for multiperil coverage include limits for residential and nonresidential properties. For single-family dwellings, the limit is $500,000, and for structures with multiple units, it is $500,000 per unit. Nonresidential properties have separate limits. For nonresidential properties, including church properties, the insurance coverage limits are $1,000,000 for a single structure and $750,000 for contents and business interruption losses due to flooding or windstorm. The insurance coverage for nonresidential properties is determined based on the profits the business would have earned without the flood or windstorm. The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 is amended to prohibit duplicative coverage for structures already covered by multiperil insurance. Compliance with state and local laws is also required. SEC. 4. COMPLIANCE WITH STATE AND LOCAL LAW. Amends the National Flood Insurance Act to require compliance with state and local laws for windstorm protection measures. Section 1361 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 is amended to include studies and investigations on windstorm prevention measures in windstorm-prone areas, such as land management, zoning, and damage prevention. The Director is authorized to enter into agreements to carry out these activities, including examining laws and regulations related to development in high wind risk areas. The Director is authorized to establish criteria to reduce windstorm damage in windstorm-prone areas and work with state and local governments to encourage adoption and enforcement of these measures. The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 is amended to include a definition of \"windstorm\" as any hurricane, tornado, cyclone, typhoon, or other wind event."
