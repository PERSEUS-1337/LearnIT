    "content": "Congress established federal inspectors general (IGs) to combat waste, fraud, and abuse in federal departments and agencies. These IGs lead independent offices that audit, investigate, and evaluate programs and operations. Over 70 federal agencies have Offices of Inspectors General (OIGs), with substantial independence and powers granted since the mid-1970s. OIGs produce reports with findings and recommendations to increase federal efficiency and address employee allegations. Federal inspectors general (IGs) were established by Congress to combat waste, fraud, and abuse in federal departments and agencies. They are predominantly located in executive branch agencies but also oversee entities in the legislative branch. The Inspector General Act of 1978 governs the appointments, powers, and responsibilities of IGs, as well as the Council of the Inspectors General for Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE), which aims to increase professionalism and effectiveness among OIG personnel. The report provides background on the statutory creation of federal inspectors general (IGs) and their role in combating waste, fraud, and abuse in federal departments and agencies. It discusses the importance of ensuring that IGs have the necessary authorities and access for their investigations, audits, and evaluations, while also protecting sensitive information related to national security or ongoing criminal investigations. The Inspector General Act of 1978 has been amended twice, with the Inspector General Act Amendments of 1988 creating a new set of IGs in designated federal entities (DFEs). The Inspector General Reform Act of 2008 established the Council of the Inspectors General for Integrity and Efficiency, amended reporting obligations, salary, bonus, and award provisions, and added budget protections for IGs. Various laws have granted IGs different authorities and responsibilities, leading to differences among statutory IGs. Statutory Inspector Generals (IGs) have varying appointment methods and authorities, with jurisdiction typically limited to a single agency. Some IGs can audit multiple agencies or programs. Over 70 federal entities have IGs authorized by the IG Act, grouped by appointment method, authorizing statute, and government branch. Statutory Inspector Generals (IGs) have different appointment methods and authorities, including appointment by the President with Senate consent, agency head appointment, and temporary appointments. IGs can be located in various government branches, with over 70 federal entities having IGs authorized by the IG Act. \"Federal establishments\" under the IG Act include Cabinet departments and larger federal agencies. IGs are appointed by the President with Senate consent and can be removed by the President. \"Designated federal entities\" include smaller boards, commissions, and government entities, with IGs appointed and removable by the agency head. Two other executive agencies have their own IGs with separate statutory authorities. Two temporary programs operate under their own authorities and reflect different appointment structures. The Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) is a direct presidential appointee, while the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP) is appointed by the President with Senate consent. Five legislative branch IGs operate under their own statutory authorities, including the Architect of the Capitol, Government Accountability Office, Government Printing Office, Library of Congress, and U.S. Capitol Police. Each IG is appointed and removable by the head of the agency. Inspectors general governed by the IG Act have three main purposes: conducting audits and investigations, providing leadership and coordination for agency programs, and preventing fraud and abuse. Some IGs have additional responsibilities, such as those outlined in the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank legislation expands the duties of Inspectors General (IGs) overseeing federally insured funds. IGs have broad authority to conduct audits and investigations, access records, request assistance, subpoena information, administer oaths, hire staff, receive complaints, and implement incentive programs. However, IGs are not authorized to take corrective action themselves. Inspectors General (IGs) have broad powers to conduct audits and investigations, access records, and receive complaints. However, they are not authorized to take corrective action themselves. IGs have reporting obligations to Congress, the Attorney General, agency heads, and the public, including reporting suspected violations of federal criminal law directly to the Attorney General and submitting semiannual reports to agency heads for submission to Congress within 30 days. Additionally, IGs are required to report \"particularly serious or flagrant problems\" immediately to agency heads for submission to Congress. Inspectors General (IGs) have broad powers and protections, including the authority to hire their own staff and conduct reviews requested by various entities. They serve under the \"general supervision\" of the agency head and report to Congress within seven days with the IG report. Congress mandates certain reviews for IGs, such as annual reviews of federal agencies' information technology security programs. The Inspector General Reform Act of 2008 amended the budget process for establishment and DFE OIGs, providing separate appropriations accounts for presidentially appointed IGs in establishments to prevent funding limitations by agency administrators. Budget estimates are now required to be provided to the affiliated agency, including operations, IG training, and other costs to support the federal IG council. The Inspector General Reform Act of 2008 amended the budget process for establishment and DFE OIGs, providing separate appropriations accounts for presidentially appointed IGs in establishments to prevent funding limitations by agency administrators. The affiliated agency's aggregated budget request to the President must include the OIG's original budget estimate and any response from the IG to suggested changes. The President must include in his budget submission to Congress the IG's original budget estimate, requested amounts for the IG, and comments of the affected IG if the President's budget would inhibit the IG from performing duties. Similar provisions apply to the IGs for the CIA and of the IC, with variations in appointment and removal reflecting the status, location, and permanency of the affiliated agency. All IGs follow laws and practices to ensure impartiality and political nonpartisanship, selected without regard to political affiliation. Inspector Generals (IGs) are selected based on integrity and expertise in various fields. Presidential appointees can only be removed by the President or through impeachment. Differences exist in appointment structure, removal procedures, and term limits for IGs in designated federal entities and legislative branch agencies. The U.S. Postal Service IG can only be removed for cause. The removal of Inspector Generals (IGs) in designated federal entities and legislative branch agencies requires written concurrence from a majority of board or commission members. Coordination among IGs is facilitated by the Council of the Inspectors General for Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE), established by the IG Reform Act of 2008. The Council of the Inspectors General for Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) was created by the IG Reform Act of 2008 to aid coordination among IGs and provide professional training for personnel in IG offices. CIGIE includes all statutory IGs and other relevant officers, with a chairperson from within its ranks and an executive chairperson from the OMB deputy director of management. Other interagency mechanisms, like the Council of Inspectors General on Financial Oversight, have been established by law to improve coordination among IGs. The Intelligence Community Inspectors General Forum was established in 2010 by Congress to improve financial oversight among inspectors. Two administrative organizations, the Homeland Security Roundtable and the Defense Council on Integrity and Efficiency, were also created to coordinate IG activities. A special Integrity Committee within CIGIE investigates alleged misconduct by OIG officials, including IGs themselves. The committee overseeing IGs includes four IGs, the Special Counsel, the Director of the Office of Government Ethics, and the FBI representative who chairs the committee. Congress has the authority to amend the IG Act and oversee IG operations through legislation, letters, and oversight hearings. Recent examples include bills to expand IG oversight and create new IGs for agencies lacking oversight mechanisms. Legislation has been introduced to expand oversight mechanisms for entities, including creating new Inspector General positions and amending appointment structures. For example, P.L. 113-6 established an IG at the Commission on Civil Rights, granting them similar responsibilities as other federal IGs and allowing the use of GAO resources. Various administrative initiatives are also being implemented to ensure competitive pay rates for IGs. The Inspector General Improvement Act aimed to expand the oversight responsibilities of existing IGs to smaller federal entities without OIG oversight. Bills like H.R. 314 and H.R. 6723 sought to require IGs to oversee entities like the Trade and Development Agency and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. However, no further action was taken on these bills. In December 2015, Congress established a new agency-appointed IG to oversee the operations of the AbilityOne Program following a GAO report recommending its creation. The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Inspector General Act of 2013 aimed to establish an IG for the MWAA. The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) operates a two-airport system providing air service for the mid-Atlantic region. A bill was introduced to create a new Inspector General (IG) for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) with dedicated funding and oversight responsibilities. The bill introduced aims to establish an independent Inspector General for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) with dedicated funding and oversight responsibilities. Legislation requires the IG to testify before congressional committees at least twice a year based on the CFPB's and CFPB OIG's semi-annual reports. Similar bills were introduced in previous Congresses. In the 113th Congress, bills were introduced to change the appointment structure of federal IGs, including the NSA IG and NRO IG, to presidential appointments with Senate approval. This change aims to ensure independence in overseeing agency activities, especially those related to privacy concerns. In recent years, Congress has made legislative efforts to increase reporting requirements for inspectors general (IGs), such as the FOIA Act and the Reducing Over-Classification Act. These efforts aim to ensure appropriate oversight and compliance within government agencies. In the 113th Congress, legislative efforts were made to codify pay rates for inspectors general (IGs) at designated federal entities. The Oversight Workforce Improvement Act of 2014 sought to set the average pay of an IG no less than the average total compensation of senior level officials in affiliated agencies. This bill also aimed to require the IG of the Intelligence Community and the IG of the Central Intelligence Agency to be members of CIGIE. The bill aimed to give CIGIE authority to investigate allegations against IG's special counsel or deputy special counsel. It was referred to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, but no further action has been taken. Congressional committees have also held hearings on IG-related issues. At a hearing titled Strengthening Government Oversight, federal IGs from the U.S. Small Business Administration and the U.S. Department of Justice discussed the roles and limitations of IGs. SBA IG Peggy Gustafson suggested exempting IGs from the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act to improve their ability to identify and remove individuals who improperly receive federal assistance. She also mentioned the need for IGs to be exempted from the Paperwork Reduction Act. Ms. Gustafson suggested exempting federal IGs from the Paperwork Reduction Act to enhance their independence and efficiency in accessing records. This proposal came after difficulties accessing information were highlighted in a hearing before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Federal IGs are entitled to access all relevant records, but agencies have been uncooperative in providing requested information. For example, the Peace Corps refused to give records related to sexual assault victims, citing privacy laws. The agency's refusal to provide records to the IG hinders transparency. A hearing highlighted the lack of a centralized database for tracking IG recommendations, hindering oversight by Congress and the public. Chairman of CIGIE supported the idea of a database for IG recommendations. Senator Heidi Heitkamp introduced the Inspector General Recommendation Transparency Act (S. 3109) to require federal IGs to post online a list of recommendations not adopted by agencies, updated every six months for increased oversight and transparency. The Inspector General Recommendation Transparency Act (S. 3109) introduced by Senator Heidi Heitkamp aims to provide more oversight opportunities for the public and help inspectors general save taxpayers money. The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, with no further action taken. This appendix offers information on federal inspectors general, including their establishment years, appointment structures, and types of IGs."
