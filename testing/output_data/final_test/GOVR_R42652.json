    "content": "The Student Non-Discrimination Act (SNDA) aims to prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in public schools. It mirrors Title IX but has some differences. SNDA was previously part of legislation to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. It may be included in similar bills in the current Congress. The Student Non-Discrimination Act (SNDA) aims to prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in public schools. SNDA could be incorporated into bills in the current Congress. Current laws do not explicitly prohibit discrimination in schools based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Title IX and other civil rights statutes bar discrimination in education on different grounds. The civil rights statutes prohibit discrimination based on race, color, sex, religion, disability, or national origin in federally funded programs or activities, including public schools. While these laws do not explicitly cover sexual orientation or gender identity, discrimination on these grounds may also be considered a form of sex discrimination violating Title IX. Title IX prohibits sex discrimination, including same-sex harassment and gender stereotyping. Discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is prohibited only when it constitutes sex discrimination. SNDA aims to address gaps in Title IX coverage. In 2010, the Department of Education issued guidance on student bullying and harassment, particularly targeting LGBTQ students, which may violate federal anti-discrimination laws like Title IX. SNDA would cover public elementary and secondary schools, including charter schools, but its scope is limited to this level of education. SNDA would prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in public elementary and secondary schools. \"Sexual orientation\" would include homosexuality, heterosexuality, or bisexuality, while \"gender identity\" would refer to an individual's gender-related characteristics. SNDA's prohibition against sex discrimination extends to all education programs or activities operated by recipients of federal funds, similar to Title IX. This includes discrimination based on gender-related characteristics, such as student admissions, scholarship awards, housing, athletics, and employment practices. SNDA's prohibition on sexual orientation or gender identity discrimination covers a broad range of education programs or activities, including harassment based on actual or perceived orientation or identity. This includes conduct that limits a student's participation or creates a hostile environment. Title IX does not explicitly prohibit such harassment but has been interpreted to do so. SNDA's prohibition against harassment is similar to Title IX's standards. It also includes a provision against retaliation, modeled after Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Unlike Title IX, SNDA explicitly prohibits retaliation. The federal courts have interpreted Title IX to prohibit retaliatory conduct, as seen in Jackson v. Birmingham Board of Education. SNDA would also specify that the legislation does not limit rights under other laws and clarifies that its requirements are in addition to existing laws. SNDA clarifies that its requirements are in addition to existing federal laws like Title IX, Title VI, and the ADA. It also ensures that freedom of speech and expression rights, as well as rights for religious and student groups under the First Amendment and Equal Access Act, are not affected. Each federal agency providing financial assistance to education programs must ensure compliance with SNDA. SNDA, similar to Title IX, allows termination of federal assistance for noncompliance but limits it to the specific entity and program. It mandates federal agencies to report grounds for funding termination and grants individuals the right to sue for violations in federal court without exhausting administrative remedies. Remedies include equitable relief, compensatory damages, and attorney's fees. The Supreme Court has interpreted Title IX to provide student victims of sex discrimination with rights and remedies, including damages for intentional violations. In cases like Cannon v. University of Chicago and Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, the Court established that students can sue under Title IX without exhausting administrative remedies. The Supreme Court rulings in Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District and Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education established liability standards for school districts in cases of sexual harassment involving teachers and students. The Court determined that a school district can be held liable under Title IX if they had actual notice of the harassment and exhibited deliberate indifference. Additionally, if the harassment is severe enough to deprive the victim of educational opportunities, the district may be held liable for damages. The Supreme Court rulings in Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District and Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education established liability standards for school districts in cases of sexual harassment involving teachers and students under Title IX. If a school district had actual notice of harassment and showed deliberate indifference, they could be held liable for damages. Additionally, the SNDA would waive states' Eleventh Amendment immunity for sexual orientation or gender identity discrimination in programs receiving federal funds. Congress can waive states' sovereign immunity through appropriate legislation, but the scope has been narrowed by Supreme Court decisions. The Supreme Court decisions have narrowed the ability of private individuals to sue states for federal civil rights violations, but states can waive Eleventh Amendment immunity for federal benefits conditioned on waiver. Congress can condition grants to states on actions that cannot be required, and acceptance of funds implies agreement. One federal court found that a waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity under the Spending Clause is constitutionally permissible if the state voluntarily accepts it. The area of law regarding discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in federally funded education programs is evolving. Enforcement efforts by the Department of Education and Department of Justice have led to settlements in cases like the one involving Arcadia Unified School District in 2013, where a transgender student alleged Title IX violations. The school district will work with a consultant to create a safe environment for transgender students, amend policies to prevent gender-based discrimination, and train staff. Additionally, steps will be taken to treat transgender students equally in education programs. The school district and DOJ settled a case with a transgender male student over Title IX and equal protection violations related to gender stereotypes. The agreement included remedies for discrimination based on sex, gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation. SNDA aims to provide protection in cases not covered by Title IX."
