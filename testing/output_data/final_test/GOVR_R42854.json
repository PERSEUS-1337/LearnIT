The federal government offers support through federal crop insurance and agricultural disaster assistance programs to address crop or livestock production losses. Additionally, the USDA provides programs like the Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) and the Emergency Forest Restoration Program (EFRP) to repair and mitigate damage on private agricultural and forest land. The Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) assists landowners in restoring agricultural land damaged by natural disasters by removing debris, restoring fences, and providing water for livestock. Restoration practices are authorized by the Farm Service Agency (FSA) with approval from state and national FSA offices. The Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) provides payments to producers for completing restoration practices on agricultural land damaged by natural disasters. Payments can cover up to 75% of the cost, or up to 90% for limited-resources producers. The program is authorized under the Agricultural Credit Act of 1978 and is subject to appropriations. Land eligibility is determined by the FSA county committee, with exceptions made for drought conditions. The Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) provides payments to agricultural producers for restoring land damaged by natural disasters. Eligible land must be at risk of impairment, affect productivity, require costly rehabilitation, and not have pre-existing conservation issues. Participants must be landowners or users in the disaster area and can receive up to $200,000 per disaster. The Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) provides payments to agricultural producers for restoring land damaged by natural disasters. Federal agencies and states are ineligible to participate in ECP. Funding for ECP varies widely and is generally appropriated to remain available until expended. Congress may require ECP funding to be used for specific disasters, activities, or locations, limiting its use to select areas and future disasters. The Emergency Forest Restoration Program (EFRP) provides cost-share assistance to private forestland owners to repair damage from natural disasters. FSA allocates funds to state offices, which are then distributed by county committees on a first-come, first-served basis. FSA may cover up to 75% of emergency measures costs. Requests for financial assistance up to $50,000 per disaster are approved by the FSA county committee. The Emergency Forest Restoration Program (EFRP) provides financial assistance for private forest land damaged by natural disasters. Funding approval varies based on the amount requested: up to $50,000 by the FSA county committee, $50,001 to $100,000 by the FSA state committee, and over $100,000 by the FSA national office. The program was established under the 2008 farm bill and is permanently authorized with funding subject to appropriations. Eligible land must be nonindustrial private forest land with tree cover damaged by a natural disaster. The Emergency Forest Restoration Program (EFRP) provides financial assistance for private forest land damaged by natural disasters occurring after January 1, 2010. Eligible recipients include owners of nonindustrial private forest land located in counties where EFRP is implemented. Land owned or controlled by the federal government, states, or political subdivisions is ineligible. A payment limitation of $500,000 per person or legal entity applies per disaster. The program was created in the 2008 farm bill with an initial appropriation of $18 million in FY2010. The Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) program provides assistance for emergency recovery measures after natural disasters. Activities include debris removal, bank protection, and levee repairs. EWP funds cannot be used for existing structure maintenance or transportation facilities. Administered by USDA's Natural Resources Conservation. The Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) program, administered by USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service and the U.S. Forest Service, provides federal funding for emergency recovery measures after natural disasters. The federal contribution can cover up to 75% of construction costs, or 90% in limited-resource areas. The program, authorized under the Agricultural Credit Act of 1978, is available for private, state, tribal, and federal lands. The Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) program requires projects to have a sponsor who must be a state, political subdivision, qualified Indian tribe, or local government. Sponsors are responsible for obtaining permits, providing cost-share assistance, completing emergency measures, and maintenance. Funding for EWP varies annually and is mostly authorized through supplemental appropriations acts. NRCS provides assistance based on the current condition of the land or watershed impairment. The NRCS state conservationist assesses land or watershed impairment after a natural disaster. Sponsors must request assistance within 60 days. The state conservationist investigates and provides a cost estimate. Funding approval is based on urgency levels. A cooperative agreement must be signed before any funds are released. Floodplain easements under EWP are purchased as an emergency measure to safeguard lives and property from future floods, drought, and erosion. USDA holds all EWP floodplain easements in perpetuity, with NRCS having the authority to restore and enhance floodplain functions by removing structures within the easement boundaries. Landowners receive an easement payment based on established rates. The EWP program allows for the purchase of floodplain easements, with payment based on established rates or the landowner's offer. The 1996 farm bill expanded EWP to include floodplain easements, previously funded through the Wetlands Reserve Program. The EWP program, authorized under the Agricultural Credit Act of 1978, allows for the purchase of floodplain easements on cropland with a history of flooding. The 2014 farm bill amended the program to allow USDA to modify or terminate easements for compelling public needs, with compensatory arrangements determined by USDA. The EWP program allows for the purchase of floodplain easements on lands damaged by flooding, with eligibility criteria including floodplain lands damaged by flooding within the past year or multiple times in the past 10 years. Ineligible lands include those with existing easements or deed restrictions that provide sufficient protection, or where restoration practices would be futile. EWP participants must own the land. The EWP program allows for the purchase of floodplain easements on lands damaged by flooding. EWP floodplain easements do not require a project sponsor. Funding from ARRA was used for the purchase and restoration of these easements. NRCS reported enrolling a total of 1,586 easements on 184,911 acres by the end of 2016. Emergency disaster loans are available through the FSA for agricultural producers in declared disaster areas. Agricultural producers in declared disaster areas may be eligible for low-interest EM loans to recover from production or physical losses. The loans can cover up to 100% of actual losses, not exceeding $500,000. USDA also utilizes conservation programs to assist with land rehabilitation after natural disasters. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) provides annual payments to agricultural producers to take erodible land out of production and install resource-conserving practices. Emergency harvesting and grazing on CRP land is allowed in limited situations. The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) offers financial and technical assistance to address natural resource concerns on agricultural and forest land. The USDA has announced a special EQIP signup for farmers and ranchers in hurricane-affected areas to mitigate potential damage from natural disasters through conservation practices. Emergency assistance for agriculture is usually funded through supplemental appropriations. The change in funding mechanism from standalone supplemental appropriations to annual appropriations has presented a challenge for agricultural land assistance programs. The timing of annual appropriations bills may not coincide with natural disasters, leading to delays in funding availability. Inconsistent funding has left some programs without funding during high request volumes, despite disaster funds being available until expended. The 2008 and 2014 farm bills authorized permanent disaster assistance programs for crop and livestock production loss, funded mandatorily. However, funding for agricultural land rehabilitation programs remains discretionary and ad hoc, leading to suggestions that these programs have been neglected in favor of production loss assistance. Expanding the use of permanent mandatory funding is proposed as a solution. Some suggest expanding permanent mandatory funding to include land rehabilitation assistance, but achieving this in the current fiscal climate may be difficult. The Budget Control Act of 2011 limits emergency supplemental funding for disaster relief to activities under the Stafford Act until FY2021. Agricultural land rehabilitation programs have received funding through annual appropriations, often classified as disaster relief. Emergency agricultural land assistance programs, classified as disaster relief under the Stafford Act, face limitations in assisting natural disaster events like droughts. The Stafford Act requirement restricts funding availability and areas eligible for assistance, potentially impacting livestock producers in providing water to animals. The FY2016 appropriated levels classify only a portion of the funding provided as disaster relief subject to the requirements of the BCA and the Stafford Act. The remaining funds are not considered disaster relief for budget scoring purposes and are appropriated within the regular limitations of the current budget agreement. These funds are not subject to a Stafford Act declaration and may be used according to the authorities of the program. Mitigation actions are steps taken to reduce risk before a natural disaster occurs, with only one mitigation program existing for emergency agricultural land assistance\u2014the EWP floodplain easement program. The floodplain easement program on agricultural land with a history of flooding has been authorized since 1997 but faces funding limitations due to prohibitions in appropriations acts. Some question the use of federal restoration funds in high-risk disaster areas, arguing it promotes poor land use decisions. The program involves permanently removing land from production and restoring it to a natural state, with concerns over the initial cost of easement and restoration being viewed as too expensive for the federal government."
