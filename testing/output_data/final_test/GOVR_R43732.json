    "content": "Benefits for retired employees, especially postretirement pensions and health insurance, are a key concern for policymakers due to the income security of retirees. This report examines the protections for benefits of retirees from bankrupt private-sector employers, focusing on the automotive and coal industries as examples. The bankruptcy of General Motors in 2009 led to federal aid for the automotive industry, with a focus on the United Auto Workers union. Delphi Corporation, an auto parts supplier, faced challenges with salaried retirees seeking benefits similar to hourly workers. The Delphi Salaried Workers Association (DSRA) was formed by salaried retirees to increase their benefits. The United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) represents over 73,000 coal miners, with legislation periodically passed by Congress to cover retiree benefits since the 1940s. The Coal Act in 1992 protected health benefits for some retired coal miners, and trust funds for health insurance received federal assistance in 2006. Proposals for pensions and health benefits from bankrupt coal employers have been influenced by cases like the Patriot Coal Corporation's bankruptcy in 2012. These case studies are not necessarily representative of all large, unionized firm bankruptcies. The report discusses the bankruptcy proceedings of large, unionized firms and how the federal government handles retiree benefits. It explores the ability of bankrupt firms to invalidate commitments to retiree pensions and health insurance, the protections for retiree pensions, and the lack of guarantees for retiree health insurance. Case studies of bankruptcies including Old GM, Delphi, and Patriot are provided, highlighting the uncertainty of retirees receiving promised benefits. The ability of bankrupt firms to invalidate commitments to retiree pensions and health insurance depends on factors like the type of bankruptcy, labor organization, employee status, and legal relationships. Chapter 7 involves liquidation while chapter 11 is for reorganization, with automotive and coal industries often filing under chapter 11. Chapter 7 bankruptcy involves the complete cessation of business, liquidation of assets, and distribution to creditors based on priority claims. Retiree health and pension benefits are considered unsecured and non-priority claims in this process. In chapter 7 bankruptcy, retiree health and pension benefits are unsecured and non-priority claims. Chapter 11 bankruptcy involves restructuring the business to continue operations, with the debtor in possession managing assets and operations. Retiree benefits may not automatically end in bankruptcy proceedings. In chapter 11 bankruptcy, retiree benefits do not automatically end without court approval. Sections 1113 and 1114 of the Bankruptcy Code govern retiree benefits before asset sales. Section 1113 allows the debtor to modify or terminate a collective bargaining agreement, while Section 1114 covers retiree health insurance payments. The court may allow modifications based on the debtor's justification. In chapter 11 bankruptcy, Section 1114 of the Bankruptcy Code applies to unionized workplaces, allowing the debtor to modify or terminate a collective bargaining agreement if certain conditions are met. This section does not apply to nonunion workplaces. Section 1114 of the Bankruptcy Code allows the debtor in possession to terminate or modify retiree health benefits, following similar procedures as Section 1113 for collective bargaining agreements. The court must approve the modifications if necessary for the employer's reorganization, ensuring fair treatment of all parties involved. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) recognizes employees' right to collective bargaining through chosen representatives, but not retirees. The relationship between labor and management in bankruptcies depends on the type of union involved (single-employer, multiemployer, or association). Union workers in U.S. firms are often paid hourly. Union workers in U.S. firms are more likely to be paid by the hour than nonunion workers. Most unions are single-employer unions that negotiate terms and conditions of employment, resulting in a collective bargaining agreement (CBA). Multiemployer unions represent employees of multiple employers in the same industry and negotiate employee benefit plans for all eligible employees. Taft-Hartley plans, found in industries with employee mobility, ensure union members maintain benefits across employers. Trucking and construction unions often offer these plans. Associations, acting like unions, aid negotiations for retirees under the Bankruptcy Code. The term association is not legally defined, allowing unions and employer representatives to use it interchangeably. Single-employer unions negotiate for active and retired employees, who may lose benefits if the employer becomes insolvent. Multiemployer unions also cover orphan retirees, ensuring benefits for retirees across different employers. An orphan retiree is a retiree covered by a multiemployer CBA, entitled to benefits from an insolvent employer. Other solvent employers in the contract are expected to fund benefits for these retirees, even if they were never employed by them. The process of spin-offs involves independent firms emerging from larger entities like Old GM and Peabody Energy. Protections for retirees in bankrupt companies depend on negotiated spin-off arrangements between the parent company and the union. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) safeguards employee pensions and retiree health benefits. ERISA, enacted in 1974, safeguards employee pensions by setting vesting and funding requirements, and providing pension insurance in case of bankruptcy. Pension obligations must be prefunded by the employer to cover liabilities. ERISA covers private-sector defined benefit pension plans. Private-sector defined benefit (DB) pension plans typically pay a set monthly amount based on salary and years of service, with some offering a lump-sum payment. Participants in DB plans have a claim on their vested benefits, which cannot be reduced by plan sponsors. Pension trust funds are protected from bankruptcy claims. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) insures private-sector DB plans, safeguarding the benefits of millions of workers and retirees. The PBGC funds its benefit obligations through insurance premiums, pension plan funds, and investments. Benefits to retirees are not taxpayer-funded, and the PBGC's obligations are not those of the United States. The PBGC aims to prevent plan terminations for bankrupt companies and maintains separate insurance programs. The PBGC maintains two insurance programs for single-employer and multiemployer pension plans. In 2014, the single-employer plan had a $19.3 billion deficit, and the multiemployer plan had a $42.4 billion deficit. The PBGC protects pension benefits for 31 million active and retired employees in 22,000 single-employer plans. Single-employer plan terminations are categorized into three types, with the PBGC ensuring compliance with termination rules. In this case, the PBGC ensures compliance with plan termination rules of ERISA by becoming the plan's trustee in distress or involuntary terminations. The PBGC uses its assets to guarantee benefits up to a certain limit for retirees. The maximum guarantee for a pension plan terminated in 2015 is just over $6,000 per month. The PBGC guarantees a maximum pension of just over $6,000 per month for retirees in terminated pension plans. Contributions for multiemployer plans are based on employer contributions tied to employer output. Contributions are held in a trust fund managed by a board of trustees with equal representation from employers and employees. Multiemployer plans have different categories to describe their funded status, including critical, endangered, and seriously endangered status. Plans in endangered status must reduce underfunding by 33% over 10 years, while plans in seriously endangered status must reduce underfunding by 20% over 15 years. Plans in these statuses cannot increase pension benefits. During the funding improvement period, employers in endangered or seriously endangered status multiemployer pension plans cannot increase pension benefits. Employers may leave a plan for various reasons, leading to potential withdrawal liabilities. Insolvency in multiemployer plans occurs when benefit obligations cannot be met, and the PBGC provides loans to pay benefits without becoming the plan's trustee. The PBGC provides loans to pay benefits for financially troubled multiemployer pension plans, without becoming the trustee. It limits employer liabilities and offers a maximum guarantee of $1,073 per month for retirees with 30 years of work at age 65. However, the PBGC's financial health is uncertain, with a reported net loss of $34.2 billion in FY2014. There is a 50% chance the multiemployer insurance program will be insolvent by the end. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 allows for benefit reductions in pension plans in critical and declining status due to the increasing threat of PBGC insolvency. Plans deemed systematically important may still have benefit reductions rejected by participants. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 allows for benefit reductions in pension plans in critical and declining status. Systematically important plans can reduce benefits without participant approval. Participants' benefits cannot be cut below 110% of the PBGC multiemployer maximum level. Some individuals, like disabled and elderly retirees, are protected from benefit cuts. Plan partitioning can help reduce the PBGC's loan liability by dividing a multiemployer plan into two separate plans. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 allows for benefit reductions in pension plans in critical and declining status. Plan partitioning can help reduce the PBGC's loan liability by dividing a multiemployer plan into two separate plans. ERISA does not require retiree health insurance benefits to be prefunded. Even if a retiree was promised $400 a month in health insurance benefits, the employer is not obligated to fund it. Retiree health insurance benefits are not guaranteed in bankruptcy, and employers are not required to have funds available. To secure funding, employees can form a Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Association (VEBA), a tax-advantaged trust fund that can finance various benefits, including retiree health insurance. Independent VEBAs are structured as trusts separate from the employer. Independent VEBAs, also known as new or stand-alone VEBAs, must be controlled by their membership or designated trustees. They are created in bankruptcy or as part of regular business operations, acting in the employees' best interests. The terms and funding of each VEBA vary based on the bargaining power of the employer and employees. VEBAs, being tax-exempt, incentivize employers to prefund health benefits through tax-deductible contributions. VEBAs offer tax advantages and can improve an employer's financial position by removing liabilities for retiree health benefits. Employers must use accrual-basis accounting to calculate these liabilities, which can depress the firm's market value. Transferring benefits to a VEBA can increase the employer's market value. A VEBA can increase an employer's market value and reduce the risk for employees in receiving promised retiree benefits. Funds deposited into a retiree health VEBA must go to recipients and cannot revert to the employer. Without a VEBA, employees have no recourse if an employer lacks funds for retiree benefits. The presence of a VEBA does not eliminate all risks for employees as the VEBA must have sufficient assets and income to cover benefit costs for retirees. A VEBA must have sufficient funds to cover promised retiree benefits, known as a fully funded VEBA. Various factors can prevent full funding, such as incorrect calculations or insufficient employer contributions. Federal law does not mandate full funding, making it challenging to calculate the exact amount needed. For example, a firm may need to forecast funding for retiree health insurance for employees and their dependents. The level of funding needed to fully fund a VEBA involves forecasting variables like retirement dates, life expectancies, healthcare utilization, medical inflation rates, asset returns, and tax code changes. Incorrect forecasts can lead to inaccurate funding calculations, especially when considering future employees eligible for retiree benefits. Calculating the fully funded level for a VEBA is complex and requires estimating various factors. Calculating the fully funded level for a VEBA involves negotiating the amount and composition of funding, which can be contentious. Employees aim for close to 100% funding, while employers prefer a smaller percentage. Assets can be transferred to the VEBA, with some created during bankruptcy proceedings or as part of a standard CBA. The employer can transfer assets to the VEBA for funding, including cash and notes. If the union accepts stock as funding, the trust fund becomes a partial owner of the company. Retirees may have health insurance options like Medicare, Medicaid, federal subsidies, or COBRA coverage. Under the Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA; P.L. 99-272), retirees with end-stage renal disease, disabled individuals, and those aged 65 or older are eligible for Medicare. Some lower-income individuals may qualify for Medicaid, while others can purchase private nongroup coverage through health insurance exchanges or the private market. Employers must allow employees and family members to continue group health insurance coverage under COBRA if they lose coverage due to specific events, with individuals bearing the full cost. The COBRA continuation coverage allows retirees, their spouses, and dependents to maintain health insurance coverage for a certain period after specific events like employer bankruptcy. The ACA's Early Retiree Reinsurance Program provided funding for employers to cover high health insurance claims for early retirees. The Early Retiree Reinsurance Program (ERRP) provided reimbursements to fund cost-savings and improvements to employer health insurance. It accepted claims from June 1, 2010, to May 6, 2011, and closed due to budget exhaustion in 2014. The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) subsidized 72.5% of health insurance premiums for eligible taxpayers, including those in the Trade Adjustment Assistance program and PBGC pension plan beneficiaries. The PBGC took over pension plans of individuals, with the credit expiring on January 1, 2014. New enrollees had to register before October 1, 2013. The report provides examples of bankruptcy proceedings in unionized entities like Old General Motors and the United Auto Workers, Delphi and the Delphi Salaried Retirees Association, and Patriot and the United Mine Workers of America. General Motors Corporation filed for bankruptcy on June 1, 2009, with the sale of its assets approved on July 5, 2009. The buyer formed a new corporation, later named General Motors Company. General Motors Corporation changed its name to General Motors Company. Old GM received financial support from TARP under EESA, extended to the automobile industry in 2008. President Obama granted further assistance in 2009. Old GM and New GM together received $50.2 billion in total. Old GM had separate pension trusts for hourly and salaried workers, with DB pensions for unionized employees hired before October 15, 2007. New GM pensions were underfunded by $17.1 billion at the end of 2009. Despite this, pensions were not a major issue during the late 2000s bargaining. After the bankruptcy, concerns arose about increased pension contributions, leading to a buy-out offer for salaried workers in 2012. About 30% of eligible workers accepted the lump-sum payment in exchange for giving up pension rights. New GM offered salaried workers a buy-out option to trade their promised DB pensions for a lump-sum payment. Old GM historically provided generous health insurance coverage, but the high cost of healthcare became a significant issue. A 2007 memorandum highlighted the challenge of providing postretirement medical care, impacting the company's competitiveness in the North American marketplace. During the 2007 contract negotiations, Old GM agreed to contribute a percentage of its projected retiree health liabilities to an independent VEBA intended to fund retiree health benefits for 80 years. Old GM also made additional contributions to the VEBA starting in 2008, projected to fund about 68% of future retiree health obligations. The UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust took over all funding responsibilities for retiree health insurance from GM on January 1, 2010. Only retirees eligible for benefits as of October 15, 2007, can participate in the VEBA. The VEBA, established for retiree medical benefits, has separate accounts for New GM, Ford, and Chrysler. Managed by 11 trustees, including UAW representatives, it holds $14.5 billion in assets and 17.5% of New GM's stock. The UAW became a partial owner of New GM due to a restructuring agreement during bankruptcy. The VEBA, established for retiree medical benefits, holds $14.5 billion in assets, including 17.5% of New GM's stock. Ownership in New GM decreased from 17.5% in 2009 to 9.2% in 2014. VEBA officers have highlighted investment risks, such as the \"market meltdown\" of 2008 and uncertainty in future medical costs. The 2011 contract negotiations discussed the possibility of diverting profit sharing to the VEBA. The recent legislation in the 111th Congress involved TARP funding in Old GM's bankruptcy proceedings. Delphi Corporation, originally part of Old GM, now supplies parts to vehicle manufacturers. Old GM covered pension benefits for Delphi employees who retired before October 1, 2000, while those who retired after that date had their benefits managed by Delphi pension plans. In October 2005, Delphi entered chapter 11 bankruptcy and emerged in October 2009. GM had a benefit guarantee agreement with the UAW for Delphi pension plans, providing a \"top-up\" for hourly workers if the plans were terminated. Salaried employees were not covered by this guarantee. The PBGC took over Delphi's underfunded pension plans with 70,000 participants. Salaried Delphi retirees formed DSRA to fight for equal benefits as unionized retirees. Old and New GM were involved in the case. New GM honored top-up agreements with unions, including the UAW, IUE-CWA, and USW, during bankruptcy proceedings. This was done for commercial reasons and to speed up the sale of assets. The PBGC later took over Delphi pensions, leading to some salaried retirees seeking equal benefits. Some Delphi salaried retirees saw their pension benefits reduced because their monthly benefit exceeded the statutory maximum. New GM did not top-up these pensions, arguing no contractual obligation. PBGC estimated 18% of salaried retirees would see benefits reduced to $54,000/year, compared to 1% of hourly workers. DSRA argued salaried workers were treated unfairly compared to hourly workers. The DSRA argued that salaried Delphi retirees were treated unfairly compared to hourly workers in terms of pension benefits, claiming that the top-up funding for hourly workers came from TARP during the Old GM restructuring. They filed a lawsuit against PBGC, the U.S. Treasury Department, and the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry, alleging violations of the Equal Protection Clause. The DSRA contended that New GM discriminated against salaried employees for not associating with a union, renegotiating top-up agreements for political reasons after Old GM's bankruptcy. The DSRA submitted an affidavit stating that the PBGC miscalculated the benefit obligations of Delphi's pension plans. The plan for salaried employees was 86.5% funded at termination, rare for plans with that level of funding to require termination. PBGC estimated the plan was only 48% funded, with $2.4 billion in assets and $5.0 billion in liabilities. The PBGC expected to be responsible for about $2.2 billion of the plan's $2.6 billion underfunding. The Delphi court case is ongoing, with a U.S. district judge ordering the U.S. Department of the Treasury to turn over documents. The U.S. district judge ordered the Treasury to provide documents related to Obama's Auto Task Force's role in terminating the salaried pension plan. There is debate over Old GM's obligation to honor top-up commitments to UAW Delphi workers. The GAO and SIGTARP suggest special treatment for the UAW due to its influence in bankruptcy proceedings. Treasury did not explicitly approve GM's agreement on top-up agreements, while a Treasury official stated they determined which liabilities to take on as the buyer. The DSRA argued for fairness in providing benefits to Delphi salaried workers, despite no top-up commitment. The process for health benefits was quicker than pensions, with negotiations following Bankruptcy Code rules. Delphi agreed to $8.75 million cash funding for the VEBA, without providing stock. The DSRA VEBA, funded with $8.75 million cash from Delphi in 2009, provided health insurance benefits to salaried workers retired or eligible to retire by April 1, 2009. The trust agreement was later amended to include hourly retirees and their dependents, who could enroll in the DSRA VEBA health insurance plans at their own expense. Delphi has not made any additional contributions to the VEBA since its initial funding. The DSRA VEBA, funded by Delphi in 2009, provides health insurance benefits to retired salaried workers. The largest source of additional funding has been the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program. The DSRA advocated for an extension of the Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) in Congress. Federal involvement in retiree pensions and health insurance in the coal industry has a long history in the United States. President Harry Truman signed an executive order seizing the nation's bituminous coal mines during a miner walkout. The Krug-Lewis Agreement in 1946 established UMWA Health and Retirement Funds for coal miners. The current pension and retiree health benefits in the coal industry are outlined in the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement (NBCWA), negotiated between UMWA and BCOA. The most recent NBCWA was negotiated in 2011 and covers terms and conditions of employment. The National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement (NBCWA) outlines pension and retiree health benefits for coal miners, including an \"evergreen clause\" for long-term financing. Employers must contribute to these funds even if they are no longer members of the agreement. Patriot, a spin-off from Peabody Energy, filed for bankruptcy in 2012 and emerged in 2013. Patriot, a spin-off from Peabody Energy, entered bankruptcy in December 2013 with a significant amount of retiree health obligations, much higher than its active employees. The bankruptcy court deemed this amount \"astronomical\" at over $1.6 billion. Additionally, funding from the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program was no longer available to Patriot. The 1974 Pension Trust covers all employees from signatory employers to the NBCWA. The 1974 Pension Trust covers all employees from signatory employers to the NBCWA, including current retirees, surviving spouses, and dependents. Patriot is the Trust's second-largest contributor and was less than 73% funded at the time of their bankruptcy filing. The Trust is now in critical status, with active employees hired before January 1, 2012, eligible for benefits. Employees hired after this date have a 401(k) retirement plan instead. The coal industry provides generous health benefits to employees, sacrificing wage increases for better health insurance due to occupational health challenges. Coal employers maintain retiree health plans, with some employees having access to UMWA retiree health care funds. The Combined Benefit Fund (CBF) provides retiree health benefits for UMWA employees who retired before July 20, 1992, and did not have another source of retiree health benefits. The 1992 Benefit Trust, created by the Coal Act, provides retiree health benefits to coal industry employees who retired between July 20, 1992, and September 30, 1994, without another source of benefits. Unlike the CBF, the 1992 Trust adjusts premiums annually to cover healthcare costs effectively. The 1993 Benefit Trust covers employees who retired after October 1994, and new miners hired after January 1, 2007, are not eligible for benefits. The 1993 Benefit Trust is mostly closed to new enrollees, created through negotiation between UMWA and BCOA. Retired miners qualify if past employers failed to provide retiree health benefits. BCOA members contribute to active, retired, and orphan employees. Funding levels may not align with maintaining health benefits. Patriot considered eliminating retiree health insurance during bankruptcy, leading to negotiations with UMWA's Section 1114 committee. The bankruptcy court ruled in favor of Patriot's motions to no longer provide retiree health insurance benefits, leading to negotiations with UMWA. The court's decision was contested by the union, resulting in threats of a strike. However, an appellate panel later reversed the decision, requiring Peabody Energy to take responsibility for paying the health care benefits. After negotiations, Peabody settled the case by contributing $90 million to the VEBA in 2014, $75 million in 2015, $75 million in 2016, and $70 million in 2017. No bills regarding retiree health benefits have been introduced in the 114th Congress, but bills in the 113th Congress aimed to change benefits for coal industry retirees. H.R. 980 and S. 468 (113th Congress) would have redirected interest from a coal mine fund to the UMWA Pension Trust for pension benefits. The Caring for Coal Miners Act and the Coal Healthcare and Pensions Protection Act aimed to provide benefits to retired miners who were not receiving their entitled benefits due to bankruptcy. The benefits would be reduced by the amount paid by the VEBA to ensure no beneficiary receives more than they were originally entitled to. The bills introduced in the 113th Congress aimed to increase health benefits for Patriot retirees by allowing them to join the 1992 Benefit Trust or the 1993 Benefit Trust. Any excess funds from the VEBA would be transferred to the 1993 Trust and then to the 1974 UMWA Pension Trust. The 2013 Coal Healthcare and Pensions Protection Act aimed to help orphan retirees from a bankruptcy in 2012 by allowing them to join the 1993 Benefit Trust. Any extra funds from the VEBA would go to the 1974 UMWA Pension Trust. The CARE Act of 2013 would have moved interest from a coal mine fund to the 1974 Pension Trust, potentially increasing funding. The 2013 Coal Healthcare and Pensions Protection Act aimed to transfer extra funds to the 1974 UMWA Pension Trust, benefiting orphan retirees from a 2012 bankruptcy. The President's FY2016 budget would make retirees eligible for the 1993 UMWA Health Plan and transfer funds to ensure the long-term solvency of the 1974 UMWA Pension Plan."
