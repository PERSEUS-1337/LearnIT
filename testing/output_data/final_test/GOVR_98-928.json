    "content": "Following World War II, nations led by the United States aimed to establish an open trading system to boost global economic well-being. The proposed International Trade Organization (ITO) would address trade barriers and related issues, but the treaty was not approved, leading to a provisional agreement. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was established in 1948 as a provisional agreement on trade rules, becoming the main set of rules governing international trade for 47 years. Key principles of GATT included nondiscrimination in trade among countries, such as the most-favored-nation principle and national treatment. Nondiscrimination is a cornerstone of GATT, with some exceptions allowed. The GATT allows for exceptions to nondiscrimination, such as customs unions and special treatment for developing countries. Tariffs are set at maximum levels and are the most common trade barrier. Quantitative restrictions like quotas were generally not allowed. The GATT also provided a dispute resolution process through consultation and panel hearings, although decisions were not enforceable. The GATT aimed to reduce trade barriers through periodic negotiations called \"rounds.\" The Uruguay Round from 1986 to 1994 was the most comprehensive, covering areas like services trade and intellectual property rights. Further negotiations on agriculture were also required. The Uruguay Round led to the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, replacing the GATT. The WTO has 150 members representing over 95% of world trade, with a stronger dispute resolution procedure and regular review of trade policies. The World Trade Organization (WTO) has 150 members, with decisions made by consensus. The WTO Secretariat assists member countries, with a budget of 182.0 million Swiss Francs in 2007. The Ministerial Conference is the highest level body in the WTO. The Ministerial Conference of the WTO, led by Director-General Pascal Lamy, sets agendas for future work and meets every two years. The first meeting in Singapore in 1996 reviewed WTO's work and approved an action plan for least-developed countries. The second meeting in Geneva in 1998 focused on global electronic commerce and future work programs. The third Ministerial Conference in Seattle in 1999 failed to reach agreement on a new round of trade negotiations, leading to suspension of work. The fourth Ministerial Conference in Doha in 2001 launched the Doha Development Agenda for multilateral trade negotiations with a deadline of January 1, 2005. The fifth Ministerial Conference in 2003 continued discussions on developing-country issues. The fifth Ministerial Conference in Cancun, Mexico in 2003 aimed to review progress in negotiations and provide guidance, but major differences led to stalled negotiations. The sixth Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong in 2005 made modest advancements in agriculture, industrial tariffs, and access for least developed countries. The General Council oversees the day-to-day operations of the WTO, with a representative from each member country. It meets monthly to discuss trade matters and also conducts Trade Policy Reviews to monitor national trade policies. The U.S. delegate to the General Council is the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative in Geneva. The General Council oversees the day-to-day operations of the WTO and conducts Trade Policy Reviews to monitor national trade policies. Trade reviews provide information on a country's trade policies and pressure countries to avoid trade-discouraging practices. The Dispute Settlement Body resolves disputes through consultation and, if necessary, a dispute panel. If a complaint is upheld, the respondent must change its practice or negotiate a resolution, or face possible retaliation authorized by the DSB. The Dispute Settlement Body authorizes retaliation by the complainant if a decision is disregarded. Specific procedures with timetables are in place, with work done in three major bodies under the General Council. Committees under the Council for Trade in Goods focus on various trade areas, including agriculture, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, and monitoring unfair practices like antidumping and subsidies. The Council for Trade in Goods oversees various trade areas, including rules of origin, safeguards, technical barriers, customs valuation, and import licensing. It also addresses market access issues such as tariffs and nontariff measures. The Council for Trade in Services manages the Uruguay Round agreement on trade in services, which includes principles like national treatment and transparency. The General Council oversees various trade areas, including rules on the movement of persons providing services, financial services, telecommunications, and air transport services. Country commitments are binding and cannot be reduced, similar to tariff levels on goods. The TRIPS Council monitors the agreement on intellectual property rights from the Uruguay Round, ensuring compliance with basic principles like national treatment and most-favored-nation treatment. The TRIPS agreement sets standards for intellectual property rights like patents, trademarks, and copyrights, with enforcement processes established. Various committees and working groups under the General Council focus on trade, debt, finance, technology transfer, civil aircraft, government procurement, and trade and development. Working parties on accession also meet to address specific concerns of developing countries. The Uruguay Round established committees and working parties to address specific concerns of developing countries and to ensure compliance with WTO rules. Congressional debates on the WTO focus on U.S. trade goals, sovereignty in trade decisions, dispute processes, and the congressional role in U.S. participation. The WTO provides a multilateral dispute mechanism for international trade, benefiting the United States. The WTO provides a multilateral dispute mechanism for international trade, ensuring security and discouraging discrimination. Critics argue it is slow-moving and cumbersome due to its large membership and consensus-based decision-making. Alternatives include pursuing U.S. goals through other multilateral bodies like the OECD, or through regional/bilateral agreements, which are easier to negotiate but may create trade diversion. The United States and other countries may be distracted from potential benefits of multilateral negotiations. Critics question if the US can maintain sovereignty as a WTO member, as it must adhere to WTO rules but cannot be forced to comply. The United States and other WTO members must adhere to obligations, with exceptions for national security. The strength of the WTO relies on members following its rules. Unilateral actions against WTO rules may weaken the institution. U.S. policymakers must weigh the benefits of an open trading system against the discipline imposed by the WTO. The U.S. benefits from the WTO dispute process, providing a peaceful way to resolve trade disputes with clear rules to follow. The WTO dispute process provides clear rules for resolving trade disputes, with the United States being successful as a complainant. However, there are complaints about countries not adhering to dispute panels' findings, such as the U.S. complaint against EU trade restrictions on beef. Critics argue that some cases are filed for political reasons rather than economic ones. The EU challenged a U.S. tax benefit for exports after a U.S. win in another case. The United States has lost several trade remedy cases, leading to concerns about the WTO dispute panels' authority. The U.S. has not performed well as a respondent in WTO cases. There is a debate on whether the WTO should cover nontraditional issues like labor and the environment in addition to traditional trade issues. The GATT agreement initially focused on border measures like tariffs and quotas, later expanding to include internal practices affecting trade. The Uruguay Round agreements broadened trade rules to cover areas such as services and intellectual property rights. U.S. businesses prefer the WTO to stick to traditional trade issues, while some groups advocate for including non-traditional topics like labor and the environment. Labor groups argue against worker exploitation for cheap foreign products, while environmental groups push for environmental considerations in trade agreements. The WTO faces debates on including environmental effects in trade agreements and enforcing climate change obligations. There is disagreement on various trade negotiation topics domestically and internationally. Congress plays a crucial role in how the US participates in the WTO through its authority over foreign commerce. The legislation (P.L. 107-210) approved expedited procedures for implementing trade agreements in 2002. Congress sets trade objectives for U.S. negotiators and oversees negotiations. The Congressional Oversight Group advises on trade matters. Congress decides on legislative changes to implement trade agreements. The current Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) expired in 2007, and Congress may renew it for a Doha Round agreement. Congress may also amend U.S. trade laws in response to WTO Dispute Settlement rulings. The congressional role helps coordinate executive and legislative branches on trade issues. The executive-legislative relationship on trade matters is debated, with the Administration seeking greater authority in trade negotiations. Congress asserts its constitutional role in trade policy formulation and oversight of negotiations. Periodically, Congress can vote to withdraw from the WTO. The U.S. Trade Representative must submit a report every five years analyzing the costs and benefits of continued U.S. participation. The U.S. Trade Representative must submit a report every five years analyzing the costs and benefits of continued U.S. participation in the WTO. Congress can vote to withdraw from the WTO based on this report. In 2005, a joint resolution to withdraw congressional approval of the WTO agreement was considered but ultimately disapproved by the House. Members had the opportunity to debate the costs and benefits of WTO participation. The WTO structure allows all members to participate in various councils and committees, excluding specific bodies like the Appellate Body and Dispute Settlement panels. Negotiations from the Doha Declaration are conducted by the Trade Negotiations Committee and its subsidiaries."
