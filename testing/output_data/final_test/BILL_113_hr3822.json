    "content": "The Act titled \"Fort Wingate Land Division Act of 2014\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. Congress finds that the Former Fort Wingate Depot Activity in New Mexico ceased its active mission in January 1993 and was closed. The lands were originally ancestral lands of the Zuni Tribe and Navajo Nation, with significant archaeological and cultural sites. The Secretary of the Interior, with support from the tribes and concerned parties, determined environmental remediation upon closure. Upon completion of environmental remediation at Former Fort Wingate Depot Activity, lands no longer needed by the Department of the Army would be transferred to the Secretary of the Interior for the benefit of the Zuni Tribe and Navajo Nation. In July 2013, tribal leaders met to discuss the fair division of the activity. The tribal leaders informally agreed to property divisions outlined in a map prepared by the Army Corps of Engineers. This Act achieves a fair division of Former Fort Wingate Depot Activity for the Zuni Tribe and Navajo Nation. SEC. 3. Division and treatment of lands of Former Fort Wingate Depot Activity in New Mexico for the benefit of the Zuni Tribe and Navajo Nation. The United States will hold lands of Former Fort Wingate Depot Activity in trust for the Zuni Tribe and Navajo Nation, unless they elect to have specified parcels conveyed in Restricted Fee Status. The Secretary of the Interior will hold lands of Former Fort Wingate Depot Activity in trust for the Navajo Nation as part of the Navajo Reservation, unless specified parcels are conveyed in Restricted Fee Status upon completion of remediation. The Secretary of the Interior will notify the Zuni Tribe and Navajo Nation of the transfer of administrative jurisdiction over parcels of land from Former Fort Wingate Depot Activity. The Secretary shall hold each parcel in trust for the Zuni Tribe or Navajo Nation, as depicted on the Map. The Zuni Tribe and Navajo Nation may elect to have land conveyed in restricted fee status instead of held in trust by the Secretary of the Interior. Notification of this election must be made within 45 days of receiving notice of the transfer of administrative jurisdiction over the land. The Zuni Tribe or Navajo Nation can choose to have land conveyed in restricted fee status instead of held in trust by the Secretary of the Interior. They must notify the Secretary within 45 days of receiving notice of the transfer of administrative jurisdiction. If they elect to convey the land, the Secretary must do so within six months of receiving the notice. Restricted fee status is defined for this purpose. Restricted fee status, as defined for this Act, means that conveyed land must be owned by the Indian tribe, part of their Reservation, under their jurisdiction, not sold without Congress' consent, not taxed by other governments, and not subject to certain provisions. The Secretary of the Interior is not required to review or approve before an Indian tribe can use land for any purpose. The Secretary shall conduct surveys and establish legal boundaries for lands taken into trust for the Zuni Tribe or the Navajo Nation. The Secretary of Interior consults with the Zuni Tribe and Navajo Nation to prioritize surveying parcels taken into trust. Regulations in Part 151 of title 25, Code of Federal Regulations, do not apply to taking lands of Former Fort Wingate Depot Activity into trust. SEC. 4. RETENTION OF NECESSARY EASEMENTS AND ACCESS. The lands of Former Fort Wingate Depot Activity held in trust or conveyed in restricted fee status shall have easements reserved by the United States for access, cleanup, and remediation. The Zuni Tribe and Navajo Nation will receive written copies of these easements. Parcel 1 will have a shared easement for cultural and religious purposes for both tribes. Within Parcel 1, the Zuni Tribe and Navajo Nation have unrestricted access to their cultural and religious sites. They must exchange detailed information within a year to document these sites. The Secretary of the Interior will also receive this information. Shared access to other lands for religious and cultural purposes is possible with consent from both tribes and the Secretary of the Interior. The access road for Former Fort Wingate Depot Activity, connecting to Interstate 25, will be shared by the Zuni Tribe and Navajo Nation for equal access. Lands in trust or conveyed in Restricted Fee Status will have easements for Department of Defense access to the Missile Defense Agency facility. SEC. 5. ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION. Responsibility for cleanup and remediation of Former Fort Wingate Depot Activity remains with the United States as agreed by the Secretary of the Army and the New Mexico Environment Department. The Zuni Tribe and Navajo Nation are not liable for damages from Army activities or use of hazardous substances. They are also held harmless from any claims or suits related to these activities. The Zuni Tribe and Navajo Nation are not liable for damages from Army activities or use of hazardous substances at the Former Fort Wingate Depot Activity site. They are held harmless from any claims related to contamination or hazardous materials on the transferred land. The New Mexico Environment Department has fully remediated a parcel of land at Former Fort Wingate Depot Activity, meeting all Federal environmental requirements for transfer under section 3."
