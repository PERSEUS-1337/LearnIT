These individuals own over 197,000 businesses, generating more than $34 billion in revenue. The service industry is the largest sector, followed by construction and retail trade. The number of businesses owned by this group increased by 84 percent from 1992 to 1997. The Small Business Development Center program is cost-effective, with clients generating additional tax revenues of $468,000,000 in 1998, six times the program's cost to the Federal Government. Businesses owned by Indian tribe members, Native Alaskans, and Native Hawaiians receiving services under the program have a higher survival rate than those not receiving such services. The Act aims to stimulate economies, foster economic development, and support the creation and expansion of small businesses owned by Indian tribe members, Native Alaskans, and Native Hawaiians. Business counseling and technical assistance are crucial on Indian lands where such services are limited and costly. Increased counseling through the Small Business Development Center program has been proven to reduce default rates associated with Small Business Administration lending programs. The Act aims to support small business development for Indian tribe members, Native Alaskans, and Native Hawaiians by seeking advice from Tribal Councils and ensuring access to business counseling and technical assistance. Small Business Development Center assistance is provided to Indian tribe members, Native Alaskans, and Native Hawaiians. The Small Business Act is amended to provide an additional grant for Small Business Development Centers in eligible states to assist Indian tribe members, Native Alaskans, and Native Hawaiians with business startups and expansions on Indian lands. The Small Business Act is amended to provide a grant for Small Business Development Centers in eligible states with a population of at least 1% Indian tribe members, Native Alaskans, and Native Hawaiians. Grant applicants must submit an application outlining their goals and capabilities for providing training and services. The grant applicants must provide training and services to a representative number of Indian tribe members, Native Alaskans, and Native Hawaiians. They need to specify the location of the Small Business Development Center site, the required grant funding, and consultation with local Tribal Councils. Applicants must comply with all requirements of the section, excluding matching funds requirements. The Administrator shall issue final regulations for Small Business Development Centers receiving grants under this paragraph, including standards for educational and technical services. The maximum grant amount per applicant is $300,000 per fiscal year. The Associate Administrator may require Small Business Development Centers to develop work plans under this paragraph. Definitions for 'Associate Administrator' and 'Indian lands' apply. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms related to Indian reservations, Indian tribes, Indian tribe members, and Native Alaskans. These definitions are in accordance with specific sections of the United States Code and the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978. The curr_chunk defines \"Alaskan\" and \"Native Hawaiian\" in accordance with specific sections of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and the United States Code. It also authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 2004 through 2006 and specifies funding limitations. Funding under this paragraph is in addition to program limitations specified in paragraph (4). The Administration can only carry out this paragraph with appropriated funds specifically for it. The Small Business Act is amended to require states receiving grants to consult with local Tribal Councils on providing assistance to Indian tribe members, Native Alaskans, and Native Hawaiians. Satellite centers may be located to provide such assistance."
