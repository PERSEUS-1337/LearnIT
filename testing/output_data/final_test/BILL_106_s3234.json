    "content": "The bill is titled the \"Freedom to Fish Act\" and includes findings related to fishing rights. The Congress finds that recreational fishing is popular, contributes significantly to the economy, and supports over 1.2 million jobs nationally. Recreational fishers contribute to conservation efforts through catch-and-release practices and non-lethal gear. They also financially support State fisheries conservation programs with over $500 million annually. Access to fishing locations is crucial for recreational fishing, and various management measures like take limits and closed seasons help maintain fishery resources. The absence of clear Congressional policy has confused the general public regarding how programs within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration complement each other in relation to recreational fishing. The policy outlined in this Act aims to promote open access for recreational fishing, involve fishers in regulatory procedures, and restrict fishing areas only as necessary for conservation. Additionally, an amendment to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is proposed. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to not establish closed areas for recreational fishing unless specific criteria are met, such as recreational fishermen being the cause of a conservation problem and other measures being inadequate. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act requires specific criteria for establishing closed areas for recreational fishing, including periodic reviews, size limitations based on scientific information, and provisions for reopening when the basis for closure no longer exists. The National Marine Sanctuaries Act is amended to allow Regional Fishery Management Councils to propose and revise fishing regulations within marine sanctuaries, following the standards of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. These regulations will apply within the exclusive economic zone and may also be applied within state boundaries with approval."
