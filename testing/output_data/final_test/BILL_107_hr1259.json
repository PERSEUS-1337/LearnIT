    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Computer Security Enhancement Act of 2001\" and includes findings and purposes. The Congress finds that the National Institute of Standards and Technology is responsible for developing standards to ensure security and privacy of sensitive information in Federal computer systems. The Federal Government plays a crucial role in protecting sensitive, unclassified information. Cryptography technology can provide confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of information. Encryption technologies in industry should be market-driven, not government-mandated. The Act aims to strengthen the National Institute of Standards and Technology's role in securing unclassified information in Federal computer systems and promote private sector technology solutions for enhancing Federal computer system security. SEC. 3. SECURITY OF FEDERAL COMPUTERS AND NETWORKS. Section 20(b) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act is amended to provide guidance and assistance to Federal agencies for protecting the security and privacy of sensitive information in interconnected Federal computer systems, promote compliance with existing guidelines, and assist in Federal response efforts related to unauthorized access. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Act is amended to provide guidance and assistance to Federal agencies for protecting sensitive information in interconnected computer systems and assist in response efforts related to unauthorized access. SEC. 4. COMPUTER SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION. Section 20 of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act is amended to emphasize technology-neutral policy guidelines for computer security and electronic authentication practices by Federal agencies, promote the use of commercially available products for security and privacy of sensitive information in Federal computer systems, and develop measures to assess quality and effectiveness. The amended Section 20 of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act focuses on technology-neutral policy guidelines for computer security and electronic authentication practices by Federal agencies. It emphasizes the use of commercially available products for security and privacy in Federal computer systems and the development of measures to assess quality and effectiveness, including evaluations, accreditation procedures, consultation on security technologies, and uniform testing procedures for security products. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Act emphasizes technology-neutral policy guidelines for computer security and electronic authentication practices by Federal agencies. It includes procedures for certification of private sector laboratories to test security products, maintain a list of tested products, and report annually to Congress on security product conformance. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Act requires a report to Congress on the evaluations and tests of Federal computer systems, planned evaluations for the future, recommendations to Federal agencies, and their responses. SEC. 5. COMPUTER SECURITY REVIEW, PUBLIC MEETINGS, AND INFORMATION. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Act is amended to include a new subsection requiring recommendations from the Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory Board on standards and guidelines. Funding is authorized for the Board to address emerging issues in computer security, privacy, and cryptography. The Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory Board is tasked with providing recommendations on standards and guidelines for computer security, privacy, and cryptography. They will hold public meetings, receive presentations, and publish reports for public distribution on these subjects. SEC. 6. LIMITATION ON PARTICIPATION IN REQUIRING ENCRYPTION AND ELECTRONIC AUTHENTICATION STANDARDS. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Act is amended to restrict the Institute from setting encryption and electronic authentication standards for non-Federal computer systems. SEC. 7. MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS. Section 20 of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act is amended to improve computer security for Federal computer systems by coordinating with the Office of Management and Budget. This includes the ability to draw upon resources and make necessary changes to enhance security, such as updating references and including computer networks in relevant sections. SEC. 8 of the Computer Security Act of 1987 is amended to emphasize protecting information in Federal databases and computer sites accessible through public networks. SEC. 9 authorizes $5,000,000 for the Computer Security Fellowship Program for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 to support students in computer security at higher learning institutions. The funds are not subject to percentage limitations. SEC. 10 calls for a study on electronic authentication technologies by the National Research Council. The Secretary of Commerce will contract the National Research Council to study electronic authentication technologies within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The study will assess technology support, current deployment plans, interoperability, scalability, integrity, and other relevant issues. The National Research Council will study electronic authentication technologies with full cooperation from all federal agencies. A report with findings and recommendations for public policy will be transmitted to relevant committees within 18 months of the Act's enactment. The National Research Council will not recommend specific electronic authentication technology for the Federal Government. $450,000 is authorized for the Secretary of Commerce for fiscal year 2002 for this purpose. The Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology is tasked with promoting the use of security techniques like risk assessment and tools like cryptography to enhance national information security. They are also responsible for establishing a central repository of information on security vulnerabilities and promoting the development of national standards-based infrastructures for encryption technologies. The Director, in consultation with industry and Federal agencies, will develop technology-neutral guidelines and standards for electronic authentication infrastructures within 18 months of the Act's enactment. These guidelines aim to ensure secure and interoperable electronic authentication technologies for Federal agencies and their partners. The Director will develop guidelines for electronic authentication products and services, including protection profiles, interoperability specifications, and validation criteria. These guidelines will be periodically reviewed and revised as needed. The Director will maintain a list of approved electronic authentication products for Federal agencies. Core specifications for electronic certification technologies will be established for agency use. The Director will maintain a list of electronic certification and management technologies for Federal agencies to use. Reports will be submitted to Congress on the utilization and implementation progress of electronic authentication technologies by Federal agencies. The section defines terms related to electronic authentication, including electronic authentication, electronic authentication infrastructure, electronic certification and management technologies, and protection profile. The Secretary of Commerce is authorized $7,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 and $8,000,000 for fiscal year 2003 for the National Institute of Standards and Technology. This funding is for activities authorized by the Act."
