These resolutions have been used for oversight since the early days of Congress, with the House of Representatives being the primary user. House resolutions of inquiry are designated as \"H.Res.\" and can be given privileged status under specific circumstances. A resolution of inquiry is a formal request for factual information from the executive branch to Congress. If a resolution of inquiry is not reported to the House within 14 legislative days after its introduction, a motion to discharge a committee from its further consideration is in order on the House floor. Committees often mark up and report resolutions of inquiry, even if they oppose them, to retain control over the measure. Resolutions of inquiry on the House floor must call for facts within the executive branch's control and are considered under the One-Hour Rule. They may be agreed to, rejected, or tabled by majority vote. In the past, majority party Members managing such resolutions often quickly move to table them. Resolutions of inquiry on the House floor are often tabled if the executive branch has provided the requested information, as they have no legal force. Compliance is voluntary, influenced by respect for Congress's power. The Congressional Research Service has identified 313 resolutions of inquiry submitted in the House between 1947 and October 20, 2017\u2014an average of just under 9 per Congress. The number of resolutions introduced varied widely over the 70-year period, with peaks in the 92nd-94th Congresses (1971-1976) and the 108th and 109th Congresses (2003-2006), which accounted for 45% of all resolutions submitted. During the 70-year period examined, there was a significant increase in the number of House resolutions of inquiry introduced, with peaks in the 108th and 109th Congresses. In the 108th Congress, 14 resolutions were introduced, and 39 were submitted in the 109th Congress, exceeding the total number introduced in the previous two decades combined. The 39 resolutions in the 109th Congress are second only to the 44 introduced in the 93rd Congress. In the 93rd Congress, House rules limited cosponsorship to 25 Representatives, leading to more resolutions of inquiry being introduced in the 109th Congress than in any single Congress since World War II. In the 111th Congress, 29 resolutions of inquiry were introduced. Subsequent Congresses saw a decrease in activity on House resolutions of inquiry, with three submitted in the 112th Congress, five in the 113th Congress, and none in the 114th Congress. The number of resolutions of inquiry introduced in the 115th Congress has exceeded the average for a Congress and surpasses the total from the previous three Congresses combined. Some believe that minority party Members have strategically used these resolutions to push committees to act on certain issues or to force votes on controversial policies. The high number of resolutions of inquiry introduced in the GOP-controlled 115th Congress suggests a political use of this parliamentary tool by the minority party to push committees to act on specific issues or force votes on controversial policies. Some reports have criticized these resolutions as politically-calculated attacks on the administration. Members holding a different viewpoint argue that resolutions of inquiry have increased due to the executive branch's reluctance to respond to information requests from Congress, especially on politically sensitive issues. They criticize the White House for disregarding lawmakers' information requests and treating them as insignificant. Members argue that resolutions of inquiry have increased due to the executive branch's reluctance to respond to information requests from Congress, especially on politically sensitive issues. Resolutions of inquiry are seen as a parliamentary tool for individual Representatives to hold the executive branch accountable, with defense, foreign affairs, and intelligence being common subjects. This trend has been particularly notable during periods focused on military conflicts and foreign affairs, such as the Vietnam War, Iraq War, and Global War on Terrorism. The Speaker refers resolutions of inquiry to committees based on subject matter and jurisdiction. Three House committees - Armed Services, Foreign Affairs, and Judiciary - received the most referrals. These committees were primary referral for 60% of resolutions introduced between 1947 and October 20, 2017. Since 1975, legislation can be referred to multiple House committees. However, the modern practice is to refer resolutions of inquiry to a single committee only. Since 2004, three resolutions of inquiry have been multiply referred, possibly due to jurisdictional reasons or conscious decisions by House Speakers. Since 1947, 114 of the 313 resolutions of inquiry introduced in the House (36%) have been directed to the President or a Cabinet Secretary, as resolutions directed to officers below the Cabinet level do not enjoy privileged status. Since 1947, resolutions of inquiry in the House have been directed to various executive branch officials, including the President, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and Attorney General. Resolutions have also targeted Secretaries of Commerce, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Labor, and the Treasury, as well as sub-Cabinet officials like the Directors of Central Intelligence and National Intelligence. Since 1947, resolutions of inquiry in the House have been directed to various executive branch officials. Such resolutions may be marked up, reported without amendment, recommended amendments, reported favorably, adversely, or without recommendation. Approximately 52% of resolutions of inquiry introduced between 1947 and October 20, 2017, were acted on by the primary House committee of referral. During the period examined, House committees frequently marked up resolutions of inquiry and reported them adversely, indicating that the committee did not recommend the House agree to the resolution. This occurred in 73% of cases, while resolutions were reported favorably in 13% of cases and without recommendation in 14% of cases. During the period examined, House committees often reported resolutions of inquiry adversely, indicating they did not recommend the House agree to the resolution. Adverse reports were made for various reasons, such as opposition to the resolution, ensuring only committee designees could call it up, or when requested information was already provided by the executive branch to avoid wasting time. Additionally, adverse reports were issued to prevent compromising ongoing investigations or when the requested information was deemed irrelevant by the committee. Since the 108th Congress, committees have consistently marked up resolutions of inquiry, regardless of subject or sponsor, possibly to maintain control. The increase in introduced resolutions has raised concerns about the workload of House committees. Resolutions of inquiry are causing an increase in the workload of House committees, with concerns that minority party Members could use them to gain partial control over a committee's agenda. Certain committees are disproportionately affected, with some arguing that this misuse goes against the intended purpose of such resolutions. For example, in the 109th Congress, a significant number of reports from the Committee on International Relations were on minority-party sponsored resolutions of inquiry. During the same period, 21% of reports to the House by the Committee on Armed Services were on minority-party sponsored resolutions of inquiry. Opponents argue that these resolutions are a small fraction of the legislative workload and benefit the House by compelling committees to seek information from the executive branch. House floor consideration of resolutions of inquiry has been rare in recent years. In recent years, House floor consideration of resolutions of inquiry has been rare. Between 1947 and October 20, 2017, 64 resolutions of inquiry have been considered on the House floor, with approximately 40% of those reported by committees. Of the resolutions that received floor action, 81% were effectively killed by being laid on the table. Only 11 resolutions of inquiry have been agreed to by the House since 1947, with the most recent occurring in the 104th Congress (1995-1996). During the 91st-95th Congresses, some resolutions of inquiry were not acted upon, possibly because they were identical and introduced separately for more cosponsors. House committees now typically mark up and report resolutions of inquiry to maintain control and avoid floor votes. Resolutions of inquiry are seen as an oversight tool that is sometimes used disproportionately. Resolutions of inquiry are oversight tools used by both congressional majority and minority parties. Between 1947 and October 20, 2017, 132 resolutions were introduced by the majority party and 181 by the minority party. The political affiliation of resolution sponsors is fairly evenly divided. Since 2005, resolutions of inquiry have become increasingly partisan, with the majority being introduced by Members of Congress from the opposite party of the President. This trend indicates that resolutions of inquiry have become predominantly a tool used by the minority party for information-gathering purposes. Resolutions of inquiry have been used as an information-gathering tool, with data showing that half of the resolutions submitted between 1947 and October 20, 2017 resulted in unknown or disputed outcomes regarding the production of information from the executive branch. The effectiveness of resolutions of inquiry in obtaining information from the executive branch has varied over time. Between 2003-2006, these resolutions failed to produce information 64% of the time and succeeded in 19% of cases. Determining the success of such resolutions can be challenging due to these mixed results. The success rate of resolutions of inquiry in obtaining information from the executive branch has varied over time. Nearly half of resolutions introduced between 1947 and October 20, 2017, were not acted upon by House committees or the chamber floor, making it difficult to determine if the information request was fulfilled. In cases where resolutions were not pursued, it is likely that the information was obtained, especially for routine data requests. The purpose of a resolution of inquiry is to acquire factual information, but it may also serve other goals such as calling attention to an issue, seizing a committee's agenda, or forcing legislative action. The increase in resolutions introduced in recent Congresses may be due to these alternative goals. The increase in resolutions of inquiry introduced in recent Congresses may serve goals beyond acquiring factual information, such as calling attention to issues or forcing legislative action. Data suggests that these resolutions have become more common, leading to increased committee work and utilization by minority party Members in the House. This raises questions for policymakers regarding the impact on committee workloads and potential changes to House rules for handling such resolutions. The House may consider changes in handling resolutions of inquiry under House rules, such as making them privileged only if a committee reports them favorably or extending the time for committees to act on them. This could maintain the traditional use of resolutions of inquiry for all Members while giving committees more flexibility. The efficacy of resolutions of inquiry post-WWII shows mixed results, with some cases being effective. The efficacy of resolutions of inquiry in the House is unclear, with data showing mixed results. Lawmakers may need to implement a more rigorous accounting system for future resolutions of this type, such as directing agencies to report on their responses to resolutions or including this information in committee reports to the House. The House may need to standardize procedures for handling resolutions of inquiry, such as requiring committees to transmit them to the executive branch within a specified time frame. The House Committee on Rules could consider whether resolutions of inquiry should continue to have privileged parliamentary status. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee should consider examining the use of resolutions of inquiry as oversight tools, given advances in information technology. This examination could provide all Members of the House with a better understanding of the ongoing oversight relationship between the legislative and executive branches of government."
