    "content": "The FCC's primary task is to encourage broadband deployment in the US through various technologies. Recent regulatory changes have eased the process of erecting new broadband facilities. Congress and the Telecommunications Act of 1996 govern the deployment of wireless facilities, prohibiting discrimination among providers of similar services. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 prohibits discrimination among providers of similar services, allowing state and local governments flexibility in treating facilities differently based on visual, aesthetic, or safety concerns. However, policies cannot prohibit the provision of personal wireless services. The act also prevents state and local governments from effectively precluding tower siting, requiring carriers to demonstrate that further efforts would be fruitless. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 allows state and local governments flexibility in treating wireless facilities differently based on visual, aesthetic, or safety concerns. It also prohibits discrimination among providers of similar services and prevents governments from effectively precluding tower siting. Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 aims to streamline the local approval process by easing restrictions on collocation. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 aims to streamline the local approval process for wireless facilities by easing restrictions on collocation. Ambiguities in the terms \"tower\" and \"base station\" may cause difficulties in applying the new provision to future requests, but these may be resolved by federal courts or the FCC. Aesthetics can be a valid basis for denying a wireless permit if there is substantial evidence of adverse visual impact. Federal courts have upheld denials of wireless tower construction permits based on evidence of adverse visual impact, property value reduction, and damage to scenic qualities. General aesthetic concerns alone are not sufficient to support permit denial. The court upheld the reversal of a denial of a petition based on aesthetic concerns regarding a proposed wireless tower. Residents' dislike for poles in general was not considered substantial evidence, especially since they had no objection to flagpoles, the proposed disguise for the tower. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 prohibits state and local governments from regulating the placement of wireless facilities based on radio frequency emissions if they comply with FCC regulations. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 aims to prevent siting decisions based on unfounded health fears from emissions. Courts have enforced this provision, stating health concerns do not constitute substantial evidence for denial. The FCC will review regulations on radio frequency emissions. The act allows for appealing denials by state or local governments. Section 704(c) mandates procedures for federal property use within 180 days of enactment. President Clinton issued a memorandum in 1995 directing the Administrator of General Services to develop procedures for the placement of commercial antennas on federal property. The General Services Administration published updated procedures in 2007, stating they should remain in effect indefinitely. Congress required further action in 2012. In 2012, Congress required the Administrator of General Services to refine the process for granting easements for wireless infrastructure on federal property. Section 6409 of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 standardized and facilitated the placement of towers on federal property. The Administrator of General Services is mandated to develop a standard application for easements related to siting wireless towers on federally controlled property. Additionally, the General Services Administration is required to develop master contracts for wireless facilities siting. The GSA is mandated by Section 6409(c) to develop master contracts for wireless facilities siting on federal property. In 2008, CTIA requested a declaratory ruling from the FCC regarding the time frame for local authorities to approve or deny applications for new wireless towers. This was to clarify the provisions of the Communications Act, particularly 47 U.S.C. \u00a7332(c)(7). CTIA raised concerns about long delays in constructing wireless facilities and sought clarity from the FCC on when a state or local authority has failed to act on tower siting applications. They alleged that some denials were based solely on the presence of another wireless provider in the area, which they argued violated the Communications Act. As companies from recent spectrum auctions build new facilities, new towers may be necessary. The FCC issued a ruling in 2009 to streamline the tower siting application process, setting a 90-day review period for collocation applications and a 150-day review period for other applications. The ruling also stated that denying an application based solely on the presence of other carriers in the market is prohibited as it hinders the provision of wireless services. The FCC found evidence of unreasonable delays in reviewing applications for wireless facilities, hindering next-generation technology deployment. They adopted a presumption for state and local governments to act on collocation applications within 90 days and other applications within 150 days. Section 6409 of the Middle Class Tax Relief Act may impact collocation requests. The FCC requires state and local governments to act on collocation applications within specific timeframes. If the government fails to act, the applicant can file suit in federal court. The FCC does not grant automatic approval if the government misses the deadline. The FCC determined that a local government unlawfully prohibits wireless services by denying applications solely because another carrier serves the area. This decision aligns with a split in the circuits on whether such denials effectively prohibit wireless services. The First Circuit interprets \"services\" to include multiple carriers, while the Fourth Circuit limits localities from prohibiting all personal wireless services. The FCC found that local governments cannot prohibit wireless services by denying applications based on the presence of another carrier in the area. This interpretation aligns with the First Circuit's view that \"services\" include multiple carriers, while the Fourth Circuit limits localities from banning all personal wireless services. The agency concluded that if a carrier is effectively prevented from serving an area due to facility siting denials, it may violate the Communications Act even if another carrier provides services in that area. The FCC ruled that local governments cannot prohibit wireless services based on the presence of another carrier in an area. This decision aims to increase competition among wireless providers and improve service coverage nationwide. Opponents questioned the FCC's authority to interpret the provision, but the Commission affirmed its ability to do so. The FCC cited the Sixth Circuit's decision upholding its authority to issue the Local Franchising Order, which provided guidance on cable franchises. The FCC argued that its rulemaking authority extends to Section 332 despite its silence on the matter. This issue may be subject to future litigation by state and local entities. In January of 2012, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the FCC's authority to issue a declaratory order regarding wireless communications towers. Federal law does not seem to impact state or local zoning authority in this matter, with most states delegating zoning decisions to local bodies. Some states provide guidance on factors to consider when reviewing permits for wireless communication facilities, such as New Hampshire's law on visual effects of tall antennas. The law encourages local governing bodies to address the visual effects of tall wireless antennas and ensure all affected parties have a chance to be heard. Carriers are urged to consider alternatives like lower antenna mounts or disguised towers to minimize visual impact. Illinois law provides guidelines for carriers in choosing locations and designing facilities, without infringing on federal rights or authority. The law provides guidelines for siting telecommunications facilities, prioritizing non-residentially zoned lots as most desirable and small residential lots as least desirable. Design guidelines include preserving trees, landscaping, and ensuring compatibility with the area's residential character. States can also promote using existing infrastructure to reduce the number of new towers. In Kentucky, state law allows local planning commissions to require companies to co-locate equipment on existing towers if space is available and it does not interfere with the tower's integrity. Connecticut also allows sharing of towers when feasible and meeting safety concerns. Local governments use zoning authority to limit the impact of cellular towers on the environment. In an effort to regulate the construction of cellular towers, some counties and cities have enacted ordinances requiring permits for tower construction in specific areas. For example, one county in Georgia established a new permit system for towers in nonresidential areas, while the City of Bloomington, MN, requires wireless facilities to accommodate multiple users. Additionally, some communities have imposed moratoria on tower permits to comply with the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Several communities have enacted moratoria on permits for cellular towers to prevent or delay construction. Local governments justify this by needing time to study tower siting problems and zoning ordinances. Courts uphold moratoria with fixed lengths, but not those for long periods or indefinite. The FCC is streamlining the process of collocating equipment on existing utility poles to increase wireless facility deployment. Section 224 of the Communications Act grants the Commission authority to regulate this. The FCC has the authority to regulate rates, terms, and conditions for pole attachments under Section 224 of the Communications Act. In 2011, the FCC allowed incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) to benefit from Section 224, adjust rates charged by utilities to telecom carriers, and change refund calculations. Utility companies challenged the FCC's authority, arguing that ILECs were not included in the definition of telecom service providers under Section 224. The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld the FCC's interpretation of Section 224, allowing ILECs to benefit from pole attachment rights. Utility companies challenged the FCC's decision on telecom rates and refund calculations. The Court of Appeals upheld the FCC's interpretation of Section 224, allowing ILECs pole attachment rights. The court also denied utility companies' petition to review the FCC's order amending regulations under Section 224."
