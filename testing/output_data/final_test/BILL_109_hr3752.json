    "content": "The Gas Price Relief Act of 2005, also known as the Windfall Profits Tax, imposes a tax on windfall profits from crude oil. This Act adds a new chapter to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, outlining rules and definitions for the tax. The Gas Price Relief Act of 2005, also known as the Windfall Profits Tax, imposes an excise tax on integrated oil companies for windfall profits from taxable crude oil removed from properties. The tax is calculated as 50% of the excess profit over qualified investments made by the company. The tax is paid by the producer of the crude oil. The term 'windfall profit' in the Gas Price Relief Act of 2005 refers to the excess of the removal price of taxable crude oil over the base price of the barrel. The removal price is determined by the amount for which the oil is sold, with specific rules for sales between related persons and oil removed from property before sale. The term 'base price' for taxable crude oil is $40 per barrel. 'Qualified investment' refers to any amount paid or incurred. A 'qualified investment' is any amount paid or incurred for a qualified facility as described in section 45(d) without regard to the placed in service date. \"Special rules and definitions are outlined in section 5898.\" The Secretary will establish rules for withholding and depositing the tax on taxable crude oil under section 5896. Taxpayers must maintain records, submit returns, and provide information as required. The Secretary will determine the filing requirements for the windfall profit tax under section 5896. Definitions include 'producer' as the holder of the economic interest in crude oil, and 'crude oil' encompasses specific categories. The term 'crude oil' includes condensates and natural gasoline, excluding oil produced from wells drilled after the Gas Price Relief Act of 2005. A 'barrel' is defined as 42 US gallons. The Secretary may adjust removal prices to reflect fair market value, and regulations will be prescribed accordingly. The Secretary will prescribe regulations to carry out the chapter's purposes. The chapter will not apply to taxable crude oil removed after one year from the enactment date. Windfall profit tax receipts will be transferred to the Highway Trust Fund. The deductibility of windfall profit tax will be amended in the Internal Revenue Code. The windfall profit tax imposed by section 5896 will be added to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. A clerical amendment will be made to the table of chapters for subtitle E. Chapter 56 introduces amendments regarding windfall profit on crude oil, effective for oil removed after the enactment date. Transitional rules are prescribed for the period until December 31, 2005. Additionally, Section 3 discusses the reduction of fuel taxes on highway motor fuels. The Gas Price Relief Act of 2005 amends the Internal Revenue Code to reduce the tax on highway motor fuel by 10 cents per gallon for a 1-year period starting from the enactment date. Highway motor fuel refers to any fuel subject to tax under section 4041. The amendment defines 'fuel' as any taxable fuel under sections 4041 or 4081, excluding aviation gasoline and aviation-grade kerosene. The effective date of this amendment is the enactment date of the Act. SEC. 4. MAINTENANCE OF TRUST FUNDS DEPOSITS; AMOUNTS APPROPRIATED TO TRUST FUNDS TREATED AS TAXES. There is an appropriation to the Highway Trust Fund equal to the excess of reduced revenues due to a tax rate reduction over amounts appropriated by a windfall profits tax on crude oil. Amounts appropriated shall be transferred from the general fund to replicate transfers as if section 3 had not been enacted. The curr_chunk states that transfers will be made to replicate what would have happened if a certain section of the Act had not been enacted, and these transfers will be treated as taxes received under the appropriate section of Federal law. SEC. 5. FLOOR STOCK REFUNDS. Before the tax rate reduction date, if tax has been imposed on highway motor fuel under section 4081 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the fuel is held by a dealer for sale, a credit or refund will be given to the taxpayer for the excess tax paid. Claims for credit or refund must be filed with the Secretary of the Treasury within 6 months after the tax rate reduction date. The taxpayer can claim a credit or refund for excess tax paid on highway motor fuel before the tax rate reduction date. The taxpayer must repay the amount claimed to the dealer or obtain written consent for the credit or refund. No credit or refund is allowed for fuel in retail stocks. The tax rate reduction date is defined as the first day of the reduction period. The terms \"dealer\" and \"held by a dealer\" are defined in section 6412 of the Code. Rules similar to those in section 6412 of the Code apply to this section. SEC. 6. FLOOR STOCKS TAX. Imposition of Tax: A floor stocks tax is imposed on highway motor fuel held on the tax restoration date, exceeding the previously paid tax. Liability and payment method: The person holding the fuel is liable for the tax, to be paid as prescribed by the Secretary within 45 days of the tax restoration date. Definitions for this section are also provided. The tax restoration date is defined as the first day after the reduction period. Highway motor fuel and person holding the fuel are also defined in this section. The tax imposed does not apply to exempt uses. On the tax restoration date, no tax is imposed on up to 2,000 gallons of highway motor fuel held by a person, if certain conditions are met. Exempt fuel is not included in this calculation. The section discusses controlled groups for tax purposes, defining corporations and nonincorporated persons under common control. The term \"controlled group\" is defined with a substitution of \"more than 50 percent\" for \"at least 80 percent\" in certain cases. Under regulations set by the Secretary, similar principles to those in subparagraph (A) apply to a group of persons under common control if one or more of them is not a corporation. All relevant laws and penalties applicable to taxes imposed by section 4081 also apply to floor stock taxes imposed by subsection (a) to the same extent."
