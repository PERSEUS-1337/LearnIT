    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Anaktuvuk Pass Land Exchange and Wilderness Redesignation Act of 1994\". The Congress finds that the village of Anaktuvuk Pass is surrounded by the Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve, and residents rely on snow machines and all-terrain vehicles for access to subsistence resources. In 1983, a land exchange agreement reserved linear easements for Inupiat Eskimo people to use all-terrain vehicles in certain national park lands. However, these easements were found to be unsatisfactory due to inadequate access to subsistence resources and excessive environmental impact. Discussions between officials of the National Park Service and Nunamiut Corporation in 1985 led to an agreement in 1992, amended in 1993 and 1994, to address concerns over the use of all-terrain vehicles on park and wilderness land. The land exchange agreement in 1983 reserved easements for Inupiat Eskimo people to use all-terrain vehicles in national park lands. Discussions between the National Park Service, Nunamiut Corporation, and the city of Anaktuvuk Pass in Alaska led to an agreement in 1992, requiring approval and ratification by Congress for full effectuation. The Agreement, titled \"Donation, Exchange of Lands and Interests and Wilderness Redesignation Agreement Among Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, Nunamuit Corporation, City of Anaktuvuk Pass and the United States of America\", was executed in 1992 and amended in 1993 and 1994. The Secretary refers to the Secretary of the Interior. The Agreement is ratified in Section 4 of the Act. The Agreement titled \"Donation, Exchange of Lands and Interests and Wilderness Redesignation Agreement\" executed in 1992 and amended in 1993 and 1994 is ratified and confirmed. The United States' obligations under the Agreement are considered Federal law. Lands acquired by the United States will be administered as part of the Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve. Maps of the lands subject to conveyances are included. The lands subject to conveyances, retention of surface access rights, access easements, and all-terrain vehicle easements are determined by maps described in the Agreement. The maps are on file at the Alaska Regional Office of the National Park Service and the offices of Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve in Fairbanks, Alaska for public inspection. The written legal descriptions of the lands are available for public inspection at specified offices. In case of any discrepancies between the maps described and Map No. 185/80,039, the latter shall control. SEC. 5. NATIONAL PARK SYSTEM WILDERNESS.
