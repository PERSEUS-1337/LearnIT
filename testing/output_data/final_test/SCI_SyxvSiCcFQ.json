The loss function landscape of a neural network can be represented as a quantum state output by a quantum computer. This allows for training the network using quantum amplitude amplification. By adapting this method, the meta-loss landscape of multiple neural network architectures can be explored simultaneously to train and design a binary neural network. This approach addresses the challenge of finding suitable weights for neural networks in modern machine learning. Quantum machine learning aims to leverage quantum computing for improved machine learning performance. Research in this field falls into two categories, exploring the use of neuromorphic and quantum computers as Moore's law nears its end. Quantum computing utilizes quantum bits (qbits) governed by quantum physics, offering potential advantages over classical computing for optimization challenges in neural networks. In quantum machine learning, research is divided into two categories: some quantum algorithms show promise in theory but have implementation gaps, while others are more practical but struggle to compete with established methods. A quantum computer can output a quantum state representing the cost landscape for a neural network, including all possible hyperparameters and parameters. This method is versatile and can be used for training and metatraining binary neural networks using quantum amplitude amplification. Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) are neural networks with weights and activations restricted to binary values, providing advantages in compression, inference time, and computational efficiency. Despite challenges in training due to the discrete search space, BNNs have shown state-of-the-art performance on smaller datasets like MNIST and CIFAR10. To address issues on larger datasets like ImageNet, researchers have relaxed the binarisation constraints. Researchers have relaxed binarisation constraints in Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) to improve accuracy, using multiple binary activations and scale factors. Changes in training strategies, such as adjusting activation functions and regularization terms, have led to high accuracy and compression rates on ImageNet. However, training BNNs remains slow, with lower learning rates exacerbating the issue. Training a binary neural network on a quantum computer is ideal due to its discrete search space and small problem size. BNNs can be used in hybrid architectures for efficient transfer learning. Quantum computers offer improved computational complexity compared to classical computers. Quantum computers, with their improved scaling and computational power, could potentially handle large amounts of data efficiently. Grover's algorithm and quantum amplitude amplification offer faster search capabilities compared to classical algorithms. However, recent challenges have shown that classical algorithms inspired by quantum methods can achieve similar scaling. Some quantum algorithms, like k-means clustering and solving linear systems of equations, have shown efficiency. These algorithms require classical data to be encoded into qRAM. Constructing qRAM for general datasets efficiently remains a challenge, impacting the feasibility of these methods. Mimicking classical machine learning approaches by training parametrized quantum circuits on classical computers is an alternative method. Training parametrized quantum circuits on classical computers is a method used to perform classification and learn generative models. The lack of an efficient algorithm for training quantum circuits is a major issue, leading to current methods resembling black box optimization. Quantum circuits' output is known to be impossible to simulate efficiently with classical computers, suggesting potential superior performance. Previous work has explored training a perceptron using quantum amplitude amplification, with complexity compared to classical methods. Quantum hardware has been used for binary classification, but a different method is proposed here. Quantum computing involves manipulating qubits with quantum gates in quantum circuits. Manufacturing qubits is challenging due to their noise-sensitive nature. Progress in quantum computing has been rapid, with devices containing imperfect qubits available for public access. Simulating qubits using classical computers is difficult and resource-intensive. Quantum algorithms are defined in terms of circuit implementation due to the difficulty of simulating qubits using classical computers. Qubits, the unit of quantum information, can exist in states of 0, 1, or a superposition of both, represented by a two-dimensional vector with complex elements. Quantum measurement is a unique feature of quantum mechanics where qubits are measured to produce a binary outcome, either 0 or 1. This process is indeterministic, probabilistic, and irreversible, causing the original state to be lost. The values \u03b1 and \u03b2 can only be obtained through repeated measurements of identical copies of the state. The phase \u03c6 does not affect the measurement outcome but can be manipulated with quantum gates. Quantum gates manipulate qubit states through complex matrices, enabling exponential scaling with N qubits described by a complex vector of unit norm. This exponential scaling makes simulating even modest numbers of qubits unfeasible on a classical computer. The transformation of qubit states follows linear algebra rules, where a state |\u03c8 is transformed into a different state |\u03c6 by applying a quantum gate U according to the matrix transformation |\u03c6 = U |\u03c8. Quantum gates manipulate qubit states through complex matrices, enabling exponential scaling with N qubits. These matrices are unitary, ensuring reversibility of quantum operations. Quantum computing differs from classical computing in the operations that can be performed on qubits. Certain quantum operations have no classical analogue, and vice versa. Small sets of quantum gates are universal and can generate any other quantum operation. The X gate flips qubit states, the Z gate transforms states, and the Hadamard gate creates quantum superposition. These gates have no classical analogue and are essential for quantum computing. The controlled-not (CNOT) gate is a generalization of the classical XOR gate, performing a NOT gate on a target qubit based on the state of a control qubit. Quantum superpositions allow for parallel processing of weights, which is not possible classically.Weights are represented by the quantum state of qubits in an equal superposition of all possible sets, defining the domain for processing. The quantum circuit U QN N processes weights in superposition form, allowing for parallel processing. This generates a landscape state correlating all possible weights with their accuracies, represented as a single quantum state. In quantum physics, weights and accuracies in a neural network are entangled. By setting weights and connection meta-parameters to superposition, a meta-cost landscape of every possible weight with every possible connectivity can be generated using a quantum circuit. The method demonstrates generating a meta-cost landscape for a binary neural network on simple toy problems using quantum circuits. The binary neural network is advantageous due to its representation with one qubit per weight. Two toy problems involving binary classification are constructed, each with specific label functions. The sign function is defined for both problems, and the BNN implementation is chosen accordingly. The Quantum Binary Neural Network (QBNN) is implemented by mapping every operation in a Binary Neural Network (BNN) to a quantum equivalent. Qubits represent numerical values, with |1 and |0 corresponding to +1 and -1. Multiplication of binary values is achieved using an anti-CNOT gate in a quantum circuit. The anti-CNOT gate in a Quantum Binary Neural Network applies a NOT gate to a target qubit if the control qubit is in the state |0 instead of |1, performing the same function as multiplying two binary values. To handle the non-linearity of the sign function, extra ancilla qubits can be added. In the special case of binary arguments, the sign function is reduced to finding whether there exist N/2 qubits out of N in state |1. The sign function in a Quantum Binary Neural Network is reduced to determining if there are N/2 qubits in state |1. This is achieved by constructing a quantum majority function using CCNOT and CNOT/NOT gates. The QBNN consists of interconnected neurons with weighted activations. Predictions are compared to labels for accuracy using qubit registers. The quantum circuit's reversibility aids in this process. The QBNN utilizes a register of qubits to store predictions for data points. The circuit's reversibility allows for refreshing qubits and obtaining accuracy by applying a NOT gate. This process is necessary for small quantum computers but can be avoided with more qubits. Training the QBNN involves using quantum amplitude amplification to search for a single state within the cost function landscape. This technique amplifies the probability amplitudes corresponding to desired states in the superposition, increasing the probability of measuring one of these states. The 'good' subspace is defined to aid in this process. Quantum amplitude amplification is used to search for a single state within the cost function landscape by rotating probabilities. The 'good' subspace is defined as having all qubits in the prediction register in the state |1 for correct classification. The amplifying operator, Q, is constructed for this process, with operations applied from right to left. Quantum gates are reversible, and operations S 0 and S \u03c7 reverse the sign of probability amplitudes. Quantum amplitude amplification changes probability distribution by rotating probabilities to search for a single state. Target states have 100% accuracy with controlled-Z gates. Initial state is all qubits in state |0. Success probability after k amplifications is sin^2(2k+1)\u03b8. The training of a Binary Neural Network (BNN) involves a probabilistic search on a hyper-parameter p = sin 2 \u03b8. The success probability is periodic in k, with the first maximum inversely proportional to \u03b8. The landscape consists of 8 weight qubits and 8 prediction qubits, with success determined by all prediction qubits being in state |1. Quantum amplitude amplification circuits are used for the search process on a quantum computer. The study utilized quantum amplitude amplification circuits on the projectQ framework BID18 to train a Binary Neural Network (BNN) to 100% accuracy on the training data. Despite limitations in quantum hardware, the results matched the expected periodic behavior, confirming the effectiveness of quantum search in training BNNs. The Binary Neural Network (BNN) was trained to 100% accuracy using quantum amplifications. A simple algorithm was used to probe the landscape, showing training success with over 90% probability after just a few steps. Comparing to classical search, only a few correct sets of weights were found for each problem. The quantum algorithm showed a quadratic speedup over classical search for harder problems, requiring 28 and 57 steps respectively to succeed with over 90% confidence. A more complex QBNN was constructed to incorporate meta-training by encoding connection parameters within qubits in the same way as weights. The quantum algorithm demonstrated a quadratic speedup over classical search for challenging problems. A more complex QBNN was created to include meta-training by encoding connection parameters within qubits. The output of the circuit is the meta-cost landscape, where weights, connections, and accuracy are entangled. Quantum amplitude amplification is used to search for the state with all points correctly classified. Due to qubit constraints, only the structure of the first layer of the BNN is learned, while the second layer remains fixed. Between 16 and 20 amplifications were sufficient to produce results. The meta-QBNN demonstrated quantum advantage in training and metatraining by efficiently encoding entire loss landscapes in a quantum state using just a single run of a quantum circuit. Quantum superposition was used to represent parameters and hyper-parameters of a BNN, showing promise for further processing to achieve quantum advantage. The meta-QBNN showed quantum advantage in training by encoding loss landscapes in a quantum state with a quadratic speedup. Overfitting is a concern, but a solution could involve deselecting specific weights during quantum amplitude amplification. The method incorporates the entire dataset at once by using a different batch of data for each quantum amplitude amplification iteration. This allows for the amplification of a good set of weights by the circuit, using fewer qubits. Limitations include the requirement for binary input and poor scaling of the activation function, which could be improved or replaced with a more efficient binary activation function compatible with non-binary input. The quantum search method discussed in the curr_chunk scales poorly compared to backpropagation and only shows an advantage in unstructured classical/quantum searches. It is noted that backpropagation takes advantage of the cost function landscape structure, while the quantum method does not. There is a conjecture that a quantum search method that applies quantum advantage to structured searches could be used in place of quantum amplitude amplification. Harnessing quantum computers to aid classical machine learning methods remains a challenge. The loss landscape state is proposed as a potential solution, focusing on understanding the landscape's features for improved learning. Investigating the relationship between the landscape as a quantum state and its impact on machine learning is crucial for progress in this direction."
