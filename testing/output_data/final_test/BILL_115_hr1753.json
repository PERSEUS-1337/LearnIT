    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Opportunities for Fairness in Farming Act of 2017\". Congress finds that generic programs, known as \"checkoff programs,\" aim to increase demand for agricultural commodities and benefit producers. Despite laws prohibiting the use of funds to influence legislation, checkoff programs have been found to do so. Unlawful use of funds benefits some producers while harming others, necessitating stricter oversight to prevent misuse. Conflicts of interest in checkoff programs allow special interests to misuse funds for some producers, harming others. Prohibiting such conflicts is necessary for lawful operation. Lack of transparency in these programs enables misconduct that damages competition and other agricultural commodities. Requiring transparency in checkoff program expenditures is essential to prevent and uncover abuses in these programs. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"Board\" as an entity for checkoff programs, and \"checkoff program\" as a promotional program for agricultural commodities without specific producers or brands, including programs under various agricultural acts. The curr_chunk lists various agricultural acts including the Wheat and Wheat Foods Research Act, the Floral Research Act, the Dairy Production Stabilization Act, the Honey Research Act, the Pork Promotion Act, the Watermelon Research Act, the Pecan Promotion Act, and the Mushroom Promotion Act. The curr_chunk lists various agricultural acts including the Mushroom Promotion Act of 1990, the Lime Research Act, the Soybean Promotion Act, the Fluid Milk Promotion Act, the Fresh Cut Flowers and Fresh Cut Greens Promotion Act, the Sheep Promotion Act, and the Commodity Promotion Act. The curr_chunk discusses different agricultural acts such as the Canola and Rapeseed Research Act, the Kiwifruit Research Act, the Popcorn Promotion Act, and the Hass Avocado Promotion Act. It also defines \"conflict of interest\" as a financial interest in a person or entity that works with a Board. The curr_chunk defines the term \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Agriculture. SEC. 4. REQUIREMENTS OF CHECKOFF PROGRAMS. Prohibitions for a Board carrying out checkoff program activities include not entering contracts with parties influencing government policies, avoiding conflicts of interest, and prohibiting anticompetitive or deceptive acts.

They have the authority to enter into contracts for promotional activities with approval from the Secretary. Contracts must include provisions for accurate record-keeping of all funds received and expenses incurred. The Board overseeing a checkoff program must publish all approved budgets and disbursements, including amount, purpose, recipient, and other parties involved. Audits are also required. The Inspector General of the Department of Agriculture conducts periodic audits to determine compliance of each checkoff program with the requirements. The audits include a review of records produced to the Board and reports are submitted upon completion. The Inspector General of the Department of Agriculture conducts periodic audits to ensure compliance with checkoff program requirements. Reports are prepared and submitted to Congress and the Comptroller General every 3-5 years. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct an audit to assess compliance with checkoff program requirements and the effectiveness of actions taken to improve program integrity. A report will be prepared with recommendations to strengthen program impact.
