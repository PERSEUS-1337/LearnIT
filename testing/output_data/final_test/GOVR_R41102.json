The 12 regional banks act as lenders to member banks, offering low-interest loans for mortgages. Despite facing financial stress, these banks have been crucial during the financial crisis and are expected to play a significant role in the economic recovery. The collapse of the housing market has caused serious financial stress for FHLBanks, raising concerns about their stability and potential failure. These banks are crucial in providing or financing mortgages and are interconnected with the national mortgage market. This report discusses the FHLBanks' creation, purpose, structure, and current financial state, as well as the statutory options for handling a potential failure. The Federal Home Loan Bank Act of 1932 created the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) system to provide loans to member banks for mortgages. The FHLBank underwent reforms in 1989, 1999, and 2008 to ensure safety and soundness. In 1989, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) made significant changes to the FHLBank system, opening membership to all depository institutions involved in mortgage lending. The Federal Housing Finance Board replaced the Federal Home Loan Bank Board for regulation. The Federal Home Loan Bank System Modernization Act of 1999 expanded membership and mission by removing mortgage asset requirements and allowing advances secured by assets other than housing loans. In 2008, the Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA) established the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) as the new regulator for the FHLBank system, granting it broad supervisory and regulatory powers. The FHFA Director, a presidential appointee, has authority to set risk-based capital requirements and oversee the regulation of housing. The FHLBank system consists of 12 regional member-owned and federally chartered banks with individual boards of directors. The Office of Finance coordinates the sale of debt securities for fundraising. Each regional bank has a 13-member board, with a majority being officers of member banks and at least two-fifths being independent directors. The FHLBank system consists of 12 regional member-owned and federally chartered banks with individual boards of directors. At least two-fifths of board members must be independent directors. All FHLBanks are responsible for each other's debts and obligations, adding reliability to FHLBank debt securities. Membership is open to federally regulated depository or financial institutions engaged in \"long-term\" home mortgage lending. Eligible institutions must purchase stock in their regional FHLBank to become partial owners. The FHLBank system consists of 12 regional member-owned banks with individual boards of directors. Membership is open to federally regulated institutions engaged in home mortgage lending. Once an institution purchases stock in its regional bank, it becomes a partial owner eligible for benefits like dividend payments and FHLBank advances. The FHLBanks provide low-interest loans as a government-sponsored enterprise, with over 8,000 institutions in the system holding assets exceeding $13 trillion. The Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac) are involved in either borrowing funds to hold mortgages or packaging them into mortgage-backed securities (MBS). GSEs do not receive explicit government funding and enjoy special privileges such as tax exemptions. The FHLBank system, along with other GSEs, benefits from Congressional sponsorship, which grants them specific governmental powers and financial benefits. Only members can purchase stock in the FHLBank system. The FHLBank system is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, with only members able to purchase stock. FHLBank shares are bought and sold directly from the issuing FHLBank. The federal government provides an implicit guarantee for FHLBank obligations, although the value of this guarantee is uncertain. Congress has historically supported GSEs like Fannie Mae and the Farm Credit System during financial difficulties. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to support GSEs with bonds and purchase securities to stabilize financial markets. FHLBank securities are considered low risk due to an implicit federal guarantee, allowing them to borrow funds at low interest rates. The FHLBanks played a key role in stabilizing the financial system during the crisis. During the financial crisis, FHLBanks provided capital to member banks to prevent collapses and facilitate mergers. This led to an increased concentration of advances to large institutions, raising potential losses for FHLBanks. In modern finance, diversification of borrowers is preferred to mitigate risks. The FHLBank system faced financial difficulties due to declining home prices, rising delinquencies, and mergers. Some banks saw declines in advances while others increased. Preliminary 2009 financial reports showed a combined new operating income of $1.9 billion, with four FHLBanks reporting net losses. The FHLBank system faced financial difficulties with losses in Pittsburgh, Chicago, and Seattle due to declining asset values. Factors contributing to decreased income include mergers reducing membership, smaller spreads between borrowing and lending rates, and unprofitable MBS purchases. Programs to sell MBS competitively resulted in losses and were terminated. The Chicago FHLBank signed a consent order to cease repurchasing capital stock, Seattle FHLBank is undercapitalized, Des Moines and Pittsburgh are in unsatisfactory condition, Boston and Atlanta suspended dividends. FHLBank system assets decreased to $1,062 billion from $1,349 billion, total capital decreased to $45 billion from $50 billion. System net income was $1.3 billion compared to $1.9 billion in 2008. Mortgage market activity decline led to reduction in bonds and notes outstanding to $980 billion from $1,258 billion. The FHLBank system's recent financial troubles have raised concerns about handling the failure of regional banks. The system is structured to prevent a collapse, with each bank responsible for the debts of others. If necessary, the FHFA has the authority to take control of failing banks. The FHLBank system can recover from a single bank failure without federal involvement, but multiple regional bank failures or all 12 banks in financial stress may pose challenges. FHLBanks can merge voluntarily with approval, and the system can operate with fewer than 12 banks through mergers or liquidations. HERA provides the FHFA with options to handle financially troubled FHLBanks, including changing leadership, merging banks, liquidating, or placing under conservatorship. The Secretary of the Treasury has temporary authority to lend in emergencies. FHFA can enforce minimum capital levels through corrective action. The FHFA has the authority to take corrective action on FHLBanks based on their capital levels. Undercapitalization is classified as adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized. The FHFA can monitor and take various actions, including appointing new directors or executive officers, if a bank becomes significantly undercapitalized. In cases of critical undercapitalization, the FHFA can be appointed as conservator or receiver. The FHFA has the authority to appoint a conservator or receiver for failing banks based on various grounds such as insufficient assets or significant losses. The appointed entity would have control over the failing bank, with powers to operate, manage, and potentially liquidate the institution. The FHFA has the authority to appoint a conservator or receiver for failing banks based on various grounds such as insufficient assets or significant losses. The appointed entity would have control over the failing bank, with powers to operate, manage, and potentially liquidate the institution. The Director of the regulated entity has explicitly granted powers including transferring assets, paying obligations, issuing subpoenas, and taking necessary actions to ensure the entity's sound and solvent condition. In limited circumstances, HERA mandates a receivership for an FHLBank if its debts exceed assets or if it has not been paying debts as they come due. The FHFA can liquidate or reorganize an FHLBank under a conservatorship or receivership, and the affected bank can challenge the appointment in court. The FHFA has broad authority to liquidate or reorganize an individual FHLBank when deemed necessary for efficient purposes. The affected bank must be given 30 days' notice before any action is taken, and can challenge the determination through a hearing. The FHFA Director's authority, used for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, would apply to handling a critically undercapitalized FHLBank. HERA requires the Director to consider differences between FHLBanks and other GSEs. The FHFA has authority to take corrective action on FHLBanks based on their cooperative ownership, liquidity, and affordable housing mission. FHLBanks provide low-cost funding to member banks and play a significant role in the housing market recovery. Some FHLBanks face financial challenges due to the mortgage crisis, but internal cooperative structures may help stabilize the system. Government intervention is possible if internal corrections fail. The FHLBank system, with assets of nearly $1.1 trillion as of September 30, 2009, has over 70% of assets in advances or mortgage loans. Member banks can borrow based on stock purchased and mortgage-related assets."
