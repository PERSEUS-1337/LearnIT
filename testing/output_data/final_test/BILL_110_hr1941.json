The \"Liberian Refugee Immigration Protection Act of 2007\" allows for the adjustment of status for eligible aliens to lawful permanent residence, with certain conditions and exceptions. An alien in the US with an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal can apply for adjustment of status without needing to file a motion to reopen the order. If the application is granted, the order will be canceled; if denied, the order remains enforceable. Aliens eligible for adjustment of status under temporary protected status provisions for nationals of Liberia can seek a stay of removal based on their application. The Secretary of Homeland Security can provide regulations for aliens with final deportation orders to request a stay upon filing an application. The Secretary of Homeland Security can authorize an alien applying for adjustment of status to work in the US during the application process, except if the application has been denied. The Secretary of Homeland Security can authorize employment for an alien during the adjustment of status application process, if the application is pending for over 180 days without denial. Additionally, spouses and children of aliens whose status is adjusted to permanent residence can also have their status adjusted by the Secretary of Homeland Security. The alien must prove physical presence in the US for at least 1 year, be present during the application, meet visa and admissibility requirements, excluding certain grounds for exclusion. The alien must prove physical presence in the US for at least 1 year, be present during the application, meet visa and admissibility requirements, excluding certain grounds for exclusion. For establishing continuous physical presence, absences not exceeding 180 days are allowed. The Secretary of Homeland Security must provide administrative review rights and procedures to applicants for adjustment of status. Aliens in removal proceedings under section 240 of the Immigration and Nationality Act are subject to final decisions by the Secretary of Homeland Security regarding their status adjustment. When an alien is granted permanent residence status, the Secretary of State is not required to reduce the number of immigrant visas available. The Immigration and Nationality Act definitions apply unless specified otherwise in this Act. The Act does not affect the powers of the Secretary of Homeland Security in enforcing immigration laws. Eligibility for permanent residence status under this Act does not prevent aliens from seeking status under other laws they qualify for."
