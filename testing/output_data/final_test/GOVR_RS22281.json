GSA's Southeast Region 4 oversees federal buildings in eight states. Hurricane Katrina caused damage to GSA-owned and leased facilities in North Carolina, Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. Advanced preparations were made to secure buildings, including fueling generators and boarding up lower levels. Some facilities did not suffer major damage, but lacked critical infrastructure and access roads. Environmental concerns also arose. After Hurricane Katrina, GSA faced challenges in finding suitable office space for federal employees who were forced to evacuate due to the destruction of their homes. GSA leased temporary office space in Baton Rouge to accommodate workers who relocated from New Orleans. The administration used leasing and relocation priorities to secure office space for federal tenants in the aftermath of the disaster. After Hurricane Katrina, GSA leased office space in Baton Rouge for federal agencies like FEMA, Social Security Administration, FBI, DEA, and IRS employees from New Orleans. Additional office space was leased in Lafayette, Shreveport, and Jackson to accommodate other federal tenants. GSA inspected leased facilities for structural damage and notified landlords of uninhabitable properties. After Hurricane Katrina, GSA terminated leases for uninhabitable properties, including federal courthouses in New Orleans. The John Minor Wisdom Court of Appeals resumed operations in its headquarters in January 2006, with regular hearings starting in February. The courthouses suffered wind damage and roof leaks but remained structurally intact. After Hurricane Katrina, GSA reported that the Hale Boggs and John Minor Wisdom courthouses had reopened to the public. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit temporarily relocated to Houston, TX, with court business resuming in September 2005. Judges and court employees who lost their homes were provided temporary housing in Gonzalez, LA. The Dan M. Russell, Jr. U.S. Federal Courthouse in Gulfport, MS, sustained severe water and wind damage, leading to a 30-day suspension of court operations. The Dan M.

Legislation introduced in the Senate in 2005 aimed to amend current law to allow the GSA Administrator to enter into emergency lease agreements during major disasters or emergencies declared by the President or a federal agency head. The proposed legislation would have limited the term of emergency leases to five years without congressional approval. The GSA Administrator would have been required to submit an annual report describing any emergency lease to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works by April 1 of each year. S. 1708 was referred to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works in 2005, but no further action was taken. H.R. 4125, introduced in the House, would have authorized repairs on federal buildings damaged by Gulf Coast hurricanes without prior congressional approval. The proposed legislation, H.R. 4125, would authorize the GSA Administrator to enter emergency lease agreements for up to five years. The Administrator would need to submit reports on building repairs costs and completion estimates to relevant committees. The bill was favorably reported by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure in 2006. No further action was taken on H.R. 4125 after being favorably reported by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure in 2006.
