    "content": "The U.S. considers a stable, democratic, prosperous Pakistan vital to counter Islamist militancy. Top concerns include terrorism, stability in Afghanistan, political stability, nuclear security, human rights, and economic development. Despite being a key ally in anti-terrorism efforts, U.S. policies since 9/11 have not effectively neutralized militants or reduced extremism. Domestic terrorist attacks are frequent, with extremism spreading beyond tribal areas. The assessment of Pakistan as the most dangerous country in the world today due to nuclear proliferation, drug smuggling, military dictatorship, and international terrorism is a major concern for U.S. officials. Vice President Joseph Biden highlighted Pakistan's deployable nuclear weapons, radicalized population, and lack of a fully functional democracy as worrisome factors. The U.S. State Department issues stern warnings about the country's direction towards potential comprehensive failure within a few years. The U.S. State Department issues stern warnings on the risks of travel to Pakistan, as the country is ranked as a failed or failing state. Pakistan has incurred casualties and eliminated terrorists in the fight against extremism, leading to high socioeconomic costs and financial losses of up to $40 billion since 2001. The severe psychological toll on the Pakistani people has led to an upsurge in reports of depression, anxiety, paranoia, and post-traumatic stress disorders. Pakistan's troubled economic conditions, fluid political setting, and perilous security circumstances present serious challenges to U.S. decision makers. The Islamabad government faces crises that erode their options and elicit significant public resentment. Pakistan is the setting for multiple armed Islamist insurgencies, contributing to the destabilization of the region. Al Qaeda forces and their allies remain active on Pakistani territory. The challenges faced by Pakistan and its anti-American sentiments present a daunting task for U.S. policymakers. Despite some positive signs, the progress in U.S.-Pakistan relations post-2001 has not met desired outcomes. Pakistan continues to experience religious, ethnic, and political violence, along with intense anti-Americanism. The civilian government remains weak, security institutions influence foreign policies, and some elements sympathize with militant groups. Pakistan's status as a hotbed of religious extremism is a concern for the U.S. Pakistan's status as a hotbed of religious extremism has only become more secure in recent years, with Al Qaeda operating in the tribal areas and Afghanistan remaining unstable. There are signs of Pakistan being used for recruiting and training American nationals for terrorist attacks on the U.S. homeland. Pakistani military officials feel bullied by the U.S. and resent the perceived transactional relationship and strategy to denuclearize Pakistan. The Obama Administration is determined to continue supporting Pakistan despite its ongoing issues, including domestic militancy and economic crises. Vice President Biden conveyed the message that Pakistan is crucial to U.S. interests during a visit to Islamabad in January 2011. Pakistani military officials resist U.S. efforts to persuade them and have shown defiance, such as closing the Torkham border crossing after NATO helicopter attacks. Obama emphasized the importance of Pakistan to U.S. interests and addressed misconceptions held by Pakistanis. The Obama Administration focused on increasing nonmilitary aid to improve the lives of the Pakistani people and military aid for counterinsurgency goals, conditioned on progress in combating militancy. President Obama, Vice President Biden, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton supported the Enhanced Partnership With Pakistan Act of 2008. The Pakistan Enduring Assistance and Cooperation Enhancement Act of 2009 was passed into law as the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act (EPPA) of 2009. Obama emphasized the importance of working effectively with Pakistan to address security threats. Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari seeks closer relationship with the US to combat terrorism, emphasizing Pakistan's commitment to fighting extremism. Despite hopes for US involvement in resolving Kashmir tensions, Secretary of State Clinton defers on the issue. During her confirmation hearing, Secretary Clinton emphasized the U.S. role in facilitating settlements but not mediating. She criticized the Pakistani government for abdicating to the Taliban and extremists, warning of strained U.S.-Pakistan relations if appropriate actions were not taken. President Obama expressed concern over Pakistan's fragile civilian government's ability to provide basic services, while acknowledging the military's efforts against militants. The Administration's tone shifted after Pakistani forces launched major offensive operations against Taliban militants in the Swat Valley. U.S. officials laud Pakistan's military operations but also want Islamabad to target a broader array of extremist threats. Joint Chiefs Chairman Admiral Mike Mullen emphasized the need for Pakistan to eliminate all forms of extremism and terrorism. Secretary Gates visited Pakistan in early 2010 to address grievances. In early 2010, Secretary Gates visited Pakistan with a focus on the future and dispelling anti-American rumors. The U.S. assured Pakistan it did not covet their land or nuclear weapons. Intensive diplomacy and promises of a role in Afghanistan's future led Pakistani leaders to distance themselves from extremist groups. Richard Holbrooke credited this shift to persistent efforts and multiple high-level visits to Pakistan. The Taliban acknowledged the impact of persistent U.S. efforts and visits to Pakistan. Congress remains skeptical of Islamabad's commitment to resolving the Afghan insurgency. Observers in Pakistan criticize U.S. diplomacy for focusing too much on security issues. Troubled U.S.-Pakistan relations have led some Pakistanis to seek alternative destinations for work and education. President Obama appointed Richard Holbrooke as Special Representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan to coordinate U.S. efforts in the region. Richard Holbrooke was appointed as the Special Representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan (SRAP) to coordinate U.S. efforts in the region. His task was to address the \"infinitely complex\" situation in Pakistan and improve U.S.-Pakistan relations. Despite some skepticism and concerns about his strong views, Holbrooke believed in progress and made several trips to the region before his untimely death. President Obama's mandate for Holbrooke was strictly limited to dealing with the Pakistan-Afghanistan situation. In February 2009, President Obama ordered a policy review to improve U.S.-Pakistan relations and develop a new strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan as one theater of operations. The strategy aims to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat Al Qaeda in Pakistan and prevent their re-emergence in the region by utilizing all elements of U.S. national power. The Administration seeks to overcome the \"trust deficit\" in the region to achieve these goals. The Administration aims to engage the Pakistani people based on a long-term commitment to help build a stable economy, stronger democracy, and vibrant civil society. Ambassador Holbrooke highlighted the challenges in dealing with western Pakistan and the \"red lines\" set by Islamabad. The new strategy focuses on integrating policies, increasing resources, and countering Islamist propaganda. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Senator John Kerry praised the strategy as \"realistic and bold.\" President Zardari welcomed increased U.S. aid to combat militancy in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Islamabad had expressed support for a regional approach before the new U.S. strategy was announced. Secretary of State Clinton noted the value of trilateral meetings between the U.S., Pakistan, and Afghanistan. President Obama hosted a meeting in 2009 to defeat Al Qaeda. In October 2009, Secretary Clinton visited Pakistan to address the threat posed by extremists. She met with political and military leaders, engaging in open discussions with civil society members to repair bilateral relations. During a visit to Pakistan in late 2009, former National Security Advisor General James Jones delivered a personal letter from President Obama to President Zardari, urging him to unite the country against regional extremism. The United States was prepared to take unilateral action, including expanding drone strikes to Baluchistan and resuming Special Operations missions across the Durand Line if rapid progress was not made. Pakistan's foreign minister stated that they will not be influenced by others, and President Zardari emphasized Pakistan's commitment to addressing the common threat on its own terms. The Obama Administration announced a shift in the bilateral relationship with Pakistan towards mutual interest, respect, and trust. The Obama Administration emphasized mutual interest, respect, and trust in the bilateral relationship with Pakistan. President Obama urged Pakistan to target terrorist groups and eliminate safe havens. Some in Congress criticized the reliance on Pakistan as an ally. The SRAP's office released a strategy focusing on defeating Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The document acknowledges the mistrust between the US and Pakistan but sees an opportunity for cooperation in combating extremism. The strategy aims to mobilize international support to help Pakistan overcome challenges and improve regional stability. Pakistani officials remain dissatisfied with the bilateral relationship. Officials expressed dissatisfaction with the U.S. bilateral relationship, particularly regarding U.S. recognition of the threat from India. President Bush initiated a \"Strategic Dialogue\" with Pakistan in 2007, which was revived by the Obama Administration in 2010. A delegation of Pakistani leaders visited Washington, with Foreign Minister Qureshi officially leading but General Kayani seen as the dominant figure in bilateral talks. In the lead-up to bilateral talks, Islamabad government emphasized the need for increased support from Washington. Pakistan presented a 56-page document requesting expanded military and economic aid, hinting at closer alignment with U.S. interests. Rumors suggested Pakistan might curb militant networks in exchange for special considerations in regional affairs, including potential civil nuclear cooperation deals. Obama Administration officials responded positively to these developments. The Obama Administration officials were positive about Pakistan's visit, with a joint statement highlighting increased engagement and the creation of a Policy Steering Group. Secretary Clinton praised Pakistan's efforts to combat terrorism, while the U.S. reaffirmed its commitment to assist with socioeconomic challenges. However, some Pakistani analysts were disappointed with the lack of progress on key priorities such as preferential trade, civil nuclear technology access, and assistance in resolving disputes with India. The Obama Administration officials were positive about Pakistan's visit, highlighting increased engagement and the creation of a Policy Steering Group. Secretary Clinton praised Pakistan's efforts to combat terrorism, while the U.S. reaffirmed its commitment to assist with socioeconomic challenges. However, some Pakistani analysts were disappointed with the lack of progress on key priorities such as preferential trade, civil nuclear technology access, and assistance in resolving disputes with India. The Administration's biannual report to Congress on progress toward U.S. policy objectives in Pakistan and Afghanistan emphasized efforts to enhance Pakistan's civilian government capacity and stability, noting areas of progress and ongoing obstacles. The report highlighted challenges faced by Pakistan's civilian government, including President Zardari's declining popularity. It also noted Pakistan's successful military operations in certain regions but criticized the army for not conducting large-scale operations against extremist groups in western Pakistan. The report identified a fundamental problem in the army's inability to effectively hold and build cleared areas. The Pakistani military is criticized for avoiding direct conflict with the Afghan Taliban or Al Qaeda in North Waziristan, seen as a political choice due to limited resources. The Obama Administration planned to increase military aid to Pakistan to encourage more aggressive operations in the FATA. Secretary Clinton praised progress on action plans in the FATA and announced a new Multi-Year Security Assistance Commitment to Pakistan, including a request for $400 million in annual military financing funds. President Obama emphasized the importance of the Dialogue in building a true partnership with Pakistan. The Joint Statement expressed satisfaction with progress and a commitment to gaining congressional support for legislation. The US government will redouble efforts to gain congressional support for ROZ and enterprise fund legislation. President Obama plans to visit Pakistan in 2011. US officials warned Pakistan of potential consequences for inaction against militant groups. The Administration's policy review highlighted gains in pressuring Al Qaeda in Pakistan. The Administration remains focused on Pakistan-based Al Qaeda, calling for greater cooperation along the border with Afghanistan. The December strategy review was described as a realistic assessment of the foreign policy challenge, noting progress in combating Al Qaeda and Pakistani military efforts to shut down sanctuaries. Pentagon officials praised the improvement in the U.S.-Pakistan relationship and coordination of counterterrorism efforts. Ambassador Holbrooke's death in December 2010 was a loss for the U.S. Ambassador Holbrooke's sudden death in December 2010 was a significant loss for U.S. diplomacy and efforts to stabilize the region. His deputy, Frank Ruggerio, lacks Holbrooke's influence and knowledge of Pakistan, raising concerns about increased military influence on U.S. policy. Secretary Clinton sent Ruggerio to reassure leaders in Islamabad and Kabul that U.S. policy towards the region would remain consistent. The U.S. policy towards the region will not change after Holbrooke's passing. Progress in Pakistan's political, economic, and security situation in 2011 looks bleak. Mutual distrust persists in the U.S.-Pakistan relationship, with Pakistan seeking greater market access and a civil nuclear cooperation deal, which the Obama Administration has rejected. Pakistan faced natural disasters and armed insurgency in 2010. In the autumn of 2010, amidst natural disasters and armed insurgency, U.S. officials grew concerned about political instability in Pakistan. Ambassador-Designate Cameron Munter emphasized the need for a strong civilian government in Pakistan to achieve common U.S.-Pakistan successes. Urgent reparative action is called for from both Islamabad and Washington to address increasing mutual disconnect. Major tasks for Pakistan include political system reform. Pakistan faces major tasks such as political system reform and reordering economic priorities to attract more investment. The United States can help by reducing tariffs on Pakistani exports, easing visa restrictions, and providing military equipment for counterinsurgency operations. Increasing U.S. market access for Pakistani exports could be a valuable near-term goal. Many American analysts are calling for a tougher U.S. stance towards Pakistan, suggesting more counterterrorism operations and offering Islamabad a choice between incentives and consequences. Some propose setting explicit counterterrorism benchmarks and shifting emphasis to alternative supply lines into Afghanistan to reduce Pakistan's leverage. President Obama's decision to visit India without stopping in Pakistan has raised concerns among Pakistani officials about a perceived pro-India tilt in U.S. policy. The Obama Administration's policies, including refraining from involvement in the Kashmir dispute and supporting India's perspective on regional terrorism, may further strain relations with Pakistan. The Obama Administration's policies, including endorsing a permanent U.N. Security Council seat for India, have strained relations with Pakistan. In mid-2010, Pakistan faced a catastrophic natural disaster with widespread flooding affecting 20 million people and causing $9.7 billion in damages. The devastation could take decades to rebuild. The floods in Pakistan in July and August were caused by heavy monsoon rains, leading to flooding in the Indus River Basin. Over 2,000 people died, and eight million were displaced. Clean drinking water remains scarce, increasing the risk of disease outbreaks like diarrhea and cholera. The loss of livestock, crop lands, and damage to infrastructure will have long-term negative effects on food security and the economy. The floods in Pakistan caused by heavy monsoon rains led to over 2,000 deaths and eight million displacements. The disaster highlighted the limited capacity of Pakistan's government institutions to effectively respond to crises. The National Disaster Management Agency coordinated relief efforts with federal ministries, armed forces, U.N. agencies, and donors. The Pakistani military deployed about 70,000 troops for emergency relief operations. The United States has been a major contributor to the relief effort in Pakistan following the devastating floods, providing over $571 million in funds and in-kind support from the military. The U.S. House passed a resolution expressing condolences and solidarity with the Pakistani people, urging the use of funds for long-term rehabilitation and recovery. WikiLeaks also released information related to the situation in Pakistan. The WikiLeaks website posted sensitive U.S. diplomatic cables in 2010, revealing tensions between the U.S. and Pakistan over support for Taliban-linked groups. Islamabad disputed the cables' accuracy, stating they were contrary to the facts on the ground. The Foreign Ministry of Pakistan refuted negative reports on Pakistan-Saudi relations attributed to WikiLeaks, stating that the suggestion of transferring nuclear fuel to Pakistan was refused. U.S. officials criticized WikiLeaks for oversimplifying U.S.-Pakistan relations, expressing regrets over the disclosure of communications. The United States expressed \"deep regrets\" to Islamabad for the leaked confidential communications and condemned it. Senior U.S. officials downplayed the significance of the documents, but concerns remain about the impact on trust-building efforts with Pakistan. Leaked diplomatic cables could make Gulf State leaders more cautious in future meetings with U.S. officials and fuel Pakistani suspicions of a covert U.S. agenda violating sovereignty. The leaked diplomatic cables reveal concerns about Pakistani instability and unreliability as a U.S. ally, with suggestions that U.S. assistance may not alter Pakistan's strategic orientation. However, there are positive aspects of officials from both sides working to increase trust and cooperation. Media hysteria exacerbates the situation. On January 4, Salman Taseer, the governor of the Punjab province, was... Salman Taseer, the governor of Punjab, was assassinated by his own security team member due to his criticism of blasphemy laws, which was seen as a setback for liberal forces in Pakistan. The assassination was condemned by Secretary Clinton and highlighted the challenges faced in the country. China and Pakistan have had a close relationship for decades, with China being a major arms supplier and involved in various economic projects in Pakistan. Recently, China plans to build new civilian nuclear reactors in Pakistan, raising concerns about international guidelines. As U.S.-India ties strengthen, Pakistan is increasingly relying on its friendship with China. President Zardari visited China in 2010, emphasizing the importance of the relationship. During his fifth trip to China in July 2010, the head of the Pakistani government sought full membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's visit to Islamabad in December 2010 resulted in the signing of 12 MoUs and the designation of 2011 as the \"Year of China-Pakistan Friendship.\" Contracts worth $15 billion were signed between Pakistani and Chinese businesses in various sectors. Despite skepticism about China replacing the West as a significant source of foreign investment for Pakistan, agreements worth nearly $20 billion were reached. In August 2010, Pakistani military officers protested mistreatment at Dulles International Airport in the US, leading to the cancellation of their visit. The incident was attributed to misunderstanding. In December 2010, the identity of the CIA's Pakistan station chief was revealed, prompting their quick departure from the country. In 2010, the identity of the CIA's Pakistan station chief was revealed, leading to their quick departure from the country. Some U.S. officials suspected that Pakistan's military intelligence agency intentionally exposed the chief's cover in retaliation for a civil lawsuit implicating the ISI chief in the 11/08 Mumbai terrorist attack. Islamist extremism in Pakistan has been a growing issue since 2001, with a peak in attacks and victims in 2009. However, there was a significant decline in terrorist incidents in 2010 compared to the previous year. In 2010, Pakistan saw a decrease in terrorist incidents and fatalities compared to the previous year, with 687 incidents resulting in 1,051 deaths. Despite the decline, the country still ranked third globally in both measures. Suicide bombings have been on the rise in Pakistan, reaching a peak in 2009 but dropping in 2010. Pakistan also experienced a significant increase in direct attacks on security institutions and foreign-based charitable organizations. In 2010, terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda carried out attacks in Pakistan, with violence from sectarian strife and ethnic tensions claiming civilian lives. Attacks were frequent in regions bordering Afghanistan, major urban centers, and saw an increase in suicide bombings. The sophistication and frequency of suicide bombings increased in Pakistan in 2009. Various Islamist militant groups in the country have become more interconnected and supportive of each other. According to U.S. Joint Chiefs Chairman Admiral Mullen, these organizations are working closely together, forming a syndicate of armed Islamist extremists in Pakistan. An extensive 2010 study highlighted the ongoing threat posed by Pakistan-based militant groups due to Islamabad's lack of an effective counterinsurgency strategy. The report emphasized the need for a \"population-centric\" approach to address the militant threat and urged Pakistan to reform its security forces and prioritize civilian security. Pakistan must reform and strengthen local police forces to prioritize civilian security. The US should alter Pakistan's strategic calculus by reducing reliance, developing alternative supply lines to Afghanistan, and using foreign policy incentives and penalties. In 2010, the US accelerated designations of terrorists and their support networks in Pakistan, with legislation proposed to designate the TTP as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. In 2010, Secretary of State designated the TTP as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) under Executive Order 13224. TTP leaders Hakimullah Mehsud and Wali ur Rehman were named as Specially Designated Global Terrorists. Criminal charges were unsealed against Mehsud for his involvement in a deadly suicide bomb attack on the CIA outpost in Khost, Afghanistan. The US government offered a $5 million reward for information leading to Mehsud's capture. In November, the U.S. government designated Jundallah as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) and targeted the financial support networks of LeT and JeM. Concerns remain about Al Qaeda's presence in Pakistan and its influence among various militant groups in the region. The Obama Administration's core goal is to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat Al Qaeda. The United States aims to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat Al Qaeda and its safe havens in Pakistan to prevent their return to the region. Al Qaeda remains a significant threat to U.S. security, with over 300 operatives in Pakistan's tribal areas. Secretary of State Clinton expressed concerns about official Pakistan's sympathy towards Islamist terrorists, noting Al Qaeda's safe haven in the country since 2002. Pakistani officials deny Al Qaeda's presence in the country, despite evidence linking them to numerous terrorist plots in the West. Tensions persist over the issue, with calls for honesty and cooperation to address the situation effectively. Secretary Gates warned that Al Qaeda-linked groups in Pakistan are actively seeking to destabilize South Asia, potentially sparking a major terrorist attack in India. Al Qaeda's presence in Pakistan weakened in 2009 and 2010 due to various factors, including drone strikes and internal rifts. Pakistan's offensive in South Waziristan pushed Al Qaeda operatives out of the region, and Taliban fighters in western Pakistan are reportedly hesitant to assist Al Qaeda elements. Pakistan has become cautious about aiding Al Qaeda elements. The CIA Director credits improved coordination with the Pakistani government and aggressive operations for forcing top Al Qaeda figures into hiding and disrupting their attack planning. Despite some U.S. officials noting a rebuilding of Al Qaeda's infrastructure in 2010, the group continues to support various militant groups in western Pakistan. Lahore, once untouched by violence, experienced three major terrorist attacks, ending its peace. In early 2009, Lahore faced three major terrorist attacks by militants from western Pakistan targeting moderate Pakistani Muslims and Sufi shrines in Punjab. The International Crisis Group recommended a \"zero-tolerance\" policy towards Sunni extremist organizations in Punjab. Islamist militants are gaining influence in southern Punjab, where Taliban cells have been discovered. The \"Punjabi Taliban,\" a group of banned militant organizations in Punjab, are well-educated and well-equipped, with ties to the Taliban and Al Qaeda. Punjab has become a major hub for terrorist recruitment and planning, with militants also fighting in Afghanistan. The ruling party in Punjab is criticized for fostering extremism by taking conservative and right-wing positions. The megacity of Karachi, Pakistan's leading business hub, is facing an influx of extremists from FATA, exacerbating ethnic tensions and creating a potential Taliban safe haven. Reports suggest that Taliban fighters and international jihadis are increasingly present in Karachi, making it a favored destination for militants. Karachi has become a favored destination for international jihadis and militants fleeing from battles in Swat and FATA. Hundreds of thousands of flood refugees in 2010 added to ethnic tensions. Pashtun militants have established criminal syndicates in the city to sustain their insurgencies through criminal activities. Since 2007, Pakistan has been dealing with a \"neo-Taliban\" insurgency led by Maulana Fazlullah in the Swat Valley. Fazlullah and his armed followers aimed to impose Sharia law in the region, leading to a counterinsurgency effort by the army with about 15,000 troops deployed. Militant elements in the area were reported to be in retreat by the end of 2007. In 2008, despite a peace deal, heavy fighting continued in Swat with Islamist insurgents expanding their influence. By 2009, the state's authority had vanished, leading to a full-blown rebellion against the government. President Zardari agreed to restore Sharia law in Swat to counter the uprising. In 2009, a peace deal was made in Swat to bring Islamic law to the region, requiring the Taliban to give up heavy weapons and cooperate with local police. The government agreed to gradually withdraw the army in exchange. Pakistanis supported the move, but the US criticized it, emphasizing the importance of democracy and human rights. The United States expressed concern over Pakistan's deal with the Taliban in Swat, viewing it as a surrender to violent extremists. Despite Pakistani officials claiming they were trying to divide militants, critics saw it as a capitulation and a troubling trend. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan labeled it a day of \"humiliating submission,\" while an independent analyst noted the government's yielding under pressure amidst rising Talibanization in the country. The government's peace deal with the Taliban in Swat was seen as a surrender to violent extremists, with concerns raised about the militants using the truce to strengthen their positions and launch further attacks. Taliban forces moved into neighboring areas, heightening fears of escalating violence. In April 2009, Taliban forces advanced into Buner district, 60 miles from the Pakistani capital. Local militias resisted but were overwhelmed. Pakistani paramilitary troops, supported by helicopter gunships, engaged militants in Buner and Lower Dir. Pakistani commandos regained control of Buner's main town after heavy fighting, causing civilians to flee. The army accused militants of violating the accord. Alarm grew in Washington over the Pakistani government's commitment to the fight against militants. In May 2009, heavy combat raged in Swat as militants resisted the army's offensive. The army, with increased public support, abandoned negotiations and cleared the last Taliban stronghold in Swat by June 2009. Police patrols became common in Mingora by November. The Swat offensive in 2009 led to the clearing of the last Taliban stronghold in the region. Police patrols were seen in Mingora by November, indicating a return to normalcy. The military claimed over 3,500 militants were killed, but doubts were raised about the accuracy of this number. Despite the military's control of urban centers and main roadways, top Taliban commanders remained elusive. Residents still felt insecure due to the lingering threat from pro-Taliban militants. Efforts to repair the shattered regional economy in the aftermath of the Swat offensive have yielded limited results, requiring at least $1 billion in state funding. Government services remain absent despite most displaced citizens returning home. The ongoing Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan and its connection to Pakistan are serious concerns for U.S. policy makers, who believe success in Afghanistan hinges on improved relations between Islamabad and Kabul. Joint Chiefs Chairman Admiral Mullen views Pakistan and Afghanistan as linked in a common insurgency. President-elect Barack Obama emphasized the interconnectedness of Afghanistan and Pakistan in addressing the insurgency, stating that solving one requires solving the other. Despite some opposition in Pakistan to the \"AfPak\" strategy, most analysts agree that as long as Taliban forces have sanctuary in Pakistan, the Afghan insurgency will continue. The Obama Administration intelligence officials continue to highlight the crucial Pakistani link to the Afghan insurgency, emphasizing the need to disrupt insurgent presence in Pakistan to make substantial progress in Afghanistan. National Intelligence Estimates in December 2010 painted a bleak picture, stating that U.S. success in Afghanistan was not possible as long as insurgents found safe haven in western Pakistan. Joint Chiefs Chairman Admiral Mullen reiterated the importance of addressing this issue in January 2011. Pakistan's mixed record on battling Islamist extremism includes an ongoing apparent tolerance of Afghan Taliban elements operating from its territory, particularly in Baluchistan. Analysts believe Pakistan's intelligence services have knowledge of Afghan Taliban leaders' whereabouts and may maintain contacts with them as part of a hedge strategy. Afghan officials openly accuse Pakistani officials of aiding terrorism in Afghanistan. Pakistan's intelligence agency and military forces are believed to aid Taliban and other extremist groups as part of a policy. Despite efforts to secure the border, corruption among border guards allows for porous borders. Pakistani leaders stress the importance of Afghan stability and request support in controlling the border region. The shared border between Pakistan and Afghanistan remains porous, with corrupt border guards enabling movement of militants and smugglers. Pakistan has contributed $330 million to Afghan development since 2001. President Obama's 2009 policy announcement on Afghanistan had significant implications for Pakistan, with concerns about destabilization. Pakistan reaffirmed commitment to fighting terrorism and stabilizing Afghanistan in response to the new U.S. strategy. The Pakistani Army Chief welcomed General David Petraeus' appointment in 2010 to lead the U.S. military effort in Afghanistan, citing his understanding of Pakistan's perspective. Concerns exist about the U.S. Afghanistan strategy, including confusion over the 2011 withdrawal date and potential destabilization of Pakistan. The U.S. pressures Pakistan to increase military efforts against Islamist militants. The U.S. government pressures Pakistan to expand military efforts against Islamist militants in western Pakistan, but Islamabad is skeptical and fears spillover from U.S. operations in Afghanistan. Pakistani observers are wary of U.S. policy, especially with signs of expanded operations in Pakistan. Islamabad is concerned about the U.S. potentially abandoning the region, especially with the planned troop withdrawals starting in July 2011. The Pakistani government worries that this could allow the Afghan Taliban to seek refuge in Pakistan. The Obama Administration tried to address these concerns by offering an \"expanded strategic partnership\" with Pakistan. The Obama Administration offers an \"expanded strategic partnership\" with Pakistan, including military, economic, and intelligence cooperation. Assistance will be provided in political, economic, and security realms, with a focus on shifting Pakistan's military towards counterinsurgency. Islamabad is wary of India's presence in Afghanistan, fearing encirclement, and resolution of Pakistan-India disputes, especially over Kashmir, is seen as crucial for stabilizing Afghanistan. Islamabad is wary of India's presence in Afghanistan, viewing it as a strategic threat and concerned about the U.S.-India partnership. Pakistan aims to maintain a Taliban sanctuary in western Pakistan and limit India-Afghanistan ties. Pakistan is interested in mediating Afghan peace talks and has been pressing the U.S. to negotiate with Taliban figures. They believe they can play a key role in stabilizing Afghanistan, despite historical mistrust from Afghans. This shift is seen as a mix of self-interest and fear. Some analysts believe Pakistan's shift towards mediating Afghan peace talks is driven by self-interest and fear. General Petraeus welcomed Pakistan's involvement in reaching out to Afghan Taliban elements. Pakistan sees itself as essential for successful peace talks in Afghanistan. The capture of Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar in 2010 may have signaled a significant development in the region. The capture of Afghan Taliban leaders in Pakistan may indicate a shift in strategy towards targeting Taliban figures finding sanctuary in the country. This new approach, coupled with increased intelligence collaboration with the United States, led to the arrest of several top Taliban leaders in Pakistani cities. The pressure on Taliban leaders in Karachi forced them to spread out across Pakistan to evade capture. The ISI's new moves against Afghan Taliban elements in Pakistan may not signal a major strategic shift, as Pakistan's incentives to support the Taliban remain unchanged. The capture of Baradar was seen as a way to facilitate talks with \"willing\" Taliban commanders for reconciliation, but some believe it was to thwart negotiations. Pakistani officials later claimed Baradar's capture was intentional to shut down secret peace talks with Kabul. Analysts note Pakistan's inaction against militant groups like the Haqqani group and LeT. Pakistan's security services are accused of manipulating Islamist extremists for their regional strategy. There are conflicting reports on the usefulness of interrogating Baradar. Pakistan's efforts to broker reconciliation between Kabul and the Haqqanis raise concerns of Islamabad exploiting the political situation for maximal influence in post-conflict Kabul. Improved relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan could sideline the United States in any settlement arranged by Islamabad and Kabul. The United States may be excluded from a settlement brokered by Islamabad and Kabul, with skepticism from U.S. officials on involving Taliban elements. The British government sees Pakistan playing a crucial role in talks between Afghan militants and the Kabul government. NATO facilitated secret meetings between Taliban figures and Afghan officials, with uncertainty on Pakistani involvement. Reports suggest Pakistan's ISI is pressuring Taliban commanders to fight NATO forces while participating in peace talks. Pakistan has a legitimate role in supporting Afghan-led peace talks, with insurgents targeting NATO supply lines through Pakistan. The Pakistani military launched an offensive in the Khyber agency to secure the supply route. The Khyber Pass gateway was temporarily closed during fighting, but sporadic attacks on supply routes continue. U.S. military tested alternative routes through Central Asia and Russia, with the \"northern distribution network\" carrying over half of NATO's supplies by mid-2010. The \"northern distribution network\" carries over half of NATO's supplies, with transportation fees doubling since 2006 due to attacks on NATO trucks. Corruption is a major issue in moving cargo through Pakistan, with evidence of extortion and corruption along the supply line. Suspicion of corrupt trucking contractors destroying their own vehicles has also been raised. Ammonium nitrate is a widely-used fertilizer with commercial uses as an explosives precursor. The U.S. government is urging Pakistan to restrict access to ammonium nitrate (AN) to prevent its movement into Afghanistan, where it is used in improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Efforts to counter the IED threat in Afghanistan include diplomatic, law enforcement, and science and technology initiatives led by the Pentagon's JIEDDO. In 2010, Pakistan-Afghanistan relations showed signs of improvement with high-level meetings and discussions aimed at ending the Afghan insurgency. Prime Minister Gilani hosted Afghan President Karzai in Islamabad, but policy differences remained. Bilateral relations improved after Pakistan's ISI chief visited Kabul and General Kayani met with President Karzai. In July, a cross-border trade agreement was signed between the two countries. In July, Pakistan and Afghanistan signed a cross-border trade agreement, marking a significant shift in their bilateral relations. The agreement includes training Afghan military officers in Pakistan, opening new border crossings, and providing access to Pakistani ports. While it aims to boost trade and regional peace, Afghan truckers are still not allowed to transit through Pakistan to India. This development was praised by the US as a major achievement after 45 years of strained relations. President Karzai visited Islamabad in September to further strengthen the partnership with increased security cooperation and trade. In December, Prime Minister Gilani visited Kabul to accelerate bilateral initiatives, including increased counterterrorism economic cooperation. In January 2011, a high-level \"peace delegation\" from the Karzai government reassured Pakistani leaders of friendly intentions and readiness to negotiate with the Taliban. This warming of Pakistan-Afghanistan ties raised concerns in regional capitals like New Delhi and Tehran. In 2008, there were fears of a future Afghanistan heavily influenced by Islamabad with Taliban elements in a governance role. Fighting between Pakistani government security forces and religious militants intensified, leading to a major operation against militants in South Waziristan agency. The killing of Baitullah Mehsud, a suspect in former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's assassination, caused alarm in Washington. Mehsud was killed in a drone attack in mid-2009, but his \"Pakistani Taliban\" continued to fight under new leadership. The Taliban, under new leadership, continues to threaten American shores and operate from safe havens in Pakistan's tribal areas. The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) emerged in 2007 under Baitullah Mehsud's leadership, aiming to unite pro-Taliban groups, assist the Afghan Taliban, and establish a Taliban-style rule. There is no reliable evidence of external funding for the TTP. The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) emerged in 2007 under Baitullah Mehsud's leadership with the goals of uniting pro-Taliban groups, assisting the Afghan Taliban, and establishing a Taliban-style Islamic state in Pakistan. The TTP faces factionalism due to tribal rivalries, and after Baitullah's death, leadership passed to Hakimullah Mehsud. The TTP was formally banned by the Islamabad government in 2008 for its involvement in suicide attacks. The TTP's forces are estimated to be comprised of up to 35,000 armed militants, but deep-seated tribal rivalries may prevent them from becoming a truly unified force. The United States and Pakistan missed a chance to exploit divisions among Islamist factions in the region. U.S. missile strikes have unified militants, undermining Pakistani efforts to create rifts. Some argue the Taliban is decentralized, with blurred distinctions between Pakistani and Afghan networks. General Petraeus' strategy of exploiting rifts within militant groups had successes in Iraq. The death of TTP chief Baitullah Mehsud in a U.S. missile strike was a significant blow to the Pakistani Taliban, but did not decrease militancy in Pakistan. Despite hopes for increased Pakistani action against militants, attacks on government and civilian targets continued. The U.S. may have targeted Baitullah to pressure Pakistan to act against Afghan-oriented militants. The Pakistan army faced equipment shortages and delayed launching an offensive against TTP militants in FATA. Concerns arose about losing momentum as militants used heavy weapons in aggressive tactics. Pakistan deployed troops and elite commandos to combat militants in Swat valley, Bajaur, and South Waziristan. The conflict in the FATA region has spread to various tribal agencies, with Taliban forces crossing into Pakistan from Afghanistan. Military operations have been ongoing since 2008, resulting in civilian casualties and displacement of millions. The Pakistani military reports significant militant casualties, but these claims are often unverified. The Pakistani military faces challenges in the FATA region due to treacherous mountain terrain favoring Taliban guerrilla tactics. Analysts doubt the army's ability to hold ground seized in offensive operations, leading to militants quickly re-infiltrating cleared areas. By mid-2010, Pakistani forces were engaged in combat on multiple fronts, unable to consolidate military gains due to a lack of effective civilian political authority. Pakistani military operations in the FATA region have not been successful in eradicating militant safe havens, with militants simply moving to different areas. Despite Operation Sher Dil in Bajaur causing significant casualties, pessimistic analysts believe militant presence will persist. A new peace agreement with tribal elders did not deter militants from repositioning themselves. The Pakistani military faced strong resistance from militants in Bajaur, with 8,000 troops supported by gunships and jets. The militants, including foreigners, utilized sophisticated tactics and tunnels for weapons storage. Despite ongoing sporadic fighting, most militant strongholds in the agency have been taken over by the government, with Damadola reclaimed in February 2010. In mid-2010, the TTP issued warnings to local security forces in Bajaur to stop operations or face more attacks. President Zardari mentioned plans for army operations in Waziristan in May 2009. Pakistani security forces launched offensive operations in the northwest, with militants moving into the Bannu region. The army responded with artillery and helicopter assaults on Taliban positions, expanding operations into South Waziristan in response to Taliban suicide attacks in Pakistani cities. The Pakistani army was preparing to target Baitullah Mehsud in South Waziristan, with troops surrounding Mehsud-controlled areas. Islamabad offered rewards for his capture, and airstrikes weakened Taliban forces. Despite delays due to displaced persons, no ground offensive had begun. In October 2009, Pakistan launched \"Operation Rah-e-Nijat\" in South Waziristan with 30,000-40,000 security forces. The initial days of the offensive faced heavy resistance and some setbacks. In October 2009, Pakistan launched \"Operation Rah-e-Nijat\" in South Waziristan with 30,000-40,000 security forces. The early days of fighting saw Pakistani forces facing heavy resistance and some reversals. By early November, Pakistani troops took control of Kaniguram and Ladha Fort, clearing major militant bases. Only 548 militants were reported killed, with thousands escaping into remote terrain. Notable Taliban commanders evaded capture and vowed to continue guerrilla warfare, launching new attacks on Pakistani cities. By January 2010, Pakistani military leaders claimed success in breaking the back of terrorists in South Waziristan after a long-term guerrilla war. However, reports suggest that most militants likely escaped to North Waziristan, home to the Haqqani network and TTP forces. Pakistan's army denies reports of Taliban forces reentering cleared areas in South Waziristan. The North Waziristan region is a significant haven for Afghan- and Pakistan-oriented militants, including the Haqqani network and TTP forces. The US has been pressuring Pakistan to clear the region of terrorists, with commitments made by Pakistani military leaders. This pressure was reiterated during Admiral Mullen's visit to Pakistan in December. The Pakistani military faces pressure to clear North Waziristan of militants, with Admiral Mullen expressing impatience with their progress. Pakistani officials cite the need to secure other tribal areas before launching a ground assault in North Waziristan, expected no earlier than May 2011. The Pentagon views the Pakistani army as unlikely to conduct a large-scale operation similar to South Waziristan. In spring 2010, Secretary Gates likened the US-Pakistan situation to Pakistan being in control. Reports suggest a limited ground offensive in North Waziristan may occur, with concerns of scattering militants and increased terrorism. The Haqqani network was reportedly relocating to Kurram agency with possible Pakistani government support. In Kurram agency, Shiite militias allowed Haqqani fighters in exchange for help with local Sunni tribes. Government forces have engaged in operations against militant groups in FATA agencies, with notable ground operations in six agencies. In Khyber agency, a September 2009 operation left over 100 militants dead, and a Pakistani jet bombing in April killed 73 civilians. Heavy losses have been reported in Orakzai due to battles and air strikes. In Orakzai, government troops took control of Lower Orakzai in April 2010 after battles and air strikes. Pakistan's army declared success in operations in June, with over 700 militants killed in May. However, reports suggest the victory was temporary as Taliban insurgents have returned to cleared areas. The military's large-scale operations reflect the recognition of the threat posed by pro-Taliban militants to Pakistan's security and stability. The military successes in Malakand and Swat, along with the killing of Baitullah Mehsud and other Taliban leaders, led to cautious optimism about trends in Pakistan in 2009 and 2010. The counterinsurgency operations in Swat and South Waziristan were praised by U.S. and Western observers, with General David Petraeus calling them \"impressive.\" Pakistan's security services have made sacrifices in combating Islamist extremism since 2001. Pakistan has lost over 2,400 soldiers in the fight against militants since 2004, more than the entire U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan. The country has deployed about 150,000 troops for these operations, facing challenges in the mountainous terrain that favor the defense. The constantly changing militant groups in the region require a large network of informants, which has been diminished by militant campaigns to eliminate \"spies.\" Concerns persist about Pakistani institutions' ability to sustain gains and root out \"spies.\" Questions remain about military effectiveness and political reform. Observers doubt Pakistan's capacity for long-term security in FATA and KPk, noting a shortfall of 400,000 troops. Pakistan may not meet the minimum force-to-population ratio for counterinsurgency doctrine. Pakistan's regional strategy is viewed skeptically by the U.S. Pakistan's security forces rely heavily on conventional force to combat insurgents, lacking the ability to establish long-term governance in cleared areas. The army's counterinsurgency efforts in the Swat Valley and Bajaur tribal agency show mixed results. Without political reforms, the spread of Islamist militancy in the FATA region may continue unabated. President Zardari announced plans to lift a ban on political party activity in FATA to normalize the region and integrate it into Pakistan's mainstream. However, no meaningful action has been taken yet, with reforms delayed until the situation improves. In January 2010, Islamabad announced a relief package for conflict-affected areas in FATA, including tax concessions and utility bill waivers. The Pakistani army has also initiated development projects in the region. The Pakistani army has undertaken development projects in FATA, including road and dam construction. Administrative responsibility in South Waziristan was transferred to Mehsud tribe elders. Concerns arose about Pakistan's regional strategy not aligning with U.S. interests, as the military targeted Baitullah while leaving other Taliban groups untouched in the FATA. The army's strategy aimed to isolate the Mehsud faction of the TTP by keeping other militant commanders on the sidelines. The Pakistani military targeted the Mehsud faction of the TTP in South Waziristan, while leaving other regional militant commanders untouched. This strategy aimed to isolate the Mehsuds and prevent attacks inside Pakistan, but did not align with U.S. interests in ending Al Qaeda safe havens in the region. The offensive was not seen as likely to benefit the U.S.-led effort in Afghanistan. The violence between Pakistani security forces and religious militants in northwestern Pakistan since 2008 has led to a humanitarian crisis, displacing millions of civilians. Estimates of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) ranged from 1.9 million to 3.5 million in 2009, with Pakistan having the highest number of IDPs globally. About half of the displaced were children, with less than 10% staying in U.N.-run camps. Those in camps faced harsh conditions. In mid-2009, Islamabad announced the possibility of safe return to the Malakand district for internally displaced persons (IDPs) in northwestern Pakistan. Despite warnings of security risks, by August 2009, up to 1.6 million IDPs had returned home. The U.S. provided significant emergency aid, including $110 million in humanitarian assistance and an additional $200 million in urgent aid. The United States provided $430 million in humanitarian relief funds from FY2008-FY2010, with $200 million in urgent assistance. Despite this, the United Nations warns of a lack of funds for regional relief programs. Islamist charities are active in the relief effort, potentially using it to promote an anti-Western agenda. The U.S. lacks a visible presence due to anti-American sentiment. The United States provided significant humanitarian relief funds, but due to anti-American sentiments, there is a lack of a visible U.S. presence in distributing aid at IDP camps in Pakistan. This absence allows extremist groups like Jamaat-ud-Dawa to influence public opinion unchecked. Despite praise for the Pakistani army's efforts against the Taliban, poor civil-military coordination hinders relief efforts, prompting calls for better coordination from analysts and the international community. The ISI, Pakistan's main intelligence agency, has long-standing doubts about its activities and aims. Some analysts label it a \"rogue\" agency driven by Islamist ideology. Despite mutual mistrust, the ISI is seen as disciplined but willing to pursue Pakistan's regional interests aggressively. The ISI, Pakistan's main intelligence agency, is known for aggressively pursuing Pakistan's regional interests. U.S. officials have accused the ISI of supporting the Afghan Taliban with money, supplies, and planning guidance. There are ongoing concerns about ISI's links with terrorist groups like LeT, JeM, and Harakat Mujahideen. Accusations of ISI running training camps for LeT have also been made. The Pakistani government allegedly ran training camps for the LeT with CIA's knowledge, with claims of ISI complicity in various attacks. ISI provides support to Taliban commanders in Quetta and referred to terrorist leader Haqqani as a \"strategic asset.\" In 2009, Secretary of Defense Gates expressed concerns about ISI's connections with extremist groups like Hekmatyar and Haqqani. U.S. military officers accused ISI of supporting regional militants, with General McChrystal alleging material aid to insurgents in Afghanistan. A book by Bob Woodward claimed CIA intelligence linking ISI to the Mumbai terrorist attack. A Canadian diplomat testified in 2010 about ISI involvement in Afghanistan. In 2010, a report revealed ISI's strong influence on the Taliban movement, with officials participating in leadership council sessions. Concerns were raised about ISI's support for terrorist groups, including retired Pakistani military officers suspected of aiding insurgents. Colonel Imam was identified as a key figure bridging connections with Taliban leaders. In 2008, a top U.S. intelligence official presented evidence to Pakistani officials that ISI agents were assisting militant elements in Afghanistan, specifically mentioning a relationship with the Haqqani network. U.S. officials suspect local and retired ISI operatives of complicity, despite Islamabad denying the claims. Some individuals within ISI are believed to be sympathetic to the Taliban and act independently of government policy. Afghan officials accused ISI of malfeasance in 2010. In 2010, Afghan officials accused the ISI of involvement in a suicide bombing in Kabul that killed six NATO soldiers. Lieutenant General Ahmed Shuja Pasha was appointed as the new ISI chief in September 2008, known for taking the threat of Islamist extremism seriously. The ISI's political wing was disbanded by the civilian government to focus on counterterrorism efforts. General Kayani granted an unusual one-year extension in March 2010. In March 2010, General Kayani granted an unusual one-year extension to General Pasha's term under \"compulsory retainment.\" Pakistani officials assure no ISI cooperation with militants. US suspicions persist, despite ISI's assistance in capturing militants. US rewards for ISI assistance valued in hundreds of millions of dollars. US intelligence officials have no choice but to work with ISI. Pakistani public sentiments are mixed. Pakistani public sentiments have become less favorable towards Islamist militancy and the United States, especially after Taliban attacks in retaliation for army operations in Swat. The Taliban's actions, including violating agreements and publicized acts of violence, have contributed to this shift in public opinion. The affair widely viewed on television and the internet turned public sentiment against extremists in Pakistan. Evidence suggests a shift in public attitudes towards religious militancy, with more citizens now supporting military operations. Anti-American sentiments and xenophobic conspiracy theories persist among Pakistanis, with only 17% holding a favorable opinion of the United States. Many express anger at U.S. foreign policy perceived as unfriendly to the Muslim world. Some Pakistani TV hosts promote anti-American conspiracy theories and call for Islamist-influenced governance. The Urdu press often conveys exaggerated views on the United States and India. The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad counters false information about American foreign policy in Pakistani media. Allegations of U.S. malfeasance and the presence of American security contractors in Pakistan fuel paranoia. The presence of American security contractors in Pakistan has fueled paranoia and conspiracy theories. There are fears that private contractors, including Blackwater (now Xe Services), are working closely with U.S. Special Operations on Pakistani soil, bypassing congressional oversight. This has led to suspicions among Pakistanis that Americans are seeking to dominate their country. Secretary of Defense Gates inadvertently fueled rumors of Blackwater's presence in Pakistan, and Pentagon clarifications did not fully dispel these beliefs. Islamist politicians in Pakistan commonly blame Blackwater for covert U.S. operations. Islamist politicians in Pakistan commonly blame Blackwater for covert U.S. operations, with concerns rising over American citizens being recruited for terrorism. In May 2010, a U.S. citizen of Pakistani origin, Faisal Shahzad, was arrested for attempting to detonate a car bomb in New York City. Shahzad confessed to receiving bomb-making training in Waziristan, drawing inspiration from extremist groups. Faisal Shahzad, inspired by Anwar al-Awlaki, attempted a car bomb attack in New York City. He was linked to the Pakistani Taliban and received a life sentence. Pakistani authorities made arrests in connection with the case, including individuals who aided Shahzad financially and logistically. Several individuals have been detained in connection with Faisal Shahzad's attempted car bomb attack in New York City. Among them are a Pakistan army major who had cellphone contact with Shahzad, a senior member of the Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist group, and three Pakistani businessmen who confessed to providing assistance to Shahzad. The FBI is also investigating leads suggesting individuals in Massachusetts and Maine may have helped finance Shahzad. Additionally, David Coleman Headley, a Chicagoan convert to Islam, was charged with scouting for the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack by the Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist group. David Coleman Headley, a Chicagoan convert to Islam, pleaded guilty to charges related to a terrorist attack by the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) group. He had direct links to a retired Pakistani major suspected of being an LeT contact and interacted with a former Pakistani special forces commando with ties to Al Qaeda. Indian officials sought direct access to Headley for their own investigation, which was granted with an extensive interrogation in June. After an extensive interrogation in June, Indian officials confirmed a Pakistani role in the terrorist attack. Five American men were arrested in Pakistan after their families reported them missing from Virginia. The men had coded email contacts with Taliban and Al Qaeda-linked groups. They were charged with financing and plotting terrorist attacks in March. In March, the court charged five American men with financing and plotting terrorist attacks. The so-called Virginia Five were sentenced to ten years in prison for conspiring against the Pakistani state and supporting a militant organization. The conviction came quickly for Pakistan's slow-moving justice system. Najibullah Zazi, an Afghan national arrested in 2009, learned bomb-making skills at an Al Qaeda-run compound in the FATA region. In July 2010, new terrorism charges were unsealed against Zazi and four others planning to bomb the New York subways under Al Qaeda leaders' direction in Pakistan. Several American individuals, including Tariq ur Rehman and Bryant Neal Vinas, received terrorist training in western Pakistan under Al Qaeda leaders' direction. Vinas later confessed to plotting a bomb attack against the Long Island Railroad in New York and became a full-fledged member of Al Qaeda. In 2009, he pleaded guilty to charges of receiving military-type training from a foreign terrorist organization. Additionally, Syed Hashmi was sentenced to 15 years in prison for conspiring to provide material support to terrorists after loaning money to an Al Qaeda operative in London. In October 2010, a Pakistani-American man was arrested by federal law enforcement agents. In October 2010, a Pakistani-American man was arrested by federal law enforcement agents for plotting bomb attacks on the Washington Metro system. There is increasing evidence of links between Pakistan, terrorism, and U.S. nationals. President Obama emphasized the need to address militant safe havens in Pakistan after the failed Times Square bombing attempt. Secretary Clinton acknowledged improved cooperation from Pakistan but stated that more is expected. The Pakistani government is being warned by senior U.S. officials about severe consequences if an attack traced back to Pakistan is successful. This stern warning follows the Times Square incident and highlights the persistent mistrust in the U.S.-Pakistan relationship. President Obama sent his national security advisor and CIA director to Pakistan to push for more aggressive military action in tribal areas. General Petraeus believes the failed Times Square bombing could strengthen the U.S.-Pakistan relationship by highlighting the extremist threat. The U.S. is considering military intervention in Pakistan if a terrorist attack traced back to Pakistani sources occurs. The Pentagon is reviewing options for a unilateral strike under extreme circumstances. The spread of Islamist militancy in Pakistan has led to increased U.S. government attention and security-related assistance. Covert attacks against militants in Pakistan were carried out during President Bush's second term. President Musharraf and President Zardari both opposed direct U.S. military presence in Pakistan, emphasizing Pakistani forces' ability to combat militants with U.S. intelligence support. The CIA had a halted program to insert Special Forces teams into Pakistan to target Al Qaeda leaders, kept secret from Congress for years. U.S. military incursions into Pakistan in the past caused significant pressure. Past U.S. military incursions into Pakistan have put pressure on Islamabad's government and military. The Ambassador to the United States warned that such attacks are counterproductive and turn public opinion against counterterrorism efforts. U.S. efforts to strengthen the civilian government and improve the U.S. image in Pakistan may be futile due to continued drone strikes. American policy focuses on improving intelligence sharing and bolstering the Pakistani military's counterinsurgency capabilities. The Pakistani military has various forums and initiatives to enhance their counterinsurgency capabilities, including a defense consultative body, a U.S. counterinsurgency assistance fund, border coordination centers, training for security forces, and joint intelligence operations. There are reports of covert \"Counterterrorism Pursuit Teams\" and a Tripartite Commission with the U.S., Pakistan, and Afghanistan for discussions on Afghan stability and border security. NATO officers have also joined this commission. The United States has established Border Coordination Centers on the Afghan side of the shared border with Pakistan, with senior officers from Pakistan joining those from Afghanistan and the U.S. Hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. aid have been used to train and equip paramilitary Frontier Corps troops in Pakistan. A task force of U.S. military advisors and specialists has been working in Pakistan since 2008, with their numbers growing to about 200 by mid-2010. American soldiers are reportedly assisting Pakistani trainees in domestic counterinsurgency operations. The U.S. and Pakistani military forces are improving coordination and intelligence sharing efforts, with joint CIA-ISI operations becoming more common in 2010. The Obama Administration launched a clandestine effort to prevent Taliban forces from using FM radio transmissions and the internet for attacks in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Plans for new training centers near the Afghan border suggest an increase in U.S. Special Forces trainers. The coordination and intelligence sharing efforts between U.S. and Pakistani forces are improving, with Pakistan now allowed to access video feeds from American drones and intercepts of militants' communications. However, progress is hindered by language barriers, tensions between Pakistani and Afghan officials, and mistrust among the militaries. The opening of a Border Coordination Center (BCC) at Torkham in 2008 was delayed by logistical problems and political wrangling, leading to an increase in insurgent attacks in the region. Pakistani paramilitary troops were caught in a firefight between Taliban militants and U.S.-led coalition forces in June 2008. In a firefight at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, U.S. air assets bombed Pakistani territory, killing 11 Frontier Corps soldiers. Islamabad condemned the airstrike as a violation of the international border. The incident strained bilateral ties, with U.S. special forces later conducting a deadly raid in South Waziristan. Pakistan protested the \"unprovoked act of killing\" to the U.S. Pakistan condemned the \"completely unprovoked act of killing\" by U.S. air assets at the border and lodged formal protests with the U.S. Embassy for the \"gross violation of Pakistan's territory.\" The Parliament issued resolutions condemning the attack, and Pakistan's army chief vowed to defend the country's sovereignty at all costs. Plans for further U.S. ground incursions were reportedly suspended, leading to an intensified missile strike campaign by the U.S. in response. In September 2010, NATO helicopters entered Pakistani airspace after a NATO outpost near the border was attacked by militants. 55 suspected Haqqani network insurgents were killed inside Pakistan, leading to anger from Islamabad. The Pakistan army reported that two NATO helicopters crossed into Kurram agency airspace and attacked a Frontier Corps outpost, killing at least two Pakistanis. NATO said the helicopters were dispatched after ground troops in Afghanistan determined an imminent mortar attack from the Pakistani side. The incident in Afghanistan's Paktia province involving a mortar attack from the Pakistani side led to a \"deepest apology\" from U.S. officials for mistaken warning shots. Pakistan closed the Torkham border crossing for ten days in response. U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan have been controversial but effective against militants, with numerous attacks reported since President Obama took office. The drone strikes in Pakistan have increased significantly, with more attacks in recent years than in the previous six years combined. The majority of strikes have targeted the Haqqani network in North Waziristan, resulting in approximately 1,750 deaths since 2004. Improved coordination between the United States and Pakistan has led to more accurate strikes and fewer civilian casualties. Three Predators are deployed at a secret Pakistani airbase, operated by the CIA without specific permission from the Islamabad government. Most strikes on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region are launched from an air base in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, with the base at Shamsi, Pakistan still in use. Assembly and fitting of ordinance were previously done by CIA employees but are now performed by contractors from Blackwater/Xe. There was a quiet understanding in January 2008 with then-President Musharraf to allow increased U.S. aerial surveillance and UAV strikes on Pakistani territory. President Zardari may have also reached a secret accord with U.S. officials for better bilateral coordination on UAV attacks. In September 2008, a tacit agreement on drone attacks was reportedly reached between the US and Pakistan, although Islamabad denies it. The CIA publicly acknowledged the drone campaign in Pakistan in February 2009, stating its success and continuation. In 2009, the Obama administration considered expanding drone attacks in western Pakistan as an alternative to increasing troop levels in Afghanistan, a move opposed by Islamabad. In late 2010, Washington sought Islamabad's permission to expand drone strikes into the Quetta area, but the requests were consistently rebuffed. The UAV-launched missile campaign in western Pakistan has significantly impacted Al Qaeda and other extremist militants. Pakistani intelligence officials are now providing targeting information to the US, resulting in the elimination of more than half of the top 20 Al Qaeda \"high-value targets\" in western Pakistan since mid-2008. The tactic has been deemed \"very effective\" even by a Taliban logistics tactician. Despite an intensive campaign to destroy Haqqani Network targets in North Waziristan in 2010, the impact has been moderate, and the militants remain a major obstacle to progress in Afghanistan. The rate of assassinations of suspected spies in the region has increased as drone strikes in the FATA have intensified. Limited intelligence-sharing between the US and Pakistan is part of a trust-building effort, with Pakistan denying joint control of armed drones. Secretary of Defense Gates offered Pakistan a dozen \"Shadow\" surveillance UAVs in a trust-building effort, aiming to boost their aerial surveillance capabilities. However, the offer remains suspended due to high prices and long delivery schedules, despite President Zardari's call to reassess aerial attacks on Pakistani territory. The Pakistani government strongly opposes drone attacks on its territory, citing them as destabilizing and aiding terrorists. They have condemned the missile strikes, which they believe undermine public support for counterterrorism efforts. In 2009, Pakistan's defense minister warned that the attacks were causing anti-American sentiment among ordinary citizens. A 2010 survey found that the majority of respondents in the region believed drone strikes were never justified. In contrast to the majority of respondents in the region who believe drone strikes are never justified, some accounts suggest that drone strikes have broad support among local residents as an effective counterterrorism tool. However, United Nations officials and some CIA drone operators criticize the program for human rights violations and its potential to fuel Al Qaeda recruitment. There is ongoing debate over whether drone attacks create more extremists than they eliminate, with critics pointing to increased anti-Americanism and support for the Taliban as potential consequences. Critics argue that drone strikes have led to an increase in support for the Taliban and homegrown militancy in the United States. They highlight civilian deaths, undermining of Pakistani government authority, militant recruitment, and concerns about violating international law as major downsides. The secrecy of the program has raised accountability issues and accusations of violating international laws. Some analysts view the drone campaign as ineffective and merely tactical, potentially leading to legal action against perpetrators. The Waziristan man plans to sue the CIA for the \"wrongful death\" of two relatives. The State Department defends drone strikes as lawful self-defense under international law, citing the U.S. armed conflict with Al Qaeda and the Taliban. The longstanding rivalry between Pakistan and India has been marked by three full-scale wars and ongoing military preparedness. The partition of British India in 1947 and the Kashmir sovereignty issue have caused tension between India and Pakistan. Both countries have large defense establishments, impacting economic and social development. The Kashmir problem stems from competing claims to the region, with India blaming Pakistan for supporting separatist violence in the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley. Pakistan denies direct involvement in violence and criticizes India for human rights abuses in the region. The ongoing tension between Pakistan and India, rooted in the Kashmir dispute, is a major factor in U.S. interest in South Asia. The United States strongly supports an existing India-Pakistan peace initiative to prevent conflict over Kashmiri sovereignty. Improved relations between India and Pakistan are crucial for regional stability and U.S. success in Afghanistan. Some in Pakistan believe that the warm U.S.-India relationship fuels regional instability. The bilateral Composite Dialogue between Pakistan and India, reengaged in 2004, has achieved some successes, including a formal cease-fire along the shared frontier and increased trade and people-to-people contacts across the Kashmiri Line of Control. However, relations deteriorated in 2008 after a terrorist attack in Mumbai. Disputes over Kashmir, the Siachen Glacier, and the Sir Creek remain unresolved, with Pakistani officials expressing dissatisfaction over the lack of progress, especially on the Kashmir issue. The absence of substantive bilateral dialogue between Pakistan and India is seen as favoring extremists in both countries. The Obama Administration refrains from direct involvement in the dispute, while Indian leaders do not see the need for third-party intervention. In February 2010, India proposed high-level talks with Pakistan, which was accepted by Pakistan, citing reasons such as the failure of coercive diplomacy, U.S. pressure, and concerns about Western reconciliation with the Afghan Taliban. India's leaders aimed to offer tangible benefits for cooperation and maintain flexibility in case of future terrorist attacks traced to Pakistan. In 2010, an attack traced to Pakistan led to high-level talks between India and Pakistan. India focused on terrorism while Pakistan urged resolution of all core issues, including the Kashmir dispute. The meeting ended without agreements, with Pakistan calling for a resumption of the Composite Dialogue. Major military exercises by both countries indicated ongoing mutual distrust. India's foreign secretary hinted at a possible breakthrough in the peace initiative. In 2010, conflict over water resources has emerged as a new exacerbating factor in the bilateral relationship between India and Pakistan. Some in Pakistan accuse India of violating international law and bilateral agreements by manipulating water flows into Pakistan. Foreign Minister Qureshi sees water as a serious source of tension, while a senior Indian official denies any violation of the Indus Waters Treaty. Pakistani rhetoric is dismissed as a distraction from Islamabad's poor water management. The Indian government demands Pakistan to take action against the Pakistan-based terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) responsible for a terrorist attack in Mumbai. Pakistan claims they lack evidence to charge LeT founder Hafiz Saeed, who was placed under house arrest but later released due to insufficient evidence. India insists on Pakistan taking further action against Saeed. Pakistan's Supreme Court dismissed a government appeal to release LeT founder Hafiz Saeed due to insufficient evidence, leading to disappointment from India. Charges were brought against seven men involved in the Mumbai attack, but the proceedings have been slow, raising skepticism about Pakistan's commitment to justice. The military in Pakistan is committed to preserving Lashkar as long as it perceives a threat from India. Analysts warn of a potential international crisis if another terrorist attack in India is linked to Pakistan. President Zardari emphasizes the importance of resolving the Kashmir dispute for regional peace. Despite reduced violence in Kashmir, Islamabad criticizes India's efforts as insufficient. India's home minister acknowledges the ongoing threat from militants infiltrating Indian Kashmir from Pakistan. Indian Kashmir remains a hotbed of militant activity, with an estimated 50-60 militants infiltrating across the LOC each month. India's army chief accuses Pakistan of aiding in the influx of terrorists before winter. The U.S. government under the Obama Administration continues to distance itself from the Kashmir dispute, with Special Representative Holbrooke refraining from mediation efforts. Despite previous hints from Pakistan, there is no willingness to reconsider their traditional stance on Kashmir. The current government of Pakistan maintains its traditional Kashmir position, emphasizing resolution through U.N. resolutions. Criticizing past back-channel diplomacy, they stress a principled commitment to resolution. A survey in 2010 showed mixed support for separatist goals among Kashmiris, with strong backing for independence in the Muslim-majority valley. Pakistan and India are engaged in a shadow war in Afghanistan, with Islamabad accusing New Delhi of interference in Baluchistan. The Pakistani government accuses India of interfering in Baluchistan and FATA, with claims of supporting separatist militants. Despite lack of evidence according to the U.S., Pakistani officials insist on Indian involvement, citing discoveries of Indian-made arms and ammunition in Waziristan. India is a major contributor to Afghan reconstruction efforts. India is the leading regional contributor to Afghan reconstruction efforts, with $1.3 billion invested compared to Pakistan's $300 million. Pakistan's \"paranoia\" about India's influence in Afghanistan drives their zero-sum competition. Despite concerns, the U.S. government continues to support India's role in Afghanistan while recognizing Pakistan's security interests. The security of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal is a top U.S. concern due to the influence of Islamist militants. The illicit nuclear proliferation network led by A.Q. Khan was exposed in 2004, but no charges have been brought against him or his Pakistani co-conspirators. Some in Congress seek direct access to Khan for investigation, but Pakistani authorities refuse cooperation. Concerns persist about the network's potential ongoing operations. Pakistan's nuclear security has improved, but there are concerns about potential leakage of nuclear know-how or technologies. Weaknesses in safety and security structures persist, with insider threats and the spread of nuclear material being key issues. China's plan to build nuclear reactors in Pakistan raises challenges for the Obama Administration. Some analysts urge the Administration to actively oppose the Pakistan-China nuclear deal, citing concerns about harm to U.S. regional interests and indirectly aiding Pakistan's nuclear weapons program. The Obama Administration suggested that NSG approval would be needed for the deal, with the State Department raising concerns about Beijing not seeking a required special exemption. In 2008, Beijing announced plans to build two new nuclear reactors in Punjab province, citing a 2003 agreement with Pakistan. The U.S. National Nuclear Security Administration raised concerns about the deal's impact on nuclear rivalries in South Asia. Analysts warn of negative implications and urge Washington to express strong concern to prompt Beijing to reconsider. Pakistan faces economic challenges like inflation, unemployment, food, and energy shortages, worsened by devastating flooding in 2010. The devastating flooding in mid-2010 exacerbated existing economic problems in Pakistan. The country's economy is considered the worst-performing in Asia, with foreign aid and loans not expected to have a lasting impact. Two-thirds of Pakistanis cite economic issues like inflation and unemployment as the top concerns. The 2010-2011 budget raised taxes and cut subsidies on energy and food. Despite a slight GDP growth of 4.1% in the outgoing fiscal year, the recovery is fragile and not assured, with not all sectors of the economy participating in the upturn. The floods in 2010 worsened Pakistan's already struggling economy. Before the floods, Pakistan sought external financing from the IMF to stabilize its economy. The IMF provided a $7.6 billion loan, later increased to $11.3 billion. Despite the challenges, there was a short-term boost in aggregate supply, leading to an estimated growth rate of 2% in the current fiscal year. The IMF extended Pakistan's loan to complete fiscal reforms, stabilizing the economy since 2008. The government needs to reduce inflation and fiscal deficit, address losses in public sector entities, and increase public revenues through tax reforms. Repayment of IMF loans will constrain the federal budget, while the World Bank provided over $2 billion in loan assistance in FY2009 and FY2010. In FY2009 and FY2010, the World Bank provided over $2 billion in loan assistance to Pakistan, the highest ever annual support for the country. Foreign direct investment decreased by nearly 10% in the quarter ending September 2010, with U.S. investors trailing behind those from the United Arab Emirates. A June 2010 Pakistani government report identified key structural weaknesses in the economy, including large fiscal and trade deficits, inadequate social services, and economic instability due to various factors including the costs of Pakistan's role in the \"War on Terror.\" The report highlights the economic challenges faced by Pakistan, including significant capital flight and inflation rates reaching above 25% in 2008. The rupee's value dropped by more than 20% against the U.S. dollar, and international reserves declined to below $7 billion. Despite some recovery, inflation rates remain in the double-digit range, and Pakistan's sovereign debt rating was downgraded to \"negative\" in 2008. The struggling power sector continues to hinder commerce and everyday life in the country. Pakistan's power sector struggles impact commerce and daily life, leading to factory shutdowns and public unrest. With over half of Pakistanis facing up to 20 hours of power outages daily, Prime Minister Gilani has called for a national energy strategy. Measures like extending weekends and reducing power to government offices have been implemented, but the country needs to add 20,000 megawatts of generation capacity at a cost of $32 billion, with half expected from foreign donors. Pakistan's economic instability is rooted in low government revenue generation, caused by mass tax evasion by the economic elite. The federal budget emphasizes military spending over social development, leading to unsustainable debt. The U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan highlighted the country's low tax-to-GDP ratio of 9%, urging the government to increase revenue from its citizens. Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin resigned due to Prime Minister Gilani's refusal to give him greater authority. International bailouts enable Pakistan's elite to avoid changing their habits, perpetuating the debt crisis. Pakistan's economic instability is due to low government revenue caused by tax evasion by the wealthy elite. International pressure post-2010 floods pushed for tax reform to increase contributions from the wealthy. The Reformed General Sales Tax bill is being considered to address the issue. Corruption is a significant problem affecting domestic and foreign investment, with Pakistan ranking poorly in global corruption levels. Pakistan ranks 143rd out of 178 countries in global corruption levels, lower than Nigeria and Bangladesh. A hotline was established by the U.S. government and Transparency International to report misuse of funds, leading to threats and harassment towards TI workers. Nearly one in three Pakistanis reported paying bribes for traffic violations. Islamabad launched an anti-corruption initiative in November 2010 to improve access to Western markets amid a decline in foreign investment due to security concerns. Exports, particularly from the textile sector, are crucial for Pakistan's economic recovery, as foreign investment has dropped significantly. Prime Minister Gilani emphasized the need for international support to boost exports. Despite efforts to secure greater market access, obstacles remain, such as opposition from the American textile industry due to concerns about job losses. Islamabad continues to push for reduced tariffs on textile exports in both the U.S. and European markets. Pakistani officials are advocating for reduced tariffs on textile exports to boost the economy, especially after flood damage to the cotton crop. The EU has granted limited trade concessions to help with the crisis, while the US is considering establishing Reconstruction Opportunity Zones in western Pakistan. President Bush's 2006 initiative aimed to create employment opportunities in Pakistan's tribal regions by providing duty-free access to the U.S. market for certain goods. The House passed ROZ legislation in the 111th Congress, but the Senate version has seen no action. While the ROZ plan is widely approved in principle, concerns remain about the lack of products with export value in the FATA region. Pakistani businessmen find the bill's restrictions on textile exports problematic. Pakistani businessmen criticize the U.S. bill's restrictions on textile exports as too extensive, making the initiative \"largely worthless.\" The U.S. Chamber of Commerce supports ROZ legislation, while U.S. textile associations warn of job losses. Pakistan has a history of military rule, with General Pervez Musharraf leading a coup in 1999. In 2008, after the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, a coalition led by her Pakistan People's Party (PPP) won the election, leading to Musharraf's resignation. Asif Zardari became president, retaining powers similar to Musharraf until 2010. Asif Zardari held presidential powers similar to Musharraf until April 2010. U.S. officials anticipated Zardari's influence to diminish, establishing ties with other Pakistani leaders. Prime Minister Gilani has navigated political pressures well, potentially becoming a more reliable ally for the U.S. government. Despite gaining new powers through the 18th Amendment, Gilani has maintained a strong relationship with Zardari. The civilian government remains weak, with analysts questioning its effectiveness. The civilian government in Pakistan has remained weak, with analysts questioning its effectiveness. The military establishment is still seen as the origin of foreign policy and national security policies. General Kayani, appointed by President-General Musharraf to lead the army, has taken steps to withdraw the military from direct governance, aiming to improve its institutional image. However, there are no signs of meaningful civilian control over the army or ISI, leading to a shift in views on Kayani's role. President Zardari's leadership in Pakistan has been marked by controversy and allegations of corruption. Despite his control over the civilian government, he has faced public disapproval and struggles with various crises, including clashes with the Chief Justice and failed attempts to validate controversial bills. The influence of the Pakistani army has continued to grow since Musharraf's departure in 2008, leading to concerns about the prioritization of security services over other interests in battling Islamist extremism. The controversial amnesty bill, the National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO), weakened Zardari's position. The proposed bill aimed to protect Zardari and other politicians from graft charges, causing a split in the ruling coalition. The government withdrew the proposal after facing opposition led by Sharif and his PML-N party. The Supreme Court began hearing challenges to the NRO, further damaging Zardari's credibility. The Supreme Court invalidated the NRO, leaving Pakistani politicians vulnerable to prosecution. Zardari faced intense pressure and criticism from various sectors but remained defiant. President Zardari faced intense pressure and criticism, with his popularity dwindling due to various factors. Despite calls for his resignation and demands to relinquish powers, he managed to maintain his grip on the presidency by potentially becoming a \"figurehead\" for political survival. President Zardari faced pressure and criticism, but maintained his presidency with support from PPP allies and reluctance from the army. He surrendered some powers and passed the 18th Amendment bill to make the Constitution more democratic and federal. The 18th Amendment bill made the Constitution more democratic and federal by removing the President's powers, transferring authority to the Prime Minister, limiting emergency rule, and adding Senate seats for non-Muslim minorities. In 2010, a dispute arose between the executive and judiciary over judicial appointments, leading to the suspension of the President's order. In 2010, a crisis erupted when the President made judicial appointments without consultation, leading to protests and accusations of being unconstitutional. The government withdrew the appointments, but the Supreme Court continued to pressure for reopening graft cases. The Attorney General resigned, citing government interference in graft investigations involving President Zardari. There were concerns that escalating conflict between the executive and judiciary could involve the military, causing a greater political crisis. In October 2010, the Supreme Court gave the government a two-week deadline to reopen corruption cases against Zardari and other officials. In late 2010, serious threats to the government's majority status arose when the Jamaat Ulema Islami withdrew its support for the ruling coalition, narrowing its National Assembly majority to only nine seats. This decision posed a significant challenge to the stability of the ruling coalition. The ruling coalition faced challenges as the JUI withdrew support, reducing their majority to nine seats. Subsequently, the MQM left the coalition due to economic issues, causing a potential government collapse. However, the Prime Minister's reversal of fuel subsidy cuts appeased opposition parties and led to the MQM's return to the coalition. The Prime Minister's reversal of fuel subsidy cuts appeased opposition parties and led to the MQM's return to the coalition, but drew criticism from the U.S. government and the IMF for hindering Pakistan's economic progress. Nawaz Sharif issued a 10-point agenda for socioeconomic development, including addressing fuel price hikes, electricity shortages, and corruption allegations. Prime Minister Gilani indicated cooperation in implementing the opposition's agenda. Commentators viewed Gilani's acceptance of the opposition agenda as an acknowledgment of his government's failure in Pakistan, where serious human rights abuses are prevalent. The U.S. Department of State highlighted restrictions on freedoms of association, religion, and movement, along with political leaders' imprisonment. Recent abuses include violent attacks on religious minorities, indefinite government detentions related to anti-terrorism efforts, and alleged extrajudicial executions by the Pakistani military. U.S. government concerns focus on press freedoms, security force abuses, and threats to religious freedoms from Pakistan's blasphemy law. Press freedoms are severely restricted despite a thriving news industry. Press freedom in Pakistan is severely constrained, with the country being ranked as the most dangerous for journalists. The government has imposed bans on social media sites like Facebook and YouTube, citing blasphemy concerns. Journalists critical of the authorities often face threats, with some even being kidnapped and tortured by government agents. The kidnapping of a journalist working for a major Pakistani newspaper allegedly by government intelligence agents raised concerns about press freedom and human rights abuses in Pakistan. The ISI was implicated, prompting calls for a thorough investigation and prosecution. U.S. officials expressed worries over reports of extrajudicial executions by Pakistani security forces, urging the government to address these allegations. Human Rights Watch called for investigations into alleged summary executions and torture in the Swat Valley. In September, a video showed men in Pakistani military uniforms executing six young men in civilian clothes in the Swat Valley. The Army Chief ordered an inquiry, and two intelligence agencies admitted to holding 11 missing persons. The Obama Administration withheld funding for Pakistani army units involved in human rights abuses. Blasphemy laws in Pakistan protect Islamic beliefs but are criticized for human rights violations. Pakistan's blasphemy laws, rooted in 19th-century colonial legislation but enforced more prominently under General Zia's rule in the 1980s, have faced criticism for being discriminatory and arbitrary. While convictions are common, most cases are overturned on appeal, but accusations have led to lynchings and intimidation of religious minorities. The laws came under scrutiny in 2010 when a Pakistani Christian woman was sentenced to death, prompting calls for repeal from international human rights groups. Despite this, the laws have significant public support in Pakistan. The blasphemy laws in Pakistan have faced criticism for being discriminatory and arbitrary. Despite significant public support, a bill to amend the law was introduced to limit its application in cases with clear premeditation or malicious intent. Protests and strikes organized by religious leaders ensued, with Islamist hardline groups justifying the assassination of a Punjab official. President's son, Bilawil Bhutto Zardari, pledged to defend Pakistan's minorities. Pakistan has received over $10.7 billion in U.S. aid since 2001, including $6 billion for development and humanitarian aid, and $4.4 billion for security-related programs. In 2009, Congress passed a bill authorizing increased nonmilitary aid to Pakistan and placing conditions on security-related aid. The Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (PCCF) was established in 2009 to enhance Pakistani security forces' ability to combat militancy, with appropriations totaling $1.1 billion. Since 2002, Congress has allocated over $8 billion in coalition support funds (CSF) to Pakistan for counterterrorism operations. The Obama Administration's FY2010 budget emphasized nonmilitary assistance, notably increasing economic development funds to over $1 billion. The Obama Administration requested a significant increase in foreign assistance for Pakistan in FY2011, including doubling Global Health and Child Survival funds to $67 million. Security-related assistance, particularly for the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (PCCF), is set to increase by about 20% to over $3 billion. Major Pakistan-specific legislation in the 111th Congress, known as the \"Kerry-Lugar-Berman\" bill, includes conditions on future military aid and increased development aid. The \"Kerry-Lugar-Berman\" bill (P.L. 111-73) includes reporting requirements for U.S. assistance funds, causing controversy in Pakistan. The military and opposition parties criticized it as an infringement on sovereignty. The strong reaction was seen as fueled by military elements and opposition forces aiming to weaken the government. The legislation placed the U.S. in the middle of a power struggle between Army Chief General Kayani and the government, which quickly dissipated. There is a debate on how to best channel foreign assistance to Pakistan, with claims that a significant portion of U.S. aid is spent on administrative costs. Pakistani officials suggest reducing costs by channeling aid through government agencies instead of NGOs. The State Department plans to reduce the use of U.S. aid contractors and direct more funds to Pakistani officials and local groups, despite opposition. A senior economist working for USAID in Pakistan warns that Pakistani aid contractors and NGOs lack experience and resources to effectively deliver aid. Concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of shifting aid from U.S. contractors to local implementers without a proper transition period. Senator John Kerry is worried about potential large-scale corruption undermining U.S. aid efforts in Pakistan. The State Department plans to reduce the use of U.S. aid contractors and direct more funds to Pakistani officials and local groups. Ambassador Holbrooke's plan to shift assistance funds directly through Pakistani organizations and government agencies raises concerns about potential misuse of funds. The \"Friends of Democratic Pakistan\" group was formed in September 2008 with the aim of working in partnership with Pakistan on various issues including combating extremism, economic development, stabilizing border regions, addressing energy shortages, and supporting democratic institutions. In April 2009, representatives from 31 countries and 18 international institutions attended a meeting to discuss these goals. In April 2009, 31 countries and 18 international institutions attended an FODP/Donors' Conference in Tokyo where Ambassador Holbrooke announced $1 billion in assistance to Pakistan over 2009-2010. The total aid offered by the international community exceeded $5 billion. The FODP's Third Ministerial Meeting in October focused on urging Pakistan to reform its economy, particularly by expanding the tax base. The Obama Administration's Pakistan Assistance Strategy Report in December 2009 outlined key objectives. The Pakistan Assistance Strategy Report, issued in December 2009, outlines the objectives of nonmilitary U.S. aid to Pakistan, focusing on infrastructure programs in energy and agriculture with a budget of $3.5 billion for FY2010-FY2014. Another $2 billion will fund health, education, and humanitarian programs, while the remaining $2 billion aims to improve Pakistani government capacity in governance, security, and legal institutions. The focus on infrastructure projects is to benefit Pakistani citizens and address energy and water issues. The United States aims to provide tangible benefits to Pakistani citizens by addressing energy and water shortages. The focus is on the KPk province, FATA, and areas vulnerable to extremism. The goals for civilian assistance include addressing urgent energy and water crises, supporting economic and political reforms, improving healthcare and education, responding to humanitarian challenges, and combating extremism. Large international contractors will be reduced in favor of building local capacity through Pakistani implementing partners. The Obama Administration emphasized upgrading Pakistan's energy sector in mid-2009. U.S.-Pakistan security cooperation increased after 2001, with Pakistan designated as a major non-NATO U.S. ally in 2004. Commercial sales allowed Pakistan to refurbish its fleet of F-16 fighter aircraft in 2002. The Obama Administration focused on enhancing Pakistan's energy sector in 2009. U.S.-Pakistan security cooperation saw a boost after 2001, with Pakistan becoming a major non-NATO U.S. ally in 2004. Commercial sales enabled Pakistan to upgrade its fleet of F-16 fighter aircraft. In 2010, high-level discussions on military cooperation and counterterrorism took place between U.S. and Pakistani officials. The Pentagon expressed frustration over Pakistan's perceived ineffective counterinsurgency efforts. The U.S. officials are concerned about Pakistan's slow shift from conventional war strategy to counterinsurgency efforts. The Pentagon proposed the creation of a dedicated fund, the PCCF, to strengthen Pakistan's counterinsurgency capabilities. There are worries about human rights abuses by the Pakistani army triggering restrictions on U.S. security assistance. Since 2001, the United States has provided Pakistan with significant military assistance, including arms sales and grants for counterterrorism operations. The bulk of purchases are made with Pakistani funds, but recent years have seen an increase in U.S. grants. The Pentagon reports total Foreign Military Sales agreements worth $5.4 billion for FY2002-FY2010, with a focus on F-16 combat aircraft. Additionally, over $2.1 billion in Foreign Military Financing has been provided for longer-term modernization efforts. Pakistan has also received U.S. defense supplies as Excess Defense Articles. Since 2001, the United States has provided Pakistan with significant military assistance, including arms sales and grants for counterterrorism operations. Major post-2001 defense supplies provided under FMF include P-3C Orion aircraft, TOW anti-armor missiles, military radio sets, surveillance radars, C-130E transport aircraft, SH-2I Super Seasprite helicopters, AH-1F Cobra attack helicopters, and TOW missile launchers. Pakistan has also received supplies paid for with a mix of Pakistani national funds and FMF, including Mid-Life Update kits for F-16A/B combat aircraft. Since 2001, the United States has provided Pakistan with significant military assistance, including arms sales and grants for counterterrorism operations. Recent acquisitions by Pakistan include 18 new F-16C/D Block 50/52 combat aircraft, F-16 armaments, Harpoon anti-ship missiles, Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, and Phalanx Close-In Weapons System naval guns. Additionally, major articles transferred via EDA include F-16A/B combat aircraft, T-37 military trainer jets, and M-113 armored personnel carriers. Pakistan has received various military equipment including helicopters, surveillance aircraft, vehicles, explosives detection vehicles, munitions, night vision devices, radios, body armor, and more under different authorities. They are eager to receive more counterinsurgency hardware such as armored personnel carriers, laser target designators, night-vision goggles, and surveillance gear. Pakistan also requests better surveillance and communications equipment, attack helicopters, and utility helicopters. The Defense Department has characterized F-16 fighters, P-3C patrol aircraft, and anti-armor missiles as having significant anti-terrorism applications. Some observers are skeptical of claims that FMF funds have been solely for counterterrorism efforts. U.S. officials are concerned about alleged modifications to U.S.-supplied weapons by Pakistan, including expanding the capability of Harpoon anti-ship missiles and P-3C naval aircraft for land-attack missions. The Islamabad government denies these allegations. Indian observers were not surprised by the claims. The Defense Department denies allegations of withholding counterinsurgency equipment from Pakistan. Some analysts suspect a U.S. motive to maintain Pakistan as a regional balancer to India. Pentagon officials refute claims of hindering Pakistan's access to necessary equipment during fighting in South Waziristan. The United States provided significant assistance to Pakistan during the fighting in South Waziristan, including transport helicopters, helicopter gunship parts, infantry equipment, and intelligence sharing from American UAVs. In 2010, the U.S. supplied the Pakistani air force with bombs and laser-guided bomb kits. However, Pakistani officials have complained about the slow delivery of defense equipment, especially attack and utility helicopters. In his first two years in Washington, Pakistan received only eight used Mi-17 transport helicopters, hindering military operations due to lack of equipment. U.S. officials provided Pakistan with 50 helicopters since 2006, including armed Cobra models. Former Joint Chiefs Chairman Colin Powell urged better support for Pakistani military in counterinsurgency operations. Pentagon notified Congress of potential sale of 30 Bell 412 utility helicopters to Pakistan. The Bush Administration initiated a program to strengthen Pakistan's Frontier Corps, a paramilitary force responsible for border security in KPk and Baluchistan provinces. The Pentagon funded training and equipping of the FC and increased U.S. Special Operations Command involvement in Pakistani counterterrorism efforts. Efforts to train Pakistan's paramilitary forces have faced challenges due to Pakistan's reluctance to send troops needed for urgent operations elsewhere. Additionally, there are ongoing programs to train Pakistan's elite Special Service Group commandos and increase their force size to 5,000. The United States provides security assistance to Pakistan, including training Pakistani soldiers, bolstering counterterrorism efforts, and enhancing military professionalism. U.S. efforts also focus on strengthening law enforcement capabilities and promoting respect for human rights and democratic values. The United States provides security assistance to Pakistan, including training soldiers and enhancing military professionalism. Pakistani shortcomings hinder U.S. efforts, with poorly trained and equipped personnel, low conviction rates, and rampant corruption in the criminal justice sector. Analysts urge greater international attention to bolster Pakistan's civilian security sector. Pakistan's police and civilian intelligence agencies are seen as better suited to combating insurgency and terrorism than the regular army. The United States provides security assistance to Pakistan, focusing on training soldiers and enhancing military professionalism. Analysts recommend international support to strengthen Pakistan's civilian security sector, emphasizing the role of police and intelligence agencies in combating insurgency and terrorism. Recent legislation limits foreign military financing for Pakistan to border security, counterterrorism, and law enforcement activities against Al Qaeda and the Taliban, with additional funding allocated for coalition support reimbursements. The Enhanced Partnership With Pakistan Act of 2009 authorizes $1.5 billion per fiscal year for nonmilitary assistance to Pakistan, with a focus on strengthening Pakistani counterinsurgency capabilities. The President is required to report to Congress on the progress of Afghan and Pakistani governments in meeting policy objectives and the metrics used to assess such progress. The Enhanced Partnership With Pakistan Act of 2009 authorizes $1.5 billion per fiscal year for nonmilitary assistance to Pakistan for FY2010-FY2014, with conditions on military assistance and arms transfers. It requires certification from the Secretary of State on Pakistan's cooperation in dismantling nuclear proliferation networks, efforts to combat terrorist groups, and ensuring security forces do not interfere with political or judicial processes. Additionally, a Pakistan Assistance Strategy Report must be submitted to Congress outlining objectives and accountability mechanisms. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2010 directs the Secretary of State to monitor defense articles and services transferred to Pakistan and Afghanistan, prohibiting retransfer without U.S. consent. It also requires assessments of alternatives for reimbursements to Pakistan and reports on progress towards security and stability in Pakistan. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2010 requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to consult with the Secretary of Defense. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, must submit quarterly reports to Congress on Pakistan Counterinsurgency Fund spending. Requires notification to Congress of new PCF projects or fund transfers over $20 million. H.R. 1463 aimed to restrict U.S. military assistance to Pakistan unless certain conditions were met. S. 496 focused on Afghanistan and Pakistan Reconstruction Opportunity Zones Act of 2009. The Afghanistan and Pakistan Reconstruction Opportunity Zones Act of 2009 aimed to provide duty-free treatment for certain goods from designated zones in Afghanistan and Pakistan."
