The Small Business Producer Energy Emergency Disaster Loan Program allows the Administrator to provide loans to small businesses affected by increased energy prices. The loans have the same interest rate as economic injury loans. The Small Business Producer Energy Emergency Disaster Loan Program offers loans to small businesses impacted by rising energy costs. Loans cannot exceed $1,500,000 unless the borrower is a significant local employer. Assistance is contingent on a declaration of disaster by the President or Administrator. The Small Business Producer Energy Emergency Disaster Loan Program provides financial assistance to small businesses affected by increased prices of heating oil, natural gas, gasoline, transportation fuel, propane, or kerosene. Assistance is available upon declaration of a disaster by the President, Administrator, or certification by the Governor of a State. The Small Business Producer Energy Emergency Disaster Loan Program offers financial aid to small businesses impacted by rising prices of heating oil, natural gas, gasoline, propane, or kerosene. Businesses can use the loan to switch to renewable energy sources like geothermal, solar, wind, or fuel cells. The program defines terms like 'base price index' as the average closing unit price on the New York Mercantile Exchange for heating oil. The term 'current price index' refers to the moving average of the closing unit price on the New York Mercantile Exchange for contracts to purchase heating oil, natural gas, gasoline, transportation fuel, or propane. The amendment defines a significant increase in prices for heating oil, natural gas, gasoline, transportation fuel, propane, and kerosene. It will apply to economic injury suffered after the enactment of the Act."
