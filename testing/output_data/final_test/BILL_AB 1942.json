    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 52.6 of the Civil Code is amended to require certain businesses and establishments to post a notice near the public entrance. This includes on-sale general public premises licensees, adult or sexually oriented businesses, primary airports, intercity passenger rail or light rail stations, and bus stations. Certain businesses and establishments, including truck stops, emergency rooms, urgent care centers, farm labor contractors, job recruitment centers, roadside rest areas, and massage or bodywork services, are required to post a notice near the public entrance. The notice must be a certain size, font, and include specific information. If you or someone you know is being forced into any type of labor and cannot leave, call the National Human Trafficking Resource Center or the California Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking for help and services. Victims of slavery and human trafficking are protected under United States and California law. The hotlines for victims of slavery and human trafficking are available 24/7, toll-free, operated by nonprofit organizations, anonymous, and accessible in over 160 languages. The notice to be posted must be in English, Spanish, and the most widely spoken language in the county, as required by the federal Voting Rights Act. The Department of Justice must develop a model notice by April 1, 2013, for businesses to comply with. Failure to comply results in civil penalties of $500 for the first offense and $1,000 for subsequent offenses. Government entities can enforce these penalties if regulatory agencies have taken action. The Department of Justice requires businesses to be notified of noncompliance and face civil penalties if violations are not corrected within 30 days. Hotels must train employees to recognize and report signs of human trafficking as per DOJ guidelines. The Department of Justice mandates guidelines for training hotel employees on human trafficking by July 1, 2017. The training must cover an overview of human trafficking, how to identify signs, report incidences, and the risks it poses to hotels. Starting January 1, 2018, the training should be part of the initial training process for new employees likely to interact with trafficking victims. Section 2810.7 of the Labor Code mandates that hotels and motels in California train employees likely to interact with human trafficking victims on recognizing and reporting signs of trafficking to law enforcement. The training must be included in the initial training process for new employees starting January 1, 2018. The training for hotel and motel employees in California on human trafficking includes an overview of human trafficking, how to identify signs, report incidences, and understand the risks. Starting January 1, 2018, new and existing employees likely to interact with victims must undergo this training."
