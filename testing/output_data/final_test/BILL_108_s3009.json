The Act titled \"National Food and Agricultural Science Act of 2004\" defines key terms such as Council, Director, Division, Foundation, and Fundamental agricultural research/science. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture, and \"United States\" in a geographical sense includes the States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and all territories and possessions of the United States. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\" summarizes the section regarding the findings and purposes of the document. The Agricultural Research, Economics, and Education Task Force reviewed agricultural research in the US and recommended establishing national institutes to address critical challenges in food and agriculture. These challenges include exotic diseases, pests, obesity, and environmental degradation. Agricultural innovation is crucial to address environmental degradation, animal diseases threatening human health, and the competitiveness of US crop producers. Innovation has led to higher yielding crop varieties, increasing food supply without expanding cultivated land. Only 1.5% of the US population provides food and fiber for the nation's needs. Agriculture and agriculture sciences are vital for the health and welfare of the United States. Fundamental scientific research is crucial for innovation in agriculture, with opportunities for advancement never greater due to progress in life sciences. The Federal Government has played a significant role in advancing life sciences, particularly in genetics, cell biology, and proteomics. This scientific knowledge can be utilized in agriculture and food sciences through sustained research efforts. Publicly sponsored research is essential for agricultural innovation to address environmental impacts, enhance sustainability, and improve public health. Competitive, peer-reviewed research is crucial for fundamental advancements in agriculture. The importance of competitive, peer-reviewed fundamental agricultural research is highlighted for promoting breakthrough innovations in agriculture. Additional long-term funding is needed for an institute dedicated to supporting high-quality research. Inadequate investment in research threatens the nation's international competitiveness in agriculture. Grant-receiving institutions must be adequately reimbursed for their costs to pursue necessary agricultural research effectively. To ensure technological superiority in agriculture and promote innovation, sufficient Federal funds are needed for fundamental agricultural research through an independent institute. The Division aims to enhance the international competitiveness of US agriculture and develop healthier foods to combat obesity. The Division aims to enhance US agriculture by developing healthier foods, creating new products from plants and animals, improving food safety, enhancing sustainability, strengthening rural economies, reducing dependence on foreign petroleum, and improving agricultural productivity in developing countries for national security. The Division aims to enhance US agriculture by developing healthier foods, creating new products, improving food safety, enhancing sustainability, and strengthening rural economies. Additionally, it aims to combat hunger and political instability through modernizing agricultural research facilities and achieving other determined goals. The Division is established to enhance US agriculture by developing healthier foods, creating new products, improving food safety, enhancing sustainability, and strengthening rural economies. Additionally, it aims to combat hunger and political instability through modernizing agricultural research facilities and achieving determined goals. The Division of Food and Agricultural Science is established within the National Science Foundation, consisting of a Council and administered by a Director. The Director coordinates the research agenda with the Secretary and oversees a Standing Council of Advisors composed of scientists and stakeholders appointed by the Director. The Council of the Division of Food and Agricultural Science is appointed by the Director of the National Science Foundation and the Director of Food and Agricultural Science. Scientist members must be eminent in agricultural research or related fields, selected based on distinguished service to represent views in agricultural research and science. The Council of the Division of Food and Agricultural Science consists of 12 stakeholder members appointed by the Secretary for 4-year terms. Stakeholder members include distinguished individuals from the US public, farm organizations, industry, and those knowledgeable about the environment. The Council of the Division of Food and Agricultural Science, consisting of 12 stakeholder members appointed by the Secretary, is tasked with assisting the Director in establishing research priorities and reviewing funded programs to ensure they meet the needs of the Nation. The Council of the Division of Food and Agricultural Science holds periodic meetings to provide an interface between scientists and stakeholders, ensuring national goals are linked with scientific opportunities. Meetings are held at the call of the Director or Secretary, at least annually. The Division of Food and Agricultural Science holds periodic meetings to connect scientists and stakeholders, aligning national goals with scientific opportunities. The Director awards competitive grants for high-quality agricultural research to individual scientists, research centers, and entities from public and private sectors. The funded research complements existing programs without replacing them. The Division solely awards grants for agricultural research funded by various organizations. It does not conduct research or operate labs. The Director establishes procedures for grant review and administration."
