    "content": "The \"IRS Customer Service Improvement Act\" requires the IRS to provide personal and timely responses to phone calls and signed letters to taxpayers. It also mandates equal interest rates for overpayments and underpayments. SEC. 3 amends the Internal Revenue Code to set the same interest rate for overpayments and underpayments. The changes apply to interest calculations after the enactment date. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to require the Secretary to notify the taxpayer by certified mail if an amount of tax in excess of that shown on the return is due due to a mathematical or clerical error. The IRS must notify the taxpayer by certified mail of any additional tax due because of a mathematical or clerical error. The notice must explain the error alleged, but it does not count as a deficiency notice or allow the taxpayer to petition the Tax Court based on that notice. The amendment made by subsection (a) shall apply to returns filed after the date of the enactment of this Act. In case of failure to provide timely notice, certain interest amounts and penalties may be waived. SEC. 5. FAIRNESS WHEN COLLECTING A TAX DUE TO MATHEMATICAL AND CLERICAL ERRORS. Section 6404(d) of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to allow for the abatement of interest, penalty, additional amounts, and additions to tax for assessments due to mathematical or clerical errors if the taxpayer pays or requests an abatement within 60 days of notice. The amendment to section 6404(d) of the Internal Revenue Code allows for the abatement of interest, penalty, and additional amounts for assessments due to mathematical or clerical errors if the Secretary fails to notify the taxpayer within the specified 6-month period. The effective date of this amendment applies to notices filed after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 6. 1-YEAR PERIOD OF LIMITATION ON CERTAIN ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENTS RELATING TO CERTAIN RETURNS. SEC. 6 amends subsection (c) of section 6501 of the Internal Revenue Code to add a 1-year period for certain individual income tax taxpayers, reducing the assessment limitation from 3 years to 1 year for specific tax returns. The amendment applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 1997, and sets criteria for tax return understatement. SEC. 7. EXCEPTION FOR SMALL BUSINESSES FROM REQUIRED USE OF ELECTRONIC FUND TRANSFER SYSTEM. The amendment exempts small depositors from making electronic fund transfers for taxes if their employment tax payments are $50,000 or less in a calendar year. The amendment exempts small depositors with employment tax payments of $50,000 or less from electronic fund transfers for taxes. Amendments to required deposit percentages are also specified, effective after June 30, 1998."
