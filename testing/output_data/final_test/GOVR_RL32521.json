    "content": "Agroterrorism, defined as the deliberate introduction of animal or plant diseases to create fear and economic losses, is a growing national security concern post-9/11. The response to this threat is known as \"food defense,\" with bioterrorism likely involved. The goal is not to kill animals or plants but to disrupt the agricultural and food industries, causing social unrest and loss of confidence in government. Agroterrorism poses a threat to national security by disrupting agricultural and food industries, leading to social unrest and loss of confidence in government. It is considered a viable secondary target for terrorism analysts, with evidence of al Qaeda interest in using it to harm the US economy. Agriculture's unique characteristics, such as dispersed farms in unsecured environments, make it susceptible to agroterrorism attacks. Livestock in agriculture are often concentrated in large numbers, making them vulnerable to diseases that can spread quickly. The potential for agroterrorism is heightened by the ease of acquiring and deploying pathogens that are harmful to plants and animals. The transportation and processing of live animals and food products further increase the risk of contamination on a large scale. The international trade in livestock, grains, and food products is closely tied to disease-free status, as the presence of pests or diseases can halt exports and disrupt markets. The lack of direct experience with foreign diseases among veterinarians and scientists in the U.S. may delay recognition and response to outbreaks, making the agriculture and food industry susceptible to bioterrorism. The agricultural sector is vulnerable to bioterrorism attacks, leading to economic losses from plant and animal health issues. This would result in reduced food supply, decreased demand for certain foods, and disruptions in the supply chain. The impact would be felt across various sectors from farmers to food service providers, potentially threatening food security. The report addresses the threat of biological weapons against agriculture, focusing on protecting dangerous agricultural materials like fuels and fertilizers. Legislation proposed in 2005-2006 aimed to restrict the handling of agricultural fertilizers that can be converted into explosives. Concerns also exist over the misuse of small aircraft in potential attacks. The report primarily focuses on the threat of biological weapons in agriculture, particularly the misuse of small aircraft for spreading biological weapons. It emphasizes the potential for agricultural materials to be converted into explosives and discusses the need for legislation to restrict the handling of such materials. The report also mentions references to agroterrorism and agricultural security measures. References to agroterrorism and agricultural bioweapons can be found in government, academia, and the press, with concerns raised about the risk-free nature of biological attacks on agricultural targets. Despite initial awareness in the late 1990s, agriculture and food production received less attention in federal counterterrorism and homeland security activities as the 20th century ended. After initially receiving less attention in federal counterterrorism efforts, agriculture was added to the list of critical infrastructure in 2003. Agroterrorism gained national attention in 2004 when concerns were raised about the vulnerability of the food supply to terrorist attacks. Congress has addressed agroterrorism through hearings and legislation, with a focus on food safety, border inspections, and physical security. The executive branch has responded to concerns about agroterrorism by implementing new laws, issuing presidential directives, creating task forces, and publishing protection and response plans. The law enforcement community recognizes agroterrorism as a threat, with the FBI and JTTF sponsoring an annual conference on the topic. The 9/11 Commission report does not directly address agroterrorism but recommendations on intelligence coordination and information sharing could impact agriculture and other sectors. Agriculture and the food industry are crucial for the social, economic, and political stability of the United States. The food and fiber sector employs 16% of the workforce and contributed $1.2 trillion to the GDP in 2002. Farm sales exceeded $200 billion, with production split between crops and livestock. Livestock inventories included 95 million cattle and 60 million hogs in 2002. In 2003, farm sales of broilers and other meat-type chickens exceeded 8.5 billion birds in the U.S. The country has technologically advanced and efficient agriculture, allowing Americans to spend only about 10% of their disposable income on food. The U.S. produces and exports a large share of the world's grain, with significant shares in corn, soybeans, and wheat production and exports. The U.S. agricultural sector heavily relies on export markets, with 21% of production exported. Agriculture contributes positively to the country's balance of trade, with $60 billion in exports and $47 billion in imports. Farm assets exceed $1.3 trillion, with land accounting for 80% of assets. Agricultural production is concentrated geographically and on large farms in the U.S. Agricultural production in the U.S. is concentrated geographically and on a subset of large farms. 75% of the value of production occurs on just 6.7% of farms, with average sales of $1 million annually and 2,000 acres in size. Livestock and poultry production are concentrated in different regions, with cattle being the least concentrated. Beef cattle feedlots are particularly concentrated in a swath from northern Texas through Iowa. The top five cattle-producing states account for 35% of U.S. cattle production. Hog inventories are concentrated in the Midwest, especially Iowa. Hog inventories are concentrated in the Midwest, with Iowa, North Carolina, and Minnesota being the top three hog-producing states, accounting for 53% of U.S. hogs. Chicken production is focused in the Southeast, with Georgia, Arkansas, and Alabama being the top three chicken-producing states, producing 41% of U.S. chickens. Grain production is mainly in the Midwest, with Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, and Minnesota being the top four corn-producing states, producing 54% of the crop. Economic losses from agroterrorist incidents could be significant, including the value of lost production and the cost of destroying diseased animals. Economic losses from agroterrorist incidents could be significant, including the value of lost production, cost of destroying diseased products, containment expenses, potential export market restrictions, multiplier effects on the economy, and government costs for eradication and compensation to producers. Economic losses from agroterrorist incidents could be significant, including the value of lost production, containment costs, and compensation to producers for destroyed animals. Market prices of affected commodities may drop, impacting producers on a national scale. However, demand for uncontaminated products may increase, leading to higher market prices for substitutes or certified products from non-contaminated areas. For example, when Canada discovered mad cow disease in 2003, beef prices dropped significantly in Canada but remained stable in the United States. The discovery of BSE in the United States in 2003 led to a drop in beef prices, but less severe than in Canada. Public concerns about eradication methods and environmental impact could affect consumer confidence in the government. The UK's FMD outbreak in 2001 highlighted the challenges of euthanizing and disposing of infected animals. The economic impact of disease outbreaks in the agriculture industry can be significant, with potential costs varying based on factors such as disease agent, transmission rate, and response plans. The 2001 FMD outbreak in the UK had estimated economic impacts of $1,389 to $4,477 per head of livestock, exceeding the animals' value due to the wide range of industries affected. Price Waterhouse Coopers estimates that a potential FMD outbreak in the U.S. could result in the destruction of 7.5 million animals, with an economic impact ranging from $10.4 billion to $33.6 billion. Additionally, a limited outbreak on just 10 farms could have a $2 billion financial impact. The USDA has outlined the wide-ranging implications of an FMD outbreak, while a study on African swine fever suggests a potential 10-year impact of at least $5.4 billion. If agroterrorist attacks were to occur in the U.S., the 10-year economic impact could be at least $5.4 billion, with potential for higher costs. However, some assessments suggest that the economic consequences might be limited due to the food and agriculture industry's ability to handle disruptions. The Congressional Budget Office report indicates that economic losses from such attacks could be small, as the industry is well-prepared to deal with disruptions. Traditional farm commodity programs may help mitigate economic losses within industry experience and current response plans. Traditional farm commodity programs are not equipped to respond to the scale of devastation from agroterrorism. These programs support about 25 agricultural commodities but do not cover meats, fruits, vegetables, and other vulnerable products. Agroterrorist attacks could target these non-supported commodities, leading to significant economic impact. The economic impact of an agroterrorist attack on vulnerable food products like meats, fruits, and vegetables is not covered by existing federal farm income support programs. Federal assistance would likely come from emergency transfer authority for producers and through supplemental emergency appropriations by Congress. Making disaster payments to individuals not receiving commodity payments is more challenging. Despite suggestions that the economic effects of agroterrorism may be within normal experience, federal and state agencies, along with private corporations, continue to prepare for such threats. State agencies and private corporations are preparing for agroterrorism, anticipating attacks that could exceed natural outbreaks. Historical evidence shows that agricultural bioweapons programs have been conducted by various countries, with rare instances of biological weapons being used against crops or livestock by state actors. Examples include Germany's use of glanders in World War I. In recent decades, biological weapons have been used against agricultural targets, but mostly as a theoretical consideration. The Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention in 1972 led to many countries, including the United States, halting military development of biological weapons. While some individuals or groups have used bioweapons against agriculture, only a few incidents can be considered terrorist acts. Examples include the Mau Mau killing cattle in Kenya in 1952 and the Rajneeshee cult spreading salmonella in Oregon in 1984. The Rajneeshee cult spread salmonella in salad bars at Oregon restaurants to influence a local election. Chemical weapons have been used against agricultural targets, including incidents by Israeli settlers and the Arab Revolutionary Council. Congress has held hearings on agroterrorism from 1999 to 2006. In October 1999, a hearing on \"The Agricultural Biological Weapons Threat to the United States\" was held by Senator Pat Roberts. In November 2003, the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs discussed \"Agroterrorism: The Threat to America's Breadbasket.\" In May 2005, the House Homeland Security Committee evaluated the threat of agro-terrorism. In response to the threat of agro-terrorism, various hearings and discussions were held by government committees between 2005 and 2006. The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act was enacted in 2002 to address vulnerabilities identified after September 11, 2001, with provisions important to agriculture. The Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2002 expanded FDA authority over food manufacturing and imports, tightened control of biological agents, authorized agricultural security activities, addressed criminal penalties for terrorism against animal enterprises, and responded to concerns about food safety. The Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2002 expanded FDA authority over food manufacturing and imports, implementing new rules for registration of food processors, prior notice of food imports, administrative detention of imports, and record-keeping. FDA established a one-time registration system for all food facilities supplying food for the United States by December 12, 2003. Exemptions were provided for certain entities like restaurants, retail stores, farms, and non-profit food establishments. The Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2002 expanded FDA authority over food manufacturing and imports, implementing new rules for registration of food processors and prior notice of food imports. Many farms had difficulty determining if they needed to register based on handling or processing. Registration documents are protected under FOIA. Critics argued that registration created a burden without proof of emergency response capability. Importers must give advance notice to FDA before importing food. FDA can assess if facilities can respond in an emergency with prior notice. The FDA can assess food shipments for inspection with prior notice, otherwise, the food will be refused entry. Critics are concerned about the administrative costs of compliance and potential delays in perishable imports. However, the new system has generally not caused delays, and most shippers have been accommodated. FDA and DHS integrated their information systems to facilitate compliance for food importers. Upon enactment of the act in December 2003, FDA gained the authority to detain food imports under certain conditions. FDA procedures for detention were issued on June 4, 2004. The agency must provide credible evidence of a serious health threat to detain food, which can be held for up to 30 days. Owners are responsible for moving detained food to secure storage. Perishable foods receive expedited review, and FDA published a rule for record-keeping in 2003. Companies involved in the food industry must maintain records for up to two years, allowing FDA access in case of food safety issues. The rule exempts farms, restaurants, and fishing vessels not engaged in processing. FDA can reduce record-keeping requirements for small businesses and protect trade secrets. In 2002, USDA issued regulations to prevent biological agents and toxins from being used in terrorism. APHIS identified select agents with the potential for agricultural or food-related terrorism. Regulations (9 CFR 121 for animals, 7 CFR 331 for plants) outline requirements for handling these pathogens, impacting various research institutions and laboratories. Security upgrades were necessary, leading to concerns about research program disruptions. Extensive registration and background checks were planned for 2003, but faced delays at the FBI. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred personnel and responsibilities for agricultural border inspections from USDA to DHS, and possession of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center in New York to DHS. Delays in FBI processing led to provisional registrations for laboratories in 2003. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 authorized the transfer of APHIS border inspection personnel from USDA to DHS. Approximately 2,680 APHIS inspectors became employees of DHS in the Bureau of Customs and Border Inspection (CBP). USDA retains a significant presence in border inspection due to its scientific expertise. The APHIS Agricultural Quarantine Inspection (AQI) program was one of the programs selected for inclusion when DHS was created. Some drafts of the bill considered transferring all of APHIS to DHS, raising concerns from farm interest groups. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 authorized the transfer of APHIS border inspection personnel to DHS, leaving other activities under USDA. DHS-CBP personnel now inspect international conveyances and baggage for plant and animal products that could harbor pests or disease organisms. USDA retains a significant presence in border activities, setting agricultural inspection policies for DHS border inspectors. APHIS manages data collected during inspections, monitors smuggling and trade compliance, and supervises CBP inspector training. The CBP cross-training initiative aimed to train inspectors in customs, immigration, and agriculture inspections equally, but faced criticism leading to the creation of a separate class of inspectors. DHS created a new class of inspectors called \"agriculture specialists\" to work in secondary inspection stations in passenger and cargo terminals. These specialists include former APHIS inspectors and new graduates from a training program. The training program for agriculture specialists is now eight weeks long, taught by CBP and APHIS instructors at a USDA facility in Frederick. The course for agriculture specialists is taught by CBP and APHIS instructors at a USDA training facility in Frederick, Maryland. Specialists also receive two weeks of law enforcement training and can exercise similar authority to CBP officers. The first class graduated in July 2004, and regular CBP officers receive 12-16 hours of agricultural training at FLETC in Georgia. The future size of the specialist corps is uncertain due to attrition of former APHIS inspectors. Deployment details and staffing at ports of entry are not available. The deployment of agriculture specialists at ports of entry under DHS has raised concerns about the effectiveness of agricultural inspections. Statistics show a decrease in insect infestations under DHS compared to APHIS. Challenges include unfilled inspector positions and difficulties in cross-training customs and immigration officers for agricultural inspections. Congressional committees are worried about the level of attention given to agricultural security under DHS. The FY2007 DHS appropriations act supports cross-training legacy customs, immigration, and agricultural inspection officers as part of CBP's 'One Face at the Border Initiative'. Only 21% of agricultural specialists receive urgent alerts for inspection priorities in a timely manner. The number of canine units has declined from 140 to 80 since the transfer to DHS, with 60% of tested canine teams failing proficiency tests. The GAO analyzed a survey of morale among agricultural specialists, revealing more negative responses than positive comments. Section 310 of the Homeland Security Act transferred the Plum Island Animal Disease Center to DHS, including only the property and facilities. APHIS and ARS personnel continue research and diagnostic work at the facility, with DHS also conducting research there. DHS conducts research at Plum Island and plans for a new National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility. The Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act increases penalties for damaging animal enterprises. The act covers threats, vandalism, property damage, trespassing, harassment, and intimidation towards animal enterprises for profit or educational purposes. Since 2002, GAO reports have identified gaps in federal controls for protecting agriculture and food, including insufficient guidance for border inspectors, shortcomings in documentation for imports, and security flaws at food processing companies. The FDA lacks authority to impose requirements or assess security flaws. The 2003 GAO report highlighted security flaws at USDA's Plum Island lab, with inadequate background checks for personnel and limited security authority. DHS announced armed security personnel would supplement security in 2004. A 2005 GAO report addressed agroterrorism issues, noting vulnerability assessments and interagency coordination efforts were in progress, but more coordination was needed. There was also a lack of veterinarians trained in foreign animal diseases and response capacity. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act expressed concerns over agricultural border inspections and research at Plum Island after the transfer of activities to DHS in 2003. The lack of coordination between USDA and DHS regarding agriculture inspections was highlighted, with fears that the focus may shift away from agriculture. The Government Accountability Office was requested to provide a report on this coordination to ensure the protection of U.S. agriculture interests. The report (H.Rept. 108-792) highlighted accomplishments in interagency coordination between USDA and DHS, including training of agricultural specialists and creation of agriculture liaisons. However, issues in coordination and inspection performance were noted, such as the lack of performance measures for agriculture inspections and staffing deficiencies. Agriculture specialists were not always informed of urgent inspection alerts, indicating room for improvement in communication and operational efficiency. The number of canine units for inspection has decreased from 140 to 80 since the transfer to DHS, with 60% of tested canine teams failing proficiency tests. Financial management issues include user fees being lower than program costs, lack of information on actual costs, and delays in transferring fees. A survey on morale among agricultural specialists revealed concerns about declining inspections and mission, with negative responses outweighing positive comments. After the transfer to DHS, the number of canine units for inspection decreased, with financial management issues and concerns about declining agricultural mission and morale among specialists. USDA created a Homeland Security Staff post-9/11 to coordinate agroterrorism preparedness plans, focusing on food supply, facilities, and staff readiness. The staff also serves as a liaison with Congress, DHS, and other agencies on terrorism issues, including combating WMD threats. Directive 62 (PDD-62) in 1998 focused on agriculture's role in combating terrorism. USDA has been overshadowed by other agencies in national security efforts. Efforts to improve agroterrorism preparedness have been undertaken by various departments and agencies. Agriculture was added to the critical infrastructure list in 2003 by Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7). This directive aims to protect physical systems vulnerable to terrorist attacks. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) identifies key industries vulnerable to terrorist attacks and instructs agencies to develop plans to counter the threat. It includes agriculture, banking, transportation, energy, telecommunications, public health, emergency services, and water treatment. HSPD-9, released in 2004, focuses on defending the agriculture and food sectors against terrorist attacks. The Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) instructs various government agencies to coordinate efforts in preparing for, protecting against, responding to, and recovering from agroterrorist attacks. Different departments are assigned primary responsibilities, with a focus on developing awareness and warning systems for monitoring plant and animal diseases, food quality, and public health. Vulnerability assessments and mitigation strategies are prioritized throughout the agricultural sector. Mitigation strategies are implemented at critical stages of production or processing, including inspection of imported agricultural products. Response and recovery plans are coordinated across federal, state, and local levels. A National Veterinary Stockpile (NVS) of vaccine, antiviral, and therapeutic products is developed for deployment within 24 hours of an attack. A National Plant Disease Recovery System (NPDRS) aims to develop disease and pest resistant varieties within one growing season of an attack to resume production of certain crops. The Secretary of Agriculture makes recommendations for risk management tools to encourage self-protection for agriculture and food enterprises vulnerable to losses from terrorism. HSPD-9 encourages USDA and HHS to promote higher education programs focusing on the protection of animal, plant, and public health, including capacity-building grants for universities and internships. HSPD-9 suggests capacity-building grants for universities, internships, fellowships, and post-graduate opportunities. It incorporates USDA and agriculture into DHS research programs. HSPD-9 is a presidential directive for internal executive branch management, not creating enforceable laws and subject to change without Congressional consent. Implementing HSPD-9 involves drawing upon HSPD-5. The USDA Homeland Security Staff and other agencies are utilizing HSPD-5 and HSPD-8 for the national response plan and preparedness. HSPD-5 established the National Response Plan to coordinate federal resources for domestic incidents. The plan, developed by DHS in 2004, includes annexes addressing agriculture and food emergency support. The USDA plays a key role in coordinating federal interagency support. USDA is the primary agency for ESF #11, focusing on nutrition assistance, pest control, food safety, and protection of resources in disaster areas. The NRP includes incident annexes for specific hazard situations. The \"Food and Agriculture Incident Annex\" outlines federal roles in coordinating responses to incidents affecting food and agriculture. USDA and HHS are designated as primary agencies for coordination, with law enforcement notified through the FBI if incidents appear intentional. HHS coordinates food inspected by the FDA beyond the farm gate, while USDA coordinates food safety for products inspected by the Food Safety. The USDA coordinates food safety for processed meat, poultry, and egg products inspected by FSIS. EPA provides expedited assistance for pesticide applications and technical support for decontamination. DHS is involved in activating other parts of the NRP for law enforcement and border inspection activities. The annex emphasizes the importance of laboratory networks like FERN for incident detection and investigation. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan unifies critical infrastructure protection through public-private partnerships, establishing national priorities and goals. Sector partnership model encourages Sector Coordinating Councils and Government Coordinating Councils to work together for infrastructure protection. The Food and Agriculture Sector Coordinating Council (FASCC) is a self-organized group of key stakeholders within the sector, working with a Government Coordinating Council to coordinate infrastructure protection activities. FASCC has seven sub-councils representing different areas of the agriculture industry, serving as a model for other Sector Coordinating Councils. The FASCC, a key stakeholder group in the Food and Agriculture Sector, collaborates with government agencies to enhance infrastructure protection. Recent achievements include developing a Sector Specific Plan, identifying security gaps, and conducting site surveys to assess vulnerabilities in the industry for potential terrorist attacks. The Food and Agriculture Sector works with government agencies to enhance infrastructure protection. They identify potential terrorist targets, develop intelligence collection strategies, and establish mitigation strategies for early detection and prevention of attacks. The Food and Agriculture ISAC serves as a contact point for law enforcement and intelligence agencies to detect and prevent threats against critical infrastructure. The Food and Agriculture ISAC, established in February 2002, shares confidential information on food safety and bio-security threats with law enforcement and intelligence agencies. The ISAC network is similar to Infragard, a public-private information sharing program by the FBI. AgGard, a program created in 2005, encourages the agricultural community to share information on suspicious activities to prevent agroterrorism threats to critical infrastructure. The United States has expanded its agricultural laboratory and diagnostic infrastructure in response to the recognition of agroterrorism as a threat to critical infrastructure. Plans are underway to replace the aging Plum Island Animal Disease Center with a new \"National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility\" for research on high consequence foreign animal diseases. Congress has allocated funds for planning and site selection, with 18 sites in 11 states currently under consideration. The Plum Island Animal Disease Center in NY, currently the main U.S. facility for researching foreign animal diseases, is considered outdated and insufficient for current biosecurity research needs. It is the only approved facility in the U.S. for studying high-consequence foreign livestock diseases like foot-and-mouth disease due to its specially designed BSL-3 bio-containment area. The proposed NBAF facility raises concerns about its location due to the geographical restriction on using live FMD virus on the U.S. mainland. Critics argue that locating the facility in regions with livestock poses a high risk if security measures are breached by terrorism. Biosafety levels (BSLs) range from BSL-1 for minimal hazard pathogens to BSL-4 for high-risk, life-threatening diseases with aerosol transmission risks. Only a few BSL-4 labs exist globally. The U.S. has limited BSL-4 labs, including CDC lab in Athens, Georgia, and an Army lab in Ft. Dietrick, Maryland. Plum Island Animal Disease Center and USDA NVSL in Ames, IA are the only BSL-3 agriculture facilities in the U.S. With the rise of zoonotic diseases, there is a need for BSL-4 labs to study pathogens and BSL-4 agriculture facilities to work with host animals. Currently, the U.S. lacks a BSL-4 agricultural facility, requiring scientists to conduct experiments in Canada or Australia. The National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) was first proposed in the FY2006 budget request for DHS with an estimated cost of $451 million. Construction is set to be completed in FY2013, with funding allocated in FY2006 and FY2007. DHS issued a request for site proposals in 2006, with evaluation criteria including research capacity. DHS received 29 expressions of interest from 20 states and the District of Columbia for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) site selection. A subset of 18 sites in 11 states was released for further consideration. Conceptual design began in April 2006, with a projected total cost of $451 million. Construction is scheduled to begin in FY2010 and be completed in FY2013. Several USDA agencies have upgraded their facilities to respond to agroterrorism threats by expanding laboratory capacity and adding physical security. Programs include research on foreign animal diseases at Plum Island Animal Disease Center in New York and the Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Georgia. Three major USDA laboratories are consolidating operations in a new BSL-3 agriculture facility in Ames, Iowa, called the National Centers for Animal Health. This complex will be USDA's largest animal health center for research, diagnosis, and product evaluation. The USDA collaborates with other federal agencies on counterterrorism research and preparedness, including partnerships with the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases at Ft. Dietrick, Maryland. The Ft. Dietrick site provides access to high-level biosecurity laboratories, including a BSL-4 laboratory. USDA conducts research on various diseases, such as soybean rust, at Ft. Dietrick. Laboratory networks have been established to improve the diagnosis and detection of deliberate or accidental disease outbreaks, including the CDC-led Laboratory Response Network and the USDA-funded National Plant Diagnostic Network. The CDC-led Laboratory Response Network (LRN), USDA-funded National Plant Diagnostic Network (NPDN), and National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) are key networks for responding to biological threats. LRN consists of 140 labs for rapid response to terrorism and public health emergencies. NPDN, organized by USDA, is a network of university plant disease diagnostic facilities. The National Plant Diagnostic Network (NPDN) is led by five regional labs and one support lab, facilitating detection and response to pests and pathogens. The network allows for efficient exchange of plant disease information through common protocols. The National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) augments federal resources with state and university labs for better detection and response to animal health emergencies. The USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) is part of this network. The USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) meets epidemiological reporting standards and serves as the central reference laboratory. State and university labs assist with surveillance testing, outbreak response, and epidemiologic investigations. The Food Emergency Response Network (FERN) integrates state and federal laboratories to analyze food samples in threats or contamination incidents. The Extension Disaster Education Network (EDEN) links extension educators for disaster response. The Extension Disaster Education Network (EDEN) is sponsored by USDA to help extension agents prepare for disasters, collaborate with emergency management networks, provide educational programs, and train personnel. In April 2004, DHS awarded university research grants to the University of Minnesota and Texas A&M for agriculture centers of excellence. Texas A&M will focus on animal diseases, while the University of Minnesota will work on food protection and defense. The House Appropriations Committee addressed agroterrorism research in report language for the FY2004 homeland security appropriations bill. Texas A&M and Minnesota universities received funding for food contamination response and management. The Committee highlighted the need for more research on threats to field crops, farm animals, and food processing and distribution chains in the context of agro-terrorism vulnerabilities. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 emphasizes coordination of research efforts in this area. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 emphasizes coordination of research efforts between the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Agriculture (USDA) for agro/bioterrorism research. The Committee expects effective coordination to identify research gaps, develop priorities, and select entities with expertise in agriculture research for federal funding in agroterrorism preparedness. The report discusses federal funding for agroterrorism preparedness, including appropriations and user fees within USDA and DHS. Specific activities related to agroterrorism within their budgets are included in the President's annual budget request to Congress as mandated by the Homeland Security Act of 2002. Comprehensive details on agroterrorism funding are challenging to calculate while appropriations bills are pending. Agroterrorism funding details are difficult to calculate during appropriations debates in Congress. Legislative language rarely specifies amounts for agroterrorism, with analysts needing to wait for the President's budget for a comprehensive breakdown. USDA and DHS agencies and offices receive homeland security funding for agroterrorism-related activities. The DHS has two directorates receiving funding for agroterrorism, with dual-use programs like animal and plant health programs being expanded primarily due to agroterrorism concerns. This introduces discrepancies in budgeting and accounting, requiring updates based on the most recent data available. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) attributes budget authority to homeland security based on specific criteria related to agroterrorism. Activities may be considered homeland security spending if they address international pest outbreaks, comply with directives, or receive enhanced funds post-9/11. USDA previously allocated $45-60 million annually for similar purposes. USDA allocated $45-60 million annually for homeland security pre-9/11. Funding increased to $225-240 million in FY2002 with user fees. By FY2007, appropriations for agriculture-related homeland security activities in USDA and DHS grew to $818 million, a 48% increase over five years. Homeland security funding for agriculture has increased by 48% over five years, reaching $818 million in FY2007. Agriculture receives about 2.1% of the total non-defense budget authority for homeland security. Regular appropriations for agroterrorism preparedness have grown significantly since FY2002, with a three-fold increase in USDA funding from FY2002 to FY2003. However, there have been fluctuations in funding levels, with a 9% drop in FY2006 and an estimated 19% decrease in FY2007. The Administration's request for FY2008 includes a 54% increase to enhance preparedness efforts. In FY2007, homeland security funding for agriculture increased by 54% to enhance preparedness efforts. Supplemental appropriations acts in 2002 and 2003 provided additional funds to respond to agroterrorism vulnerabilities. User fees for agricultural border inspections grew significantly post-9/11, reaching $339 million in FY2005. In FY2007, homeland security funding for agriculture increased by 54% to enhance preparedness efforts. User fees fund about half of the total amount available for homeland security in agriculture. APHIS and CBP conduct most activities related to homeland security in agriculture, with APHIS expected to account for 51% of spending and CBP about 33%. Research agencies in USDA account for nearly 10% of funding. APHIS retains 39% of user fees collected each year and transfers the rest to DHS for its Customs and Border Patrol agency. In FY2007, homeland security funding for agriculture increased by 54% to enhance preparedness efforts. User fees fund about half of the total amount available for homeland security in agriculture. APHIS and CBP conduct most activities related to homeland security in agriculture, with APHIS expected to account for 51% of spending and CBP about 33%. Research agencies in USDA account for nearly 10% of funding. APHIS retains 39% of user fees collected each year and transfers the rest to DHS for its Customs and Border Patrol agency. Throughout the federal government, funding is categorized based on six mission areas defined in the National Strategy for Homeland Security. Border inspections are the largest homeland security activity for agriculture in FY2007, followed by defending against catastrophic threats and protecting critical infrastructure. Emergency preparedness and intelligence have received relatively less funding. The appropriations acts post-9/11 provided funds for homeland security related to agriculture and food. USDA received funding in the final installment of the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for FY2001. The FY2002 Agriculture Appropriations Act also allocated funds for homeland security. The FY2002 Emergency Supplemental Act (P.L. 107-117) provided $328 million to USDA for homeland security programs, preceding the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. The FY2002 Emergency Supplemental Act (P.L. 107-117) allocated $328 million to USDA for homeland security programs before the funds were transferred to DHS. Additional funding of $181 million was provided to USDA for homeland security activities in the FY2003 Omnibus Appropriations Act. In FY2003, Congress allocated $110 million to the Agricultural Research Service for modernization of facilities in Ames, Iowa. In FY2004, $292 million was provided for homeland security activities in USDA and $33 million in university grants for agriculture biosecurity from DHS. $80 million remained available to USDA from the Emergency Response Fund as of September 30, 2003. The USDA has been slow in obligating its ERF funds, with nearly $9 million available to the Secretary. The conferees urge prompt action to address security needs and advise on additional necessary funds. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act provided $465 million for homeland security activities in USDA, while the FY2006 Homeland Security Appropriations Act allocated $23 million for the National Bio and Agrodefense Facility. The conferees urge the DHS to collaborate with USDA and HHS on agroterrorism and bioterrorism, develop veterinary vaccines, and create an integrated agricultural response system. They also directed DHS to coordinate with USDA to address a reduction in agriculture inspections. The FY2006 Agriculture Appropriations Act provided $420 million for homeland security activities in USDA. The FY2007 Homeland Security Appropriations Act provided $420 million for homeland security activities in USDA, including funding for the National Bio and Agro-defense Facility. The FY2007 Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution generally funded USDA at FY2006 levels with minor adjustments. USDA's annual budget request highlighted programs in a \"Food and Agriculture Defense Initiative.\" The Food and Agriculture Defense Initiative, highlighted in USDA's budget requests, does not cover all homeland security programs for agriculture but focuses on priority programs during the appropriations process. In FY2006, the initiative received $247 million, while total USDA homeland security appropriations were $420 million. For FY2008, the initiative seeks $340 million, almost double the amount allocated in FY2007. The FY2008 increase in homeland security funding for agriculture is 54%, up from $340 million in FY2007 to $524 million. The initiative includes enhanced surveillance by APHIS of animal and plant health, as well as a new $16 million request for a poultry research laboratory in Georgia. These programs aim to improve the government's ability to quickly identify and characterize agroterrorist attacks through surveillance and monitoring, promoting data sharing and joint analysis among federal, state, and local levels. The Food Emergency Response Network (FERN) of laboratories enhances information sharing and diagnostic methods for contaminated foods. The National Veterinary Vaccine Bank and National Plant Disease Recovery System are part of the preparedness efforts. The FY2008 DHS budget does not specify allocations for agriculture, focusing on border inspection and science and technology activities. Only a few animal and plant pathogens pose significant economic threats due to their contagiousness, rapid spread potential, and international quarantine status. Livestock are more susceptible to agroterrorism than cultivated plants due to efforts to eliminate animal diseases from U.S. herds, leaving current herds unvaccinated. Infected livestock can transmit diseases, facilitating outbreaks, especially during transportation. Some animal diseases can be transmitted to humans, making them attractive to terrorists. Certain plant pathogens still exist in small areas of the U.S. and continue to infect. Plant pathogens in the U.S. infect limited areas of plants each year, with outbreaks and control efforts becoming routine. They are difficult to manipulate and require specific environmental conditions to spread. The Agricultural Bioterrorism Protection Act of 2002 created a list of animal pathogens of concern for agroterrorism. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) review select agent lists every two years. The select agent list for animal pathogens is based on the OIE lists of high-concern pathogens. It includes an APHIS-only list for animals and an overlap list selected by both APHIS and CDC for animals and humans. The OIE replaced its Lists A and B with a single list in 2004, classifying diseases equally for international trade. The OIE replaced its Lists A and B with a single list in 2004, classifying diseases equally for international trade. The new list includes former List A and List B diseases, setting criteria for disease inclusion and reporting requirements for member countries. Regulations for the select agent list for animals outline possession and use requirements. The select agent list for animals (9 CFR 121) outlines requirements for handling biological agents to prevent terrorism threats. APHIS and CDC identified 23 animal diseases, including OIE-listed diseases and emerging health risks like Akabane, Camel pox, and Menangle. The select agent list addresses additional terrorism risks not covered by the OIE list. The overlap list of 20 diseases and agents in 9 CFR 121.4 poses a risk to human and animal health. It includes ten OIE-listed diseases and regulates high-consequence pathogens. Some pathogens may not cause a disease but can lead to symptoms like food poisoning. Foot and mouth disease is a frequently mentioned disease in discussions on agroterrorism. Foot and mouth disease is a commonly discussed disease in agroterrorism due to its ease of spread and potential economic damage. Dr. Thomas McGinn described a simulation of an FMD attack before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, highlighting the rapid spread of the disease. In contrast, mad cow disease, caused by BSE, is considered a select agent despite being less likely for terrorists due to uncertainty in infection, delayed symptoms, and detection challenges. Emerging diseases like Nipah virus, Hendra virus, and H5N1 avian influenza are lethal as vaccines are elusive. The Agricultural Bioterrorism Protection Act of 2002 instructed APHIS and CDC to create a list of potential plant pathogens. The Federal government lists biological agents and toxins for plants in 7 CFR 331.3. The act requires regular review and revision of these lists. Plant pathogens listed in 7 CFR 331.3 by APHIS pose a severe threat to crops like potatoes, rice, corn, and citrus. These pathogens could be used by terrorists due to their potential for widespread crop losses and economic damage. Other plant pathogens not on the list, such as Karnal bunt, citrus canker, and soybean rust, could also be used against specific crops or regions. The U.S. animal and plant health safeguarding system aims to prevent the introduction and spread of exotic pests and diseases, including those intentionally used for agroterrorism. The system is being upgraded to address this threat, as past introductions were presumed to be unintentional. Various analysts and agencies have different approaches to outlining a response. The National Research Council outlines a three-pronged strategy for countering the threat of agroterrorism: Deterrence and prevention, Detection and response, Recovery and management. Government agencies and private businesses take the threat seriously, implementing biosecurity measures to protect their products. Agribusinesses have response plans and security measures in place to safeguard against foreign pests and diseases. International treaties and standards play a role in primary prevention and deterrence interventions. The National Research Council outlines a three-pronged strategy for countering the threat of agroterrorism, including deterrence and prevention, detection and response, and recovery and management. Government agencies and private businesses implement biosecurity measures to protect against foreign pests and diseases. International treaties and standards, bilateral and multilateral cooperative efforts, off-shore activities, port-of-entry inspections, quarantine, treatment, and post-import tracking of plants, animals, and their products are crucial in preventing biological attacks. Agricultural inspectors serve as the first line of defense, with smuggling interdiction efforts acting as deterrents. Continued oversight is necessary to determine which preparedness activities and threats require more attention. Off-shore activities for pre-clearance inspection of U.S. imports by APHIS are being enhanced to detect intentional threats. U.S. intelligence agencies monitor biological weapons that could target agriculture. Information sharing between USDA, DHS, and intelligence agencies is crucial to prevent attacks on the food production chain. Agricultural vulnerabilities include unmonitored access to crop fields and livestock by terrorists. Biosecurity measures are crucial to prevent the rapid spread of diseases in livestock operations and crop fields. This includes securing processing plants and shipping containers, as well as implementing preventive security measures against pathogens. Structural enclosures and cleaning practices help protect animals and crops from infectious agents. Biosecurity measures are essential for preventing disease spread in livestock and crops. The USDA promotes biosecurity practices for poultry through \"Biosecurity for the Birds.\" Livestock farmers are increasingly aware of the importance of these measures due to past disease outbreaks. Measures include restricting visitors and requiring protective clothing. These precautions help farms prepare against diseases and agroterrorism. The conferees emphasize the importance of emergency preparedness in agriculture and food sectors, particularly in detecting and responding to agro-terrorism. They expect coordination between the Department of Agriculture and Homeland Security to support interstate cooperation initiatives. States with joint preparedness efforts are of particular interest. Existing frameworks for detecting, identifying, reporting, tracking, and managing natural and accidental disease outbreaks need to be upgraded to combat agroterrorism. Responses are being developed based on specific pathogens and circumstances surrounding an attack. Decision-making processes involve factors like geographical spread, infestation rates, available personnel, public sentiment, and industry cooperation. Response procedures are outlined in manuals and plans for emergency programs in agriculture and livestock. The National Response Plan (NRP) discusses USDA's role in responding to terrorist attacks or disasters, emphasizing the importance of early detection in controlling outbreaks. Farmers, producers, veterinarians, and others play a key role in recognizing initial symptoms. However, reluctance to test crops or livestock due to economic concerns can hinder detection efforts. Training programs are being implemented to enhance awareness and improve rapid disease diagnostic capabilities. Lessons from past outbreaks, such as Foot-and-Mouth Disease in Europe, are informing response strategies. Lessons from disease outbreaks like the 2001 FMD outbreaks in Europe and the 2003-06 spread of H5N1 avian flu globally emphasize the importance of swift detection, diagnosis, and control to prevent economic and public health disasters. However, the declining number of veterinarians with experience in recognizing foreign animal diseases poses a challenge. Efforts are being made to increase training for foreign animal diseases and address the shortage of large animal veterinarians in the United States. Efforts are being made to increase training for foreign animal diseases and create registries of veterinarians with appropriate experience. The National Veterinary Medical Service Act provides loan repayment assistance for new veterinarians in exchange for practicing in areas with veterinary shortages and responding to emergency situations. DHS and USDA are improving coordination in response plans to secure the food supply, focusing on research funding, detection technology, surveillance, partnerships with private industry, and state and local response coordination. Public-private partnerships for detection include the food and agriculture Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC) and the food and agriculture Sector Coordinating Council (SCC). Numerous simulation exercises have been conducted. Numerous simulation exercises have been conducted to test response and coordination efforts in agroterrorism attacks. Examples include Silent Prairie in Washington, Silent Farmland in North Carolina, and Exercise High Stakes in Kansas. Experience gained from recent agricultural disease outbreaks has shown the need for costly measures like isolation, control, and eradication of epidemics. Depopulation and destruction of livestock and crops, indemnity payments to farmers, and quarantine areas are necessary in widespread disease outbreaks. During disease outbreaks, measures like mass eradication, indemnity payments to farmers, and suspension of international trade are necessary but face resistance. Public opposition to mass slaughter of animals and disposal of carcasses has been seen in past outbreaks. Scientific alternatives are needed for mass slaughter and carcass disposal to overcome judicial roadblocks. Efforts to eradicate citrus canker in Florida's residential neighborhoods faced challenges and delays in the courts. The disease spread widely due to hurricanes in 2005. The Secretary of Agriculture has authority to prevent foreign animal diseases from entering the country. Federal quarantines and restrictions are common for pest and disease outbreaks. States also have similar authorities for quarantine and import restrictions. The Secretary of Agriculture has authority to prevent foreign animal diseases from entering the country, including stopping imports and exports, quarantining infected livestock, and compensating owners for destroyed animals. Federal involvement follows state and local efforts if outbreaks spread across state lines or are inadequately managed. The Secretary of Agriculture has authority to prevent foreign animal diseases from entering the country, including stopping imports and exports, quarantining infected livestock, and compensating owners for destroyed animals. In the event of agroterrorism, local law enforcement may struggle to handle the situation, with primary responsibility falling on them rather than a public health response. Quarantines and roadblocks would require significant resources and coordination among different jurisdictions. HSPD-9 calls for a National Veterinary Stockpile to contain necessary supplies for animal health emergencies. A National Veterinary Stockpile (NVS) is proposed to contain animal vaccines and therapeutic products for rapid deployment in response to serious diseases affecting human health and the economy. Dr. James Roth suggests including vaccines for Rift Valley fever, Nipah virus, and avian influenza due to their contagious nature and potential harm to humans. Developing animal vaccines is cost-effective and can effectively protect both public health and animal agriculture from zoonotic diseases. The National Veterinary Stockpile (NVS) contains animal vaccines for rapid deployment in response to zoonotic diseases, protecting both public health and animal agriculture. The Administration requests $8 million for FY2007 for the Food and Agriculture Defense Initiative, focusing on activities like confinement, eradication, and long-term economic recovery. Communication and education programs are essential for informing growers affected by outbreaks and rebuilding public confidence in domestic and international markets. The social sciences and public health institutions play a role in responding to agroterrorism by informing growers and consumers about food safety. If eradication is not possible, resources would focus on acquiring resistant plant varieties and animal breeds suitable for the new environment through the National Plant Disease Recovery System (NPDRS) initiated by APHIS. The National Plant Disease Recovery System (NPDRS) utilizes resistant seed varieties to sustain crop production. Funding for NPDRS increased to $6 million in FY2007 as part of the Food and Agriculture Defense Initiative. Legislators can influence homeland security activities through the annual appropriations process. The USDA's budget request for FY2008 includes increased spending on agroterrorism preparedness programs, with the Food and Agriculture Defense Initiative seeking an appropriation of $340 million, nearly double the amount allocated in FY2007. The requested increase in homeland security funding for agriculture is 54%, totaling $524 million for FY2008. The DHS budget request for FY2008 does not specify individual line items for agriculture, focusing instead on ongoing border inspection and science and technology activities. The budget request for FY2008 includes increased spending on agroterrorism preparedness programs, with the Food and Agriculture Defense Initiative seeking an appropriation of $340 million. The DHS budget request for FY2008 does not specify individual line items for agriculture, focusing instead on ongoing border inspection and science and technology activities. Discussions on past appropriations for agroterrorism and bills introduced in Congress for preparedness and response to agroterrorism are also mentioned. Senator Akaka introduced two bills in the 109th Congress related to agroterrorism preparedness: S. 572 focused on amending the Homeland Security Act to enhance DHS responsibilities, while S. 573 (later incorporated into Project Bioshield II) aimed to fund state and local preparedness, public awareness programs, and biosecurity grants for farmers. S. 573/S. 975 also proposed creating agriculture liaison positions in DHS and HHS. Senator Specter introduced the Agroterrorism Prevention Act, S. 1532, in the 109th Congress, which aimed to fund public awareness, on-farm biosecurity guidelines, state and local preparedness assistance, and bolster response capacity. The bill also addressed criminal penalties for agroterrorism and coordination for agricultural issues in the intelligence community. Additionally, S. 3898 / H.R. 6086 focused on developing a list of diseases, conditions, and events that pose a threat to humans, animals, food production, and the water supply, with input from a commission of various experts. The Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act (P.L. 109-374) was enacted in 2006 to enhance penalties for terrorism against animal enterprises, including agroterrorism and eco-terrorism. The law specifies penalties for economic damage and personal injury related to threats, vandalism, property damage, and harassment. Bills from the 109th Congress aimed to provide Congressional instructions and budget authorizations for agroterrorism preparedness. The 109th Congress introduced bills to enhance penalties for agroterrorism and eco-terrorism. Senator Akaka's bills did not have the same directives as HSPD-9. Implementing a public law for agroterrorism preparedness would establish statutory parameters and enhance oversight. S. 573 from the 109th Congress was later incorporated into Title 27 of S. 975 (Project Bioshield II, 109th Congress). Title 27 of S. 975 (Project Bioshield II, 109th Congress) included provisions for state and local vulnerability assessments, emergency response plans, grants for agriculture health officials, awareness programs, and biosecurity measures for farm-level producers. S. 1532 (the Agroterrorism Prevention Act, 109th Congress) authorized funding for USDA and DHS-FEMA to assist states in developing response plans and promoting public awareness of biosecurity guidelines. The Homeland Security Food and Agriculture Act (S. 572, 109th Congress) aimed to enhance biosecurity measures at the farm level and establish a National Veterinary Stockpile and National Plant Disease Recovery System. It would have given the Department of Homeland Security additional responsibilities for agriculture security preparedness and disaster response, including advising federal, state, and local agriculture officials on agroterrorism preparedness. The Homeland Security Food and Agriculture Act (S. 572, 109th Congress) aimed to enhance biosecurity measures at the farm level and establish a National Veterinary Stockpile and National Plant Disease Recovery System. It would have given the Secretary of DHS authority to execute responsibilities mentioned in HSPD-7 and HSPD-9, and tasked DHS with coordinating much of an agroterrorism response by communicating, equipping, and facilitating emergency response providers. DHS would have become the lead responder by coordinating with other agencies and creating a grant program to help State and local agricultural specialists prepare for agroterrorism. The estimated cost of implementing S. 572 was $8 million in 2006 and $53 million over a five-year period. The Homeland Security Food and Agriculture Act aimed to enhance biosecurity measures at the farm level and establish a National Veterinary Stockpile and National Plant Disease Recovery System. It would have given the Secretary of DHS authority to execute responsibilities mentioned in HSPD-7 and HSPD-9, and tasked DHS with coordinating much of an agroterrorism response. Concerns over DHS dedication to agricultural functions arose after the transfer of agricultural border inspections and the Plum Island research facility. Improved coordination between federal agencies with various jurisdictions and encouraging agencies to seek consultation from stakeholders has been a recurring issue. The Agricultural Security Assistance Act proposed establishing an agriculture liaison position in the Department of Homeland Security. The Agroterrorism Prevention Act proposed establishing agriculture liaison positions in DHS and HHS, giving leadership roles for preparedness and response to DHS. It instructed multiple agencies to coordinate response plans, conduct vulnerability assessments, and enhance monitoring for agroterrorism. The bill also mentioned intelligence systems, tracking systems for agricultural products, laboratory networks, and border inspection training. Additionally, it directed DHS to assess the need for modernizing or replacing laboratories with agricultural capacity. Project Bioshield II (S. 975, 109th Congress) aimed to establish a working group involving USDA, DHS, HHS, and FDA to enhance agroterrorism preparedness. Section 2708 of S. 975 would require DHS to collaborate with USDA and other intelligence agencies to improve agricultural border inspections. Legislation like S. 3898/H.R. 6086 (National Reportable Conditions Act, 109th Congress) would create a coordinated notification system for specific diseases and threats to human and animal health, food, and water safety. Some Members and industry groups were concerned that DHS would prioritize other homeland security issues over agricultural border inspections after inspectors were transferred from USDA to DHS. Appropriators directed DHS to improve coordination with USDA and state governments, target agricultural inspections, adjust to new threats, and enhance training. The conferees expressed concerns about the Department's efforts to improve agricultural targeting. The Department is directed to improve coordination with USDA and state governments, target agricultural inspections, adjust to new threats, and enhance training. The Secretary of Homeland Security must submit a report on activities to improve agricultural inspections by February 8, 2007. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to coordinate with the Secretary of Agriculture and State and local governments in carrying out activities related to agricultural inspections. Concerns have been raised about the transfer of agricultural functions to DHS and the potential shift in focus away from agriculture. Conferees are requesting a GAO study to ensure the protection of U.S. agriculture interests and proper allocation of funds. The conferees request a report from the Government Accountability Office on the coordination between USDA and DHS in protecting the U.S. agriculture sector, including the effectiveness of inspection activities. This request stemmed from concerns raised in a previous GAO study about inter-agency coordination and inspection performance. Additionally, legislative bills aimed to review State and local laws related to agroterrorism for potential impact on response efforts. S. 1532 (109th Congress) aimed to criminalize agroterrorism acts by defining them in Title 18 of the U.S. Code and prescribing penalties. The Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act (P.L. 109-374) enhanced the Department of Justice's authority to prosecute individuals committing terrorism against animal enterprises, including acts commonly considered \"eco-terrorism.\""
