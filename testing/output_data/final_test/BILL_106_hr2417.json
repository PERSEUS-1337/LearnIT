    "content": "The \"Educational Technology Utilization Extension Assistance Act\" aims to enhance the use of educational technologies in K-12 education by establishing an extension service at colleges and universities. The Congress recognizes the effectiveness of extension services like the Manufacturing Extension Partnership and the Agricultural Extension Service in integrating new technologies for small to medium-sized manufacturers and the agricultural community. Undergraduate institutions can tailor educational technology programs to meet local needs, with support from non-profit organizations and government agencies. Additionally, institutions have been integrating educational technologies into their curricula for the past 20 years with the help of the National Science Foundation. Many elementary and secondary school systems lack information on integrating technology into the curriculum. Federal and State programs focus on acquiring technology rather than utilizing it effectively in the classroom. The full potential of educational technology has not been realized, hindering the workforce's ability to integrate rapid technological changes. Only 1 in 5 teachers feel well-prepared for modern classrooms, with workshops being the most common form of professional development. Only 19% of teachers have been formally mentored, with 70% finding it helpful for their teaching. SEC. 4. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED. The Director of the National Science Foundation, along with other agencies, will assist in establishing and supporting regional centers for educational technologies. These centers aim to enhance the use of technology in K-12 education by providing guidance to school administrators and teachers. The establishment of regional centers for educational technologies aims to support the adoption and utilization of new educational technologies in K-12 education. These centers will involve collaboration with various stakeholders and focus on disseminating technical information and utilizing expertise from Federal agencies and laboratories. The ETU Center focuses on transferring research findings and expertise to local school authorities, training teachers in integrating educational technology, advising on technology acquisition and support, and providing support services as needed. The ETU Center advises teachers, administrators, and school board members on skill set standards used by private industry. The Director of the National Science Foundation will publish proposed rules for establishing ETU Centers, including program description, applicant procedures, criteria for qualified applicants, and selection criteria for recipients. The Director of the National Science Foundation will publish final rules for the program after a 30-day comment period. Any undergraduate institution, consortia, non-profit organizations may apply for financial support under this section by providing assurances to contribute 50% or more of the proposed Center's capital and operating costs. The Director of the National Science Foundation, in conjunction with other agencies, will review applications for financial support for proposed Centers based on merit, service quality, and geographical diversity. The Director of the National Science Foundation, in collaboration with other agencies, will evaluate ETU Centers based on geographical diversity, service quality, funding sources, and in-kind commitments. Evaluation will be conducted in the third year of operation by an appointed panel, and funding renewal is contingent on a positive evaluation. The term \"institution of higher education\" in this Act refers to the definition provided in the Higher Education Act of 1965."
