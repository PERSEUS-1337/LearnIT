    "content": "The Act titled \"Every Prescription Conveyed Securely Act\" requires e-prescribing for coverage of covered Part D controlled substances. The Act \"Every Prescription Conveyed Securely Act\" mandates e-prescribing for covered Part D controlled substances, requiring electronic transmission of prescriptions for schedule II-V controlled substances by healthcare practitioners. Exceptions may be specified by the Secretary in certain circumstances. The Secretary may waive the e-prescribing requirement for covered Part D drugs in specific circumstances, such as when the prescriber and dispenser are the same entity, when electronic transmission is not possible due to technical constraints, or when a practitioner has a waiver from the Secretary for a limited period. The Secretary may waive the electronic prescribing requirement for up to one year due to economic hardship, technological limitations, or other exceptional circumstances demonstrated by the practitioner. The practitioner may waive electronic prescription requirements if obtaining substances in a timely manner is impractical and would adversely impact the individual's medical condition. This includes non-patient specific prescriptions in response to a public health emergency. The practitioner may issue non-patient specific prescriptions in certain circumstances, such as a public health emergency or when prescribing a drug under a research protocol. Additionally, prescriptions may be issued for drugs that require specific elements not achievable through electronic prescribing, like drugs with risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. The practitioner may issue non-patient specific prescriptions in certain circumstances, such as during a public health emergency or when prescribing a drug under a research protocol. Prescriptions may also be issued for individuals receiving hospice care or residing in long-term care facilities, where frequently abused drugs are dispensed through a contract with a single pharmacy. This does not require sponsors of prescription drug plans, MA organizations, or pharmacists to dispense the medication. The paragraph discusses the ability of a pharmacist to verify a practitioner's waiver for a prescription, ensuring compliance with laws and regulations for dispensing covered part D drugs. It also highlights the individual's right to choose a specific pharmacy for their medication. The amendment allows a pharmacy to dispense covered part D drugs in compliance with regulations. The Secretary has enforcement authority and can impose penalties for noncompliance. Effective January 1, 2020, the amendment applies to drug coverage for prescriptions."
