It can only be accessed when sovereign immunity is waived and specific conditions are met. The Fund has evolved over time but cannot replace a specific appropriation. It has been a source of controversy, especially during budget uncertainties in the 1990s. The Judgment Fund, established in 1956 by Congress, pays judgments against the U.S. when sovereign immunity is waived. The Fund's history, administration, and access conditions are outlined, including instances of tribal judgment fund involvement. Sovereign immunity protects the government from lawsuits unless waived, and the U.S. has waived immunity in specific circumstances through constitutional provisions or statutory authority. The United States can be sued under certain statutes that waive sovereign immunity, such as the Federal Tort Claims Act. Other examples include the Tucker Act, Military Personnel and Civilian Employees Claims Act, and Federal Employees Compensation Act. These statutes have limiting principles and require Congress to provide funds for successful judgments. The Judgment Fund was created to streamline payment for these judgments without specific appropriations. The Judgment Fund was enacted to reduce the need for specific appropriations for claims against the United States. Congress established committees to settle claims since the early Republic, leading to the creation of the Treasury Department in 1789 to manage payments. The Treasury Bill of 1789 established detailed procedures for settling claims against the government, giving Congress control over monetary policy but little ministerial responsibility. Claims could be approved by the Auditor and Comptroller, with Congress making specific appropriations for validated claims. This led to many claims waiting for Congress to allocate funds, causing delays by 1855. By 1855, Congress was still dedicating resources to passing appropriations to satisfy claims against the United States. To reduce its workload, Congress established the Court of Claims, initially serving in an advisory capacity. At President Lincoln's urging, the Court of Claims was empowered to issue binding decisions, but the Treasury Department could decline enforcement. After Congress repealed this authority, the Supreme Court could hear appeals from the Court of Claims, with decisions carrying finality and enforcement on par with other Article III courts. In 1921, Congress transferred claims settlement duties from the Treasury Department to the General Accounting Office (GAO) to tighten control over payments. GAO sought appropriations from Congress to strengthen expenditure controls, allowing Congress to regain structural control. However, the process of appropriating funds for each claim proved burdensome, leading to the passing of the Judgment Fund enabling statute in 1956. The Judgment Fund was established as a permanent appropriation to pay all judgments against the United States not covered by specific appropriations. It aimed to reduce the time lapse between judgments and payment to minimize post-judgment interest. The Fund was initially available for claims under $100,000 in federal courts, covering over 98% of claims and streamlining the payment process. Congress believed a permanent appropriation would simplify payment procedures, provide uniform interest computation, and reduce total interest paid by the government. The Senate report highlighted limitations in the bill regarding payments from the Judgment Fund, emphasizing audit, review, and finality requirements. The administration of payments from the Fund underwent significant changes in the latter part of the 20th century. Congress authorized payments from the Fund for settlements negotiated by the Department of Justice in 1961, and by the mid-1970s, the payment ceiling was raised to cover larger settlements and judgments. In 1996, certification of payments from the Fund was transferred from GAO to the Financial Management Service. The Judgment Fund is a permanent appropriation that allows for unlimited funds to be used for certain judgments against the United States. Recent bills aim to increase transparency and accountability in the use of the Fund, with Congress showing interest in the amount of money spent from it. The Financial Management Service administers the Fund and published a fiscal report in 2011 detailing payments made from it. The Judgment Fund is a permanent appropriation used for paying certain judgments against the United States when not covered by specific appropriations. Judgments must be final and settlements comprehensive, agreed upon by the Department of Justice. The Fund can also cover costs to the prevailing party in litigation as outlined in 28 U.S.C. \u00a71920. Access to the Fund is limited to money judgments or settlements involving monetary awards. The Judgment Fund can be used to pay certain judgments against the United States, but not for costs and fees related to implementing fair employment practices. Payments from the Fund must come from final judgments, typically when the time for appeal has expired. However, an \"irreducible minimum amount\" can be paid out before a final judgment. For example, in Trout v. Garrett, interim attorneys' fees in a Title VII employment discrimination action against the government were paid from the Judgment Fund. The Judgment Fund statute serves as a mechanism for payment against the government. It cannot be used if the award is already provided for by appropriation or statute. Courts require programmatic specificity in appropriations to preclude payment from the Judgment Fund, regardless of funding levels. If funds have been spent elsewhere, agencies must seek additional appropriations from Congress. The Judgment Fund is limited to litigative awards, distinguishable from administrative awards, and requires additional appropriation from Congress if needed. Permissible awards include principal amounts, attorneys' fees, costs, and interest as per judgment or settlement terms negotiated by the Department of Justice. The Judgment Fund is restricted to litigative awards and requires additional appropriation from Congress if necessary. There are nearly 100 statutes affecting payment from the Fund, with 17 specifically prohibiting payment. For instance, administrative awards under $2,500 from the Federal Tort Claims Act cannot be paid from the Fund. Tax judgments, judgments against the Postal Service, and government corporations like the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation are also not payable from the Judgment Fund. Since 1996, the Judgment Fund has been administered by the Financial Management Service in the Treasury Department. Once a party has received a final court judgment or negotiated settlement, FMS requires the responsible agency to submit a request for certification of payment from the Fund. FMS considers the proposed payment in light of the rules, determining whether payment out of the Fund is proper or an obligation chargeable to agency funds. FMS is the primary enforcer for the limits on the Judgment Fund. The Financial Management Service (FMS) administers the Judgment Fund and determines the propriety of payment from the Fund. FMS calculates interest, offsets debts owed to the United States, and makes payments directly to the plaintiff. The agency's involvement ends after payment, but if FMS pays the wrong party, the U.S. obligation remains. The Financial Management Service (FMS) administers the Judgment Fund and determines payment propriety. If FMS refuses payment, the submitting agency can resubmit claims. Rejections are often due to form errors or missing documents. Claims are denied if FMS deems payment improper, usually because of specific appropriations or legal thresholds. Federal courts may decide on costs for the prevailing party, limited to court fees, transcripts, and other specified expenses. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920, the clerk of the court may award costs for court fees, transcripts, fees related to witnesses, materials for presentation in the case, compensation for court-appointed experts, and docket fees. To obtain costs for payment from the Judgment Fund, the submitting agency must include a bill of costs or the court's order with the request. Courts are limited to awarding costs for specific items listed in \u00a71920 and exemptions in statutory authority. The U.S. legal system follows the \"American Rule,\" where each party is responsible for their own legal fees unless authorized by statute or contract. The American Rule states that each party is responsible for their own legal fees unless authorized by statute or contract. Exceptions include the common benefit rule, allowing federal courts to award attorneys' fees when a party prevails in a suit benefiting a large class of people, and the bad faith exception, allowing fees to be awarded when the opponent acted vexatiously. Specific statutory exemptions, called fee-shifting provisions, make the federal government responsible for attorneys' fees in various suits, aiming to equalize parties in environmental and consumer protection litigation. Some statutes limit attorneys' fees, such as the Federal Tort Claims Act and the Freedom of Information Act. Payment of attorneys' fees in litigation cases is typically authorized from the Judgment Fund unless specified otherwise by law. Parties cannot change the payment source through settlement agreements. The Judgment Fund covers principal awards and, in some cases, post-judgment interest. However, recovering interest in suits against the government requires Congress to waive sovereign immunity and specifically allow for interest on damages. Prejudgment interest is factored into damages calculations, while post-judgment interest is treated separately. Historically, courts have treated post-judgment interest as a separate element of damages unrelated to the substantive claim, and therefore awarded only upon agreement of the parties. The United States is immune from suit absent its consent, especially in awards against the government. Payment of interest from the Judgment Fund is authorized in certain instances, such as when a district court award is awaiting appeal by the government. Library of Congress v. Shaw identified two exceptions to the no-interest rule, based on a constitutional waiver of sovereign immunity. The Fifth Amendment allows for just compensation when private property is taken for public use. Interest may be allowed in two constitutional exceptions: when a takings claim is involved, or in the commercial venture exception where a government entity is engaged in a primarily commercial function. Interest may be payable from the Judgment Fund if a plaintiff prevails under a statute that authorizes payment of interest. Additionally, interest may be paid during the time between a judgment and when the government decides not to appeal, if a transcript of judgment is filed with the Treasury Department. The Judgment Fund enables agencies to access funds for payments, but certain statutes restrict this access. The Equal Access to Justice Act allows for attorneys' fees for prevailing parties against the government, with specific size requirements for eligibility. The Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) allows for attorneys' fees for prevailing parties against the government, with specific size requirements. Agencies have disputed whether payments under EAJA should come from their appropriations or the Judgment Fund. In Cienega Gardens v. United States, the Federal Circuit ordered an award for the plaintiffs in a case involving HUD's low-income housing program. HUD argued that they should not be liable because the Department of Justice did not seek review on a questionable ruling. The Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) allows for attorneys' fees for prevailing parties against the government. In a case involving HUD's low-income housing program, the Federal Circuit ordered an award for the plaintiffs. HUD argued that they should not be liable due to a questionable ruling. The Treasury Department and Justice Department disagreed on whether payment should come from the agency's appropriations or the Judgment Fund. The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel concluded that the Judgment Fund could not pay the attorneys' fees award because HUD was the agency over which the party prevailed. The Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) allows for attorneys' fees for prevailing parties against the government. The Federal Circuit ordered an award for plaintiffs in a case involving HUD's low-income housing program. The Judgment Fund cannot pay EAJA claims, and agencies must reimburse the fund from their own appropriations or seek additional funding from Congress. The Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (CDA) also requires agencies to reimburse the Judgment Fund for payment of claims related to contract disputes. The No FEAR Act covers whistleblower and employment discrimination suits for federal employees, requiring agencies to reimburse the Judgment Fund within a reasonable time. GAO's 2008 report found that agencies have been consistent in reimbursing the Fund for No FEAR payments, but less so for CDA payments, which are typically larger. The GAO recommended that the FMS improve transparency in agency payments to the Judgment Fund and report to Congress regularly. A separate system was created for tribes under Title XXV, with a trust administered by the Interior Secretary for distributing funds from judgments. The Interior Department holds funds in trust until Congress appropriates them to the tribes, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs submits a plan to Congress for dividing funds among multiple tribes. The Judgment Fund has undergone changes over its history, with recent legislative proposals aiming to alter payments and processes. The Judgment Fund Transparency Act of 2013 in the 113th Congress seeks to require transparency by posting claimant, agency, and payment information on a public website within 30 days of payment, unless prohibited by law or court order. The 2011 Fiscal Report by FMS, however, did not include fact summaries as recommended by the House Appropriations Committee. The committee instructed FMS to report online each claim paid from the Judgment Fund in the given fiscal year. Legislation in the 112th Congress aimed to require transparency in Judgment Fund payments, including reporting all payments since 2003 and future payments from EAJA. Legislation in the 110th and 111th Congress proposed amending the No FEAR Act to reimburse the Judgment Fund for discrimination claims within two years. The No FEAR Act aims to encourage timely resolution of discrimination claims, with payments made from the Judgment Fund. Legislation in previous Congresses sought to require agencies to reimburse the Fund within a specified period, but these bills did not progress."
