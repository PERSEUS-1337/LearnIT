    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Protection from Sexual Predators Act of 1997\". Congress finds that rape and sexual assaults are serious threats to communities in America, with sexual offenders being likely to repeat their crimes even after serving time in prison. The average rape sentence is 10\\1/2\\ years, with offenders serving only half of that time. Repeat sexual offenders often strike in multiple states, and Federal prosecution is seen as a necessary tool to protect victimized communities. States should consider the high recidivism rate of sexual offenders when making decisions on plea bargaining and parole. They should also review and potentially replace ineffective treatment and parole supervision programs for sexual offenders. Federal jurisdiction over rape and sexual assault cases is addressed in Section 3. Section 2241 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to include a provision for the punishment of sexual predators. Whoever violates this section under specific circumstances shall be imprisoned for life. The amended section includes provisions for punishing sexual predators with life imprisonment if they have prior convictions for similar offenses. The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 is amended to require states to have laws allowing life imprisonment without parole for repeat offenders of certain violent crimes. SEC. 5. STUDY OF PERSISTENT SEXUAL PREDATORS. The National Institute of Justice will conduct a study on persistent sexual predators, reporting to Congress and the President within a year. The report will include a synthesis of current research on such offenders, their characteristics, recidivism rates, treatment effectiveness, responses to treatment, deterrence, and the potential for early intervention. Additionally, an agenda for future research in this area will be provided."
