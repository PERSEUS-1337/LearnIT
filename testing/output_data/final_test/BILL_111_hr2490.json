The installment payment schedule for eligible small businesses allows for payments to be made in 4 equal installments. An additional deferral of tax can be granted if an eligible small business meets the employment increase requirement for the second taxable year following the election. The employment increase requirement for eligible small businesses involves having a greater average number of employees in the last calendar quarter compared to before the establishment of the GROW Account.

Funds can only be used as security for a loan to the business or for repayment, and the grantor is taxed as the owner.\" The GROW Account owner is subject to tax according to specific regulations. Payments to the account are deemed made on the last day of the taxable year if made within 3 1/2 months after the year ends. Definitions related to salary maintenance of called-up reservists are also provided. The text chunk discusses the eligibility criteria for employees who are members of the Ready Reserve or National Guard and are called up for qualified active duty. The terms National Guard, Ready Reserve, and qualified active duty are defined in accordance with specific sections of the United States Code. Employees who are members of the Ready Reserve or National Guard called up for qualified active duty are entitled to reemployment rights, benefits, and a leave of absence under specific sections of the United States Code. This includes hospitalization incident to such active duty. The active duty wage differential for Ready Reserve/National Guard employees on qualified active duty is calculated based on their daily wage differential multiplied by the number of days on active duty. The daily wage differential is the excess of the employee's average daily compensation over the period. The average daily employer-provided compensation for an employee on qualified active duty is calculated based on the average daily compensation paid by the employer for the 1-year period before the start of active duty, adjusted for cost-of-living and other increases. The term 'compensation' refers to remuneration for employment deductible under section 162(a)(1). Average daily military pay for Ready Reserve/National Guard employees is based on their military pay and allowances during qualified active duty. The term 'military pay' refers to pay defined in section 101(21) of title 37, United States Code, and 'allowances' refer to allowances payable to members of the Armed Forces under chapter 7 of the same title.

The section amends the priority of lenders regarding loans secured by GROW accounts with banks, providing protection for loans made without knowledge of existing liens. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subchapter B of chapter 62 of the Code. The amendments made by this section extend the time for tax payment for certain small businesses. A study will be conducted by the Comptroller General to evaluate the impact of the GROW America's Small Businesses Act of 2009 on businesses' capital funding needs. The report is due by March 31, 2011. The Comptroller General will submit a report to the House of Representatives and the Senate Committee on Finance with recommendations for legislative or administrative changes based on a study evaluating the impact of the GROW America's Small Businesses Act of 2009 on businesses' capital funding needs."
