    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Law Enforcement and Correctional Officers Employment Registration Act of 1994\". The Congress recognizes the importance of ethical law enforcement professionals in addressing violent crime and the need to prevent officers with a history of misconduct from seeking employment in other jurisdictions. A national clearinghouse of officer employment histories is needed to conduct thorough background checks on officer applicants and ensure only honest, ethical officers are hired. Federal legislation should require registration of employment termination data for law enforcement and correctional officers to prevent misconduct. Registration of employment data for law enforcement and correctional officers is mandated under an amendment to the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 amendment requires the designation of state peace officer standards boards to submit lists of law enforcement and correctional officers employed since January 1, 1994, to the Attorney General of the United States. Additionally, all federal executive branch entities employing such personnel must also submit lists of officers hired after the same date. The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 amendment mandates state peace officer standards boards and federal executive branch entities to submit lists of law enforcement and correctional officers hired after January 1, 1994, to the Attorney General of the United States. The list should include officers' names, dates of birth, social security numbers, appointment dates, agency information, and service end dates. The responsible agency must notify the designated officer within 90 days of an officer's employment, appointment, or separation. The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 amendment requires state peace officer standards boards and federal entities to report employment data of law enforcement and correctional officers to the Attorney General of the United States. This includes officers' details and certification status. The term 'law enforcement officer' refers to individuals appointed to conserve peace, make arrests, or possess peace officer authority. The term 'correctional officer' refers to individuals appointed to guard or supervise prisoners in various facilities. Certification revoked for cause means the cancellation or revocation of an individual's law enforcement certification. The text discusses the cancellation or revocation of a law enforcement or correctional officer's professional license by a state peace officer standards board after due process. It defines who qualifies as a law enforcement or correctional officer and excludes citizens assisting officers unless deputized for over 30 days. American Indian tribe or band and federal agencies must require applicants for law enforcement or correctional officer positions to disclose prior service and submit a written authorization for release of information. The Attorney General will release collected data to prospective employers upon receiving the authorization within 30 days. Each state, territory, political subdivision, the District of Columbia, Native American Indian tribes, and federal agencies employing law enforcement officers must notify the Attorney General within 30 days of appointing or employing an officer. The Attorney General will issue regulations for an employment data clearinghouse. Agencies submitting data are presumed to act in good faith and are immune from civil liability unless proven otherwise. The presumption of good faith for agencies submitting data is rebutted if the data was knowingly false or submitted with malicious intent to mislead. SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act will be effective on October 1, 1994. Lists required under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 must be submitted within 180 days of enactment. States, territories, tribes, federal agencies employing law enforcement officers must comply with the Act within 180 days. Grants may be authorized to assist in compliance. SEC. 5. REPORTS.\n\nThe Attorney General must submit a report to Congress within 2 years of this Act's enactment, evaluating compliance with the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. The report will list entities that have failed to comply with the requirements. Subsequent reports will be submitted as deemed appropriate by the Attorney General."
