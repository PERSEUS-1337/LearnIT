    "content": "The \"Royalty Relief for American Consumers Act of 2010\" allows for amendments to leases in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico to incorporate price thresholds for royalty suspension provisions. These amendments will be effective from October 1, 2010, with existing lease provisions remaining until September 30, 2010. Eligibility for new leases and the transfer of leases are also addressed, along with conservation of resources fees. The Secretary cannot issue new leases for oil or gas production in the Gulf of Mexico under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to certain individuals unless they renegotiate existing leases to include specified price thresholds or pay all due fees established by the Secretary. The Secretary cannot issue new leases for oil or gas production in the Gulf of Mexico under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to certain individuals unless they renegotiate existing leases to include specified price thresholds or pay all due fees established by the Secretary. A person described is a lessee that holds a covered lease on the date of issuance of the new lease or transferred the covered lease to another person or entity before the enactment of this Act. The Secretary may implement separate agreements with multiple lessees of a covered lease to modify payment responsibilities, including price thresholds. The Secretary of the Interior will establish conservation of resources fees for producing Federal oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico within 60 days of the enactment of the Act. These fees will apply to agreements modifying payment responsibilities and price thresholds for multiple lessees. The Secretary of the Interior will establish a conservation of resources fee for nonproducing Federal oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico. The fee for producing leases will be set at $9 per barrel for oil and $1.25 per million Btu for gas, based on price thresholds. The fee for nonproducing Federal oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico will be $3.75 per acre per year in 2005 dollars, effective on or after October 1, 2010. Amounts received as fees will be treated as offsetting receipts. Lessees or individuals with a direct or indirect interest in a lease cannot transfer or sell their rights. To be eligible to transfer any covered lease for oil or gas production in the Gulf of Mexico, the lessee must renegotiate and modify the terms of all leases to include royalty relief limitations based on market prices. The Shelf Lands Act outlines requirements for lessees of covered leases for oil or gas production in the Gulf of Mexico to pay fees established by the Secretary or enter into agreements to pay such fees. A covered lease is one issued by the Department of the Interior under specific legislation. The Royalty Relief Act (43 U.S.C. 1337 note; Public Law 104-58) exempts lessees from royalty relief limitations based on market price. A lessee includes any person or entity related to the lessee. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior."
