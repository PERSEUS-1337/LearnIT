    "content": "Banks face default and funding risks due to loans made to borrowers who may not repay, and funding longer-term assets with shorter-term borrowings. Profits come from the spread between long-term customer loan rates and shorter-term borrowing rates. Banking firms manage these risks to avoid financial distress. Banks may face financial distress if borrowers default on loans, leading to an inability to repay shorter-term loan obligations. This could force banks to sell longer-term assets for cash to avoid defaulting on existing borrowing obligations. Sudden increases in shorter-term borrowing rates relative to longer-term rates can impact cash flows. Lenders also encounter systemic risk, defined as an increase in correlation among individual default and funding risks. Systemic risk arises from an increase in correlation among individual default and funding risks, often triggered by a sudden loss of market confidence following a liquidity disruption or asset price decline. This can lead to widespread panic, with creditors and investors rushing to recover their principal amid uncertainty about loan repayments or asset values. Financial panics historically stem from reliance on future asset values to secure loans, which can result in market collapses. If the market values of assets used to secure loans suddenly decline, it can lead to a rise in loan defaults, financial market runs, and hinder lending activity, causing severe recessions. Insured depository institutions in the U.S. must comply with safety and soundness regulations, including maintaining sufficient capital reserves to buffer against credit, liquidity, and systemic-risk events. A bank's capital is the difference between its assets and liabilities, and having enough capital reduces the risk of asset defaults leading to repayment failures. A capital buffer protects bank creditors from loan defaults and unfavorable macroeconomic events. Banks must maintain capital above a minimum threshold to be considered solvent and face closure if undercapitalized. Regulators implement prudential requirements to ensure capital reserves grow with assets and risks. The Basel Committee's Basel I Accord established safety and soundness standards for international banks. Basel I aimed to establish consistent safety and soundness standards for banking institutions globally to prevent competitive disadvantages. The Basel Capital Accord, implemented in 1992, set capital reserve requirements for financial institutions. U.S. federal banking regulators typically align with Basel Accords, although the BCBS lacks authority to enforce specific standards on member governments. The Basel Capital Accords, implemented in 1992, set safety and soundness regulatory framework for banking institutions in the United States. Tier 1 capital includes common shareholders' equity, disclosed reserves, retained earnings, and preferred stock. Banks must maintain minimum capital-asset ratios to reduce vulnerability to loan defaults. Tier 2 capital includes allowances for loan losses. Loan loss provisioning increases ALLL for anticipated loan losses. Loan loss provisioning involves adjusting the ALLL to account for increased loan default risks, with excess reserves not counted as Tier 2 capital. Stress testing is conducted to assess a bank's ability to withstand severe economic downturns. Federal regulators mandate U.S. banks to analyze the impact of adverse economic conditions on their financial viability. Basel II and Basel III were developed in response to perceived shortcomings in the asset risk weighting system. Basel II was initially applied to the 19 largest banking institutions in the United States. Basel III was designed to address issues such as excessive leverage, inadequate capital, and insufficient liquidity buffers. Pillar 1 of Basel III requires more and higher quality capital to be held by banks. Basel III, established in response to shortcomings in asset risk weighting, requires banks to comply with enhanced requirements by 2019. The Regulatory Capital Rule, implementing Basel III recommendations, also addresses provisions from the Dodd-Frank Act on capital reserve requirements for banks. Regulatory references to credit ratings are required to be removed under Section 939 of the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 939 of the Dodd-Frank Act mandates the removal of regulatory references to credit ratings to address concerns about their role in the housing bubble. Federal agencies reviewed and modified regulations to eliminate reliance on credit ratings for assessing security or money market instruments. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency amended the definition of investment grade to include due diligence by banks in addition to credit ratings. The Federal Reserve announced that banks with $10 billion or less in assets must adopt the OCC regulatory definition of an investment grade security. The Collins Amendment of the Dodd-Frank Act aims to establish consistent capital requirements for all insured depository institutions and holding companies. Capital requirements for bank holding companies must be at least as stringent as those for their depository subsidiaries, and cannot be lower than pre-Dodd-Frank Act levels. Only features of Basel I and Basel II that were in effect before July 2010 are considered. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, established regulatory ratios based on Basel I and Basel II features implemented in the United States. Regulators can set higher ratio requirements but not lower than those in effect for insured depositories at that time. Bank holding companies with assets under $1 billion are exempt. The Collins Amendment excludes certain securities from eligible Tier 1 capital for large banks and nonbanks. Trust preferred securities (TruPS) are considered hybrid instruments resembling debt obligations. The Collins Amendment excluded Trust Preferred Securities (TruPS) from Tier 1 capital requirements for bank holding companies with $15 billion or more in assets. Companies with less than $15 billion had a longer phase-out period starting in 2013. The Regulatory Capital Rule adopted some BCBS recommendations but not all, and included safety and soundness provisions required by Dodd-Frank. The Regulatory Capital Rule incorporates Basel III and Dodd-Frank requirements, providing guidance on risk-weighting methodology and capital-ratio levels. It applies to all US banks and bank holding companies, with exceptions for smaller institutions. Compliance with revised risk weights is mandatory for both parent companies and subsidiaries. The Regulatory Capital Rule, which incorporates Basel III and Dodd-Frank requirements, applies to all US banks and bank holding companies. However, it does not apply to all top-tier savings and loan holding companies engaged in insurance underwriting or non-financial activities. Advanced approaches banks with over $250 billion in assets face more stringent requirements, including a countercyclical capital buffer and a supplementary leverage ratio. Dodd-Frank Title 1 imposes enhanced safety and soundness requirements on banks with over $50 billion in assets and systemically important financial institutions designated by the FSOC. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) identifies systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) that could threaten financial stability. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) designate global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). Advanced approaches banks designated as SIFIs and G-SIBs must meet additional capital requirements. The Federal Reserve's Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee (LISCC) oversees large banking institutions. Changes to eligible capital and new risk-weighting requirements are outlined in the Regulatory Capital Rule. Stress testing requirements have also increased for all U.S. banks. The increase in stress testing requirements for U.S. banks will lead to higher levels of required capital. Basel III's Pillar I includes a minimum common equity tier 1 capital (CET1) ratio requirement to improve regulatory capital quality. The Tier 1 capital must mainly consist of common equity and retained earnings. The financial crisis showed that retained earnings are crucial for cushioning against credit losses. The definitions of Tier 1 capital ratio and CET1 ratio are now more defined. The final rule requires most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) to be included in Tier 1 regulatory capital, including mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets, and holdings in other financial institutions. These assets may not exceed 15% of a bank's Tier 1 capital to limit dilution of common tangible equity. AOCI captures unrealized gains or losses on assets available for sale, providing a more accurate assessment of a bank's loss absorption capacity. The inclusion of unrealized gains and losses in Tier 1 capital could add volatility to bank capital ratios due to interest rate fluctuations. This may make it challenging for small banks to gauge lending amounts during periods of uncertainty. Federal banking regulators allowed banks a one-time opportunity to address this issue. The Basel III final rule allows banks to opt out of the AOCI requirement. Capitalization levels are determined through a two-step process involving risk weights and capital ratio charges. For example, a $100,000 mortgage loan with a 50% risk weight would result in a $50,000 risk-weighted asset. The bank needs to hold total risk-based capital of $4,000 (8% of $50,000) to be adequately capitalized and $5,000 (10% of $50,000) to be well-capitalized. All bank assets are risk-weighted before applying capital charges, with risk weights assigned based on asset types and borrower underwriting requirements. Federal regulators require all banks to follow the same risk-weighting guidelines. After risk-weighting bank assets, capital requirements are determined based on a minimum percentage of risk-weighted assets. Regulators use prompt corrective action to assess a bank's capital adequacy, categorizing them as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized. Increased scrutiny and penalties may follow a PCA notice from the primary regulator for a deteriorating financial health. The capital requirements for banks are determined based on risk-weighted assets, with regulators categorizing banks based on their capital adequacy. A significantly or critically undercapitalized bank may be considered insolvent, leading to the appointment of the FDIC as the receiver. The minimum capital ratios set by regulators include a common equity tier 1 capital requirement of 4.5%, additional Tier 1 capital instruments at 1.5%, and Tier 2 capital requirements at 2.0%. The sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital ratios is known as the minimum total capital ratio. The BCBS established a capital conservation buffer at 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, consisting mostly of common tangible equity. Basel III prohibits banks from distributing earnings, dividends, and bonuses below their capital conservation buffers. A countercyclical buffer of 0% to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets was also set up to address economic fluctuations. The countercyclical buffer, set at 0% to 2.5% of a bank's risk-weighted assets, can grow during economic expansions and decrease during contractions. U.S. bank regulators are required to maintain this buffer under Dodd-Frank, with the Federal Reserve initially setting it at 0%. Failure to meet the buffer could result in restrictions on capital distributions and bonuses. The Federal Reserve established capital requirements for U.S. banks, with different risk-weighted asset calculations for well-capitalized banks. Advanced approaches banks have a capital charge of 12.5%-15%, including the countercyclical buffer. Globally systemically important banks must hold an additional 1% to 2.5% of capital in common equity. The G-SIB Surcharge Rule was announced by the Federal Reserve on July 20, 2015. The Federal Reserve announced the G-SIB Surcharge Rule in 2015, establishing capital surcharges for designated G-SIBs ranging from 1.0% to 4.5% of total risk-weighted assets. The leverage ratio, defined as Tier 1 capital divided by on-balance sheet assets, is important when financial risks exceed assigned risk weights. U.S. banks have specific leverage ratio requirements, with an additional 2% capital buffer for large bank holding companies. The Federal Reserve announced the G-SIB Surcharge Rule in 2015, establishing capital surcharges for designated G-SIBs. The rule requires a 5% minimum supplementary leverage ratio for banks with over $700 billion in assets. The BCBS issued liquidity requirements to accompany the higher capital requirements to address potential financial stress. Bank portfolios may consist of illiquid assets funded by liabilities, leading to funding risks during periods of uncertainty. Institutions holding large amounts of illiquid assets may face competition for shorter-term liquid assets, driving up rates. This can result in banks liquidating asset security holdings, creating a market with many sellers and few buyers, impacting liquidity even if the bank remains solvent. The BCBS introduced new liquidity risk ratio requirements to improve resilience to liquidity stress. The 30-day liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement was established to promote resilience to sudden disruptions in liquidity by ensuring banks hold high-quality liquid assets. The final rule implemented by federal banking agencies in 2014 requires banks with $50 billion or more in assets to hold a certain amount of High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) relative to their net cash outflows over a 30-day period. The rule defines different levels of qualifying liquid assets (level 1, level 2A, and level 2B) with level 1 being the most liquid. Additionally, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) established the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) to encourage banks to rely more on medium- and longer-term funding for their loans. The NSFR approach aims to reduce the need for large short-term funding at once, but may lead to narrower lending spreads or more reliance on equity financing, increasing funding costs. It will become a Basel III requirement in 2018. Higher capital and stress testing requirements provide a cushion against losses and reduce insolvency risk. Increased liquidity requirements help mitigate cash flow reversals and lower vulnerability to bank failures. Higher capital can reduce the need for FDIC intervention in case of bank failure, but it comes with costs. Capitalization levels may not fully indicate a bank's resilience to systemic risks. Banks may opt to fund loans through cheaper short-term interbank loans rather than shareholder equity. Meeting increased capital requirements may lead banks to pass on higher costs to customers. Banks may choose to shift higher capital costs to borrowers rather than shareholders to avoid diluting equity. This decision can impact credit expansion and economic recovery, as capital levels fluctuate with economic cycles. Excessive lending activity can exacerbate these challenges. Excessive lending activity may indicate vulnerability to systemic-risk events more than bank capital levels. Liquidity-risk ratio requirements have benefits but also come with difficult-to-measure costs. Banks may shift higher capital costs to borrowers, impacting credit expansion and economic recovery. The U.S. banking system may not need large liquid assets as the Federal Reserve acts as the lender of last resort. Holding large amounts of liquid U.S. Treasury securities could increase systemic-risk crisis vulnerability and reduce supply for other entities. While liquidity-risk management is important for stability, a significant increase in risk-free asset holdings by large banks could introduce new risks. Expanding safety and soundness requirements can enhance a bank's ability to withstand financial risks. Systemic-risk events involve multiple institutions experiencing distress due to missed payments or disruptions, leading to widespread loss of confidence and contagion. A sudden asset price decline can cause distress for financial institutions with interconnected balance sheets. Higher capital requirements may increase the likelihood of loss for equity shareholders during financial crises. However, increased capitalization levels may not prevent destabilizing effects on the banking system during panics. The banking system may face destabilizing effects even when well-capitalized. Prudential requirements may be less effective when lending occurs outside regulated banks. Nonbank institutions and securitizers not subject to safety requirements contributed to the financial crisis. Raising prudential requirements for depository institutions may not address risks in unregulated parts of the financial system. The Dodd-Frank Act included provisions for regulating nonbank financial activities, while the 114th Congress is considering bills that would impact the prudential regulation of the banking system. Some of the bills being discussed include H.R. 1408, which focuses on mortgage servicing asset capital requirements, and H.R. 1309, which aims to improve the designation of systemic risks. The Systemic Risk Designation Improvement Act of 2015 would change the criteria for determining SIFI designation, removing the $50 billion asset threshold for enhanced regulation. Banks designated as G-SIBs would automatically face enhanced regulation, while FSOC could designate other firms as systemically important. S. 1484, the Financial Regulatory Improvement Act of 2015, includes provisions affecting bank regulation. The bill H.R. 3791 aims to raise the consolidated asset threshold for small bank holding companies from $1 billion to $5 billion, exempting them from certain capital requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. It passed the House on April 14, 2016. Capital-adequacy regulation requires banks to maintain minimum capital-asset ratios, with Basel I introducing a risk-weighting system for assets. Basel I introduced a risk-weighting system for assets based on credit or default risk, assigning lower weights to more liquid assets like cash and U.S. Treasury securities. Loans with higher risk weights reduce a bank's capital-asset ratio, requiring more capital to be held. When a bank decides to increase its holdings of less liquid loans, its capital reserves must also increase to maintain its capital-asset ratio. Banks with low ratios may shift towards low risk-weighted assets to restore the ratio. The Basel I weighting system did not adequately differentiate between varying degrees of risk, treating all commercial loans the same regardless of credit quality. This system fails to account for offsetting risk exposures. The Basel I weighting system fails to capture offsetting risk exposures, leading banks to potentially make higher-risk loans for higher yields instead of lower-risk loans. There is also a concern that banks may prefer holding government securities over extending loans during economic downturns due to the risk weight of 0% for OECD-member nations' securities. If banks hold lower quality loans during expansions and face increased defaults during recessions, their capital-asset ratios may fall below regulatory thresholds. The Basel I weighting system incentivizes banks to hold more OECD country sovereign debt during economic downturns to maintain capital-asset ratios, potentially reducing lending to high-risk segments. Basel II introduced a more differentiated risk-weight system to address these issues. Basel II proposed a more differentiated risk-weight system by adding more risk-weight categories and using external credit assessments. Basel III incorporated a comprehensive risk-weighting system to allow for better risk differentiation. Despite the increased array of risk weights, the system still provides procyclical lending incentives for banks. Basel II.5 was introduced in response to the global financial crisis to better capture credit risk in the trading book of banks. The trading book consists of securities not held to maturity and accounted for at market value. Distinguishing between assets for the trading and banking books can be challenging. Basel II.5 aims to prevent improper placement of securities in trading books for favorable accounting treatment, ensuring banks have enough regulatory capital. U.S. regulators issued proposed rules in 2011, finalized in 2012, applying to banks with significant trading assets and liabilities. The BCBS announced a revised framework in 2016 to review the market capital risk rule, including requirements for daily mark-to-market treatment of trading book assets and restrictions on moving assets between trading and banking books to prevent regulatory arbitrage. The BCBS provides standardized methodology for calculating regulatory capital requirements for the trading book, with the option for large banks to use their own internal models. Internal models must now include Estimated Shortfall (ES) and be evaluated for accuracy. Guidance is given on valuing illiquid assets in the portfolio, regardless of book placement. The BCBS provides guidance on accounting methodologies, market liquidity assumptions, and procedures for banks to determine liquidity positions. The market capital risk rule may reduce assets in trading books, impacting total market risk capital requirements. The effect on trading activity is uncertain, similar to the Volcker Rule. The timeline for the revised market capital risk rule for U.S. banking firms is unknown. Stress testing is a diagnostic tool used by banks. Stress testing is a diagnostic tool used to assess a bank's ability to withstand adverse economic conditions. It helps determine if a bank can remain solvent under scenarios like high unemployment, economic slowdowns, or borrower defaults. Stress test scenarios highlight balance sheet weaknesses and may require banks to make financial risk adjustments. Passing a stress test may require banking institutions to adjust their asset portfolios and maintain capital levels above regulatory requirements. The BCBS recommends rigorous stress testing programs, while the Dodd-Frank Act mandates semi-annual stress tests for large financial institutions. Regulatory bodies like the OCC, FDIC, and Federal Reserve have also issued rules for annual stress tests for banks with over $10 billion in assets. The Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests (DFAST) require banking institutions to analyze the impact of adverse economic conditions on their financial viability. Final guidance was issued for midsize banking organizations with assets between $10 billion and $50 billion. Stress testing requirements and deadlines for reporting and financial disclosures are included in the rules. Comparisons between midsize banks and larger institutions are discussed. In February 2009, the Federal Reserve introduced the Supervisory Capital Allocation Program (SCAP) for large bank holding companies with assets over $100 billion. The program included stress tests for the 19 largest U.S. banks under adverse economic scenarios for 2009 and 2010. Sections 165 and 166 of the Dodd-Frank Act require enhanced standards for bank holding companies with assets over $50 billion. The Comprehensive Capital Assessment Review (CCAR) program was established in November 2011 to evaluate the capital planning process of institutions annually. The SCAP stress testing now continues under the CCAR program, which evaluates the capital planning process of institutions with over $50 billion in assets. Large banks must conduct stress tests in January and July, while midsize banks submit in March. Large banks must maintain a 5% Tier 1 common ratio post-stress test, but this is not required for midsize banks. Small U.S. banks are also required to conduct stress testing for market risks. Community banks in the U.S. are required to conduct stress tests to assess their ability to withstand adverse macroeconomic scenarios, even though they are not subject to Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act. These stress tests may focus on financial risks that regulators deem more imminent, such as obtaining additional funding under stressed situations or demonstrating resiliency to changing interest rates. Portfolio stress tests are mandated for community banks with significant concentrations in specific credit exposures, like commercial real estate. Regulatory guidance has been increased for banks with high concentrations in commercial real estate due to concerns about relaxed underwriting standards. Increased supervisory guidance for banks with significant concentrations in commercial real estate (CRE) due to concerns about potential loan defaults and failures. Banks must submit a risk management plan if certain conditions are met, such as high levels of construction and land development loans or a significant increase in the CRE loan portfolio within 36 months. The plan should outline strategies to reduce or manage the risks associated with CRE lending. The guidance requires banks with high commercial real estate concentrations to submit a risk management plan within 36 months. The plan should outline strategies to reduce risks and may require additional capital for banks with inadequate plans. Additionally, the TLAC proposal for large U.S. banking institutions under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act is discussed in the appendix. TLAC requirements aim to increase the loss-absorbing capacity of global systemically important banks to prevent contagion risks. The Financial Stability Board introduced a framework for TLAC standards in 2014, while the Federal Reserve proposed a rule in 2015 to enhance the ability of large banks to resolve themselves without government assistance. The TLAC requirements aim to quickly capitalize a clean holding company in case of insolvency, with long-term debt issuances and equity holding requirements. Covered G-SIB bank holding companies must issue long-term debt instruments with a one-year minimum maturity to ensure resilience to systemic risk panic. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision released a consultative document on G-SIBs' loss absorbing and recapitalization capacity. The TLAC requirements ensure that long-term debt issuances by G-SIB bank holding companies are resilient to systemic risk panic. Third party investors must be involved, and in case of insolvency, debt automatically converts to equity in a clean holding company. This reduces the need for taxpayer funds to recapitalize a G-SIB. Non-compliance with TLAC requirements would restrict a company's ability to pay dividends to equity holders. The Federal Reserve's proposed rule for TLAC requirements would restrict dividends to equity shareholders and discretionary bonuses for executives. TLAC instruments must have plain vanilla features for transparency, unlike derivatives or structured notes. Accelerating payment of TLAC debt instruments may be limited depending on the final rule definition. The TLAC requirement may restrict the early payment of long-term debt instruments, potentially reducing systemic-risk panics in case of insolvency. However, the willingness of investors to buy instruments with liquidation restrictions may decrease. If a financial asset collapses, holders may face balance sheet losses similar to the 2008 crisis, potentially leading to multiple bank insolvencies. Uncertainty remains on whether converting to clean holding companies would reduce uncertainty during banking crises."
