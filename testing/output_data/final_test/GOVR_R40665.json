    "content": "Title III of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 establishes annual budget resolutions by Congress, outlining revenue, spending, surplus/deficit, and public debt for upcoming fiscal years. The report focuses on Budget Act provisions affecting budget resolution consideration in the Senate, enforced by points of order raised by Senators. Enforcement of budget resolution in the Senate involves raising points of order against amendments. If a point of order is raised, a motion to waive it can be made with a three-fifths vote. If the motion fails, the point of order is sustained, and the amendment fails. Few points of order are raised during budget resolution consideration. During the consideration of budget resolutions in the Senate, points of order can be raised against amendments, with few being waived. The budget resolution process is privileged, allowing for nondebatable motions. Section 301(a) of the Budget Act outlines the required content for the budget resolution, while Section 305(b)(1) limits debate time to 50 hours, divided equally between majority and minority managers. After the 50 hours expires, Senators may continue to consider the budget resolution and offer further amendments, motions, and appeals, but with no time provided for debate. The Senate often uses unanimous consent agreements to conduct business differently from the provisions of 305(b), such as agreeing on a specific amount of remaining time regardless of actual time used. The Senate may designate specific debate times on the budget resolution, including up to four hours for discussing economic goals and policies. Senators can informally discuss these topics before the resolution is brought to the floor, often during morning business or opening statements. Unanimous consent agreements can also be used to reserve time for general debate. The Budget Act includes provisions governing the amendment process for the budget resolution in the Senate. Section 305(b)(2) limits debate on an amendment to two hours, with time managed by the mover and the manager of the resolution. If both are proponents, opposition time is controlled by the minority manager. If no time is yielded, it is split equally between sides. Section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act limits debate on amendments to the budget resolution in the Senate to two hours, with time managed by the mover and the manager of the resolution. Time used on amendments is often charged equally to both sides, and a manager can yield additional time to a Senator. Quorum calls during consideration of an amendment are taken from the amendment's time, unless otherwise agreed to through unanimous consent. Debate on any amendment to an amendment, debatable motion, or appeal is limited to one hour. The Senate uses unanimous consent agreements to modify time limits and structure the amendment process. This was seen during consideration of the FY1994 budget resolution when the Senate entered into a unanimous consent agreement to dispose of remaining amendments by a certain time. During the consideration of the FY1994 budget resolution, the Senate implemented a practice known as \"vote-arama\" to address remaining amendments. This practice involves setting a specific list and order of amendments, allowing a two-minute explanation for each amendment, followed by a ten-minute vote on each. Additional amendments are not permitted under this procedure. Since the introduction of vote-aramas in the Senate, amendments to budget resolutions have been handled efficiently. On average, 78 amendments were offered per year between 1993 and 2009, with 33% debated and disposed of before time expired. Another 22% of amendments were pending when time ran out and disposed of afterward, while 45% were offered and disposed of after the expiration of time. During 1993-2009, one-third of amendments were disposed of before time expired, and two-thirds after time expired in the vote-arama process. Senators expressed frustration with this process, leading to discussions on potential adjustments or reforms. The Budget Act specifies elements required in the budget resolution for the upcoming fiscal year and the next four out-years. The Budget Act specifies elements required in the budget resolution, including the budget surplus or deficit, new budget authority, outlays for major functional categories, and public debt. It also includes figures for outlays and revenues under the Social Security program, with provisions to exclude them from the overall surplus or deficit totals. Additionally, the Act allows for reconciliation instructions and other procedures deemed necessary for budget implementation. The Budget Act specifies elements required in the budget resolution, including the budget surplus or deficit, new budget authority, outlays for major functional categories, and public debt. It also includes figures for outlays and revenues under the Social Security program, with provisions to exclude them from the overall surplus or deficit totals. Section 301(g) of the Budget Act creates a point of order against the Senate considering a budget resolution that utilizes more than one set of economic assumptions, and amendments that cause the budget resolution to use more than one set of economic assumptions. One instance in which this point of order was raised against an amendment occurred during the consideration of the FY1988 budget resolution. The Senate adopted the budget resolution conference report, with a requirement for Social Security figures to be separately presented. A point of order was created against any budget resolution or amendment causing a decrease in the Social Security surplus. The ruling of the chair was upheld despite a Senator's appeal. The Budget Act allows for a point of order against non-germane amendments, specifically those that would decrease the Social Security surplus. Determining the germaneness of an amendment is decided on a case-by-case basis, with the primary factor being the relationship between the subject of the amendment and the underlying resolution. This provision has been the most common point of order raised against budget resolution amendments in the past 10 years. The Budget Act allows for amendments to ensure mathematical consistency, even if they would normally be out of order. Amendments must maintain mathematical consistency for the Senate to vote on a budget resolution. The Budget Act allows for amendments to ensure mathematical consistency in budget projections, separate from economic assumptions."
