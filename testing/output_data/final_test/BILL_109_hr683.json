Section 2 discusses dilution by blurring and dilution by tarnishment. Section 43 of the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1125) is amended to provide injunctive relief to owners of famous marks against dilution by blurring or tarnishment, regardless of confusion or competition. A mark is considered famous if widely recognized by the general public in the U.S. as a source identifier for goods. The court may consider various factors to determine if a mark is famous, including advertising reach, sales volume, actual recognition, and registration status. Dilution by blurring refers to association arising from mark similarity. In determining dilution by blurring, the court considers factors like similarity to the famous mark, distinctiveness of the famous mark, exclusive use, recognition, intent to create association, and actual association. \"Dilution by tarnishment is the association arising from the similarity between a mark or trade name and a famous mark that harms the reputation of the famous mark. Exclusions from dilution by blurring or tarnishment include fair use, nominative or descriptive fair use, and parodying, criticizing, or commenting upon the famous mark owner or their goods/services.\" In a civil action for trade dress dilution under this Act, the burden of proof lies with the person asserting trade dress protection to prove that the claimed trade dress is not functional and is famous. Additionally, the owner of the famous mark is entitled to injunctive relief in such cases. The owner of a famous mark is entitled to injunctive relief under certain conditions, as outlined in sections 34, 35(a), and 36 of the Trademark Dilution Revision Act of 2006. This relief is subject to the court's discretion and principles of equity if the mark causing dilution was first used after the Act's enactment. Willful intent to trade on the recognition of the famous mark is a key factor in claims of dilution by blurring or tarnishment. Ownership of a valid registration under the Trademark Dilution Revision Act of 2006 is a complete defense against actions seeking to prevent dilution by blurring or tarnishment, or claims of damage to the distinctiveness or reputation of a mark. The Trademark Dilution Revision Act of 2006 provides a defense against actions related to dilution by blurring or tarnishment, or damage to the distinctiveness or reputation of a mark.
