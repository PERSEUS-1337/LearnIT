Enhanced reporting requirements are included in the Act. The \"Delivering Antimicrobial Transparency in Animals Act of 2015\" requires sponsors of new animal drugs with antimicrobial ingredients to submit annual reports to the Secretary on the amount of each antimicrobial ingredient sold or distributed for use in food-producing animals. Reports must detail the amount of each ingredient by container size, strength, dosage form, quantities distributed domestically, and quantities exported. The \"Delivering Antimicrobial Transparency in Animals Act of 2015\" mandates annual reports from sponsors of new animal drugs containing antimicrobial ingredients. Reports must specify the amounts of ingredients sold or distributed for use in food-producing animals, detailing container size, strength, dosage form, quantities distributed domestically and exported. Additionally, animal feed containing such drugs requires annual reports from live poultry dealers, swine contractors, or feed lot operators specifying the approved food-producing animal and the new animal drug used.

Reports must detail the amount of ingredients in feed sold for food-producing animals, including dosage, quantity sold, and indications for use under a veterinary feed directive. The \"Delivering Antimicrobial Transparency in Animals Act of 2015\" mandates annual reports from sponsors of new animal drugs with antimicrobial ingredients. The reports must include details on the amount of ingredients in feed sold for food-producing animals, such as dosage, quantity sold, and indications for use under a veterinary feed directive. The Act exempts live poultry dealers, swine contractors, or feed lot operators if the total value of live animals they control per year does not exceed a certain threshold. The Secretary may specify alternative reporting requirements, including pilot programs, to improve accuracy, lessen reporting burden, facilitate public summaries, and enhance understanding of the relationship between sales, distribution, and end-use practices for feed containing new animal drugs. The report on feed containing new animal drugs and antimicrobial resistance trends must be submitted electronically by March 31 each year, covering the previous calendar year with monthly data in a format specified by the Secretary to enable easy integration of reported data. The Secretary can integrate data on drug sales and antimicrobial resistance from Federal databases and share it with the Antimicrobial Resistance Task Force. Summaries of the reported information must be made publicly available each year by November 30, categorized by antimicrobial drug class. The Secretary can integrate data on drug sales and antimicrobial resistance from Federal databases and share it with the Antimicrobial Resistance Task Force. Summaries of the reported information must be made publicly available each year by November 30, categorized by antimicrobial drug class, specifying quantity, percentage of drugs with labeled indications, and marketing categories. The veterinary feed directive requires reporting of drug sales per state and per food-producing animal, categorized by production class. For antimicrobial drug classes with fewer than 3 sponsors, alternative reporting measures are implemented. The veterinary feed directive requires reporting of drug sales per state and per food-producing animal, categorized by production class. For antimicrobial drug classes with fewer than 3 sponsors, alternative reporting measures are implemented, including reporting data by category of importance of the drugs to human medicine and specifying quantity sold per dosage form and percentage with labeled indications for different purposes. The amendment requires reporting drug sales per state and per marketing category, including over-the-counter, prescription, and veterinary feed directive. Data must be reported in a way that protects national security and confidential business information. The terms 'live poultry dealer' and 'swine contractor' are defined as per the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921. This amendment applies to specific reports under section 512(l) of the Act. The amendment applies to reports under paragraphs (3) and (4) of section 512(l) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, covering specific calendar years. The provisions of section 512(l)(3) of the Act apply to reports covering previous calendar years. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will enhance collaboration with the Secretary of Agriculture to collect data on antimicrobial drug use in food-producing animals. This includes providing information for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and the Economic Research Service. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study to evaluate the FDA's voluntary approach to reducing antimicrobial drug use in food-producing animals and the effectiveness of data collection on antimicrobial resistance. A report on the study's results will be submitted to the Senate and House committees within one year."
