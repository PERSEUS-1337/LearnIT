    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Wild and Scenic Rivers Act\". The Congress designated segments of the Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Rivers in Massachusetts for study of potential addition to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Systems. The Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord River Study Committee was established to advise the Secretary of the Interior in conducting the study. The 16.6 mile Sudbury River segment from Danforth Street Bridge in Framingham to its confluence with the Assabet River, the 4.4 mile Assabet River segment from Damon Mill Dam in Concord to its confluence with the Sudbury River at Egg Rock, and the 8 mile Concord River segment from Egg Rock to the Route 3 Bridge in Billerica are eligible for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System due to their free-flowing condition and scenic, recreational, wildlife, literary, and historic values. The towns directly abutting these segments are also involved. The towns abutting the Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord River segments have shown support for National Wild and Scenic River designation through town meeting votes. A comprehensive management plan has been prepared to ensure long-term protection of the rivers' values and resources. The plan does not require federal involvement. The river management plan for the Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Wild and Scenic Rivers relies on State, local, and private entities for ownership and management. The Study Committee recommended including these segments in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System for management according to the River Conservation Plan. SEC. 3. WILD, SCENIC, AND RECREATIONAL RIVER DESIGNATION. Section 3(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act is amended to designate the Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Rivers in Massachusetts as scenic and recreational river segments, totaling 29 miles in length. The Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Rivers in Massachusetts totaling 29 miles are designated as scenic and recreational river segments. The Secretary of the Interior will administer these segments through cooperative agreements with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and its political subdivisions. The management will follow the \"Sudbury, Assabet and Concord Wild and Scenic River Study, River Conservation Plan\" dated March 16, 1995. The management of the Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Rivers in Massachusetts totaling 29 miles will be administered by the Secretary of the Interior through cooperative agreements with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and its political subdivisions. The Director of the National Park Service represents the Secretary of the Interior on the SUASCO River Stewardship Council for the Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Wild and Scenic River Study. They oversee the implementation of the Plan and review federally assisted water projects that could impact the designated values of the segments. The Director is authorized to enter into cooperative agreements with the Commonwealth. The Director may offer cooperative agreements with relevant parties for the protection of designated river segments. The Federal Government may provide assistance for implementation, with a cap of $100,000 per fiscal year. Segments not in the National Park System will not become part of it under this Act. Water resources projects must consider the Plan's values for National Wild and Scenic Rivers. The Plan serves as the main source for maintaining instream resources and balancing resource protection with water withdrawals. Land management includes zoning bylaws in towns. The zoning bylaws of certain Massachusetts towns are deemed to satisfy the standards under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. The US Government cannot acquire land along the segments for designation under this Act. Federal acquisition of interests in land along the segments is allowed under other laws for other purposes. Funding authorization of up to $100,000 per fiscal year is authorized for the Secretary of the Interior to implement the purposes of this Act."
