    "content": "Title XVII of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 established the National Commission on the Future of the Army (NCFA) to study the Army's structure. The NCFA made recommendations to Congress and the Administration in January 2016, addressing tensions among the Active, Guard, and Reserve components due to reduced budgets. The National Commission on the Future of the Army (NCFA) was established to study the Army's structure and address tensions among the Active, Guard, and Reserve components due to reduced budgets. Senators introduced a bill to establish the NCFA, highlighting concerns about major changes proposed in the President's budget for the Army. The National Commission on the Future of the Army (NCFA) was established to address concerns about major changes proposed in the President's budget for the Army, including transferring all of the National Guard's AH\u201364 Apaches to the active component, potentially leaving the Nation without combat reserves for essential ground operations. Senator GRAHAM has emphasized the impact of these changes on the National Guard's role as a combat reserve of the Army. The National Commission on the Future of the Army (NCFA) was established to address concerns about major changes proposed in the President's budget for the Army, including transferring all of the National Guard's AH\u201364 Apaches to the active component. The Army's 2013 Aviation Restructuring Initiative (ARI) significantly influenced the decision to establish the NCFA. The Army's proposal aims to divest older helicopters and rebalance combat capabilities across its components. This includes removing AH-64 Apache helicopters from the reserve and increasing them in the active component, saving $1 billion annually. The National Guard Bureau opposes removing AH-64 Apaches, citing concerns about degrading their combat reserve role and setting a precedent for removing other capabilities. The Army's proposal to remove AH-64 Apache helicopters from the National Guard is causing disagreement and disruption across 20 states. The National Commission on the Future of the Army (NCFA) released a final report with 63 recommendations, including a classified appendix for those with appropriate clearance. The National Commission on the Future of the Army released a final report with 63 recommendations, including maintaining an Army of 980,000 soldiers and retaining an 11th Regular Army Combat Aviation Brigade stationed in South Korea due to significant aviation safety risks. The National Commission on the Future of the Army recommends maintaining an Army of 980,000 soldiers and retaining an 11th Regular Army Combat Aviation Brigade in South Korea for safety reasons. Additionally, the commission suggests forward stationing an Armored Brigade Combat Team in Europe to enhance interoperability with allies and address air defense capability shortfalls. The National Commission on the Future of the Army recommends maintaining an Army of 980,000 soldiers and addressing various shortfalls in tactical mobility, missile defense, CBRN defense, field artillery, fuel distribution, water purification, Army watercraft, and military police. It suggests considering the elimination of two Regular Army Infantry Brigade Combat Teams to create units to address these deficiencies. The commission recommends maintaining 24 manned AH-64 Apache battalions in the Army, with 20 in the Regular Army and 4 in the National Guard. The Regular Army battalions would have 24 AH-64s each, while the National Guard battalions would have 18 Apache helicopters and would need to cross level helicopters between units before deploying. Additionally, only 2 UH-60 Black Hawk transport helicopter battalions would be added to the National Guard instead of the 4 proposed under the Army's Aviation Restructuring Initiative. The National Commission on the Future of the Army (NCFA), established by the Defense Authorization Act, is tasked with conducting a comprehensive study of the Army's structure and policy assumptions related to its size and force mixture. This includes assessing the Active Component (AC) and Reserve Components (RC) and making recommendations on modifications to the Army's structure to meet current and future mission requirements while considering national risk and available resources. Additionally, the NCFA is studying the transfer of AH-64 Apache aircraft from the Army National Guard to the Regular Army. The National Commission on the Future of the Army (NCFA) is studying the transfer of Army National Guard AH-64 Apache aircraft to the Regular Army. The NCFA is directed to consider force structure that meets Combatant Command requirements, achieves cost efficiency, supports homeland defense missions, and maintains a peacetime rotation force. The National Commission on the Future of the Army is evaluating the allocation of Army National Guard personnel and force structure to states and territories, as well as assessing force generation policies to meet mission requirements and strategic risks. This includes managing readiness, efficiency, effectiveness, capability, and affordability, while maintaining the Reserve Component as an operational reserve. The National Commission on the Future of the Army is assessing the allocation of Army National Guard personnel and force structure to states and territories. The commission will submit a report with findings, conclusions, and recommendations by February 1, 2016. The final report was released on January 28, 2016, and the commission is composed of eight appointed commissioners. The National Commission on the Future of the Army, composed of eight appointed commissioners, includes Retired Army General Carter Ham as Chair and former Assistant Secretary of the Army Thomas Lamont as Vice Chair. The National Commission on the Future of the Army, led by General Ham and Secretary Lamont, includes appointees such as Retired SMA Raymond Chandler, General Larry Ellis, Robert Hale, and Kathleen Hicks, each with extensive military and government experience. The National Commission on the Future of the Army, led by General Ham and Secretary Lamont, includes appointees such as Retired SMA Raymond Chandler, General Larry Ellis, Robert Hale, and Kathleen Hicks. Dr. Hicks is from the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and formerly served as Director for Policy Planning at the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. Retired Lieutenant General Jack Stultz, Retired General J.D. Thurman, and federal government employees were detailed to the NCFA staff. The National Commission on the Future of the Army, led by General Ham and Secretary Lamont, included appointees such as Retired SMA Raymond Chandler, General Larry Ellis, Robert Hale, and Kathleen Hicks. Dr. Hicks from the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and formerly served as Director for Policy Planning at the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. Retired Lieutenant General Jack Stultz, Retired General J.D. Thurman, and federal government employees were detailed to the NCFA staff. Department of Defense and Department of the Army Civilians, Congressional Research Service Specialist in Military Ground Forces, Washington Headquarters Service members, and contractors were also assigned to the staff. The NCFA staff was organized into five subcommittees chaired by commissioners, with staff members serving on multiple subcommittees. The Operational Subcommittee assesses the Army's size, force mixture, and component mixture to propose modifications for meeting mission requirements. The Institutional Subcommittee evaluates the impact on the Army's institutional elements and proposes structural modifications. The Force Generation Subcommittee will develop conclusions and proposals on the Army's projected force generation process and maintaining \"peacetime rotation\" rates. The Aviation Subcommittee will study the transfer of AH\u201364 Apache aircraft from the Army National Guard to the Regular Army, considering depth, scalability, and cost-efficiency between components. The Drafting Subcommittee of the Army Commission will consolidate information and input, articulate future threats and mission demands, and synthesize conclusions and recommendations into a draft report. A Designated Federal Officer (DFO) and Alternate DFOs were assigned to ensure compliance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The DFO's duties include organizing committee meetings, approving agendas, maintaining records, ensuring compliance with laws, and providing reports to the Committee Management Officer. The NCFA operates under FACA, as required by the Department of Defense. Title XVII does not mandate FACA compliance for the NCFA, but it is still required. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) was enacted in 1972 in response to concerns about the inefficiency and lack of public accessibility of executive branch advisory bodies. FACA requires advisory bodies to report membership, costs, and operations annually to the General Services Administration for oversight by Congress. The National Commission on the Future of the Army (NCFA) ensures transparency by posting meeting notices in the Federal Register and maintaining a public website. This website serves as a valuable resource for understanding Army force structure debates and tracking the commission's activities. Meetings are held to gather information for the commission's analysis. The NCFA conducted a series of meetings at various locations in the United States, including open meetings for the public and closed meetings for classified discussions. They also conducted site visits, totaling 26 between May and November 2015, to gather information. Minutes and supporting materials from the meetings are available on the NCFA website. The NCFA conducted site visits at various locations, including the Pentagon, Capitol Hill, U.S. Army Europe, U.S. Army Africa, and Active/Reserve Component installations. These visits involved interactions with a range of individuals and units, with details available on the NCFA website. Classified materials and minutes are not publicly accessible. The NCFA conducted site visits at various locations, including the Pentagon, Capitol Hill, U.S. Army Europe, U.S. Army Africa, and Active/Reserve Component installations. Classified materials and minutes are not publicly accessible. The primary means of interaction between NCFA commissioners and staff were subcommittee meetings, which were subject to FACA and attended by DFOs. Subcommittee meetings were closed events, but outside experts were occasionally invited to present briefings. Opinions on the recommendations offered by the NCFA varied among the Army, state governments, Congress, and the public. In 2014, General Raymond Odierno expressed mixed feelings within the Army about the need for the NCFA, citing internal and external analysis already conducted. He questioned the additional expertise a commission would bring and highlighted the cost implications of delaying the Aviation Restructure Initiative. General Frank Grass and Lieutenant General Jeffery Talley expressed differing opinions on the need for an external look at the Reserve component versus the Active component balance. Grass emphasized the value of reevaluating the balance during fiscal challenges, while Talley believed that the Army could resolve challenges internally without the need for a commission. General Mark Milley, current Chief of Staff of the Army, is open to considering input from the National Commission on the Future of the Army (NCFA) and its recommendations on the Army Readiness Initiative (ARI). He is interested in reexamining the number of training days for National Guard soldiers and establishing composite units, initiatives supported by the NCFA. Several governors have expressed their support for Regular Army bases, particularly for the National Guard's role. The National Guard's role in disaster response and concerns about Guard reductions were emphasized by various stakeholders, including the National Governor's Association and members of Congress. The NCFA received letters addressing opposition to the ARI, the importance of maintaining the National Guard as an operational reserve, and concerns about the commission's work not aligning with Title XVII provisions. Public involvement in the NCFA's activities was widespread, with members providing written and oral statements expressing personal concerns. The NCFA received public involvement in its activities, with various stakeholders expressing support for military installations. There was a misconception that the NCFA visit aimed to close bases like the BRAC. Academics, defense analysts, and industry representatives also provided suggestions and analysis to the NCFA. The commission presented thematic findings with specific recommendations. The commission's recommendations focus on the Army's Total Force Policy, suggesting the expansion of multicomponent units and alignment of recruiting efforts to avoid competition within the Army. These recommendations may be challenging and costly to implement. The commission recommends aligning Army Reserve and Army National Guard positions to avoid competition within the Army. They also suggest regionalizing the Army's school system and supporting the Integrated Personnel & Pay System\u2013Army. Training readiness should be a top funding priority for the Army. The commission recommends prioritizing training readiness for the Army by increasing rotations for National Guard BCTs, reducing mandatory training activities, and considering more flying hours for peacetime training to address proficiency issues. The NCFA report found that training proficiency has decreased due to funding issues related to flying hours. Appendix E contains classified information on strategic threats, force structure analysis, and impacts of strategic lift, cluster munitions ban, and cyberwarfare. Reviewing Appendix E could provide policymakers with more clarity and context. The report includes 63 recommendations for various entities. The NCFA report includes 63 recommendations for various entities, with a focus on the Army implementing most of the \"action items.\" Recommendations include establishing pilot programs for recruiting, testing multicomponent approaches for Army aviation force structure, and conducting a review of the Army School System for efficiencies. The NCFA report includes 63 recommendations for the Army, focusing on tactical mobility, readiness gaps, and mission effectiveness. Recommendations include implementing ARI, the One Army School System, and a modernization program for aviation forces. Questions may arise regarding the capacity of the \"Corporate Army\" to implement these recommendations. The NCFA report includes 63 recommendations for the Army, focusing on tactical mobility, readiness gaps, and mission effectiveness. The commission's comprehensive approach identified initiatives like Multi-Component Units, IPPS-A, Generating Force Model, One Army School System, and Objective-T Methodology for Assessing Training Readiness. Challenges in implementing these initiatives will influence the recommendations. The commission acknowledges the mixed results of multicomponent units in the Army's history. The commission acknowledges the Army's history of mixed results with multicomponent units and notes issues with programs like IPPS-A and One Army School System, affecting successful implementation. Data correctness problems persist in the IPPS-A program across Active Duty, Army National Guard, and Army Reserve. The commission suggests further examination of Army initiatives like IPPS-A and One Army School System across Active Duty, Army National Guard, and Army Reserve. Monitoring progress on implementing recommendations is advised to overcome potential setbacks and bureaucratic resistance. The NCFA's final report to the President and Congress addresses all mandated requirements, with additional force structure-related issues worth considering. The commission's final report to the President and Congress addresses all mandated requirements, with additional force structure-related issues worth considering, including the absence of recommendations related to U.S. Army Special Operations Forces (SOF) and their combat units operating with Army General Purpose Forces. An examination of U.S. Army SOF force structure and mix could provide valuable insights to the Administration and Congress. The commission's final report to the President and Congress did not examine the Army's Commands, Direct Reporting Units, and Army Service Component Commands. These organizations, including TRADOC, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and ASCCs like U.S. Army Pacific, may benefit from a review to assess their necessity, potential redundancies, and opportunities for consolidation. Despite limitations, addressing these organizations is a substantial analytical undertaking. The final report by the commission highlights potential redundancies and opportunities for consolidation in a dynamic security environment. Questions arise on how the Administration, Congress, and the Army will evaluate and implement the recommendations. Without a clear process, the commission's work may remain informative rather than actionable. The recommendations range from creating new units to not implementing the Army's Aviation Restructuring Initiative. The Aviation Restructuring Initiative recommendations have associated costs that may be difficult to fund. Implementing these recommendations could be challenging due to affordability issues, but solutions like \"offsets\" or budget adjustments could help address this hurdle. The implementation of the Aviation Restructuring Initiative recommendations may face challenges such as affordability issues, developmental issues, and bureaucratic opposition. Policymakers need to consider potential hurdles and oversight mechanisms for effective implementation. Some recommendations may be realized quickly, while others could take years to fully implement. Congress may need to establish special hearings to oversee the implementation of multiple recommendations. The commission's recommendations could be overseen through special hearings or annual reports to Congress. Establishing a formal means of congressional oversight for the National Commission on the Future of the Army could benefit all parties involved. The National Commission on the Future of the Army Act of 2014 establishes a commission composed of eight members appointed by various officials. The National Commission on the Future of the Army Act of 2014 establishes a commission with appointments to be made within 90 days. Failure to appoint members by the specified date will result in a reduction of the Commission's size. The National Commission on the Future of the Army Act of 2014 establishes a commission with appointments to be made within 90 days. Members appointed should have expertise in national and international security policy, military forces capability, force structure design, organization, and reserve forces policy. Members serve for the life of the Commission, vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment, and a Chair and Vice Chair are selected from among its members. The Commission must hold its initial meeting within 30 days of all members being appointed, and meetings are called by the Chair with a majority of members constituting a quorum. The Commission shall study the structure of the Army, assess the size and force mixture, and make recommendations for modifications to meet mission requirements and national risk levels. Special consideration will be given to evaluating and identifying a suitable Army structure. The Commission will evaluate and identify a structure for the Army that meets combatant command requirements, ensures cost-efficiency between regular and reserve components, supports homeland defense missions, maintains a peacetime rotation force, and provides a base of trained personnel for the reserve components. The Commission evaluates force generation policies for the Army, including readiness, training, equipment, personnel, and maintenance of reserve components. It also assesses the distribution of responsibility for Army National Guard personnel and force structure to states and territories. The Commission evaluates force generation policies for the Army, including readiness, training, equipment, personnel, and maintenance of reserve components. It also assesses the allocation of Army National Guard personnel and force structure to the States and territories, including a study on transferring AH-64 Apache aircraft from the Army National Guard to the regular Army. The Commission will submit a detailed report to the President and congressional defense committees by February 1, 2016.
