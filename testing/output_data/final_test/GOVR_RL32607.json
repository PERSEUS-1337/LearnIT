    "content": "Public diplomacy is the promotion of America's interests, culture, and policies by informing and influencing foreign populations. After the September 11th attacks, the Bush Administration faced a public diplomacy war on terrorism. President Bush's initial naming of the U.S. response as \"Operation Enduring Crusade\" was changed due to concerns of it being inflammatory to Muslims. Foreign populations had favorable views of the United States in 1999/2000, but funding for public diplomacy activities was downplayed by Congress and past administrations. Funding for public diplomacy activities was downplayed by Congress and past administrations, leading to a drop in funding levels during the late 1990s. Negative attitudes towards America have increased worldwide since the 2001 attacks, with the Iraq War exacerbating these opinions. Negative opinions of America have been on the rise globally, especially since the Iraq War. This has led to a sense of urgency to enhance public diplomacy efforts to counteract negative sentiment and prevent terrorist recruitment. The 108th Congress recognized the importance of public diplomacy and included measures in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 to promote free media in Islamic countries, provide scholarships for Muslims to attend American-sponsored schools, offer public diplomacy training, and establish an International Youth Opportunity Fund. The 109th Congress has not passed legislation for changes in public diplomacy but has increased funding. A 2006 Pew Survey showed negative opinions of the US due to the Iraq War. The US government acknowledged public diplomacy activities in the early 20th century. In the early 20th century, President Wilson and Roosevelt established committees for overseas information dissemination during World Wars I and II. The Smith-Mundt Act of 1948 provided legislative authority for broadcasting and cultural activities. The Smith-Mundt Act of 1948 consolidated the activities of the State Department's Division of Cultural Relations, the Office of Inter-American Affairs, and the Office of War Information. Senator Smith aimed to counter Russia's hostile information campaign by promoting truthful information through an informational service and an educational exchange service. In 1953, President Eisenhower created the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) to administer broadcasting and information programs, while educational exchange programs remained in the Department of State to avoid propaganda implications. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) began broadcasting in 1950. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) started broadcasting in 1950 under the CIA's clandestine support. The Board for International Broadcasting (BIB) was established in 1973 to oversee RFE/RL operations and provide funding. The BIB aimed to create a separation between the U.S. government and RFE/RL to enhance its credibility. In 1977, the Reorganization Plan No. 2 consolidated functions into the International Communication Agency (ICA), later renamed the U.S. Information Agency in 1982. In 1994, Congress removed international broadcasting from the US Information Agency (USIA) and created the Broadcasting Board of Governors. Senator Helms initiated legislation to abolish USIA in 1999, transferring its functions back to the State Department. Chairman Frank Wolf questioned the decision to abolish USIA in a FY2004 hearing. The US government spent significant amounts on public diplomacy activities, with funding peaking in FY1994 at nearly $1.5 billion. The President's FY2007 budget request of nearly $1.6 billion would set a record for public diplomacy expenditures. Funding declined in the late 1990s due to budget savings from consolidating broadcasting in 1994 and abolishing the USIA in 1999. Funding for public diplomacy activities peaked in FY1994 at nearly $1.5 billion but declined in the late 1990s due to budget savings from consolidating broadcasting in 1994 and abolishing the USIA in 1999. Actual funding levels in FY2000, FY2001, and FY2002 were higher than in 1980, but in constant dollars, funding dropped below FY1980 levels. New funding designated for public diplomacy has been added through supplemental and regular appropriations since the terrorist attacks. The Administration is seeking additional funds for Educational and Cultural Exchanges and international broadcasting activities related to Iran. Congress provided funding for exchanges and broadcasting into Iran in the FY2006 emergency supplemental package. Critics point to what they view as meager funding levels for public diplomacy. Critics highlight the low funding for public diplomacy compared to military expenses in combating terrorism. Public diplomacy includes international information programs, educational and cultural exchanges, and nonmilitary broadcasting. The Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy oversees these activities, while the Broadcasting Board of Governors manages international broadcasting. The International Information Programs (IIP) office serves as a strategic communications service for the foreign affairs community, producing various information products in multiple languages and formats to reach key audiences in over 140 countries. These products include regionally-oriented reports, issue-oriented reports on topics like economic security and democracy/human rights, speaker programs, and Information Resource Centers (IRC) support for embassy staff. The Bureau for Educational and Cultural Affairs facilitates mutual understanding between the United States and other countries through educational exchanges, scholarships, and training programs. Programs include the Fulbright Program, Humphrey Fellowships, International Visitor Program, and Office of Citizen Exchanges. International exchange programs are seen as effective in promoting American culture abroad, but drawbacks include high costs and limited reach. Concerns have been raised about tracking participants' visa status and changes in study focus. The United States is addressing issues with international exchange programs to make them more effective in addressing terrorism and security concerns for Muslim and Arab participants. International broadcasting includes entities like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe, overseen by the Broadcasting Board of Governors. The Broadcasting Board of Governors, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, oversees broadcasting entities like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe. In times of crisis, U.S. international broadcasting goes into \"surge broadcasting\" mode, which includes expanded coverage of events, creating new broadcast mediums, increasing interviews with U.S. officials, and cooperating with other countries' broadcast operations for 24-hour broadcasting into affected regions. The U.S. government has historically used public diplomacy to influence various regions, including Europe during World War I and World War II, Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, and Muslim and Arab populations to combat terrorism. Efforts have included increased funding, coordination of activities, and evaluation of programs for future effectiveness. Notable examples include Secretary of State Colin Powell's appearance on MTV after the September 11th attacks. Secretary of State Colin Powell appeared on MTV in February 2002, engaging with young people worldwide about America's values. Public diplomacy efforts targeted Arab and Muslim populations, promoting concepts like religious tolerance and independent media. $25 million in funding was allocated post-9/11 to develop programs reaching larger Muslim and Arab audiences, including tripling Arabic text publications and creating an Arabic-language magazine. The Bureau of International Information Programs (IIP) increased its efforts to reach Arab and Muslim populations post-9/11. This included tripling Arabic text publications, establishing American Corners for multimedia learning, and creating a counter-disinformation capability. Funding for Muslim-related activities totaled $8.69 million in FY2004, $9.11 million in FY2005, and $8.76 million in FY2006. After 9/11, the Bureau of International Information Programs (IIP) focused on Muslim and Arab populations, receiving about $175 million in funding for exchange programs. The Department of State promoted exchanges with Afghanistan, bringing Arab and Afghani women to the US for political engagement and education. The Bureau of International Information Programs (IIP) focused on Muslim and Arab populations post-9/11, receiving funding for exchange programs. The Department of State promoted exchanges with Afghanistan, bringing women to the US for political engagement and education. Additionally, programs like Partnership for Learning (P4L) and Youth Exchange and Study Program (YES) aim to reach youth in Arab and Muslim countries, with initiatives including high school programs and cultural exchanges. After the 2001 attacks, VOA expanded broadcasts to Afghanistan and the Middle East in Arabic, Dari, Farsi, Pashto, and Urdu languages. VOA estimated that 80% of adult males in Afghanistan listen to VOA and find it credible. An emergency appropriation provided $12.25 million for VOA and RFE/RL broadcasts in various languages. The BBG continues 24/7 broadcasting into Afghanistan and has expanded news programming into Iraq. The Broadcasting Board of Governors has expanded news programming into Iraq and Iran through Radio Sawa, METN (Alhurra), and Radio Farda. Expenditures for broadcasting related to the war on terrorism have increased significantly from FY2002 to FY2006. The Administration's FY2007 request for international broadcasting related to the war on terrorism is $274.4 million. Despite significant efforts to revamp U.S. public diplomacy in response to the terrorism threat, questions remain about its effectiveness and sufficiency. Condoleezza Rice recommended new initiatives such as sister cities programs and exchanges focusing on the Muslim world. Public diplomacy is seen as more than just overseas PR, with a shift towards dialogue to build relationships and trust with Muslim populations. The 9/11 Commission Report emphasized the importance of building long-term relationships with Muslim populations for effective public diplomacy in combating terrorism. Former officials stressed the need to prioritize public diplomacy efforts alongside military tools, with recommendations including increased funding for broadcasting to Arab and Muslim populations. The Board of Governors increased funding for broadcasting to Arab and Muslim populations, with total appropriations ranging from $420 million in FY2000 to $599.6 million in FY2005. Post 9/11 emergency supplemental appropriations for BBG have totaled $143.7 million. The 9/11 Report recommended clear communication of American values, urging increased funding for international broadcasting, exchanges, scholarships, and libraries overseas. Chairman Thomas Kean highlighted low favorability of Americans in Egypt despite significant U.S. assistance. The Commission recommended the U.S. government support the International Youth Opportunity Fund to promote education and literacy, improve textbooks, and offer alternative schools to combat Islamist terrorism. They also suggested creating a forum for Western and Arab/Muslim representatives to foster understanding and relationships among all countries. The Commission emphasized the importance of building long-term relationships and understanding among all countries to combat global terrorism. They highlighted that most Muslims are moderates who do not support violence, while Islamist terrorists use violence against the United States. The Commission suggested that the U.S. can drive a wedge between these groups through public diplomacy by promoting optimism and hope for the future. Several organizations, including the Council on Foreign Relations and the Government Accountability Office, offered suggestions to improve public diplomacy and combat terrorism. Options included creating a Corporation for Public Diplomacy, reconstituting USIA, and increasing emphasis on public diplomacy across all government agencies. Public diplomacy is a key tool used by the U.S. government to promote its interests abroad. Views on its effectiveness have varied over the years, with some questioning its expense. Changes have been made to improve public diplomacy efforts, including training staff in public diplomacy and languages, and measuring success by blending best practices from the public and private sectors. The USIA was abolished after the Cold War, moving public diplomacy into the Department of State. Since the terrorist attacks in 2001, there have been calls to increase public diplomacy funding to \"win the hearts and minds of Muslims\" and enhance national security. However, concerns have been raised about the credibility of the message, as global polls show skepticism towards the U.S. government. Effective public diplomacy requires a consistent message that aligns with people's experiences and perceptions. Many argue that public diplomacy is ineffective, especially if U.S. foreign policy is the root cause of negative foreign opinions. The Advisory Group on Public Diplomacy for the Arab and Muslim World emphasizes the importance of truthful communication over spin and propaganda. Edward R. Murrow also stressed the significance of honesty in public diplomacy efforts, stating that truth is the best form of propaganda. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-458) aimed to reform the intelligence community and increase public diplomacy activities in Muslim populations. Signed into law on December 17, 2004, it emphasized the importance of credibility and truthfulness in communication."
