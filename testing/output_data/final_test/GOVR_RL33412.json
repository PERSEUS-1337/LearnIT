    "content": "The annual agriculture appropriations law covers the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Temporary funding for FY2007 is provided through a continuing resolution until February 15, 2007. The House passed the FY2007 agriculture appropriations bill, while the Senate considered a crop disaster amendment in December 2006. The House bill allocates $93.9 billion, slightly less than the Senate-reported bill of $94.6 billion. The Senate-reported bill includes $4 billion for emergency agricultural disaster assistance, while the House bill provides $17.8 billion in discretionary appropriations. The House bill also includes $76.1 billion for mandatory programs, which is $300 million less than the Senate bill. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has various responsibilities and is staffed by around 100,000 employees. The USDA is responsible for various activities beyond agriculture budget functions. The total appropriation for FY2006 is $98.4 billion, with food and nutrition programs receiving the largest share at $58.9 billion. Farm and foreign agricultural services follow with $24.4 billion in appropriations. The USDA's budget includes farm commodity price and income support programs, conservation and trade programs, crop insurance, farm loans, and foreign food aid programs. Other activities cover natural resources, research, education, marketing, regulatory programs, food safety, and rural development. The Forest Service receives a significant portion of the natural resources budget. Agricultural assistance programs, including FDA and CFTC, are part of the USDA's budget under Title V in the appropriations bill. These agencies have historical ties to food and agricultural markets. Food and agricultural issues have become less dominant in FDA and CFTC as medical and drug issues have grown. Their combined share of the overall agriculture and related agencies appropriations bill is usually less than 2%. Mandatory and discretionary spending are treated differently in the budget process, with Congress controlling spending on mandatory programs through eligibility rules and benefit formulas. Discretionary program spending is controlled by annual appropriations acts. Approximately 80% of the total agriculture and related agencies appropriation is classified as mandatory spending, which includes programs like food stamps, child nutrition, farm commodity support, crop insurance, and agricultural conservation. Mandatory spending is influenced by program participation rates, economic conditions, and weather patterns. These programs receive funds outside of annual appropriations. The annual agriculture appropriations act funds mandatory programs like food stamps and child nutrition based on projected spending needs. Supplemental appropriations are made if estimates fall short. The remaining 20% of the appropriations bill is for discretionary programs such as conservation, rural development, research, and education programs. The agriculture appropriations bill funds USDA, FDA, and Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Congress passed three continuing resolutions to fund the government due to delayed appropriations bills. Agriculture-related agencies are funded at the lower of House-passed or FY2006 levels. The 110th Congress is expected to consider funding agriculture-related agencies at FY2006 levels with some adjustments. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported the FY2007 agriculture appropriations bill on June 22, 2006. In November 2006, the agriculture appropriations bill faced debate in the Senate with thirty submitted amendments, including 14 by Senator Coburn targeting earmarks. Floor action was initially promised in exchange for Senator Conrad withdrawing a crop disaster amendment from another bill. However, fiscal concerns led to the blockage of floor action on the agriculture bill. A debate on Senator Conrad's disaster amendment took place on December 5, but it was defeated and ruled out of order. The House passed its version of the bill on May 23, 2006, with added amendments and stripped provisions. The House added 17 amendments and stripped three provisions from the bill. Another 13 amendments were rejected, with 8 targeting earmarks. The House-passed bill provides $93.9 billion, $691 million less than the Senate-reported bill. It includes $17.8 billion in \"net\" discretionary appropriations, $391 million less than the Senate bill. For mandatory programs, the House bill includes $76.1 billion, $300 million less than the Senate bill. Appropriations for mandatory programs would be down nearly $7 billion from FY2006. The House-passed bill provides $18.4 billion in \"gross\" discretionary appropriations, while the Senate bill provides $18.7 billion. These amounts exceed official discretionary caps by adding money above them, offset by reducing certain mandatory programs. The House bill is $130 million below FY2006 levels, and the Senate bill includes $4 billion in emergency agricultural disaster assistance. The House and Senate passed different FY2007 budget resolutions, with the House providing $17.812 billion and the Senate providing $18.2 billion for the agriculture bill. The House bill does not include any emergency provisions, while the Senate bill includes $4 billion in emergency agricultural disaster assistance. The FY2007 budget request for agriculture agencies was $93.7 billion. Appropriators have placed limitations on mandatory spending authorized in the 2002 farm bill to fund discretionary programs. The House-passed bill for FY2007 contains $505 million in reductions to mandatory programs. The House-passed bill for FY2007 includes $505 million in reductions to mandatory programs, with $483 million in conservation and $22 million in rural development. The Senate-reported bill has $396 million in reductions, with $371 million in conservation and $25 million in rural development. The proposed reductions for FY2007 are smaller than in previous years due to savings from the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The House and Senate bills for FY2007 include reductions to mandatory programs in conservation and rural development. The 302(b) discretionary allocations are increasing in both chambers, leading to similar levels of gross discretionary program activity compared to FY2006. The FY2007 House and Senate bills include reductions in mandatory programs for conservation and rural development. The agriculture appropriations bill has 600-700 earmarks totaling about $500 million, representing 3% of the discretionary total. Earmarks are specific designations in the appropriations act for projects, locations, or institutions, with most originating in Congress. In FY2006, half of earmarks and 40% of the dollar value are for agricultural research and 40% for conservation projects. Earmarks for rural development, animal, and plant health programs make up the rest. FY2006 earmarks are higher in value and number compared to FY2000. In FY2007, Representative Flake's amendments to restrict funding for earmarked projects were defeated on the House floor. Earmark sponsors defended their projects, stating that cancelling earmarks would not necessarily reduce overall spending. Senator Coburn submitted 14 amendments to strike earmarks for agricultural research, animal control, and rural development. One of the amendments would define an earmark and require the USDA to create an Internet database identifying earmarks and their costs. Another would require earmarks to be listed in the conference report for approval by both the House and Senate. The continuing resolution allows departments to allocate funds for earmarked programs from the FY2006 appropriation. Senator Dorgan's amendment in the Senate bill facilitates travel for sales of agricultural and medical goods to Cuba. Senator Martinez submitted an amendment to strike this provision, which may be debated if the agriculture bill is brought to the floor. Similar provisions were included in previous agriculture bills but removed in conference committee. The White House threatened to veto a bill if it included a provision for travel to Cuba. Administrations have proposed new user fees for agency accounts, but the FY2007 House-passed bill and Senate-reported bill rejected these proposals. Previous agriculture bills included provisions for travel to Cuba but were removed in conference committee. The Administration proposed new user fees for USDA, CFTC, and FDA in FY2007, totaling $335 million. If Congress does not enact these fees, appropriators may need to adjust agency activities or appropriations. Separate legislation would be required to implement these fees. The appropriations bill for agriculture compares the Administration's budget request with FY2006 levels. USDA, excluding the Forest Service, receives funding through the Interior appropriations bill, totaling 95% of its total appropriation. Mandatory agriculture and conservation programs are funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), a government corporation authorized to borrow up to $30 billion from the U.S. Treasury. The CCC finances various programs including farm commodity price support, conservation, trade, and rural development. Emergency supplemental spending, such as farm disaster payments, is also covered by the CCC, which must eventually repay the borrowed funds. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) must repay funds borrowed from the Treasury due to low farm commodity prices. Congress replenishes CCC losses through annual appropriations to maintain its $30 billion borrowing authority. Funding needs are difficult to estimate as spending fluctuates based on economic and weather conditions. The CCC has a \"current indefinite appropriation\" providing necessary funds during the fiscal year. Outlays in FY2007 are projected to be $19.4 billion, initially funded through CCC borrowing authority and reimbursed through a separate appropriation. For FY2007, USDA projects CCC net expenditures at $19.4 billion, lower than FY2006. Both Senate and House bills support an indefinite appropriation of $19.74 billion for CCC, tracking net realized losses from previous years. Actual transfer amounts may differ from initial estimates. In FY2004, the transfer to CCC exceeded the initial estimate, while in FY2005, it was less than estimated. The House Appropriations committee proposed amendments to farm commodity programs in the 2002 farm bill, but they were removed due to legislating in an appropriations bill. An Obey amendment to extend the Milk Income Loss Contract program was also deleted for the same reason. The MILC program, originally authorized by the 2002 farm bill, pays farmers when milk prices fall below a target price. The program was extended until September 30, 2007, with a 0% payment rate for September 2007. The Obey amendment aims to maintain the current 34% payment rate for future years, adding $1.8 billion to the baseline budget. The CBO estimated that extending the MILC program would add $1.8 billion to the budget over the next five years. The House appropriations committee adopted a Kingston amendment for a peanut storage subsidy, but it was removed due to a point of order. The Senate-reported bill includes a similar provision to extend the peanut storage subsidy. The Administration's FY2007 budget request includes proposals to reduce farm commodity program spending. The Administration proposes reducing farm commodity program spending by $1.1 billion in FY2007 and $7.7 billion over ten years through various measures. The House-passed FY2007 agriculture appropriations bill does not address this proposal, requiring separate legislation for any changes. The House and Senate versions of the budget resolution differ on reconciliation instructions for agriculture. Similar commodity program cuts were proposed in February 2005 but were rejected by Congress. Title VIII of the Senate-reported FY2007 agriculture appropriations bill includes $4 billion in emergency funding for crop and livestock farmers in response to natural disasters. The Senate bill also includes $1 billion for crop disaster assistance, $1 billion for livestock disaster assistance, and $1.6 billion for traditional growers of grains, cotton, peanuts, and oilseeds, among other provisions. The Senate-reported FY2007 agriculture appropriations bill includes $4 billion in emergency funding for crop and livestock farmers in response to natural disasters. The bill also includes $1 billion for crop disaster assistance, $1 billion for livestock disaster assistance, and $1.6 billion for traditional growers of grains, cotton, peanuts, and oilseeds. Additionally, there is a debate over supplemental agricultural assistance in the bill, with farm state Senators advocating for assistance beyond the Gulf states affected by the 2005 hurricanes. The Administration opposes additional assistance, citing existing crop insurance and USDA support programs. The Senate-reported FY2007 agriculture appropriations bill includes emergency funding for crop and livestock farmers in response to natural disasters. The Commodity Credit Corporation funds farm income support and disaster assistance programs, administered by USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA). FSA also administers farm loan programs, conservation programs, and food assistance programs. The account funds program administration and other functions assigned to FSA, including transfers from various programs. The Senate-reported FY2007 agriculture appropriations bill includes funding for FSA salaries and expenses, with an increase compared to previous years. The House-passed bill includes language restricting USDA from closing county offices without public hearings. USDA serves as a lender of last resort for family farmers through farm loan programs. The FSA loans are used for farm real estate, operating expenses, and disaster recovery, with some loans at subsidized rates. An annual appropriation covers the federal cost of direct and guaranteed loans, including interest rate subsidies and projected loan losses. The Senate-reported bill for FY2007 would provide $146.2 million to subsidize $3.427 billion in FSA loans, an 8.5% decrease from FY2006. The Senate-reported bill for FY2007 would provide funding for FSA loans, with a decrease in loan authority compared to FY2006. Loan subsidy differences exist between the Senate bill, House bill, and Administration's request, particularly in guaranteed loan programs. The Senate bill aligns with the Administration's request for loan authority, differing from the House bill in reducing unsubsidized guaranteed operating loans. Both Senate and House bills propose increased loan authority for direct farm ownership loans compared to FY2006. The Senate-reported bill for FY2007 proposes funding for FSA loans, with a decrease in loan authority compared to FY2006. There are differences in loan subsidy levels between the Senate bill, House bill, and Administration's request, particularly in guaranteed loan programs. The Senate bill aligns with the Administration's request for loan authority, differing from the House bill in reducing unsubsidized guaranteed operating loans. Both Senate and House bills recommend increased loan authority for direct farm ownership loans compared to FY2006. The Senate bill for FY2007 does not provide new funds for emergency loans, citing sufficient carryover funds from previous supplementals. It includes language to expand eligibility for farm loans to \"commercial fisherman\" and rejects the Administration's proposal to increase fees on guaranteed loans. The proposed fee increase was 1.5% to offset $30 million. The Senate and House bills for FY2007 reject the proposed fee increase of 1.5% on guaranteed loans, providing more loan subsidy than requested by the Administration. The federal crop insurance program, administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency, offers free catastrophic insurance to producers with the option to purchase additional coverage at a subsidized rate. Policies are sold through approved private insurance companies with program losses reinsured by USDA. The annual agriculture appropriations bill provides funding for the federal crop insurance program, including discretionary funding for RMA salaries and expenses. The Senate-reported bill allocates $78.5 million for RMA, slightly higher than the House-passed level. The Administration's FY2007 request for $80.8 million includes funds for RMA to audit the expenses and performance of private crop insurance companies. The annual agriculture appropriations bill provides funding for the federal crop insurance program, including discretionary funding for RMA salaries and expenses. The Senate bill provides nearly 50% of the requested increase in funding, allowing RMA to use up to $3.6 million for data mining activities. The Administration estimates an FY2007 appropriation of $4.131 billion for the Federal Crop Insurance Fund. The FY2007 appropriations bill involves a debate on whether crop insurance companies can offer a premium reduction plan for the 2008 insurance year. The PRP allows companies to sell policies at a discount if they demonstrate cost savings. The FY2006 agriculture appropriations act prohibited RMA from implementing the PRP for the 2007 insurance year. The House-passed FY2007 agriculture appropriations bill extends the prohibition on crop insurance companies offering a premium reduction plan for the 2008 insurance year. Independent insurance agents and companies not qualifying for the plan are concerned about reduced commissions and competitiveness. Some farm groups fear cherry-picking of customers, potentially leaving some farmers uninsured. The Administration's budget proposes crop insurance legislative changes to save $140 million annually from FY2008. The USDA proposes changes to federal crop insurance, including requiring farmers to purchase crop insurance, reducing government premium payments, and increasing producer contributions. These changes aim to encourage higher coverage levels and reduce the need for disaster payments. Legislation separate from the FY2007 agriculture appropriations bill would be needed to enact these proposals, possibly in the 2007 farm bill discussions. The Senate-reported bill and the House-passed bill reject some of the Administration's proposed reductions for discretionary programs in FY2007. The Senate bill would reduce discretionary NRCS funding by $3.0 million, while the House-passed bill would reduce it by $73.8 million. The Administration's proposal aimed to reduce funding by $204.8 million. Funding for conservation programs in the FY2007 budget request was provided for FY2006 in supplemental appropriations. The Senate bill would reduce funding by $371 million, while the House and Administration request would make larger reductions. The FY2007 appropriations process shows a trend of Administrations proposing more reductions than Congress supports. All discretionary conservation programs are administered by the Natural Resources Conservation Service. The Senate provides $835.3 million for Conservation Operations in FY2007, more than the House or Administration requests. Both bills include earmarks to be funded separately from state allocations. They also reject the Administration's request for no funding for Watersheds Surveys and Planning and Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations. The Senate and House bills for FY2007 provide funding for various conservation programs, with reductions from the previous year's appropriation. Both bills reject the Administration's request for funding cuts to programs such as Watershed Rehabilitation and Resource Conservation and Development. The Senate bill allocates $5.0 million to the Healthy Forests Reserve Program, while the House bill provides no funding. Congress had previously rejected similar funding reductions in the FY2006 budget. The FY2007 Senate and House bills provide funding for conservation programs, with differences in reductions and enrollment limits. The Senate bill makes fewer reductions compared to the House bill and aligns more with the Administration's proposed reductions. The largest difference is in the Wetlands Reserve Program, with the Senate bill authorizing 250,000 acres while the House bill limits enrollment to 144,766 acres. The House bill limits enrollment to 144,766 acres, with differences in funding for conservation programs compared to the Senate bill. The House bill provides $96 million more for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, while the Senate bill offers $92.8 million more for the Conservation Security Program. Congress has enacted reductions in mandatory programs each year, with a decline in authorized funding for conservation over the past four years. Different constituencies support each program and oppose reductions from the 2002 farm bill funding commitment. The USDA's international activities are funded by discretionary appropriations and the borrowing authority of the CCC. The Senate-reported bill provides $1.489 billion for international activities, while the House-passed bill provides $1.488 billion. An additional $3.8 billion would be allocated to CCC-funded programs, bringing the total program value to an estimated $5.3 billion for FY2007. Included in the Senate-reported bill is $156.2 million for the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) to administer. The Senate-reported bill allocates $156.2 million for the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) to administer USDA's international programs, while the House allowance is $156.5 million. For P.L. 480 foreign food assistance, the Senate-reported bill provides $1.225 billion, $87 million more than FY2006, and the House bill provides $1.223 billion. All P.L. 480 appropriations would go for Title II commodity donations, administered by USAID. Both bills agree with the President's request for no funds for P.L. 480 Title I loans. The bill concurs with the President's requests for no funds for P.L. 480 Title I loans or the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust. It assumes $161 million of CCC funds for the Food for Progress program. No funds will be available for FFP from P.L. 480 Title I during FY2007. The McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program is allocated $100 million in both the Senate-reported and House-passed bills. The President's budget request proposed allowing USAID to use up to 25% of P.L. 480 Title II funds for local or regional purchases of commodities in food crises. The Senate report explicitly rejected this proposal, along with lifting the requirement that 75% of P.L. 480 Title II commodities be devoted to nonemergency or development activities. Congress also rejected similar requests in the FY2006 budget proposal. CCC Export Credit Guarantee Programs secure commercial financing of U.S. agricultural exports. CCC Export Credit Guarantee Programs secure commercial financing of U.S. agricultural exports, with an estimated FY2007 program level of $3.2 billion. Both the Senate-reported and House bill provide $5.3 million for administrative expenses, deleting statutory authority for the intermediate export credit guarantee program. This program was suspended due to a WTO ruling in the U.S.-Brazil cotton dispute, with the President's budget suggesting legislative changes. The President's budget proposed legislative changes for the Market Access Program (MAP) funding level of $200 million for FY2007. The House rejected a proposal to cut $100 million from MAP and also rejected an amendment to bar the use of funds for MAP. The Foreign Market Development Program would receive $34.5 million as authorized by the farm bill. The budget requests $28 million for the Export Enhancement Program, $35 million for the Dairy Export Incentive Program, and $90 million for Trade Adjustment Assistance to Farmers. The House bill allocates $3 million for an intensive risk management technical assistance program for farmers under the Trade Adjustment Assistance to Farmers. USDA's REE function is carried out by four agencies, including the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES). The Economic Research Service (ERS) provides economic analysis. For more information on USDA's international activities, refer to CRS Report RL33553 by [author name scrubbed]. The USDA's Economic Research Service (ERS) provides economic analysis of agriculture issues using databases and data from the National Agricultural Statistics Service. The USDA research, education, and extension budget remained flat from FY1972 to FY1991, then increased by 25% from FY1992 to FY2000. Funding levels have since trended downward to historic levels, with most increases in the budget allocated for anti-terrorism activities from FY2001 to FY2003. Funding for agricultural research and extension programs can be affected by fluctuations in state and federal appropriations. In 1998 and 2002, legislation aimed to increase competitive grants in the REE mission area by tapping into different funding sources. However, appropriations acts have since prohibited the use of these funds for their intended purposes. In recent years, appropriations for ongoing agricultural research programs have exceeded initial House and Senate proposals. However, some view these increases as not significant when adjusted for inflation. Concerns are raised about long-term funding due to high budget deficits and lower tax revenues. The Senate Appropriations Committee's bill for FY2007 allocates $2.645 billion for USDA's research, extension, and economics mission area, representing a slight increase over the House-passed bill and nearly level funding compared to FY2006. The Senate appropriations bill for FY2007 allocates $1.21 billion for USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS), with $1.13 billion for research salaries and expenses and $83.4 million for building construction and renovation. Funds are redirected to higher priority projects in areas like emerging diseases, food safety, bioenergy, obesity, and invasive species. The House measure aligns with this approach. The Senate-reported bill for FY2007 would redirect approximately $35 million of the Administration's proposed $100 million for ARS buildings and facilities. The House-passed bill would allocate $136.9 million, with $66 million going towards completing four high priority ARS research labs. The Senate bill designates 20 ARS locations to receive construction funds and provides a total of $1.21 billion for the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service. The Senate and House appropriations committees agree on not increasing competitive research funds at the expense of state allocations. The Senate bill proposes raising Hatch Act formula funds to $185.8 million, while the House bill suggests $183.3 million. Historically black land grant institutions would receive $39.1 million for research. The Senate bill does not support the Administration's request to cut funding for Special Research Grants and Federal Administration grants. The Senate bill proposes cutting funding for Special Research Grants and Federal Administration grants, providing $119.3 million for Special Grants and $41.3 million for Federal Administration grants. This is a decrease from FY2006 levels. The bill also includes $190.2 million for the National Research Initiative competitive grants program, a 5% increase from FY2006. Additionally, $467 million is allocated for continuing education and outreach activities of the Extension System in the states, with $286.6 million for Smith-Lever formula funded programs. The Committee allocated $286.6 million for Smith-Lever formula funded programs, $35.2 million for Extension at the 1890s, $63.5 million for EFNEP, and $58.7 million for competitively awarded projects under Integrated Activities. The Senate bill does not reflect the Administration's proposal to move funding for these projects. The Senate bill includes a floor amendment to increase funding to $5 million for a program assisting producers in adopting organic farming practices. The bill also allocates $76 million for USDA's Economic Research Service, with $5 million designated for an Agricultural and Rural Development Information System. Additionally, the bill includes $148.7 million for the National Agricultural Statistics Service and encourages a follow-up survey on the organic industry. The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) conducts mandatory inspection of meat, poultry, and processed egg products to ensure safety and proper labeling. The Senate-reported bill provides $865.9 million for FSIS, while the House-passed bill provides $853.2 million. The President's FY2007 budget proposed a $987 million program level, including new user fees to replace a portion of the appropriation. FSIS has been authorized to charge user fees for holiday and overtime inspections since 1919. The President's proposal aims to collect fees to cover inspection costs beyond a plant's primary approved shift. Administration officials argue that user fees are necessary for budgetary savings without compromising food safety oversight. Congress disagrees, stating that ensuring food safety is a taxpayer-funded government function. The proposed fees would have minimal impacts on producer and consumer prices. The requested increase includes $16.6 million for pay costs, $2.6 million for Salmonella control, $2 million for baseline studies, $3 million for international food safety work, and $1.9 million for IT support. The Senate allocates $16 million for food defense, while the House designates $4 million. Both recommend funding for the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act enforcement and the Humane Animal Tracking System. The House directs a $500,000 transfer to support the Miami-based Food Safety. The House bill includes a transfer of $500,000 from FSIS to the Foreign Agricultural Service to support the Food Safety Institute of the Americas in Miami. It also contains language to prohibit USDA funds for importing processed poultry from China, citing concerns about avian flu outbreaks. The Senate version does not include this provision. The largest appropriation for USDA marketing and regulatory programs goes to APHIS, responsible for protecting U.S. agriculture from pests and diseases. APHIS is responsible for protecting U.S. agriculture from pests and diseases, including avian influenza and mad cow disease. The Senate-reported bill provides a $906.4 million appropriation for APHIS, while the House-passed measure provides $927.6 million. The total program level for FY2007 is approximately $1.1 billion, including user fees. The Administration has proposed new user fees of $8 million. The Administration has proposed new user fees of $8 million to pay for some of APHIS's animal welfare activities. The Senate committee report designates $161.7 million for foreign pest and disease exclusion programs, while the House committee report provides $164.1 million. Additionally, the Senate committee report designates $273.6 million for plant and animal health monitoring and surveillance activities, and $351.6 million for pest and disease management within the total appropriation. The Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to transfer funds from the CCC to APHIS for pest and disease management, despite concerns from the Office of Management and Budget. Congressional appropriations committees support using CCC funds for emergencies in addition to allocated funds for APHIS. The Senate committee and House plan would fund emerging plant pests (EPP) at $107.4 million and $114.8 million in FY2007, respectively. This is compared to an Administration request of $126.9 million and a FY2006 level of $99.2 million. The money would be divided among various plant problems, with allocations for citrus pests and diseases, Glassy-winged sharpshooter/Pierces' Disease, Emerald Ash Borer, Sudden Oak Death, Asian Long-horned Beetle, and Karnal bunt. The House adopted a Weiner amendment to provide $23 million for emerging plant pests, specifically for control of the Asian longhorned beetle. The funding would come from a cut of $26 million from the Department's common computing environment account. The Senate-reported bill includes $70.4 million for avian flu activities in APHIS, with $56.7 million for the Administration's request for the highly. The Senate and House have allocated funding for avian flu activities in APHIS, with the Senate expecting additional funds to be transferred if needed. The House committee report designates specific amounts for HPAI activities, including surveillance, diagnosis, wildlife surveillance, preparedness, communication, and international capacity building. The House version also includes funding for the LPAI program. The Senate committee report designates $13.7 million in FY2007 for the LPAI program, while the House version designates $16.7 million as requested by USDA. $2.8 million is allocated for surveillance through the National Poultry Improvement Plan and $5.3 million for surveillance in live bird markets. Both reports mention $12 million for AI indemnities provided in FY2006. The HPAI monitoring and surveillance line item started with the pandemic flu supplemental in December 2005, continuing efforts from FY2004-05. The surveillance program includes monitoring for wild and migratory birds, increased smuggling interdiction, and live bird monitoring and control. In FY2006, APHIS received $13.8 million for avian flu in regular appropriations, plus $71.5 million in emergency supplemental appropriations. The emergency appropriations were part of the $3.8 billion pandemic flu supplemental in Division B of P.L. 109-148, which included $111 million for agencies in the agriculture appropriations bill. Both the Senate and House committee reports designate $17.2 million for BSE surveillance within the APHIS appropriation. The USDA received $17.2 million for BSE surveillance to conduct 40,000 animal tests annually. Two cattle out of 750,000 tested positive for BSE over two years. The Department plans to scale back testing after a peer review. Representative Kucinich proposed but later withdrew an amendment to maintain testing levels. The House Appropriations Committee rejected an amendment to prevent USDA from restricting private BSE testing. Several private companies, led by Creekstone Beef of Kansas, are seeking USDA approval to test all cattle for BSE, despite opposition citing scientific limitations. Congress is frustrated with delays in reopening Japanese and Korean markets for U.S. beef. A Senate bill includes a provision for retaliatory tariffs on Japanese imports if U.S. beef access is not granted. The most recent U.S. BSE case was reported in an older Alabama cow in early March 2006. The USDA reported a BSE case in an older Alabama cow in early March 2006, which was destroyed and did not enter the food supply. There are challenges in tracking livestock for disease purposes, leading to the need for a national identification program. The USDA has allocated funds for this effort, but a fully operational animal ID system is not expected until early 2009 due to differing views in the industry. The Senate and House bills align with the Administration's budget request, with the House version requiring the Secretary to provide a complete report before funds can be used. The House Appropriations Committee requires a detailed plan for the animal ID program before funds can be used. The Senate report asks the GAO to review USDA's progress and emphasizes collaboration with private industry. Amendments to prohibit funding and create a mandatory ID system were defeated. The USDA's Animal Marketing Service (AMS) is responsible for promoting U.S. agricultural products and relies on user fees for funding. AMS is expected to receive additional federal funds in FY2007, with the House-passed level at $104.9 million. The Administration's FY2007 proposal recommended about $100 million. The Administration's FY2007 proposal recommended about $100 million for the USDA's Animal Marketing Service (AMS), compared to an estimated $114 million in FY2006. The Senate and House bills do not include the Administration's plan to reduce funding by $14 million through new user fees. The Senate's anticipated decrease in budget authority reflects reduced spending on the development of a new Supply Chain Management System. The Senate committee report recommends $15.3 million for the Pesticide program. The Senate committee report recommends funding for various programs including the Pesticide Data Program and the Pesticide Recordkeeping Program. It also highlights the requirement from the 2002 farm bill to purchase additional fruits and vegetables annually. The House version differs in funding allocations, but maintains support for programs like the Microbiological Data Program and the Farmers Market Promotion Program. Both versions endorse an Administration proposal within the AMS total budget. The Senate and House versions of the AMS total budget endorse increasing National Organic Program funding to over $3 million in FY2007. The Senate bill includes $10 million for specialty crop block grants, while the House bill allocates $15.6 million for the program. These grants aim to promote specialty crops like fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, and nursery crops. The Specialty Crops Competitive Act of 2004 authorizes up to $54 million annually through FY2009 for these grants. The Senate and House versions of the AMS total budget endorse increasing National Organic Program funding to over $3 million in FY2007. Another branch is charged with ensuring competition and fair-trading practices in livestock and meat markets. The House-passed bill would provide $39.7 million for GIPSA salaries and expenses, compared to the Administration's FY2007 request of nearly $42 million. The Administration proposes to reduce its requested appropriation by nearly $20 million through new user fees, which neither the House nor Senate versions adopt. GIPSA's Packers and Stockyards branch is working to improve its oversight of livestock markets. The Stockyards branch is enhancing its oversight of livestock markets amidst concerns about market concentration and changes in business relationships. GIPSA is supervising a study on livestock marketing practices funded by a congressional appropriation. In 2006, GIPSA faced criticism for enforcement shortcomings. The House committee is optimistic about recent administration efforts. The committee report expressed encouragement for the Administration's efforts to address issues in USDA's rural development mission area. Three agencies, including RHS, RBS, and RUS, are responsible for this area. The Senate-reported bill for FY2007 recommends $2.223 billion in discretionary budget authority for USDA rural development programs. The Senate bill for FY2007 provides $14.247 billion in budget authority for USDA rural development loan and grant programs, which is $280 million less than FY2006. The bill focuses on increasing rural development loan authority, particularly for rural electric loans, and rejects the Administration's proposal for zero funding for certain programs. Additionally, the Senate bill would block $25 million in funding for mandatory programs authorized by the 2002 farm bill. The Senate bill for FY2007 provides $14.247 billion in budget authority for USDA rural development loan and grant programs, which is $280 million less than FY2006. It would block $10 million of the broadband program and limit the value-added grant program to not more than $28 million. The bill recommends $25 million in discretionary funding for the program and $715 million for the three RCAP accounts, which is $20.0 million above FY2006 levels. The Senate bill for FY2007 provides $14.247 billion for USDA rural development programs, with reductions in water and waste water subsidies and increases in grant programs. Funding is allocated for community facilities, utilities, and business development accounts. The bill also includes directed spending for water and waste water improvements for Native tribes, colonias, and Alaskan rural areas. The Senate bill for FY2007 recommends funding for various rural development programs, including grants for Alaskan rural and native communities, Rural Community Development Grants, Economic Impact Initiative Grants, High Energy Cost Grants, Rural Business Enterprise Grants, and Empowerment Zones/Enterprise Communities program. Additionally, the bill allocates $1.144 billion in budget authority for RHS loans and grants, a 22% decrease from FY2006. The Senate bill for FY2007 recommends funding for various rural development programs, including grants for Alaskan rural and native communities, Rural Community Development Grants, Economic Impact Initiative Grants, High Energy Cost Grants, Rural Business Enterprise Grants, and Empowerment Zones/Enterprise Communities program. The bill allocates $1.144 billion in budget authority for RHS loans and grants, a 22% decrease from FY2006. In addition, the bill recommends $220.6 million in subsidies to support $5.029 billion in loan authorization, with differences in loan authorization levels compared to the House measure and Administration requests. The Senate bill for FY2007 recommends funding for various rural development programs, including multi-family loan guarantees (Section 538) and rental housing loans (Section 515). The bill proposes doubling the loan authority of Section 538 to $198 million and recommends $335.4 million for the rental assistance program (Section 521). Additionally, the bill recommends $33.6 million for mutual and self-help housing grants and $30.6 million for the farm labor account (Section 514/516). The Senate bill for FY2007 recommends $28.0 million for the multifamily housing revitalization program, $92.0 million for rural development programs, including loan authorization levels, and $10.0 million for rural Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Communities programs. The Senate bill for FY2007 recommends $94.7 million in budget authority to support RUS's loan and grant programs, with $43.9 million for electric and telecommunication loans. This is an increase of $3.72 billion in loan authorization compared to the House bill. The Senate bill for FY2007 recommends $3.72 billion more in loan authorization than the House bill, and $2.57 billion more than enacted for FY2006. The Senate measure's recommendation for subsidies is slightly higher than the House bill, but lower than FY2006. Loan authorization levels in the rural electrification portfolio are the major sources of difference between the request and the Senate measure. The Senate bill recommends $30.0 million for Distance Learning/Telemedicine grants, $5.3 million more than the request and the House bill. The Senate bill for FY2007 recommends $500.0 million for broadband loans, $143.6 million more than the request (+40%) and $19.0 million less than FY2006 (-4%). The recommended loan subsidy is nearly the same as requested and constant with FY2006. Additionally, $10.0 million is recommended for broadband grants, about $1.0 million more than enacted for FY2006. The Administration is requesting no funding for the broadband grant program for FY2007. Funding for domestic food assistance represents over one-half of the USDA's budget, with programs like the WIC program, CSFP, and nutrition program administration being mandatory entitlements. For FY2006, P.L. 109-97 allocated $58.9 billion for domestic food assistance programs, including the Food Stamp Act, child nutrition programs, WIC, CSFP, and nutrition program administration. However, actual spending is projected to be $53.7 billion, with the difference due to contingency appropriations, lower costs, and expected carryovers into FY2007. The Senate-reported bill for FY2007 would appropriate $57.1 billion for domestic food assistance, slightly more than requested. The House-passed bill provides $56.8 billion, similar to the Senate and Administration requests. The Administration proposed $57 billion for FY2007, a decrease from FY2006, with estimated spending of $54.3 billion. The FY2007 appropriations for domestic food assistance proposed \"full funding\" except for the CSFP and WIC programs. The budget estimates depend on economic conditions, hurricane costs, and changes to program rules. The appropriations include changes to program terms and funding for free fresh fruit and vegetables in schools. Most of the Administration's proposed changes in program rules were not adopted. The Senate-reported measure includes appropriations for specialty crops and livestock, providing $100 million in grants to states. These block grants can support state food bank programs and other nutrition assistance initiatives. The appropriations cover various programs under the Food Stamp Act, including the regular Food Stamp program, Nutrition Assistance Block Grant for Puerto Rico, Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations, and nutrition assistance grant programs in American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The Senate-reported measure includes appropriations for specialty crops and livestock, providing $100 million in grants to states for nutrition assistance initiatives. The bills in the Senate and House would appropriate $37.865 billion for Food Stamp Act programs, slightly less than requested by the Administration. The Administration's requested $3 billion contingency fund is included in the bills. In FY2007, there is a $2.8 billion reduction from FY2006 in anticipated spending for food stamp programs. Regular food stamp spending would be around $33.2 billion, with no increase due to an improved economy and no hurricane-related costs. Puerto Rico's block grant would see a $41 million increase to $1.6 billion as mandated by law. Funding for TEFAP commodities and the Community Food Project remains the same as FY2006 at $140 million and $5 million, respectively. However, there is a proposed small reduction in funding for the FDPIR, resulting in a net decrease of $2 million to $77.5 million. In FY2007, there is a $2.8 billion reduction in anticipated spending for food stamp programs. The Senate bill would appropriate $13.654 billion for child nutrition programs, including a $300 million contingency fund. The bill includes a $300 million contingency fund and additional funding for expanding the free fresh fruit and vegetable program in schools. The Administration requested $13.645 billion for child nutrition programs in FY2007, up from $12.7 billion in FY2006. This covers various programs like School Lunch, Breakfast, Summer Food Service, and nutrition education. The Administration's request for child nutrition programs in FY2007 would be an estimated $13.8 billion, compared to $13.1 billion in FY2006. The Senate bill provides $5.264 billion for the WIC program, $20 million more than the House recommendation and $64 million more than requested. Differences in funding reflect changed estimates of program participation and food costs. The House and Senate bills reject rule changes affecting the WIC program proposed by the Administration. FY2007 WIC spending is anticipated at about $5.35 billion, up from $5.2 billion in FY2006. The Administration's $5.2 billion FY2007 request was nearly the same as the FY2006 appropriation. Spending was projected to be the same as FY2006, but $200 million over FY2005. The requested FY2007 amount was predicated on changes in WIC rules not adopted in the House and Senate. The Senate and House bills for FY2007 reject the Administration's proposed rule changes for the WIC program. The Senate bill would appropriate $179 million for commodity assistance programs, while the House bill provides $189 million. Both bills reject the Administration's request to terminate the CSFP and include funding for various food assistance programs. The Senate and House bills for FY2007 include small amounts of added funding for TEFAP, the WIC farmers' market program, and assistance for Pacific Islands. The Administration requested $70 million for this account, less than the $188 million available for FY2006 due to proposing to end the CSFP. The Senate-reported measure includes $143 million for nutrition program administration, rejecting most of the Administration's proposals for new initiatives. The FY2007 bills include funding for nutrition education and program integrity initiatives, with $2.5 million allocated for the Congressional Hunger Center. The Administration requested $160 million, up from $141 million in FY2006. Special provisions in the bills relate to domestic food assistance programs, including expanding free fresh fruit and vegetables in schools. The House and Senate bills maintain rules for programs under the Food Stamp Act, ignoring proposed changes by the Administration. The House and Senate bills for FY2007 continue rules for food stamp eligibility, terminate a bison meat purchase program, and allow commodity funding for distribution costs. The House bill also includes provisions for sponsors of legal aliens receiving food stamps. Additional provisions from the Administration's budget request were rejected. The House and Senate bills for FY2007 include provisions related to food stamp eligibility, termination of a bison meat purchase program, and allowing commodity funding for distribution costs. The Senate bill also addresses WIC rules by barring approval of new retailers whose main revenue comes from WIC food items. The House bill does not include any changes to WIC rules. The Administration proposed a cap on grants for nutrition services, an income limit for automatic WIC services, and restrictions on using Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition program funds for sales taxes. The bills continue funding for CSFP and the Congressional Hunger Center, with the Senate bill adding Minnesota to simplified Summer Food Service program rules. The Senate and House bills reject the Administration's proposal to provide no new funds for the free fresh fruit and vegetable program in schools. Instead, they provide additional funding, with the Senate appropriating $9 million to support the program in selected schools in 14 states, 3 Indian reservations, and 3 additional states. The House bill proposes $25 million for the free fresh fruit and vegetable program, allowing expansion to selected schools in all states. This represents a substantial increase from the $15 million available in FY2006. The Senate-reported measure removes a bar against using funds for studies and evaluations from food stamp, child nutrition, and WIC budgets. The FDA regulates food safety. The FDA, now under the Department of Health and Human Services, regulates food safety, drugs, biologics, and medical devices. Its budget consists of direct appropriations and user fees. The Senate-reported bill for FY2007 would allocate $1.947 billion to FDA, an increase from previous years. The Senate-reported bill for FY2007 would allocate $1.947 billion to FDA, an increase from previous years. The President's budget justification includes various user fees totaling $401.9 million, with different calculations by the House and Senate committees. The Senate Committee's FY2007 bill allocates $1.947 billion to FDA, with discrepancies in user fee calculations. The budget outlines funding for pandemic preparedness, food defense, and new activities. The House and Senate differ in their proposed allocations for these programs. The Senate Committee's FY2007 bill allocates $1.947 billion to FDA. The House-passed bill includes increases for personalized medicine, drug safety, and human tissues. The President's budget request also includes funding for cost of living pay increases. The House-passed bill and Senate-reported bill would provide additional funding for generic drug review, consolidation at the White Oak campus, and rental payments to GSA. The President's proposed budget includes reductions totaling $52.3 million, with the Senate-reported bill restoring $29.7 million to CFSAN and NCTR. Additionally, the Senate-reported bill expands on financial conflicts of interest for FDA advisory committee members. The Senate-reported bill addresses financial conflicts of interest for FDA advisory committee members by allowing waivers with disclosure requirements and mandating detailed reports on efforts to find conflict-free individuals. The Senate-reported bill does not include a House-passed amendment regarding FDA funding for drug importation. The annual struggle over drug importation may arise in the conference committee. Table 11 shows budget authority for different program areas in various bills. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is also mentioned. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is an independent regulatory agency overseeing derivatives markets, including trading on futures exchanges, fraud prevention, and investor protection. The Senate-reported bill allocates $99.5 million for the CFTC in FY2007, a $2.1 million increase from FY2006. The House-passed bill provides $109.4 million, a 12% increase from FY2006 but $17.6 million less than the Administration's request of $127.0 million. The Administration requested a large increase in funding for the CFTC, but both the House and Senate bills rejected the proposal to fund the agency through transaction fees. The proposed fee would be about six or seven cents per transaction on futures exchanges to cover regulatory costs. Previous administrations have unsuccessfully called for similar fees, with the futures industry arguing against them as anti-competitive. The futures industry opposes a proposed transaction fee on futures exchanges to fund the CFTC, arguing it could be anti-competitive. The fee, about six or seven cents per transaction, is seen as relatively modest and may not significantly impact trading decisions. The CFTC is the only federal financial regulator not funded by the entities it regulates."
