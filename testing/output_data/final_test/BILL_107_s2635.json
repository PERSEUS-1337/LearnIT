In 1609, Englishman Henry Hudson and French explorer Samuel de Champlain made significant voyages, leading to early European exploration and discovery of America. The early contacts between Native Americans and Europeans in the New World led to the establishment of Dutch and English settlements in Albany, New York, and French Quebec settlements as far south as Lake George. These early settlements influenced the history, culture, law, commerce, and traditions of the United States. In 1807, Robert Fulton's steamboat Clermont successfully inaugurated steam navigation on a commercial basis, marking a significant event in history. The Hudson-Fulton-Champlain Commemoration Commission was established to observe the significant historical events related to navigation, commerce, naval warfare, and international relations in the United States. The National Park Service in New York owns resources related to early US history and the Hudson River Valley, and in 2002, the State of New York created a commission for this purpose. The Hudson-Fulton-Champlain Commemoration Commission was established to ensure a suitable national observance in 2009 of the anniversaries of Henry Hudson, Robert Fulton, and Samuel de Champlain's voyages. The commission aims to assist in providing an excellent visitor experience, promoting interaction with natural and cultural resources, and recognizing the diverse communities along the Hudson River and Lake Champlain. Additionally, it seeks to facilitate international involvement in the observances. The Fulton-Champlain 2009 observances aim to support marketing efforts for commemorative items and assist in developing heritage tourism and economic benefits for the United States. SEC. 3.
