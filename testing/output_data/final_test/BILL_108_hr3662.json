The majority of States are facing their worst fiscal crisis since World War II due to soaring healthcare costs. Healthcare spending currently accounts for approximately 30 percent of total State budgets. State revenues are falling dramatically while spending pressure has grown, leading to the largest spending cut since 1979. State drug expenditures for various groups are rising each year as more Americans lose jobs and health care coverage. States' share of Medicaid costs grew by 13 percent in fiscal year 2002 and is expected to rise by 8 percent in fiscal year 2003 and 4.9 percent in fiscal year 2004. The National Governor's Association urged Congress to review Federal laws contributing to high prescription drug costs. Some States are looking to import drugs from foreign countries to lower costs, as foreign nations and federally funded programs obtain drugs at lower prices. The Act allows states and localities to purchase prescription drugs domestically at prices similar to those in foreign nations, potentially reducing prices by up to 40 percent. The purpose is to provide prescription drugs at substantially lower prices for States and local governments and residents.
