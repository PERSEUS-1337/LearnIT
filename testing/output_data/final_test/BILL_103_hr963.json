    "content": "The Act titled \"Local Government Interstate Waste Control Act\" addresses the interstate transportation and disposal of municipal solid waste under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. It introduces a new section, SEC. 4011, to regulate this process. The Local Government Interstate Waste Control Act, under SEC. 4011, restricts the receipt of out-of-state waste by landfill or waste disposal facilities unless authorized by the local government through formal action. Only one authorization per facility is required, and notification must be given to the Governor, adjoining local governments, and Indian tribes. The Local Government Interstate Waste Control Act requires local governments to obtain authorization for out-of-state waste disposal facilities. Information such as facility description, site map, and environmental characteristics must be provided for inspection. The curr_chunk discusses the characteristics of the site, environmental controls, waste residuals management, site access controls, and roadway improvements for a waste disposal facility. The curr_chunk provides information on the timing and extent of increased local truck traffic, required permits, personnel requirements, employment statistics, violations of environmental laws, enforcement proceedings, and corrective actions for a waste disposal facility. The curr_chunk outlines the information required by State law regarding gifts, contributions, compliance with solid waste management plans, and notification procedures for receiving municipal solid waste from outside the State. It also specifies the need for public notification and comment before authorization is granted. The curr_chunk details limitations on the applicability of State law to landfills in operation that were compliant with regulations before the enactment of the section. The curr_chunk specifies exemptions for landfills under construction or in the planning process from certain state regulations if they have obtained authorization from the local government before the enactment of the section. The curr_chunk outlines conditions for termination of exemptions for landfills failing to meet state regulations, while exempting incinerators and waste disposal facilities accepting waste from outside the state. The curr_chunk discusses the need for authorization for waste disposal facilities to accept waste generated outside the state, treating expansions as separate facilities. The curr_chunk outlines the conditions under which a waste disposal facility can be expanded to accept waste from outside the state without additional authorization. The text outlines conditions for expanding a waste disposal facility to accept out-of-state waste without additional authorization from the local government. The Governor may restrict out-of-state municipal solid waste disposal if requested by affected local government and solid waste planning unit, without additional authorization needed from the local government. The Governor can limit out-of-state municipal solid waste disposal at landfills in the State to the amount received in 1991 or a 12-month period in 1991-1992, as determined by the Governor. Before making this request, the local government and solid waste planning unit must provide public notice and opportunity for comment. The Governor must respond consistently to requests from affected local governments regarding out-of-state municipal solid waste disposal, without discrimination based on landfill or state of origin. Governors intending to limit out-of-state waste disposal must submit relevant data to the Administrator within 60 days of the enactment of this section. The Administrator must notify the Governor and the public about out-of-state municipal solid waste disposal data for 1991-1992. Governors can restrict waste disposal if consistent with the law. Under this subsection, actions may be restricted if they conflict with State law or violate existing contracts for landfill waste disposal. This includes contracts with local governments and out-of-state waste disposal agreements in effect before May 31, 1992. After January 1, 1997, subsections (a) through (e) of this section will not apply in a State unless each operating municipal solid waste landfill meets certain standards or is on a schedule to stop receiving waste by January 1, 2000 and implement a closure plan. Definitions in this section include the term 'affected local government' referring to elected officials of the city, town, borough, county, or parish where a waste disposal facility is located.
