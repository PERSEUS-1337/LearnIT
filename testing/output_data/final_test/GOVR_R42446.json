    "content": "The Federal Pell Grant program, authorized by the Higher Education Act of 1965, is the largest federal grant aid for postsecondary education students, providing $31 billion to 8.2 million undergraduates in FY2015. Pell Grants are need-based aid and constitute 23% of all HEA Title IV student aid. The program was reauthorized through FY2017 by the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) and other legislative acts provided significant funding increases and changes to the Pell Grant program, including a $619 increase in the maximum award for AY 2009-2010, indefinite mandatory appropriations, and amendments to eligibility criteria. The Pell Grant program received additional mandatory funds in FY2012 and future years through various legislative acts, including the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the FY2012 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The program underwent changes to eligibility criteria and award rules, with the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 allowing reduced awards for individuals in career pathway programs. This report analyzes program costs, funding, recipient characteristics, and the program's role in federal student aid distribution. The Pell Grant program provides grants to needy undergraduates without repayment. Federal funding ensures all eligible students at eligible institutions receive Pell Grants. The report also discusses legislative issues, program structure, student eligibility, and the role of postsecondary institutions. Appendices detail grant calculations, recipient count history, and common acronyms. Pell Grants are awarded to eligible students at eligible institutions through the FAFSA process. The EFC is calculated based on the information provided in the FAFSA. Pell Grants are portable and follow students to their enrolled postsecondary institutions. To receive Pell Grants, students must enroll in approved coursework at eligible institutions. The grant amount is determined by financial need and maximum award limits set annually. Students must meet general Title IV aid requirements and specific Pell Grant program criteria. Students must be enrolled in an HEA Title IV eligible program at an eligible institution to earn a degree or certificate. They must demonstrate an ability to benefit from education, maintain satisfactory academic progress, and may be disqualified for federal student aid if convicted of drug possession or sale. Students receiving HEA Title IV student aid may be disqualified for federal student aid for various reasons, including defaulting on a Title IV student loan, failing to repay an overpayment, or not meeting citizenship requirements. Males aged 18-25 must register with the selective service system. Pell Grant eligibility requirements include being a full-time or part-time undergraduate at a non-foreign institution, with a lifetime cap of 12 full-time semesters. The Pell Grant program provides financial assistance to financially needy students, with eligibility determined by award rules. Students with intellectual disabilities can enroll in a transition program without needing a high school diploma. Ineligible students include those incarcerated or civilly committed for a sexual offense. Pell Grant awards are based on annual eligibility. The Pell Grant program determines annual awards based on need, with the neediest students receiving the highest grants. Awards are prorated for part-time students and are calculated independently of other financial aid. The Pell Grant program determines annual awards based on need, with the neediest students receiving the highest grants. The total maximum award amount is the maximum Pell Grant amount a student may receive in an award year, consisting of a discretionary base maximum award and a mandatory \"add-on\" award. The actual amount may be reduced according to award rules. The mandatory \"add-on\" award is a specified amount in the HEA that increases the discretionary base maximum award to yield a total maximum award amount. It is funded through permanent mandatory appropriations. The add-on amount for AY2013-2014 and onwards increases with inflation according to a statutorily defined formula. The add-on amount for AY2013-2014 and onwards is determined by adjusting the total maximum award for inflation and subtracting the discretionary base maximum award, rounding to the nearest $5. The mandatory add-on amount for award years is calculated by adjusting the previous year's total maximum award for inflation, subtracting $4,860, and rounding to the nearest $5. For AY2014-2015 and AY2015-2016, the amounts were $870 and $915 respectively. An estimated amount of $985 was calculated for AY2016-2017. From AY2018-2019 onwards, the add-on amount will be the same as AY2017-2018. Prior to the SAFRA Act, the maximum Pell Grant was specified annually in the HEA. The authorized maximum award and total maximum award were equal in only three instances during the program's history. The elimination of the authorized maximum award levels from the HEA has no impact on the determination of maximum award levels. The qualifying minimum Pell Grant award is the minimum amount of Pell aid on which qualification for the program is based. Under the SAFRA Act, the qualifying minimum award in AY2010-2011 and AY2011-2012 was equal to 5% of the total maximum award. For example, in AY2011-2012 the qualifying minimum award was $277, or approximately 5% of $5,550. The FY2012 Consolidated Appropriations Act revised the basis for determining the qualifying minimum Pell Grant award to be 10% of the total maximum award. The bump award, which was an additional increase to the qualifying minimum award, was eliminated for AY2012-2013 and future years. The effective minimum Pell Grant award is now equal to 10% of the total maximum award, with no additional aid added under current rules. The bump award was eliminated starting in July 2012, making the qualifying minimum award and effective minimum award the same. Table 1 displays award levels from 1973-1974 to AY2018-2019 and beyond, including the total maximum award and the primary Pell Grant award rule. The SAFRA Act determines a student's Pell Grant award based on the total maximum Pell Grant minus the student's EFC or Cost of Attendance minus EFC, with a reduction for less-than-full-time enrollment. Most students receive aid based on the first condition. An exception applies to students in eligible career pathway programs, where the award is based on the discretionary maximum Pell Grant or Cost of Attendance. The EFC is the amount expected to be contributed by a student and their family towards education costs, based on income, assets, and expenses. Different EFC formulas are used for dependent and independent students. The Expected Family Contribution (EFC) is determined based on financial information provided on the FAFSA by dependent and independent students. Only dependent students and independent students with dependents other than a spouse can qualify for an automatic zero EFC under certain conditions, such as low income and meeting specific criteria. Independent students without dependents are not eligible for an automatic zero EFC. The Expected Family Contribution (EFC) is determined based on financial information provided on the FAFSA by dependent and independent students. Independent students without dependents are not eligible for an automatic zero EFC. A student with a zero EFC would receive the total maximum Pell Grant award if enrolled full-time for a full year at an institution where the COA is equal to or exceeds the total maximum Pell Grant award. The income threshold for automatically qualifying for a zero EFC was changed to $23,000 in AY2012-2013 and increased to $25,000 for AY2016-2017. The income threshold for automatically qualifying for a zero EFC was changed to $25,000 for AY2016-2017. The maximum EFC for Pell Grant eligibility was adjusted to 90% of the total maximum award starting in AY2012-2013. In AY2015-2016, a student with an EFC of $5,198 would receive a minimum award of $588. For Pell Grant awards, the cost of attendance includes room and board, dependent care costs for students with dependents, and may be based on average costs at the institution. From 2009 to 2011, students could receive \"year-round\" Pell Grants with up to two awards in a year, allowing for support during summer terms. Students had to be enrolled at least half-time to qualify. The HEOA provision for Pell Grant eligibility was eliminated in 2011. Institutions must meet specific criteria to participate in Title IV programs, including the Pell Grant program. Eligible institutions can be public or private nonprofit, for-profit, or vocational institutions. Their role in the Pell Grant program involves determining eligibility for students. An eligible institution's role in the Pell Grant program includes determining student eligibility, disbursing awards, adjusting awards as needed, record keeping, and reporting to ED. Pell Grants are calculated based on COA, enrollment status, and EFC, with payments made in installments over the academic year. Funds are disbursed by schools to cover tuition, fees, and living expenses, with any remaining funds given directly to the student. ED provides funds to schools for Pell Grant awards. The Pell Grant program provides funds to schools for disbursement to eligible students, with an administrative cost allowance. The program aims to improve access to higher education for financially needy individuals, reaching 41% of undergraduates in AY2011-2012. The number of Pell Grant recipients has increased significantly since its inception in AY1973-1974, reaching a peak of 9.4 million recipients. The number of Pell Grant recipients reached a peak of 9.4 million in AY2011-2012 before declining to 8.7 million in 2013-2014. Pell Grant recipients are primarily low-income, with 61% of dependent recipients having a family income at or below $30,000 in AY2013-2014. Independent recipients generally have lower incomes than dependent recipients, with 83% having lower incomes in the same year. In AY2013-2014, 83% of independent Pell Grant recipients had incomes below $30,000. Some awards also go to mid- and high-income families, but they are smaller and mainly for dependent students with multiple family members in postsecondary education. Many low-income undergraduates don't receive Pell Grants because they didn't apply for aid. Table 3 compares the percentage of dependent and independent undergraduates from different income levels who were Pell recipients in AY2007-2008 and AY2011-2012. The data shows an increase in Pell Grant recipients in AY2011-2012 compared to AY2007-2008, with higher rates among aid applicants than total undergraduates. For example, in AY2011-2012, 81.8% of dependent undergraduates from families with incomes below $10,000 received Pell Grants, compared to 63.8% in AY2007-2008. In AY2011-2012, 65.0% of independent undergraduates with total income under $5,000 were Pell recipients, while 81.3% of aid applicants in that income category received Pell Grants. Participation rates in the Pell program decrease as income rises for both dependent and independent students. Over 81% of dependent undergraduates with family income under $10,000 were Pell recipients, compared to less than 5% with family income over $60,000. Some low-income independent undergraduates did not receive Pell Grants in AY2007-2008 or AY2011-2012. In AY2011-2012, 82.1% of dependents and 65.2% of independents received Pell Grants. The discrepancy may be due to low-income students not applying for aid, family assets making them ineligible, or finding the application process too complex. Some low-income students who did not apply for aid may have been eligible, but believed they were not or had sufficient resources. Some students find the federal financial aid application process too complex or are unaware of its availability. Aid outreach efforts at low-cost institutions may be lacking. Some students and families choose not to disclose financial information, leading to a lack of aid applications. Pell Grant distribution by institution sector has been a focus, showing that Pell Grant recipients are more likely to attend private for-profit institutions. The Pell Grant is intended to be the foundation aid for financially needy undergraduates. Pell Grant recipients attend different types of institutions compared to undergraduates who do not receive a Pell Grant. The purchasing power of the Pell Grant and the distribution of other federal aid to Pell recipients are analyzed to assess its effectiveness as foundation aid. In AY2013-2014, the total maximum Pell Grant covered a percentage of average tuition, fees, room, and board at different types of institutions. The maximum grant peaked in the 1970s but lost ground in the mid-1980s to early 1990s compared to average charges. In AY2013-2014, the maximum Pell Grant covered 68% of average in-state tuition and fees at four-year public institutions, exceeding the average at two-year public institutions. However, it only covered 41% of the average tuition and fees at for-profit institutions. In AY2013-2014, the maximum Pell Grant covered 41% of average tuition and fees at four-year public institutions and only 19% at four-year private institutions. Published tuition, fees, and room and board have consistently risen faster than average prices in the economy. The role of federal student aid, including Pell Grants, in rising published prices needs examination. In AY2011-2012, 77% of undergraduates who received federal need-based aid were Pell recipients, while 67% borrowed Direct Subsidized Loans. Only 32.4% of Pell recipients relied solely on the grant for college costs, with many also participating in other federal aid programs. In AY2011-2012, many Pell recipients also borrowed Direct Subsidized Loans, with an average amount of $3,441. Pell Grant aid covered 23.6% of the cost of attendance on average, while all loan sources covered an additional 22.7% for these recipients. Total aid from all sources supplied less than Pell Grant aid for Pell Grant recipients. In AY2011-2012, Pell Grant recipients borrowed Direct Subsidized Loans averaging $3,441, covering 23.6% of the cost of attendance. Total aid from all sources supplied less than two-thirds of the cost of attendance for Pell Grant recipients. Family income affects the percentage of cost covered by Pell Grants, with borrowing propensity varying based on institution type and income availability. At public two-year institutions, borrowing rates were lower than the average for Pell Grant recipients. Costs for the Pell Grant program are award year-specific and affected by the number of students who apply for aid. Program costs have fluctuated over the years but have stabilized since AY2011-2012 due to changes in appropriations acts. The Pell Grant program costs have fluctuated over the years, doubling from AY2007-2008 to AY2009-2010 and increasing by 18% in AY2010-2011. However, costs have since declined and stabilized due to changes in enrollment trends and recent provisions by Congress. The Pell Grant program costs escalated significantly from AY2008-2009 to AY2010-2011 due to legislative changes, increased student enrollment, and a weakened economy. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act led to a substantial increase in the maximum Pell Grant award. The Pell Grant program saw a significant increase in costs from AY2008-2009 to AY2010-2011 due to legislative changes, increased student enrollment, and a weakened economy. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act led to a substantial increase in the maximum Pell Grant award, with estimates showing a cost of $500-700 million per $100 increase. The number of students applying for Pell Grants also rose by 74% during this period, potentially influenced by efforts to simplify the FAFSA application process. Increased FAFSA applications may be due to efforts to promote federal financial aid availability and coordination between ED and the U.S. Department of Labor. Economic trends, such as a weak job market, may have also contributed to higher Pell Grant costs. During a weak job market, displaced workers may have returned to college for new skills. Financial aid adjustments were made for unemployed individuals. Legislative changes expanded Pell Grant eligibility. The legislative changes expanded Pell Grant eligibility, benefiting students by allowing \"year-round\" Pell Grants with significant impact on program costs. Regulatory interpretation played a key role in defining eligibility criteria for individuals exceeding 24 credit hours. The legislative changes expanded Pell Grant eligibility by allowing students to receive grants for more credit hours in an award year. This led to higher discretionary costs due to various changes in need analysis calculations. Pell Grant program costs have generally decreased, but there was a slight increase from AY2013-2014 to AY2014-2015. Since AY2010-2011, Pell Grant program costs have decreased overall. However, from AY2013-2014 to AY2014-2015, the increase in mandatory add-on award costs outweighed the decrease in discretionary award costs. Factors contributing to cost reduction include leveling of base and add-on awards, raising qualifying minimum award, reducing income threshold for automatic zero EFC, and eliminating year-round Pell Grants. Beginning in AY2011-2012, changes were made to Pell Grants, including reducing lifetime eligibility from 18 to 12 semesters starting in AY2012-2013. Qualifying for Pell Grant aid now requires demonstrating an ability to benefit from postsecondary education. Undergraduate enrollment has been declining since AY2010-2011. The FY2012 Consolidated Appropriations Act eliminated the ability to benefit provision for individuals who first enrolled in a program of study on or after July 1, 2012. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, included provisions enabling a subset of students to demonstrate an ability to benefit by enrolling in an eligible career pathway program after July 1, 2014. Total undergraduate fall enrollment in degree-granting postsecondary institutions has declined from 18.1 million in 2010 to 17.5 million in 2013, leading to a reduction in Pell Grant recipients from 9.4 million in AY2011-2012 to 8.7 million. The Pell Grant program has seen a decrease in recipients from 9.4 million in AY2011-2012 to 8.7 million in AY2013-2014. Despite currently operating with a surplus, addressing funding shortfalls is crucial for eligibility and award rules. Discretionary funding surpluses and shortfalls have impacted the program, with annual appropriations being the main source of funding. Funding shortfalls have been addressed in the past through various measures. The Pell Grant program receives annual discretionary appropriations to support awards for multiple years. Mandatory appropriations from various acts supplement these funds. The Pell Grant program receives annual discretionary appropriations to support awards for multiple years. Advance mandatory funding has been introduced to supplement or replace discretionary funding, with recent increases offset by savings from federal student loan programs. The SAFRA Act established indefinite mandatory appropriations for the Pell Grant program to provide for increases in the discretionary base maximum award amount. The amount of mandatory add-on award is contingent on the discretionary base maximum award, with increases requiring additional mandatory appropriations. The discretionary base maximum award is below $4,860. Funding history from FY2010 to FY2016 is detailed in Table 7, showing discretionary and mandatory appropriations. Mandatory appropriations for add-on award amounts are available through FY2021. The specific amount needed each year depends on the add-on amount and disbursement to eligible students. The annual discretionary appropriation and base maximum Pell Grant level are determined. The annual discretionary appropriation level and base maximum Pell Grant level are determined in advance based on estimates of program costs. If estimates are inaccurate, the appropriation may be insufficient. The Secretary of Education must notify Congress of any funding shortfall. Table 8 shows a history of annual appropriations, expenditures, and shortfall/surplus levels from FY1973 to FY2016. The Pell Grant program has experienced funding shortfalls over the years, leading to various measures by federal policymakers and Congress to address the issue. These shortfalls have occasionally resulted in reductions in student awards, recipient caps, the need for supplemental appropriations, or stagnant award levels. Congress may adjust appropriations based on previous year's surplus or shortfall. The Pell Grant program has faced funding shortfalls, leading to adjustments in student awards, recipient caps, and the need for supplemental appropriations. These shortfalls have been managed through various measures, with the program often operating as an appropriated entitlement. Recent funding shortfalls have not directly impacted eligible students' awards. The Pell Grant program has faced funding shortfalls, leading to adjustments in student awards. The Secretary of Education had authority to reduce awards in response to funding shortfalls until 1992. After that, appropriations legislation provided the Secretary with reduction authority, but it was not used. The Secretary can now allocate funds from recent appropriations to cover costs from previous award years. Between FY2002 and FY2006, a funding shortfall of $4.1 billion accumulated in the Pell Grant program due to increased applicants and misalignment between cost estimates and appropriations. Despite this, eligible students did not see a reduction in awards. Congress responded in FY2006 by providing $4.3 billion in mandatory appropriations to eliminate the shortfall. In FY2006, Congress provided $4.3 billion in mandatory appropriations to eliminate a $4.1 billion funding shortfall in the Pell Grant program. Additionally, steps were taken to prevent future large funding shortfalls, including establishing a permanent rule for scoring the program's budget authority. The bill for the program will be equal to the adjusted full cost. The budget authority will be based on the maximum appropriated award amount and changes to eligibility criteria. Before the FY2006 scoring rule, CBO accounted for budget authority in the Pell Grant program based on each appropriation bill. The program operates like an entitlement program, allowing annual appropriations to fund multiple award years. The scoring rule constrains Congress from underfunding the Pell Grant program. The Pell Grant program faced funding challenges from FY2006 to FY2010, with a $2.7 billion shortfall in FY2008. In FY2009, funding from ARRA and P.L. 111-8 helped retire the shortfall, increased maximum awards, and created a $3.4 billion surplus for FY2011. In response to a funding shortfall, the SAFRA Act provided $13.5 billion in advance mandatory appropriations for general use through FY2011. The Pell Grant program faced challenges due to increased student applications and economic conditions, leading to a cumulative funding shortfall of $10.7 billion by the end of FY2010. The SAFRA Act provided $13.5 billion in advance mandatory appropriations for general use from October 1, 2010, to September 30, 2012. This funding surplus in FY2011 helped offset the $10.7 billion discretionary funding shortfall. Congress had to address a significant \"funding gap\" between FY2010 and FY2011 to maintain award and eligibility parameters. In FY2011, Congress addressed a funding gap by providing $23 billion in discretionary appropriations and $8.8 billion in mandatory appropriations for general use in the program from FY2012 to FY2021. This was offset by estimated savings from eliminating a provision for two scheduled Pell Grants in one award year. The Budget Control Act of 2011 further provided $10 billion in mandatory appropriations for FY2012 and $7 billion for FY2013. In FY2011, Congress provided $23 billion in discretionary appropriations and $8.8 billion in mandatory appropriations for the program from FY2012 to FY2021. This was offset by estimated savings from eliminating provisions in the program. In FY2012, despite having a $7.4 billion surplus in mandatory funds, Congress faced a $1.3 billion funding gap. To address this gap, changes were made to federal student aid programs, with most savings redirected to the Pell Grant program. In FY2012, changes were made to the Pell Grant program with $22.8 billion in discretionary funding provided. The maximum award remained at $4,860 for AY2012-2013, with a total maximum award of $5,550. An additional $3.1 billion in mandatory funding was allocated from FY2012 to FY2021, offset by savings from policy riders in the FY2012 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Changes were made to federal student aid programs in the Higher Education Act (HEA), specifically affecting the Pell Grant program. For AY2012-2013 and beyond, the minimum Pell Grant award was set at 10% of the total maximum Pell Grant, and lifetime eligibility was reduced from 18 to 12 semesters. The income threshold for determining eligibility for need-based federal student aid was lowered from $31,000 to $23,000 for AY2012-2013, with future thresholds indexed to inflation. Additionally, students no longer qualify for federal student aid programs under Title IV of the HEA. Students who first enroll on or after July 1, 2012, are affected by changes to federal student aid programs under Title IV of the HEA. Qualification for federal student aid now requires a high school diploma or equivalent. The Pell Grant award calculation formula for AY2014-2015 through AY2017-2018 is based on specific criteria. The Pell Grant award calculation formula for AY2014-2015 through AY2017-2018 includes a $5 increment, the Total maximum Pell Grant award for the previous year, and the change in CPI-U. For example, if the discretionary base maximum amount is $4,860 in AY2016-2017, the mandatory add-on amount is $985, and the CPI-U change is 2%, the mandatory add-on amount for AY2017-2018 would be $1,100."
