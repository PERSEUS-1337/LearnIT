The Healthcare Innovation Zone pilot program, established under the Healthcare Innovation Zone Program Act of 2009, aims to increase healthcare provider integration and align incentives to improve health and reduce costs. It includes an HIZ planning grant program and an HIZ demonstration project. The Healthcare Innovation Zone pilot program aims to work with local employers, community leaders, and payors to provide a full spectrum of care, including inpatient, outpatient, post-acute, and preventive care. It includes an academic medical center that offers tertiary and quaternary care, conducts health services research, and provides clinical training for health professionals. The program is able to accept alternative payment structures beyond fee-for-service and per diem amounts. The HIZ Planning Grant Program is established under Section 3. The Secretary will provide grants to eligible entities for researching and preparing an HIZ model plan. Grant recipients must apply for the HIZ demonstration project and return unused funds if not selected. Eligible entities include healthcare institutions, academic medical centers, large multispecialty group practices, and other clinical organizations.

The HIZ model plan must include a mechanism for knowledge-sharing, training of healthcare professionals, governance structure, and addressing non-financial barriers to innovation. The HIZ model plan should include mechanisms for data reporting, site visits, community health impact assessments, performance tracking indicators, community involvement, and payment methodology options. The Secretary will award 10-25 grants ranging from $250,000 to $1,000,000 each. Funding for the grants can come from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Healthcare Innovation Zone Demonstration Project will be implemented. The Secretary will establish an HIZ demonstration project to test the effectiveness of HIZs in integrating healthcare providers, improving services, and reducing costs. The project will last at least 3 years and can be renewed at the Secretary's discretion. Eligible entities must apply to participate in the project. To participate in the HIZ demonstration project, eligible entities must submit an approved HIZ model plan, provide necessary data for assessment, show a culture of innovation, possess structural elements for care, offer clinical training, and allocate resources effectively. Entities participating in the HIZ demonstration project must have the ability to allocate resources, a research infrastructure supporting data analytics, significant investment in health information technology, advanced innovations like medical homes and pay for performance, long-term economic sustainability, strong leadership, and willingness to undergo portfolio assessment and reengineering of patient care processes. The HIZ must have a robust financial infrastructure, oversight arrangements, and accreditation standards. It should provide healthcare services for multi-year periods and offer comprehensive services including hospital care, physician services, preventive care, education, and palliative care.

The Secretary may determine payments for healthcare services under a model plan implemented with a grant. An HIZ established under this section must assume financial risk for costs exceeding payment amounts and have sufficient reserves. The HIZ established with funding from this section must waive rights to additional reimbursement from federal healthcare programs or insurance plans for services provided. The Secretary will collaborate with the Government Accountability Office to score healthcare costs and savings from nationwide HIZ implementation. The HIZ established under this section must waive certain requirements under the Social Security Act and submit reports to the Secretary. The Secretary will evaluate the demonstration program periodically and report to Congress."
