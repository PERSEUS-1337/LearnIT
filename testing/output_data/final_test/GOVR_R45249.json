    "content": "President Trump imposed tariffs on U.S. steel and aluminum imports under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, granting him the authority to restrict imports threatening national security. Congress has delegated broad authority to the President for such actions without requiring approval. In the Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980, Congress amended Section 232 to allow for joint disapproval resolutions to override presidential actions on petroleum imports. Section 232 is one tool among several that the U.S. uses to address trade barriers and foreign trade practices, including investigations and actions to address import surges and violations of trade agreements. Trade is vital to the U.S. economy, and Members often receive feedback from constituents on issues affecting businesses. The U.S. economy is impacted by Section 232 actions on imports, affecting industries, workers, and consumers. Recent investigations include automobiles, uranium, and titanium sponges. Reports on these investigations are pending, raising economic and policy issues for Congress. The report provides an overview of Section 232, analyzing the Trump Administration's investigations and actions, with potential policy and economic implications for Congress. It also includes a discussion of previous Section 232 investigations and the legislative history of the Trade Act of 1962. The executive branch's interpretation of \"national security\" and the scope of investigations can be expansive under the Trade Expansion Act. The Secretary of Commerce conducts Section 232 investigations to determine the effects of specified imports on national security. Public hearings and consultations may be held during the investigation, with a 270-day deadline to advise the President on whether the imports threaten U.S. national security. The report must be published in the Federal Register. The Section 232 process involves the Secretary of Commerce conducting investigations on the effects of imports on national security. Factors considered include domestic production, capacity, human resources, and potential economic impacts. The President has 90 days to decide on necessary actions after receiving the report, which may include trade-restrictive measures. The President has 15 days to implement actions recommended in the Commerce report on national security threats posed by imports. Presidential actions can remain in place as long as necessary to adjust imports. The Commerce Department initiated 31 Section 232 investigations between 1962 and 2019, with outcomes varying on whether imports threatened national security. In 11 cases, Commerce found imports threatening national security and made recommendations to the President. The President acted in eight cases, including imposing oil embargoes in two instances. In two cases, the President imposed oil embargoes in 1979 (Iran) and 1982 (Libya), which were later replaced by broader economic sanctions. Commerce found that imports threatened national security in three recent investigations but did not recommend import adjustments. Instead, Commerce suggested increasing domestic energy production and utilizing existing government programs for energy security. Prior to the Trump Administration, a President last acted under Section 232 in 1986 when Commerce determined that imports of metal-cutting and metal-forming machine tools threatened national security. The President sought voluntary export restraint agreements with foreign exporters and developed domestic programs to revitalize the U.S. industry. These agreements predate the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules prohibiting voluntary export restraints. Additionally, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross initiated a Section 232 investigation in May 2018 to determine the impact of automobile imports on national security. Commerce initiated a Section 232 investigation on imports of automobiles, parts, uranium, and titanium to assess national security threats. Despite potential conflicts with WTO agreements, Article XXI allows measures for \"essential security interests.\" The WTO allows members to protect essential security interests, with broad national security exceptions included in trade obligations. Recent U.S. actions have been challenged under WTO agreements, including investigations into steel and aluminum imports for national security threats. Commerce conducted public hearings and consultations with defense agencies, receiving around 300 comments on Section 232 investigations. Stakeholders submitted around 300 comments on the Section 232 investigation and potential actions. Steel producers supported limiting steel imports, while users like automakers opposed additional tariffs. The U.S. aluminum industry had mixed views on global aluminum tariffs. Some sought limited actions to address overcapacity and unfair trade practices, while others cautioned against broad use of Section 232 authority for protectionist purposes. Commerce analyzed the importance of steel and aluminum products to national security. Commerce analyzed the importance of aluminum products to national security, defining it broadly to include industries critical for the economy and government operations. The investigations considered current and future national defense requirements, as well as specific critical infrastructure sectors. The reports also assessed domestic production capacity, industry requirements, import quantities, international markets, and global overcapacity. The definition of national security was based on a 2001 investigation on iron ore and semi-finished steel. The final reports from Section 232 investigations in January 2018 concluded that certain steel and aluminum imports threaten the national security of the United States. The Secretary of Commerce recommended reducing imports to enable U.S. steel mills to operate at 80% capacity and suggested immediate action through quotas or tariffs. President Trump took immediate action to adjust steel and aluminum imports through quotas or tariffs, with three potential courses of action identified. The Secretary of Defense recommended targeted tariffs to address unfair trading practices, particularly Chinese transshipment. Despite the national security concerns, U.S. military requirements for steel and aluminum represent only about three percent of U.S. production. On March 8, 2018, President Trump issued proclamations imposing duties on certain imports. On March 8, 2018, President Trump imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum imports, with flexibility on country and product applicability. The tariffs were in addition to existing duties, with processes established for product exclusions and diplomatic negotiations with countries having a security relationship with the U.S. The President notified Congress of his actions regarding tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on April 6, 2018. He initially excluded Mexico and Canada from the tariffs and linked NAFTA renegotiation to maintaining exemptions. Other countries with a \"security relationship\" could discuss alternative ways to address the national security threat and gain exemptions. The USTR was tasked with negotiating bilaterally with trading partners for potential exemptions. The President issued proclamations temporarily excluding Australia, Argentina, Brazil, South Korea, the EU, Canada, and Mexico from Section 232 tariffs. Negotiations and tariff exemptions were extended with Canada, Mexico, and the EU until June 1, 2018. Argentina, Australia, and Brazil were exempted indefinitely pending final agreements. South Korea agreed to an annual quota in discussions to modify the KORUS Free Trade Agreement. The U.S. and South Korea agreed on an annual quota for steel imports under the KORUS Free Trade Agreement, exempting them from steel tariffs. South Korea did not negotiate an agreement on aluminum and is subject to aluminum tariffs. Argentina, Brazil, and South Korea were permanently exempt from steel tariffs, with final quota agreements reached. Brazil, like South Korea, did not negotiate an agreement on aluminum and is subject to aluminum tariffs. Aluminum imports from Argentina were permanently exempt from tariffs with an absolute quota. Steel and aluminum imports from Australia were permanently exempt without quantitative restrictions. The Section 232 tariffs imposed on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico, and the European Union have prompted criticism from Members of Congress. The USMCA agreement did not address these tariffs, but includes a requirement for North American steel and aluminum content in motor vehicles. The USMCA agreement includes a requirement for motor vehicles to contain 70% or more North American steel and aluminum content to qualify for duty-free treatment. Discussions are ongoing regarding steel and aluminum tariffs, with speculation of potential quotas on imports from Mexico and Canada. Some policymakers suggest ratification of the agreement may be delayed until Section 232 tariffs are removed. President Trump announced plans for trade negotiations with the EU to eliminate tariffs, including those on steel and aluminum. The Trump Administration is considering alternative measures to tariffs on trade products, such as quantitative restrictions and increased traceability requirements. Commerce has published rules for requesting exclusions from tariffs on items not produced in sufficient quantity or quality in the US. The Trump Administration is exploring alternative measures to tariffs, including quantitative restrictions and increased traceability requirements. Commerce has issued rules for requesting exclusions from tariffs on items lacking sufficient US production quality. Exclusion requests and objections are posted on regulations.gov, with determinations based on national security. Only individuals or organizations using steel articles in US business activities can submit exclusion requests, with objections allowed within 30 days. Exclusion reviews will not exceed 90 days, causing uncertainty for petitioners. As of March 4, 2019, Commerce received thousands of steel and aluminum exclusion requests, with a significant number granted and denied. Companies have criticized the lengthy and complex process, including delays in receiving responses from Commerce. Alcoa, a major U.S. aluminum producer, sought an exemption for aluminum imported from Canada. Alcoa, a major U.S. aluminum producer, is facing increased costs in its supply chain due to higher aluminum prices from tariffs. The Cause of Action Institute filed a lawsuit against Commerce for not responding to FOIA requests regarding the exclusion process. Members of Congress have raised concerns about the review process, suggesting recommendations to ease the burden on manufacturers, especially small businesses. Commerce has improved the exclusion process for tariffs by increasing staff and expediting requests. The International Trade Administration now analyzes requests and objections to ensure domestic production can meet needs. BIS makes final decisions on granting or denying requests. Some Members question the process of picking winners and losers. Senator Ron Johnson requested specific statistics on the process. Senator Ron Johnson and Senator Elizabeth Warren have requested specific information and investigations regarding the exclusion process for tariffs by the Commerce Department. Pending legislation aims to revise the process for excluding products. Commerce announced a new rule on September 6, 2018. Commerce announced a new rule on September 6, 2018, allowing companies to rebut objections to petitions for excluding products. The rule includes new rebuttal and counter-rebuttal procedures, criteria for granting exclusion requests, and revised estimates of requests and objections. The Commerce Inspector General's office initiated an audit of the exclusion process, ongoing as of October 29, 2018. Funding was provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 for improving the exclusion process. Funding was provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 for contractor support to implement the product exclusion process for articles covered by Section 232 actions. Congress mandated improvements to the exclusion process and required quarterly reports from Commerce. As of March 28, 2019, $4.7 billion and $1.5 billion were assessed from Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum. The Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum have collected $4.7 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, which are put into the U.S. Treasury's general fund. Annual tariff revenue could reach $5.8 billion for steel and $1.7 billion for aluminum based on 2017 import values. However, import prices may decrease over time, leading to a decline in import demand and tariff revenue. The Commerce Department granting product exclusions is also expected to reduce tariff revenue. The tariffs aim to reduce imports to a level determined by the Secretary. The Section 232 tariffs aim to reduce imports of steel and aluminum to enable domestic producers to use 80% of existing production capacity for long-term economic viability. In 2018, steel imports totaled $29.5 billion and aluminum imports were $17.6 billion. While imports increased slightly in value from 2017 to 2018, they decreased by over 10% in quantity. Imports from individual countries fluctuated significantly over the past year. U.S. imports of steel and aluminum fluctuated significantly over the past year. The largest declines in steel imports were from South Korea, Turkey, and India, while there were significant increases from the EU, Mexico, and Canada. For aluminum, major declines were seen from China, Russia, and Canada, with notable increases from the EU, India, and Oman. Countries with permanent exclusions from tariffs accounted for a portion of U.S. imports. In 2018, U.S. steelmakers employed 140,100 workers, representing 1.1% of the nation's factory jobs. In 2018, steel manufacturers added 2,700 jobs, a rise of 2% from a year earlier. Employment in the steel industry has declined due to new technology, with labor productivity nearly tripling since 1987. Aluminum manufacturers employed 58,100 workers in 2018, with domestic smelting of aluminum in long-term decline. The majority of domestic aluminum production comes from recycled scrap melted in a smelter. Steelmaking and aluminum smelting are capital intensive, with small output changes impacting profitability. U.S. steel mills have a capacity utilization rate of over 80%, while primary aluminum producers operated at 78% capacity in December 2018. The aim of metals tariffs is to maintain producers at 80% capacity for profitability and investment. The OECD Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity estimates global steel overcapacity at 595 million metric tons in 2017, with China being the largest producer. China plans to reduce its steelmaking capacity by 100-150 million metric tons by 2020. No global forum monitors aluminum overcapacity, but industry groups have called for one. In 2017, China accounted for over half of the world's primary aluminum production but does not export aluminum in commodity form to the United States. Instead, China ships semi-finished aluminum products like bars, rods, and wire, which are subject to Section 232 tariffs. The United States produced more than double the amount of steel it imported in 2018, with import penetration reaching 33% in 2016. In the primary aluminum market, U.S. net import reliance increased to 50% in 2018 from 33% in 2014. The U.S. Geological Survey reported that U.S. net import reliance for primary aluminum rose to 50% in 2018 from 33% in 2014. OECD analysis attributes global steel overcapacity to government intervention and market-distorting practices. Past administrations, like President George W. Bush, have worked on addressing steel overcapacity through international discussions. In 2001, the Bush Administration initiated discussions on overcapacity and trade issues at the OECD, involving industrial steel-producing members and major non-OECD producers like India, Russia, and China. Negotiations were suspended in 2004, and by 2005, the OECD abandoned efforts to ban domestic subsidies for steel mills. The Obama Administration also participated in global efforts to address steel imports, including the G-20 Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity launched in 2016. In 2018, the OECD Forum agreed on measures to reduce global steel overcapacity and issued policy recommendations. The USTR supported the recommendations but questioned the Forum's ability to implement them effectively. The aluminum industry also raised concerns about China's excess production affecting them. Global overcapacity in primary aluminum was 11 million metric tons in 2017, attributed to government intervention and market-distorting practices. The U.S. Aluminum Association and international counterparts aim to address this issue through a global forum. The Trump Administration's Section 232 actions prompted safeguard investigations and quota restrictions by trading partners like the EU, UK, and Canada. These actions are uncoordinated, unlike OECD efforts to reduce overcapacity in the steel industry. The Trump Administration, along with the EU and Japan, are taking concrete steps to address industrial overcapacity through new international rules on subsidies and state-owned enterprises. They aim to improve compliance with WTO transparency commitments and cooperate on technology transfer policies. Multiple meetings have been held to work towards fair competition conditions. The parties are working together to identify signals for nonmarket policies and enhance information sharing. In November 2018, a joint proposal was put forward in the WTO to increase transparency and propose incentives for compliance with WTO notification reporting requirements regarding subsidies. U.S. unilateral tariff actions may limit other countries' participation in multilateral forums, raising issues for Congress regarding Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The response to U.S. tariff actions on steel and aluminum imports by other countries can impact domestic producers, downstream manufacturers, and consumers. It may also affect the U.S. economy and global trading system. Different countries have varied responses, including direct negotiations, pursuing retaliation with tariffs, and seeking alternative markets to avoid U.S. tariffs. Some are raising actions at the WTO or pursuing litigation. Several major U.S. trading partners are imposing retaliatory tariffs in response to U.S. actions, affecting approximately $23.2 billion of U.S. exports in 2018. The process of retaliation involves adherence to international rules through agreements at the WTO and in bilateral and regional free trade agreements. The Trump Administration's national security considerations have been cited as a factor in the tariff actions. The Trump Administration's Section 232 actions have led to increased tariffs, permitted under international agreements for specific circumstances like antidumping, countervailing duties, and safeguard tariffs. U.S. trading partners have retaliated through WTO notifications and may also seek recourse through FTA commitments, such as Canada and Mexico claiming violations of NAFTA and WTO agreements. The Trump Administration's Section 232 tariff actions have led to retaliation from U.S. trading partners, magnifying the impact of the tariffs on various industries. If Section 232 tariffs are imposed on the motor vehicle sector, it could have significant negative effects on U.S. exporters, especially with retaliatory measures from trading partners like the EU. The EU has prepared retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports worth $50 billion in response to Section 232 tariffs. Concerns are raised over the strain on the international trading system. The Trump Administration defends the tariffs as within its rights under WTO national security exceptions. If disputes are not resolved, it could lead to further unilateral actions. The President's Section 232 actions on steel and aluminum have faced legal challenges in the U.S. domestic court system. One case involved a Russian steel producer seeking to prevent import tariffs, but the court denied the motion, stating the tariffs were imposed for national security purposes. If disputes are not resolved, it could lead to further unilateral actions and increasing retaliation. The American Institute for International Steel challenged Congress's delegation of authority to the President under Section 232, arguing it created an unconstitutional regime with no limits. The court rejected the argument, stating Congress did not delegate too much power to the President. The court upheld the constitutionality of Congress's delegation of authority to the President under Section 232, citing a 1976 Supreme Court precedent. Judge Katzmann expressed concerns about the broad delegation but followed the precedent. The case is currently under appeal, with U.S. importers challenging the President's increase of steel tariffs on imports from Turkey. The Section 232 steel tariffs on U.S. imports from Turkey were increased from 25% to 50%, but are being challenged for lacking national security rationale and violating procedural mandates and Fifth Amendment rights. The case is pending before the CIT and could have implications under WTO agreements, with China already challenging the actions as violating U.S. obligations. China has requested the formation of a dispute settlement panel under WTO rules to address alleged violations by the United States regarding tariff measures and exemptions. Other WTO members have also requested consultations or joined existing requests. China claims that the U.S. measures violate GATT Article II, which prohibits duties on imported goods exceeding agreed limits. China has requested a WTO dispute settlement panel to address alleged US violations of tariff measures and exemptions. The US is accused of exceeding agreed duty limits on imported goods and not treating China's goods as favorably as those of other WTO members. The US invoked the national security exception in defense of steel and aluminum tariffs. The US invoked the national security exception in defense of steel and aluminum tariffs under GATT Article XXI, which allows member countries to take actions deemed necessary for their essential security interests. Some analysts argue that a WTO panel may evaluate the use of this exception, but historically, the US has maintained that it is self-judging. The national security exception under GATT Article XXI allows WTO members to justify measures inconsistent with their obligations. The US believes this exception is self-judging, preventing WTO panels from evaluating its use. There is little guidance on how a panel would assess the US's invocation of the exception in disputes over steel and aluminum tariffs. Concerns have been raised about the potential overuse of this exception undermining the WTO. WTO members are concerned about the overuse of the national security exception, fearing it could lead to protectionist measures. If the US faces an adverse WTO decision, it must remove tariffs or face compensation or countermeasures. China has already imposed duties on US exports, while the US argues that retaliation takes too long through the WTO. The United States has filed WTO complaints over retaliatory tariffs imposed by five countries in response to U.S. Section 232 measures. Dispute settlement panels have been composed to hear these cases. The Trump Administration initiated a third Section 232 investigation into automobile imports in May 2018. Commerce held a public hearing and requested comments on the impact of these imports on national security. The U.S. initiated a Section 232 investigation into automobile imports, considering factors related to national security and the economy. Commerce requested information on the impact of U.S. production by majority U.S.-owned firms versus majority foreign-owned firms. The value of imports under investigation is higher than steel and aluminum. The presence of foreign-owned auto manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and potential retaliation by trading partners could have significant economic consequences. Ford Motor Co.'s executive highlighted the importance of the auto industry in this investigation. The auto industry is a global business, with companies like Toyota, Volkswagen, General Motors, Nissan, Hyundai, and Kia benefiting from scale and global reach. The Driving American Jobs Coalition opposes potential tariffs from the new Section 232 investigation, while others see it as a tactic to pressure trade partners. The EU has reportedly drafted a list in response. President continues to threaten auto tariffs. EU has drafted retaliatory tariff targets if auto tariffs proceed under Section 232. Support for limited measures from United Automobile Workers, United Steelworkers, and Forging Industry Association. Final Section 232 report submitted to President on February 17, 2019, not yet released. Calls for report's public release, lawsuit filed by Cause of Action Institute. President has 90 days to review report. Senate Finance Chairman Grassley opposes potential tariffs. Senate Finance Chairman Grassley opposes potential auto tariffs, urging President to focus on opening new markets instead. Proposed legislation in House and Senate requires USITC report on domestic automotive manufacturing before any action. Trump Administration opened two additional Section 232 investigations in response to industry petitions, including uranium ore and product imports. The Trump Administration opened an investigation into uranium ore and product imports following a petition from U.S. mining companies. The petitioners requested limits on imports to secure 25% of the U.S. nuclear market for domestic producers. U.S. uranium production has been declining, with Energy Fuels being the only remaining operator of a uranium mine in the country. The House Natural Resources Subcommittee questioned the need for an investigation into U.S. uranium production, with concerns raised by the U.S. nuclear power industry about potential job losses. In March 2019, Commerce launched a Section 232 investigation into titanium imports for defense applications. Titanium Metals Corporation (Timet) is the sole producer of titanium sponge in the US, with 150 workers employed in 2018. The US was 75% import reliant for titanium sponge in 2018, with Japan as the largest supplier. China, the world's largest producer, is not a significant source of sponge imports for the US. Any Section 232 tariff would be added to the existing 15% ad valorem tariff on titanium sponge imports. Unlike steel and aluminum, there are no countervailing or antidumping duties in place for titanium imports. The Section 232 tariffs impact various stakeholders in the US economy, with reactions from Members of Congress. Hearings have been held to examine the issue, focusing on the effects on domestic steel and aluminum producers. The tariffs are expected to benefit these producers by restricting imports, potentially raising prices and expanding production, while possibly negatively affecting consumers and downstream industries. The Section 232 tariffs have a modest negative effect on the US economy, impacting consumers and domestic industries with higher input costs. Retaliatory tariffs from other countries could further reduce US exports, potentially worsening the economic impact. The Administration's consideration of tariffs on motor vehicles and parts could significantly increase the negative effects. The Section 232 tariffs impact the US economy by influencing the price of imported goods and exchange rates. The price of imported goods subject to tariffs is likely to increase, depending on various factors. Recent studies show that the tariffs have a high pass-through rate. Recent economic studies show that the Section 232 tariffs have a high pass-through rate, impacting downstream industries and consumers. U.S. firms are facing increased prices for imported steel and aluminum, leading to higher production costs and potentially giving foreign competitors an advantage. Demand for imported goods facing tariffs may decrease, while domestic goods may see an increase in demand. The impact of the Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum products in the U.S. led to a decrease in imports subject to higher tariffs, while domestic production increased. As consumers shift to lower-tariff substitutes, domestic producers are expected to increase output and prices, potentially causing resource constraints. The Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum in the U.S. have led to a decrease in imports and an increase in domestic production. Resource constraints may limit output expansion, causing prices to rise. Domestic producers are responding by increasing prices strategically and investing in capacity expansion. For example, U.S. Steel Corporation plans to increase capacity with new facilities, while three U.S. aluminum smelters are being restarted. Prices of U.S. steel and aluminum producers rose between 2017 and 2018. This increase in prices is expected to lead to higher input costs for downstream domestic producers, potentially resulting in lower profits, higher consumer prices, reduced demand for downstream products, and possible employment declines. For example, Ford CEO James Hackett estimated that the metal tariffs could cost the auto manufacturer around $1 billion. Metal tariffs are expected to cost the auto manufacturer roughly $1 billion. U.S. exports subject to retaliatory tariffs from six trading partners are likely to decline, affecting approximately $23 billion of U.S. exports in 2018, including agricultural goods. The retaliatory tariffs have led to decreased demand for U.S. exports and incentivized manufacturing abroad to avoid tariffs. For example, Chinese tariffs on soybeans caused a decline in overall U.S. agricultural and food exports to China in 2018. Canada, Mexico, and the EU account for 80% of U.S. exports subject to retaliatory tariffs. Since retaliatory tariffs were imposed in response to Section 232 actions, U.S. exports to affected trading partners have decreased by 25%, 10%, and 38%. Harley Davidson plans to move some production out of the U.S. due to EU tariffs on its motorcycles. Tariffs can impact macroeconomic variables, potentially affecting the value of the U.S. dollar as demand for foreign goods falls. The tariffs imposed may lead to a decrease in demand for U.S. exports and an increase in demand for foreign imports, affecting national consumption patterns and potentially reducing discretionary income. The ad hoc nature of these tariffs could also increase uncertainty in the U.S. business environment, potentially hindering investment. From a global perspective, tariff increases on steel and aluminum may result in a welfare loss by shifting production to higher-cost producers. Some view the trade actions as addressing fairness issues for U.S. producers. The tariffs imposed on steel and aluminum may have negative effects on the domestic economy, with higher prices impacting consumers and industries. The possibility of foreign firms absorbing the tariff increase to create a positive welfare effect is unlikely due to global industry conditions and potential retaliation. The Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum may have limited direct economic effects due to their small share of economic activity. Stakeholder estimates suggest a small negative impact on U.S. GDP, with employment shifting to domestic steel and aluminum industries. Congress may consider potential legislative responses to these issues. In enacting Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, Congress delegated authority to regulate international commerce to the executive branch, granting the President broad discretion in restricting imports. Congress's current recourse if disapproving of the President's use of the statute is limited to passing new legislation or using informal tools to pressure the Administration. Some Members and observers suggest requiring additional steps in the Section 232 process, with proposals introduced in the 116th Congress to amend Section 232, such as by requiring an economic impact study by the USITC. Some Members in the 116th Congress are proposing amendments to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act to restore congressional authority over trade actions. This includes requiring an economic impact study by the USITC, congressional consultation, or approval of new tariffs. Senate Finance Chair Grassley is working on a consensus bill to gain bipartisan support. Debates include whether changes should be retroactive, affecting steel and aluminum tariffs, and if Congress's role should be consultative or decisive. Several U.S. trading partners have also proposed similar measures. In the 116th Congress, some Members proposed legislation to address the economic impact of retaliatory tariffs from U.S. trading partners. Proposals include expanding trade adjustment assistance and increasing funding for agricultural export programs. Stakeholders can easily initiate a Section 232 investigation process. Congress may consider establishing criteria or a threshold for Section 232 petitions to limit requests and ensure justification. Concerns have been raised that restrictions on U.S. imports under Section 232 could harm U.S. allies and national security. For example, Canada is a key source of U.S. steel imports and part of the U.S. defense industrial base. The defense industrial base is a top source of U.S. imports of steel and aluminum, with national security being a key concern. The Trump Administration's Section 232 actions are controversial, with some arguing they are unrelated to national security. Congress may need to amend Section 232 to address these concerns and prevent other countries from enacting protectionist measures under the guise of national security. Some Members propose narrowing the definition of \"national security\" under Section 232 and updating trade agreements to address market-distorting practices like government intervention. WTO negotiations for new rules have stalled, but recent FTAs like USMCA include related disciplines. Congress could establish new measures to address these issues. Congress could consider establishing new negotiating objectives for trade agreements, prioritizing engagement in negotiations to address nonmarket practices, and potential risks of undermining the international system with unilateral trade actions. The challenges in resolving trade disputes related to national security concerns may hinder the effectiveness of existing procedures. The United States' actions outside the multilateral system could lead to criticism and impede its enforcement efforts. Congress could address these issues by increasing oversight, establishing stricter criteria, or requiring approval for the use of Section 232. The U.S. unilateral actions under Section 232 have heightened tensions with trading partners and could impact international economic cooperation. Trade disputes with allies have strained relationships and could affect cooperation on foreign policy issues. Concerns over national security, trade, and domestic industry have been ongoing since the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1954. The Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1958 expanded provisions allowing the President to adjust trade restrictions based on national security threats. Factors considered in investigations included domestic production capacity for national security, impact of imports on domestic production, and effects of foreign competition on domestic industries. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 continued provisions from the 1958 Act, with amendments over the years. In 1980, Congress amended Section 232 to allow for a joint disapproval resolution provision to override presidential actions on petroleum imports. In 1980, Representative James Shannon introduced House Joint Resolution 531 to disapprove the presidential action on license fees for petroleum imports. The House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade voted to disapprove, and the full committee favorably reported the resolution. Despite concerns about U.S. dependence on foreign oil, the measure passed the House but was indefinitely postponed in the Senate. Multiple joint resolutions of disapproval were introduced in Congress, but none passed both chambers. Additionally, President Carter's action in Proclamation 4744 was challenged in court, with a federal district court striking it down as unlawful on May 13, 1980. The court struck down the President's action on petroleum imports as unlawful, preventing the government from implementing the program. Congress then enacted an amendment to extend the public debt limit, terminating Proclamation 4744's petroleum import program. The President formally rescinded Proclamation 4744 on June 19, 1980."
