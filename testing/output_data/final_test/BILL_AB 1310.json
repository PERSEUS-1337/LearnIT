    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 786 of the Penal Code in California is amended to allow for jurisdiction in cases where stolen property is taken across different territories. The jurisdiction can be in any competent court within the territories involved, or in a contiguous territory if the arrest is made there and certain conditions are met. The jurisdiction of a criminal action for unauthorized use, retention, or transfer of personal identifying information extends to the county where the theft occurred, where the victim resided, or where the information was used illegally. Multiple offenses involving the same defendant or scheme in different jurisdictions can be prosecuted in any of those jurisdictions. Jurisdiction also covers associated offenses connected to the underlying identity theft offense. The jurisdiction of a criminal action for unauthorized use, retention, or transfer of personal identifying information extends to multiple offenses connected to the underlying identity theft offense. When charges alleging multiple offenses of unauthorized use of personal identifying information in different jurisdictions are filed in one county, a hearing is held to decide if the case should proceed in that county or if counts should be severed. The district attorney must show that all counties involved agree to proceed in the filing county. Factors considered include evidence location, offense locations, similarity of activities, defendant and victim rights, and convenience or hardship to the victim. The decision to proceed with a case in one county or sever counts is based on factors like evidence and offense locations, similarity of activities, and the rights of the defendant, people, victim, and witnesses. When an action for unauthorized use, retention, or transfer of personal identifying information is filed in the victim's county of residence, the court must hold a hearing to determine if it is the proper venue for trial, considering the parties' rights, access to evidence, witness convenience, and interests of justice. The jurisdiction of a criminal action for unauthorized distribution of an intimate image extends to the county where the offense occurred, where the victim resided, or where the image was used illegally. Multiple offenses involving the same image or scheme can be prosecuted in any jurisdiction. Jurisdiction also covers associated offenses connected to the unauthorized distribution of an intimate image. When charges alleging multiple offenses of unauthorized distribution of an intimate image occurring in multiple territorial jurisdictions are filed in one county, the court will hold a hearing to decide if the matter should proceed in that county or if counts should be severed. The district attorney must show evidence that all relevant district attorneys agree on the county of filing. Factors considered include the location and complexity of evidence, where the majority of offenses occurred, similarity of activity, defendant and victim rights, and convenience of witnesses. When charges of unauthorized distribution of intimate images in multiple jurisdictions are filed in one county, a hearing will determine if the case should proceed there or if counts should be separated. Factors considered include evidence location, where offenses occurred, activity similarity, defendant and victim rights, and witness convenience. If the victim resided in the county at the time of the offense, the court will hold a hearing to determine if it is the proper venue for trial. This does not affect victims' rights under Section 530.6 of the Penal Code. Section 1524.3 of the Penal Code is amended to require electronic communication service providers to disclose subscriber information to governmental agencies with a search warrant. The search warrant must specify target individuals, accounts, information types, and time periods. Unrelated information obtained must be sealed. Government entities must notify subscribers upon receiving requested records, with possible delays for adverse results. Upon expiration of the delay period, the government must notify the subscriber of the law enforcement inquiry specifics and information shared with them. The service provider must inform the subscriber of any delay in notification due to a court order and provide a copy of the inventory of seized property. A court may modify a search warrant if the requested information is voluminous or burdensome. (g) A provider of wire or electronic communication services must preserve records for 90 days upon a peace officer's request, extendable for another 90 days. (h) Providers are protected from legal action for complying in good faith with a search warrant."
