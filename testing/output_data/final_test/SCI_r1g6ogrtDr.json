Current equivariant models consider all possible transformations, while human visual system focuses on relevant transformations for object recognition. A modified equivariant feature mapping attends to co-occurring transformations in data, outperforming conventional rotation equivariant models. Co-attentive equivariant neural networks outperform conventional rotation equivariant models on rotated MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Research in psychology and neuroscience supports the idea that our visual system can recognize objects despite changes in size, location, and lighting. Humans can not only identify objects but also characterize the modifications applied to them, indicating equivariance to various transformations like translation, rotation, and scaling. The human visual system can recognize objects despite changes in size, location, and lighting, exhibiting equivariance to various transformations like translation, rotation, and scaling. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) aim to replicate these abilities but lack equivariance to all transformations. However, if an ordinary CNN learns rotated copies of the same filter, the stack of feature maps becomes equivariant to rotations. The stack of feature maps in CNNs becomes equivariant to rotations by stacking convolutional feature maps, reducing the need to learn rotated copies independently. Various approaches have emerged to extend equivariance to planar rotations, spherical rotations, scaling, and general transformation groups. Our visual system infers object identities based on size, location, and orientation in a scene. A study showed that the orientation of an object within a context can affect how it is recognized. While the concept of equivariance to transformation groups is similar, real-world experiences may vary in how our visual system reacts to different transformations. The human visual system recognizes objects based on size, location, and orientation. Research has shown that in-plane rotations can affect recognition, especially for mono-oriented objects like faces. This effect worsens with age but adults are quicker at recognizing objects in their usual orientation. The visual system does not perform fully equivariant feature transformations. The human visual system does not react equally to all input transformations, learning poses objects usually appear in to improve recognition. Studies suggest orientation is encoded relative to context. The Co-occurrence Envelope Hypothesis allows equivariant feature mappings to detect co-occurring transformations. By enabling equivariant feature mappings to detect co-occurrent transformations in the data, the Co-occurrence Envelope Hypothesis enhances neural networks' descriptive power. A co-attentive equivariant feature mapping focuses on the co-occurrence envelope of the data, improving the representation of visual patterns like rotated faces. This simplifies the task by recognizing transformations even when trained on specific orientations. The Co-occurrence Envelope Hypothesis enhances neural networks' descriptive power by enabling equivariant feature mappings to detect co-occurrent transformations in the data. One strategy to simplify the task is to restrict the network to react exclusively to upright faces, which reduces the set of relevant visual pattern orientations but risks losing the ability to detect faces in other orientations. Another strategy involves defining relevant pattern orientations relative to each other, improving the recognition of faces in different orientations. The study introduces co-attentive equivariant feature mappings to detect co-occurrent transformations in data using attention mechanisms. This approach enhances neural networks' ability to recognize faces in different orientations without disrupting equivariance. The study introduces cyclic equivariant self-attention, a novel mechanism to preserve equivariance in neural networks across various transformation groups. Experiments show that co-attentive rotation equivariant networks outperform conventional ones in rotated MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Additionally, cyclic equivariant self-attention is extended to multiple symmetry groups in p4m-CNNs. The study introduces co-attentive equivariant mappings to multiple symmetry groups, outperforming conventional equivariant mappings. Equivariance is defined as a feature mapping that commutes with actions of a transformation group. Equivariant feature representations are advantageous for learning systems as they produce predictable transformations in the feature space, reducing the hypothesis space and simplifying the learning process. Equivariance allows for the construction of layered networks preserving input structure, enabling intermediate layers to leverage the input structure as well. Invariance is a special case of equivariance where all group actions in the input space are mapped to the same feature representation. Equivariant neural networks utilize feature mappings that encode equivariance through parameter sharing, allowing for efficient networks with larger groups. CNNs preserve spatial structure by applying convolutional filters to input signals. Equivariant neural networks utilize parameter sharing to encode equivariance for larger groups, preserving spatial structure through convolutional filters. The extension of equivariance to rotations involves modifying feature mappings and convolutional filters. Learning smaller filters allows for the same number of output feature channels. Neural networks are learned via backpropagation by updating network parameters using the chain rule of derivation. The networks obtain feedback from all elements in a group, leading to optimal feature representations. However, some feature combinations may not appear together, reducing the model's hypothesis space. This is related to the success of spatial and temporal attention in deep learning architectures. In this section, co-attentive feature mappings are defined and applied in the context of equivariant neural networks. Cyclic equivariant self-attention is introduced to construct co-attentive rotation equivariant neural networks, extendable to larger symmetry groups for rotations and mirror reflections. The reader can verify that \u0398 forms a group, with co-attentive equivariant feature mappings shown in Figure 3. The application of self-attention A C on top of conventional equivariant feature mapping results in modulated group convolution responses based on relevance. The circulant structure of A C preserves equivariance to the corresponding group through attention, allowing for transformation of the attention mask with input rotation. This approach enables rotation equivariant networks to learn co-attentive equivariant representations. The co-attentive rotation equivariant feature mapping introduces an attention operator A (l) to discern feature responses along the rotation axis r. Attention is applied locally to grant flexibility and utilize attention exclusively along the rotation axis, separate from spatial attention. Attention is applied pixel-wise on top of learned feature representations across the spatial dimension of the output feature maps. The attention operator A leverages information from source vectors to estimate an attention matrix A, modulating the original source vector to attend to relevant positions with regard to the target vector. Self-attention is a special case where the target and source vectors are equal, estimating the influence of the sequence on its own elements. The attention matrix is constructed using nonlinear space transformations of the source vector, followed by the softmax function. Different mappings are used in literature, such as feature transformation pairs in RNNs and self-attention networks, involving various operations between the transformed pairs. The computational complexity of these approaches and the extensive pixel-wise usage of transformations on every network layer make direct integration challenging. To enhance the descriptive power in a more compact setting, the usual self-attention formulation is modified by relaxing the range of values of A and defining A = x T \u00c3. Instead of directly applying softmax on the columns of A, the contributions of each element x i are summed to obtain a vector a, which is then passed to the softmax function. The softmax function is scaled by (1 / n) to prevent reaching regions of low gradient. The compact self-attention mechanism involves scaling the argument by (dim(A)) \u22121 = (1 / n) and normalizing before weighting x to preserve magnitude range. This allows the use of A in deep architectures. The self-attention operator A C generates importance matrix A relating rotated responses in the rotational group \u0398. This attention mechanism, referred to as full self-attention (A F), encodes linear relationships but may not conserve equivariance to \u0398. The full self-attention operator A F may not conserve equivariance to \u0398, leading to potential issues as outlined in Fig. 2c. Introducing the cyclic permutation operator P i, which induces a shift on its argument, allows for strong activations in the feature map x(r) during learning. This rotational equivariance property results in equal responses to input patterns up to a cyclic permutation of i positions on r. The self-attention mechanism A F faces challenges in detecting identical input patterns and may dampen responses due to small attention coefficients. By introducing prior-knowledge and leveraging equivariance to the cyclic group C n, these issues can be addressed while reducing the number of additional parameters needed. The self-attention mechanism faces challenges in detecting identical input patterns and may dampen responses. By leveraging prior knowledge and imposing cyclic equivariance using circulant matrices, the attention mechanism can produce the same output for similar input patterns. This approach reduces the need for additional parameters. The self-attention operator A C assigns responses generated by f R for rotated input patterns to unique entities, dynamically adjusting output to appearance angles. The attention weights a C are updated equally regardless of specific values of \u03b8 i. The co-attentive rotation equivariant feature mapping f R is defined as approximately equal to a conventional equivariant one if \u00c3 = \u03b1I for any \u03b1 \u2208 R. The self-attention mechanisms can be extended to larger groups with multiple symmetries, such as rotations and mirror reflections. Group convolution on these larger groups produces more output channels compared to roto-translational convolution. Full self-attention can be integrated by modulating the output of the group convolution, relating the responses within the group. The cyclic equivariant self-attention operator can be extended to multiple symmetry groups. The cyclic permutation operator induces a shift on the input patterns along the transformation axis. The response of the group convolution for a given input pattern is equivalent to a cyclic permutation of positions along the rotation axis. Mirror equivariance property also affects the generated response. The response generated by mp is equivalent to that of p up to a cyclic permutation of one position along the mirroring axis m. To extend A C to the \u03b8 r m group, the structure of A must respect the permutation laws imposed by the equivariant mapping f \u03b8rm. The circulant block matrix structure on \u00c3 must ensure that the composing blocks permute internally and the blocks themselves permute with one another. The text discusses the extension of cyclic equivariant self-attention to act on any G-equivariant feature mapping for symmetry groups. The approach is validated by exploring the effects of co-attentive equivariant feature mappings on existing equivariant architectures in different rotational settings. In this study, co-attentive equivariant networks are evaluated in fully and partially rotational settings, replacing equivariant mappings in p4m-CNNs. The goal is to assess the relative effects of these networks compared to conventional counterparts, without additional tuning beyond baseline strategies. Further improvements are possible through parameter tuning on the proposed co-attentive equivariant networks. The rotated MNIST dataset contains 62000 gray-scale 28x28 handwritten digits uniformly rotated on the entire circle [0, 2\u03c0). It is split into training, validation, and test sets. Co-attentive equivariant networks consistently outperform conventional ones in various models. Equivariant networks outperform conventional ones on CIFAR-10 dataset by replacing layers with co-attentive ones in various models. Li et al. (2018) reported training convergence improvements with co-attentive equivariant networks. Adding too many rotational equivariant layers decreased performance on CIFAR-10. Rotational equivariant CNNs were more prone to divergence due to additional feedback from roto-translational convolutions. Data preprocessing strategy left large outlier values, impacting model behavior. The study evaluated the performance of DREN networks compared to CNNs in rotational settings. Results showed DREN networks outperformed CNNs, but were more susceptible to divergence during training. Stabilization techniques were implemented to improve results. Co-attentive equivariant feature mappings enhance conventional equivariant mappings, beneficial in rotational settings. Attention is applied independently over each spatial position on the codomain of group convolution, with a circulant structure to preserve equivariance. In future work, the idea is to extend co-attentive feature mappings to act on the entire group simultaneously, lifting restrictions on mappings and potentially enhancing descriptive power. Exploring incorporating attention in the convolution operation itself could lead to imposing structure in the domain of the mapping, enhancing descriptiveness. Utilizing more complex attention strategies for large transformation groups is also a goal. In future work, the goal is to extend co-attentive feature mappings to large transformation groups without disrupting equivariance. This poses computational challenges and requires an efficient implementation of the attention mechanism. The approach could also be refined to address the enumeration problem of large groups, approximating functions acting on the group for applications beyond visual data. The concept of co-attentive equivariant feature mapping is introduced to improve the performance of equivariant neural networks on rotational settings. By attending to the co-occurrence envelope of the data, a new attention mechanism called cyclic equivariant self-attention is developed to maintain equivariance to a large set of transformation groups. The co-attentive equivariant feature mapping introduces a new attention mechanism called cyclic equivariant self-attention to maintain equivariance to transformation groups. This method simplifies the problem by focusing attention along r, leveraging the network's equivariance property. The method of cyclic equivariant self-attention simplifies the problem by focusing attention along rotations, leveraging the network's equivariance property. It ensures equivariance to cyclic permutations for each learned representation at a certain position. The equivariance property of the mapping f R simplifies the problem by ensuring that all learned feature representations move synchronously as a function of input rotation \u03b8 i. Applying a cyclic equivariant attention mechanism independently on each learned representation further enhances this property. By utilizing the equivariant attention mechanism independently on each learned representation, the feature representations move synchronously with input rotation \u03b8 i. This prioritizes learning feature representations that co-occur together, enhancing the model's performance compared to a looser formulation."
