    "content": "The Act titled \"Marine and Hydrokinetic Renewable Energy Promotion Act of 2010\" defines terms related to marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy and designates the Secretary of Energy. The Act \"Marine and Hydrokinetic Renewable Energy Promotion Act of 2010\" defines marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy as energy from waves, tides, currents, free-flowing water, salinity gradients, and water temperature gradients. It excludes energy from sources using dams, diversionary structures, or impoundments for electric power purposes. Section 633(a) of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to establish a program for marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technology research, development, and commercial application, including testing technologies and minimizing environmental impacts. The program for marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technology research aims to establish test centers, reduce costs, increase performance, integrate technologies into the national grid, and develop advanced system engineering methods. The program aims to assist industry in marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy generation by determining availability, developing materials, setting standards, and applying model predictions for technology development and operation. The program aims to assist industry in marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy generation by identifying opportunities for technology transfer, co-located development, navigation impacts, and interagency collaboration. The program focuses on marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technologies, separate from the Wind and Hydropower Program at the Department of Energy. SEC. 4. ENERGY GENERATION TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION GRANTS. The Secretary will establish a grant program to test marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technologies for performance, reliability, and cost, aiming to facilitate their commercial application at various scales. Activities may include testing technologies by connecting them to the national electrical grid. The grant program aims to test marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technologies for performance, reliability, and cost at various scales. This includes documenting technical, environmental, and economic information, obtaining operating data, providing information on environmental impacts, and conducting research and monitoring activities to support demonstration projects. SEC. 5. ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND DEMONSTRATION GRANTS. The Secretary will establish a grant program to address environmental impacts of marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technologies. This program will measure impacts, evaluate risks, research strategies to minimize impacts, develop monitoring technologies, and support baseline environmental research. The grant program aims to support baseline environmental research, facilitate public-private cooperation, and communicate information to the public for efficient and environmentally responsible technology development. SEC. 6. TEST FACILITIES. The Secretary will award competitive grants for marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technology research facilities within 180 days of enactment. Grants will support the demonstration of multiple technologies in operating environments, including modifications to existing facilities or new construction. The program aims to demonstrate various technologies at each test facility. Each test facility established under this section will provide infrastructure and resources for evaluating marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technologies. Applicants for grants must be nonprofit institutions, government entities, or research institutions. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 allows for the establishment of test facilities for marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technologies. These facilities must combine expertise from various academic fields and partner with other entities. The Secretary can provide up to $50,000,000 in Federal assistance for each test facility. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 allows for the establishment of test facilities for marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technologies. The amendment includes expanding the scope to include hydrokinetic technologies and enhancing the Centers' role as information clearinghouses and technology test facilities. SEC. 7. ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION OF PROGRAMS. The Secretary must coordinate activities to avoid duplication, collaborate with various entities, and make research information publicly available. The Secretary must report findings and activities under this Act to Congress annually, starting one year after enactment. Authorization of Appropriations: $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2011, with allocations for different sections, and $150,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2012 to 2015 for specific purposes."
