The \"Reserve Employer Tax Credit Act of 1999\" introduces a tax credit for reserve forces participation under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The credit includes an employment credit for qualified employees and a self-employment credit for qualified self-employed taxpayers. The employment credit is equal to 50 percent of qualified compensation for periods of qualified reserve duty. The \"Reserve Employer Tax Credit Act of 1999\" introduces a tax credit for reserve forces participation under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The employment credit for qualified employees participating in qualified reserve duty is the sum of individual employment credits. Qualified compensation for these employees is contingent on work presence and would be deductible under section 162(a)(1) if present. The \"Reserve Employer Tax Credit Act of 1999\" offers a tax credit for qualified employees engaged in reserve duty. Qualified compensation is deductible under section 162(a)(1) if the employee meets specific criteria. The \"Reserve Employer Tax Credit Act of 1999\" provides a tax credit for qualified employees engaged in reserve duty. The self-employment credit for a qualified self-employed taxpayer is 50 percent of the excess of their average daily self-employment income over the average daily military pay and allowances received while participating in qualified reserve duty. The \"Reserve Employer Tax Credit Act of 1999\" offers a tax credit for individuals participating in qualified reserve duty. For self-employed taxpayers, the credit is 50% of the difference between their average daily self-employment income and average daily military pay and allowances during reserve duty. The term 'average daily military pay and allowances' refers to the amount paid to the taxpayer for participating in qualified reserve duty divided by the total number of days involved, including travel time. A 'qualified self-employed taxpayer' is someone with net earnings from self-employment and is a member of the Ready Reserve. The employment credit provided in this section is in addition to any deduction allowable for compensation paid to a qualified employee during reserve duty. The maximum credit for the taxable year is $7,500 in total and $2,000 per qualified employee. The limitations for controlled groups are applied collectively, with allocation as prescribed by the Secretary. Failure to comply with employment rights of reserve components disallows the credit for taxpayers. Taxpayers are not eligible for a tax credit if they are under a final order from a district court related to a violation of chapter 43 of title 38 of the United States Code. The disallowance also applies if the individual for whom the credit is claimed is called to active duty for training under title 10, United States Code. The term 'qualified reserve duty' includes active duty in support of a contingency as designated in the reservist's military orders. Military pay refers to pay defined in section 101(21) of title 37, United States Code, and allowances are the allowances payable to a member of the Armed Forces under chapter 7 of that title. The term 'qualified reserve duty' includes active duty in support of a contingency operation as defined in section 101(a)(13) of title 10, United States Code. A person is excluded from normal employment or self-employment duties during qualified reserve duty unless on authorized leave or absence.
