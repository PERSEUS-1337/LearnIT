    "content": "The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 was passed by Congress in response to the environmental impacts of traditional incandescent light bulbs. These bulbs are inefficient, converting less than 10% of energy into light and the rest into heat. Lighting in the U.S. consumes nearly 300 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, with significant greenhouse gas emissions. The Energy Independence Act of 2007 set new performance requirements for certain light bulbs to improve efficiency. By 2030, it is projected to save $40 billion on electricity costs and offset 750 million metric tons of carbon emissions. Tier I requirements, effective 2012-2014, mandate bulbs to be 25-30% more efficient. Tier II standards, to be defined later, may require bulbs produced in 2020 to use 60% less energy. Some special-use incandescent bulbs are exempt from the standards. The Energy Independence Act of 2007 set new performance requirements for certain light bulbs to improve efficiency. Some special-use incandescent bulbs are exempt from the standards, including appliance bulbs, plant lights, infrared bulbs, bug lights, rough-service lamps, and reflector bulbs. The DOE is required to set new standards for reflector lights by June 2009. The law does not ban incandescent bulbs but sets a performance standard for non-excluded categories, requiring them to meet minimum energy efficiency requirements. Manufacturers are introducing advanced incandescent bulbs to meet the standards. In October 2007, Philips Lighting Company introduced the Halogen\u00e1 Energy Saver incandescent bulb series that meets Tier I standards. The 70-watt bulb in this product line provides high-quality light equivalent to traditional 100-watt bulbs. General Electric (GE) plans to have an incandescent bulb using half the energy of today's bulbs by 2010 and a quarter by 2012. Non-incandescent products like CFLs and LED bulbs already meet Tier I standards. Energy efficient light bulbs like CFLs and LEDs can save significant electricity compared to traditional incandescent bulbs. While CFLs may be more expensive upfront, their energy savings can offset the higher cost in a few months. LED bulbs offer a different type of light and provide consumers with a wide range of lighting options to choose from. Traditional incandescent bulbs are still preferred by some due to their familiarity. Traditional incandescent bulbs are favored by some consumers for their familiarity, low cost, and quality light. Despite high energy use and short lifetimes, this technology has endured for over 125 years. Advanced incandescent technology is emerging to address these drawbacks. Fluorescent lights, used in commercial settings since the 1930s, entered residential markets in the 1980s and 1990s with improved quality and lower costs. CFLs have evolved over two decades to meet \"Energy Star\" certification with improved quality and affordability. In 2007, Energy Star certified CFLs doubled in sales, accounting for 20% of the light bulb market. There are inexpensive, high-quality CFLs available, but brands vary in quality. CFLs contain small quantities of mercury. LEDs are now widely used in various devices and are becoming available for general illumination, with manufacturers developing new types for lighting and expecting cost reductions. LED bulbs are starting to match CFL and incandescent alternatives in light quality. LED bulbs are more expensive than CFL and incandescent bulbs but are becoming more efficient. They last longer, turn on instantly, and are not easily damaged. However, they are not widely available for general illumination and may have issues in extreme temperatures. LEDs are better suited for task lighting and some consumers find the light too cold or blue. Some consumers have complaints about LED light being too cold or blue, but these issues may improve as the technology advances. Quality concerns with CFL products include harsh light, short lifespan, and noise/flicker issues, although these have been addressed with better electronic ballasts. There are also objections to mercury in CFL bulbs, but when used and disposed of properly, they can actually reduce mercury. CFL bulbs can reduce mercury in the environment by lowering coal-fired electricity demand. EPA recommends special precautions for CFL use and disposal. New CFL varieties are designed for dimming switches but cost more and have limited settings. Some consumers complain about the time lag for CFLs to illuminate, although modern electronic ballasts have partially addressed this issue. Advanced CFL products may address the time lag for illumination issue. The Light Bulb Freedom of Choice Act (H.R. 5616) was introduced to repeal new lighting standards based on financial savings, health risks, and CO2 emissions reduction criteria."
