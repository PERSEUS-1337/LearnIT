    "content": "Federal government provides benefits through spending programs and tax expenditures, both increasing budget deficits. Differences in budget process, saliency, and targeting affect usage across services. Spending programs include discretionary, mandatory, and interest payments, totaling $3.897 trillion in FY2016. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that federal spending in FY2016 will total $3.897 trillion, with discretionary spending at $1.196 trillion and mandatory spending at $2.449 trillion. Discretionary spending includes Department of Defense, Homeland Security, and EPA, while mandatory spending covers programs like Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare. In FY2016, federal spending totaled $3.897 trillion, with $2.449 trillion allocated to mandatory spending, which is 13.2% of GDP. Net interest payments amount to $0.253 trillion, or 1.5% of GDP, and tax expenditures were projected to increase net deficits by $1.521 trillion, or 8.2% of GDP. Tax expenditures result from revenue losses due to federal tax provisions, including exclusions, exemptions, deductions, preferential tax rates, and tax credits. Tax expenditures in FY2016 were projected to increase net deficits by $1.521 trillion, or 8.2% of GDP. Exclusions, exemptions, and deductions lower taxes paid by reducing taxable income, with their value increasing with income levels. Preferential tax rates are levies on income lower than normal rates. Tax credits directly reduce tax liability for individuals or corporations and do not modify the definition of income in the federal tax code. They may be non-refundable or refundable. Tax credits in the federal tax code can be non-refundable or refundable, with nonrefundable credits capping benefit claims at the remaining tax liability amount. Refundable credits are not limited by tax liability thresholds and can impact federal outlay projections. The differences in spending and tax expenditure programs have implications for legislative treatment, budget outcomes, targeting, enforcement, and benefit distribution. The legislative process for spending programs and tax expenditures depends on factors like expiration of authority and committee assignment. Discretionary spending is funded through appropriations, with input from various committees. The federal budget process allocates discretionary budget authority through annual appropriation acts. The federal budget process allocates discretionary budget authority through annual appropriation acts, which expire at the end of each fiscal year. If a new fiscal year approaches without an agreed discretionary budget, Congress and the President can enact a continuing resolution or allow budget authority to lapse, leading to a government shutdown. Mandatory programs are permanently funded and not affected by the annual appropriations process. The enactment of modifying legislation does not affect the eligibility and benefit rules of mandatory spending programs, which are overseen by issue-specific committees. Tax expenditures, similar to spending programs, have varying legislative processes based on the type of program. However, the legislative process for tax expenditure legislation is mainly determined by whether the expenditure is permanent or expiring. Many tax expenditures have been permanently incorporated into the tax system. Many tax expenditures are permanently incorporated into the tax code, requiring legislative action to change. Benefits are not affected by the appropriations process, similar to mandatory spending programs. Some tax expenditures are temporary, introducing uncertainty as they may expire or change. Recent legislation altered the duration of several recently expired tax expenditures. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 extended 56 tax expenditure provisions that expired in 2014, with 30 programs extended for two years, 4 for five years, and 22 made permanent. Increases in resources for spending programs and tax expenditures lead to budget deficits. Congressional control over budget outcomes varies between spending and tax expenditure programs. The uncertainty in budget outcomes for discretionary spending programs arises from debates over budget authority allocation, leading to funding lapses and changes in resources. Mandatory spending programs are controlled by legislation outside the appropriations process, with Congress having limited control over final spending amounts based on program participation and usage. Congressional discretion varies between spending and tax expenditure programs, with increases in resources leading to budget deficits. The popularity of mandatory programs can vary based on budget outcomes, similar to Congressional control over mandatory spending programs. Federal legislation dictates eligibility and benefit levels for tax expenditures, but the actual resources allocated depend on public take-up influenced by external factors. Changes to one expenditure type can impact all others, and adoption of tax expenditures is tied to available tax liability. The government must identify eligible parties for resource transfers and address improper benefit claims before transferring resources to the public. The ease of this process may vary across spending and tax expenditure programs. Financial costs for targeting and enforcement can differ significantly across spending programs, with some having straightforward means of identifying eligible recipients. For example, income resources for active military servicemembers use military employment records, while programs like SNAP have income eligibility requirements. The SNAP program has income eligibility requirements based on household characteristics. Targeting and enforcement mechanisms for spending programs depend on context. Existing targeting mechanisms for income tax systems can be utilized for tax expenditures, reducing the need for additional resources. Enforcement for program eligibility can be done through the IRS tax auditing system to ensure accurate income reporting. The use of tax returns to enforce eligibility for tax expenditure programs may increase the complexity of the IRS auditing system. Spending programs have no theoretical restrictions on who can benefit, but eligibility restrictions are often based on policy goals. Discretionary spending programs allocate benefits to federal agencies for spending on public goods, which are non-rival and non-excludable. This may lead to free-riding, where some benefit without paying. For example, national defense is considered a public good. The potential for free-riding in national defense programs is a reason why discretionary spending is used, as benefits can be broadly applied and funded through general tax revenues. Mandatory spending programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid provide direct benefits to individuals and households, excluding them from funding public goods. Tax expenditure programs may have distributional limitations, especially for low-income households not filing tax returns. Tax expenditure programs may be best targeted to households with at least one employed person, as they are more likely to file tax returns. Low-income and elderly households, with below-average employment, may be less likely to participate in tax expenditure programs. Claiming tax expenditures is necessary to receive benefits, making it challenging to use them to finance public goods due to the benefit allocation process. The largest spending and tax expenditure programs in federal activities are categorized into eight groups. These programs are distinguished by type and budget subfunction. The tables exclude federal interventions like net interest. The tables categorize the largest federal spending and tax expenditure programs into eight groups based on type and budget subfunction. Three types of federal interventions, including net interest, federal allowances, and undistributed offsetting receipts, are not included in the analysis. Net interest is excluded because it is a result of previous spending and tax decisions, while allowances and undistributed receipts are omitted due to difficulties in determining beneficiaries for comparison with tax expenditure programs. Spending programs rely on collected funds, while tax expenditures are typically financed differently. The federal government collects funds for spending programs, while tax expenditures are financed through forgone revenues. Budget functions 050 and 150 cover national defense and international affairs activities. Defense and international affairs spending focus on military activities, while tax expenditure programs benefit foreign-based individuals and households with interests in the United States. The federal government funds spending programs and tax expenditures for national defense and international affairs. Budget functions 250, 270, 300, and 350 support science, technology, energy, natural resources, and agriculture. Both spending programs and tax expenditures allocate resources for scientific research and agricultural services. The federal government funds spending programs and tax expenditures for various sectors such as science, technology, energy, natural resources, and agriculture. Budget functions 370, 400, and 450 support commerce, transportation, and community development. Table 3 shows the costs of these programs, with a focus on air and ground transportation. Tax expenditures are also used to provide incentives in these areas. The federal government utilizes tax expenditures to incentivize activities related to homeownership, business, and community development. Budget function 500 focuses on education, training, employment, and social services, with a significant portion of resources allocated to higher education financing. Tax expenditure programs for budget function 500 primarily support social services. Compared to total federal spending, interventions in these areas are more likely to come from tax expenditures. Federal spending on health and Medicare programs in FY2016 is primarily allocated to Medicare and other health services, with over $1 trillion projected for mandatory components. Tax expenditure programs aim to promote health insurance enrollment and specific healthcare consumption. Income security programs fall under budget function 600, with federal spending directed towards these programs. Federal spending on income security programs in FY2016 is primarily allocated to payments for federal employees, low-income households, and private retirement contributions. Budget functions 650 and 700 focus on Social Security and veterans' benefits, with nearly 80% of resources spent on Social Security. Other federal spending goes towards income security and health care programs for veterans. Tax expenditure programs use the Internal Revenue Code to support Social Security, railroad retirement benefits, and exclude certain benefits for military veterans from taxation. Federal spending programs for budget functions 750 and 800 primarily fund government services such as law enforcement, judicial, and fiscal activities. Tax expenditures in these areas focus on exempting certain state and local government activities from federal taxation."
