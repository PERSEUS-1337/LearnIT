    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Older Industrial Region Rail and Port Access and Modernization Act\". Congress finds that the growth of commerce in northern New England is hindered by decaying rail infrastructure, international trade shipping is projected to increase by over 20% in the next 5 years, shippers are increasingly using ports with double-stack rail access, aging rail lines in older industrial States limit cargo movement and access to deepwater ports, and improving rail lines will boost the economy of older industrial regions. Improving rail infrastructure in older industrial regions will bring new industry, resulting in growth of high wage jobs. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The \"Fund\" refers to the Older Industrial Rail Modernization and Port Access Fund. An \"older industrial region\" is the northeastern area of the United States. An \"older industrial State\" includes Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire. A \"rail project\" involves the acquisition, rehabilitation, or improvement of railroad facilities or equipment. The \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Transportation. The Secretary will provide grants to older industrial States for transportation projects to improve rail transport, with grant agreements specifying requirements including cost-sharing. Grants will also be made for port access projects. The Secretary will make grants for connecting railroads to ports, ensuring free movement of double-stack rail cars, repairing bridges and tunnels, upgrading railroad beds, and developing intermodal facilities. The Secretary will make grants for constructing, operating, and maintaining train maintenance facilities, intermodal truck-train transfer facilities, passenger rail stations, and bulk fuel transfer facilities. Grants will be funded from the Fund with a cost-sharing requirement of 80% Federal share for project costs. For fiscal years 1998 through 2001, the Secretary will allocate available funds in the Fund among older industrial States based on a formula. Each State that meets grant requirements will receive an equal amount of funding from the Fund. The \"Older Industrial Rail Modernization and Port Access Fund\" is established in the Treasury of the United States, consisting of appropriated amounts and interest earned on investments. The Secretary of the Treasury will invest a portion of the Fund not needed for current withdrawals. The \"Older Industrial Rail Modernization and Port Access Fund\" is established in the Treasury of the United States. The Secretary of the Treasury will invest a portion of the Fund in interest-bearing obligations of the United States or obligations guaranteed by the United States. These investments can be acquired on original issue or by purchasing outstanding obligations at the market price. Any acquired obligation can be sold at the market price, except for special obligations issued exclusively to the Fund, which can be redeemed at par plus accrued interest. The \"Older Industrial Rail Modernization and Port Access Fund\" established in the Treasury of the United States credits interest and proceeds from obligations to the Fund. The Secretary of the Treasury can transfer funds to the Secretary of Transportation as needed for grant programs, with administrative expenses limited to 1 percent of the Fund. Funds made available to older industrial States are subject to Title 23, except as provided in this section. Authorization of Appropriations: $65,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated to the Older Industrial Rail Modernization and Port Access Fund for each fiscal year from 1998 to 2001. The funds will be available for obligation until the end of the third fiscal year following the appropriation. SEC. 5. RAILROAD LOAN AND ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. The purpose of this section is to provide assistance for rail projects in older industrial States by issuing obligations to pay for eligible rail projects. Eligible projects must meet the requirements outlined in the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976. The section authorizes funding for a rail project in older industrial states to promote mobility of goods and individuals. The Secretary can guarantee up to $50,000,000 in obligations during fiscal years 1998 through 2001. $5,000,000 is authorized for appropriations each year for the Secretary to make guarantees. The Secretary is required to submit a report to Congress and the Governor of each older industrial State annually, starting one year after the Act's enactment, regarding the rehabilitation of rail infrastructure in those states."
