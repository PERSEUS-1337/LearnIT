    "content": "The 112th and 113th Congresses made significant changes to the patent system through the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act and the Innovation Act. They also created new forms of regulatory exclusivity for biologic medicines and qualified infectious disease products. Patents, administered by the USPTO, provide a 20-year term of protection for various inventions. Regulatory exclusivities, like patents, protect inventions by granting exclusive rights to their owners. These exclusivities apply to drugs and biologic medicines regulated by the FDA, providing a shorter-term exclusion mechanism. Congress has developed these rights to promote the marketing of new drugs and establish a complex range of protections for various types of drugs. Regulatory exclusivities, like patents, serve as a shorter-term exclusion mechanism for innovative pharmaceuticals. Recent legislative trends have increased the term of regulatory exclusivities, with laws such as the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 and the Generating Antibiotics Incentives Now (GAIN) Act providing exclusivity periods of 12 and 10 years respectively. The MODDERN Cures Act, which was not enacted, aimed to extend this paradigm by allowing brand-name pharmaceutical firms to exchange their patents for a 15-year exclusivity period in certain circumstances. The report discusses proposals for pharmaceutical firms to exchange patents for a 15-year regulatory exclusivity period, as outlined in the 21st Century Cures Act draft. It reviews the evolving nature of patents and regulatory exclusivities in the industry, comparing FDA-administered exclusivities to patent rights. The report also mentions the MODDERN Cures Act and Innovation Act, highlighting the trend towards treating pharmaceuticals as intellectual property subjects. Legislative issues and options regarding these intellectual property rights are also discussed. The U.S. law has a two-track utility patent system, one for pharmaceuticals, biologics, and medical devices, and another for high-technology fields. Patent applicants must file with the USPTO, meeting statutory requirements. Once granted, patents last for twenty years, granting exclusivity rights. Pharmaceutical patents follow similar rules, with modifications under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act introduced modifications to pharmaceutical patents, allowing for up to a five-year extension to compensate for FDA approval delays. Patent holders can enforce their patents against generic competitors before product launch, blocking them from marketing throughout the patent's life if successful in litigation. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows pharmaceutical patent holders to block generic competitors for up to 30 months during patent litigation. This remedy is similar to a preliminary injunction and favors brand-name firms, but the Act also includes provisions like the \"Bolar exemption\" that benefit generic companies. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows brand-name firms to protect their patents from infringement by generic companies for up to 30 months. Generic firms can obtain FDA approval through an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) based on data from the brand-name firm, saving time and costs. Changes in patent law, such as Supreme Court decisions or legislative reforms, also impact pharmaceutical patents. The term \"regulatory exclusivity\" refers to a period of time during which the FDA protects an approved drug from competing marketing approval applications. Congress has established fifteen regulatory exclusivities, including Ten-Year Transitional Exclusivity and Seven-Year Orphan Drug Exclusivity. The FDA provides various types of regulatory exclusivities for approved drugs, including Three-Year QI Act Antibiotic Exclusivity, New Clinical Study Exclusivity, Transitional Exclusivity, Pediatric Exclusivity, Generic Exclusivity, and exclusivities for biologics. Brand-name firms have periods where follow-on biologics cannot be marketed or approved. The five-year new chemical entity (NCE) exclusivity protects drugs with FDA-approved active ingredients not previously approved. The FDA grants NCE exclusivity for drugs with FDA-approved active ingredients not previously approved. This exclusivity prevents generic companies from submitting marketing approval applications for five years after FDA approval. Regulatory exclusivities differ from patents and must be enforced through litigation in federal courts. The FDA enforces regulatory exclusivities automatically, without the intervention of the proprietary rights holder. Patents provide the right to try to exclude, but courts often find them invalid. Regulatory exclusivities prevent generic companies from marketing for five years after FDA approval. Regulatory exclusivities provide a more certain proprietary interest than patents, as they can be granted even for pharmaceuticals that were previously in the public domain. The USPTO examines patent applications to ensure novelty and nonobviousness, while courts may invalidate patents claiming public domain technologies. Regulatory exclusivities are enforced by the FDA without the need for the rights holder's intervention. Colchicine, an ancient gout remedy marketed in the US since the 19th century, saw a price increase after FDA required safety studies in 2006. Mutual Pharmaceutical Co. complied, leading to exclusivity rights and a price hike from $0.09 to $4.85 per tablet for their product Colcrys, causing generic colchicine products to become unavailable in the US. The colchicine incident in the United States in 2010 led to generic products becoming unavailable, costing the Medicaid program $50 million per year. This revealed that pharmaceuticals in the public domain can be subject to regulatory exclusivities, which differ from patents in their extent of protection. Regulatory exclusivities align closely with brand-name products, while patents focus on distinguishing inventions from earlier disclosures. Brand-name firm's patents may not fully correspond to their products. The duration of regulatory exclusivities varies, with some lasting only six months for generic firms and up to seven years for orphan drug exclusivity. These rights provide short-term protection that expires before corresponding patents. Recent legislation has extended the terms of regulatory exclusivities. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009 granted brand-name firms a twelve-year exclusivity period. In 2012, the Generating Antibiotics Incentives Now (GAIN) Act added five years to regulatory exclusivities for qualified infectious disease products. This extended exclusivity period is comparable to the 14-year patent protection under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Innovation Act introduced in the 114th Congress aims to address concerns in the pharmaceutical industry regarding trolling, infringement lawsuits, and patent ownership transparency. It includes requirements for detailed patent pleadings, disclosure of patent ownership to the USPTO, and a stay of litigation against end users using manufacturer's equipment. The Innovation Act introduced in the 114th Congress aims to address concerns in the pharmaceutical industry regarding trolling, infringement lawsuits, and patent ownership transparency. It includes requirements for detailed patent pleadings, disclosure of patent ownership to the USPTO, and a stay of litigation against end users using manufacturer's equipment. The proposed reforms do not apply to pharmaceutical patents enforced against generic competitors under the Hatch-Waxman Act, indicating a focus on high-tech industries rather than the pharmaceutical sector. The MODDERN Cures Act, not enacted, aimed to promote pharmaceutical innovation through regulatory exclusivities. It required drug sponsors to address unmet medical needs to gain fifteen years of exclusivity. The Act also proposed disclaiming patent term extensions beyond this period. Similar provisions are found in the 21st Century Cures Act discussion draft. The discussion draft of the 21st Century Cures Act proposes to extend brand-name firm exclusivities by six months for new indications related to rare diseases. It also suggests increasing new clinical study exclusivity by three years for studies supporting new indications or improving treatment benefits for patients. Additionally, the draft would amend the GAIN Act to allow transfer of exclusivity extensions for qualified infectious disease products. The MODDERN Cures Act proposes extending brand-name firm exclusivity by up to 12 months for transferring to more profitable products. Recipients must donate up to 5% of sales to NIH. Some support the Act, citing uncertainty in patent protection as a barrier to new drug development. The MODDERN Cures Act proposes extending brand-name firm exclusivity by up to 12 months for transferring to more profitable products. Some support the Act due to uncertainty in patent protection as a barrier to new drug development. However, concerns have been raised about the Act potentially granting excessive protection to all novel drugs, leading to a windfall for many. The MODDERN Cures Act proposes extending brand-name firm exclusivity by up to 12 months for transferring to more profitable products. This legislation may lead to a windfall for drugs that would have been developed regardless, aligning with the trend of relying on regulatory exclusivities for innovation in the pharmaceutical industry. The political economy of the patent system involves diverse stakeholders, making it easier for Congress to introduce reforms to drug regulation than to the patent system. The United States' membership in the WTO limits Congress' ability to tailor the patent system to specific industries. The TRIPS Agreement requires signatories to provide patent protection without discrimination based on place of invention or technology field. It also allows for regulatory exclusivities to promote desired behaviors in regulated industries, such as the development of ethnic medicines and personalized treatments. Regulatory exclusivities can be awarded for various activities like domestic manufacturing, environmentally sound packaging, or donating medications to the poor. Congress may consider steps to improve the rationality of the intellectual property system. The current fifteen regulatory exclusivities offer a diverse range of proprietary interests, some blocking competitors from submitting FDA applications while others allow applications but bar approval. Some regulatory exclusivities protect data packages submitted to the FDA, while others block marketing permission. Terms vary from date of FDA approval to first sale. Exclusivities can be forfeited or truncated. Congress may consider developing categories for easier reference. Congress may consider developing categories of scopes of protection for regulatory exclusivities, which could be divided based on the extent of protection. Specific names could be assigned to different regulatory exclusivities to improve consistency in industry terminology. Some sources use terms like \"marketing exclusivity\" and \"data protection\" interchangeably with \"regulatory exclusivity,\" while others differentiate between them. \"Data protection\" prevents generic firms from referencing sponsor-submitted data, while \"marketing exclusivity\" offers broader protection against competition. Confusion over these terms has led to calls for legislation to assign specific names to each type of exclusivity. The current system of regulatory exclusivities does not always consider the interests of patients and other stakeholders. Regulatory exclusivities should account for patient and enterprise interests, ensuring continued availability of safe medicines. Unlike patents, regulatory exclusivities offer more certainty and are less contestable. Certain exclusivities may hinder generic firms from filing paperwork. Regulatory exclusivities, such as the five-year New Chemical Entity exclusivity, prohibit generic firms from obtaining FDA approval. The exclusivity period includes the time for FDA review, and Congress may need to reconsider how these exclusivities impact competition. This shift towards relying on exclusivities to promote pharmaceutical innovation marks a significant change in US intellectual property law. Innovation in the US intellectual property landscape allows for tailored rights in specific industries, potentially aiding in consensus for patent system reforms. Concerns exist over regulatory exclusivities benefiting brand-name firms at the expense of public health. Balancing incentives for pharmaceutical innovation with public medication access is a key legislative challenge."
