    "content": "Critics of the EPA have focused on the agency's regulatory actions under the Clean Air Act during the Obama Administration. These regulations were in response to congressional mandates and court decisions, but critics argue they are too costly and not justified by the benefits obtained. The Clean Air Act allows the EPA Administrator to set standards in over 60 sections, with cost considerations mentioned in more than 40 sections. Cost estimates have been prepared for all economically significant rules since the Carter Administration, as required by executive orders. The Clean Air Act mandates that Executive Branch agencies must conduct a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) to estimate the costs and benefits of proposed regulations. Critics question if the EPA underestimates costs and negative impacts by not considering cumulative effects and relying heavily on the benefits of reducing particulate matter. The report examines issues related to Clean Air Act regulations, including the effects of reducing particulate matter (PM) emissions, the methodology for valuing the avoidance of premature death, and the challenges in identifying the full costs and benefits of environmental regulations. EPA's authorities and the role of cost considerations in standard-setting are also reviewed. The Clean Air Act, enacted in 1955 and amended multiple times, grants EPA broad powers to protect air quality and public health. It directs the EPA Administrator to set national air quality standards, regulate emissions from stationary and mobile sources, reduce hazardous air pollutants, protect pristine areas, regulate fuels and additives, require renewable transportation fuels, control acid deposition, and phase out ozone-depleting substances. The Clean Air Act grants the EPA broad powers to protect air quality and public health by phasing out ozone-depleting substances, issuing permits, enforcing emission limits, and developing Federal Implementation Plans. The act's authorities range from broad to detailed requirements, making it challenging to generalize the role of cost considerations in setting air quality standards. The Clean Air Act grants the EPA broad powers to protect air quality and public health by phasing out ozone-depleting substances, issuing permits, enforcing emission limits, and developing Federal Implementation Plans. A review of regulatory authorities in the act shows that about half specifically mention cost or economic considerations in setting emission standards for various sources. The Clean Air Act grants the EPA powers to set emission standards for various sources, including nonroad vehicles, locomotives, buses, and aircraft. Cost considerations are implied in some cases, directing the EPA Administrator to consider factors like the \"remaining useful life of the existing source\" and the use of \"generally available control technologies\" for controlling hazardous air pollutants. The EPA is directed to consider various factors when setting emission standards, including prevention of accidental releases, concerns of small businesses, feasibility of pollution control measures, and technological achievability. This includes imposing emissions standards that reflect the best retrofit technology for urban buses and establishing accelerated schedules for phasing in requirements. The EPA is directed to consider various factors when setting emission standards, including prevention of accidental releases, concerns of small businesses, feasibility of pollution control measures, and technological achievability. This includes establishing an accelerated schedule for phasing out production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances and regulating nonessential products that release class I ozone depleting substances. Cost is not mentioned or implied in 25 CAA sections where regulatory authority is conferred on the Administrator. In the late 1980s, Congress limited EPA's discretion in setting emission standards due to slow progress and litigation delays. EPA is directed to consider various factors when setting standards, including prevention of accidental releases and technological achievability. Cost is not mentioned in 25 CAA sections conferring regulatory authority on the Administrator. Congress limited EPA's discretion in setting emission standards by detailing regulatory requirements in the statute, such as in Section 202 for motor vehicle emissions and Section 112 for hazardous air pollutants. EPA still needed to create regulations to implement these standards, but the specific standards were set by Congress to take effect on a certain date. The Clean Air Act mandates strict emission limits for sources, with a 10-year schedule for standards. It includes health-based National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for pollutants like sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, and lead. EPA must review scientific data to set these standards. The Clean Air Act mandates National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for pollutants like sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, and lead. EPA reviews scientific data to set these standards, which define clean air for specified pollutants. Nonattainment areas must reduce pollutant concentrations to meet the standards, with state and local governments developing plans to achieve this within three years. Cost considerations are a significant factor in NAAQS decisions. EPA is prohibited from considering costs when setting standards under Section 109. The EPA has interpreted Section 109 of the Clean Air Act as prohibiting the consideration of costs in setting National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). This interpretation was affirmed by the Supreme Court in 2001, stating that cost considerations are barred from the NAAQS-setting process. Congress has given the EPA authority to promulgate regulations to achieve objectives related to public health and environmental protection. The Clean Air Act grants the EPA authority to regulate substances that impact public health and the environment, including ozone-depleting substances. Congress directed the EPA to phase out production and consumption of these substances to protect the ozone layer. EPA is also authorized to add other harmful substances to the list for regulation. The Clean Air Act grants the EPA authority to regulate substances that impact public health and the environment, including ozone-depleting substances. A schedule for the phase-out of these chemicals is provided in Section 604(c). Section 615 of the act allows the Administrator to regulate substances that may affect the stratosphere and endanger public health without considering cost. Additionally, the act gives EPA backup authority to regulate substances without considering cost. The Clean Air Act grants EPA authority to regulate substances impacting public health and the environment. States are responsible for adopting regulations to attain National Ambient Air Quality Standards. If a state fails to submit a satisfactory plan, EPA must promulgate a Federal Implementation Plan within 2 years. EPA cannot compel a state to submit a State Implementation Plan. The Clean Air Act grants EPA authority to regulate substances impacting public health and the environment. States must adopt regulations to meet National Ambient Air Quality Standards. If a state's plan does not meet criteria, EPA can disapprove it unless corrected. The Administrator is not required to consider cost in developing a plan, but executive orders mandate cost and benefit estimation for economically significant regulations. The term \"effect on the economy\" means that a rule may be considered economically significant if it has costs or benefits of over $100 million. Agencies are required to assess both the costs and benefits of regulations before proposing them for public comment. OMB provides guidance on estimating costs and benefits, and regulations should only be adopted if the benefits justify the costs. The OMB provides guidance on estimating costs and benefits of regulations through Circular A-4, which outlines the key elements of good regulatory analysis. This includes the need for the proposed action, examination of alternative approaches, and evaluation of benefits and costs. Agencies are required to use cost-benefit analysis in their regulatory analysis. EPA's guidelines for economic analyses are based on Circular A-4's framework. The Circular A-4 guidance states that agencies should use cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and cost-effectiveness analysis to determine the most economically efficient approaches for regulations. CBA involves identifying all costs and benefits, while cost-effectiveness analysis focuses on achieving goals at the least cost. In cases where not all benefits or costs can be expressed in monetary units, cost-effectiveness analysis is used. The goal is to maximize \"net benefits\" in regulatory design. In ideal circumstances, regulations should aim to maximize \"net benefits\" by understanding market failures and economic externalities. Analyzing environmental regulations through market theory helps assess costs and benefits. OMB's circular and EPA's guidelines provide methods to determine total costs and benefits, including difficult-to-quantify factors. This includes direct costs to regulated firms such as pollution control equipment and labor for installation and operation. The agency should analyze impacts on consumers, small businesses, government entities, international trade, and energy and employment effects. Benefits of regulations should be quantified using scientific, technical, economic, and other information to measure impacts such as air pollution reduction benefits. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) quantifies benefits of regulations through tools like Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program. Some benefits are hard to quantify, requiring qualitative discussion. EPA completed Regulatory Impact Analyses (RIAs) for 55 Clean Air Act rules from 2001-2016. From 2001-2016, EPA completed RIAs for 55 CAA rules under the executive order. 46 of the 55 RIAs concluded that the benefits of the rules would exceed the costs. Two rules had projected costs greater than benefits, while in seven cases, there was substantial overlap in cost and benefit ranges or the costs and benefits could not be quantified. EPA Administrator is required to prepare an economic impact assessment for various air quality standards under the Clean Air Act. The economic impact assessment for air quality standards under the Clean Air Act includes analyzing compliance costs, inflationary effects, competition impact on small businesses, consumer costs, and energy use. The assessment informs cost considerations but does not alter factors required for action when promulgating or revising standards. The section provides the Administrator discretion to limit time and resources for required analyses and states that there shall be no judicial review of any standard or regulation based on failure to comply with this section. Issues have been raised regarding EPA's cost-benefit analyses for Clean Air Act rules. Issues have been raised regarding EPA's cost-benefit analyses for Clean Air Act rules, focusing on underestimating costs and negative impacts, potential double counting of benefits, and the agency's approach to considering individual rules in its RIAs. EPA's analyses start with existing regulatory requirements and estimate additional costs and benefits for proposed or final rules. The agency considers more stringent and less stringent options in proposed and final rule RIAs to analyze costs and benefits. Multiple rules may be developed simultaneously to address pollution from a specific industry due to congressional directives. For example, fossil-fueled power plants have been subject to rules addressing various emissions in the past five years. Each rule's impact must be examined when multiple rules are proposed simultaneously. When multiple rules are proposed simultaneously, each rule's impact must be examined in isolation to comply with directives. Analyzing rules individually may overlook cumulative economic impacts and avoid double counting costs and benefits. Developing rules together can benefit regulated entities by allowing them to address multiple issues at once, potentially reducing compliance costs. The EPA has conducted cost-benefit analyses of Clean Air Act regulations, finding that the benefits far exceed the costs. A retrospective study estimated the cumulative cost of regulations between 1970 and 1990 at $523 billion, with benefits ranging from $5.6 to $49.4 trillion. The EPA conducted cost-benefit analyses of Clean Air Act regulations, finding that benefits far exceeded costs. The value of benefits ranged from $5.6 to $49.4 trillion over a 20-year period, with human health effects accounting for the majority of the economic value. The agency noted limitations and uncertainties in the data, including indirect costs not quantified and controversies in characterizing adverse health and ecological effects of pollution in dollar terms. The EPA conducted cost-benefit analyses of Clean Air Act regulations, finding that benefits far exceeded costs. The estimated cost of compliance for regulations under the 1990 amendments to Titles I through V of the Clean Air Act was $19 billion annually in the year 2000, rising to $27 billion annually in 2010. The estimated economic value of benefits ranged from $16 billion to $160 billion annually in 2000, and $26 billion to $270 billion annually in 2010. The agency acknowledged uncertainties in the data but concluded that the benefits greatly exceeded the costs. The EPA conducted cost-benefit analyses of Clean Air Act regulations, finding that benefits far exceeded costs. The economic value of benefits ranged from $16 billion to $160 billion annually in 2000, and $26 billion to $270 billion in 2010. EPA concluded that benefits exceeded costs by more than 4 to 1 for the central estimate. The study estimated costs and benefits separately for Title VI, with benefits of $530 billion over a 175-year period and costs of $27 billion. Another study estimated compliance costs at $65 billion in 2020 with benefits of $2 billion. The Clean Air Act had benefits exceeding costs by 31 to 1 in 2020, with estimated benefits of $2 trillion. The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) conducts interagency reviews of regulations and prepares annual reports to Congress on costs and benefits. The latest report for 2015 includes estimates of aggregated benefits and costs of regulations reviewed by OMB over the last 10 years. The OMB report reviewed benefits and costs of regulations over the last 10 years, highlighting the significant impact of EPA rules, particularly from the Office of Air and Radiation. EPA rules accounted for a majority of the monetized benefits and costs, with benefits outweighing costs by 4 to 21 times. Critics point out that EPA's cost-benefit analyses often focus on reducing particulate matter emissions, linking it to premature deaths and justifying regulations even for different pollutants. The OMB report highlighted the significant impact of EPA rules, particularly from the Office of Air and Radiation, with benefits outweighing costs by 4 to 21 times. Critics point out that EPA's cost-benefit analyses often focus on reducing particulate matter emissions, justifying regulations even for different pollutants. RIAs do not always monetize all benefits, such as those associated with reductions in hazardous air pollutants. The 2015 OIRA report highlighted the large estimated benefits of EPA rules issued under the Clean Air Act, mainly due to reducing public exposure to fine particulate matter. Some rules monetize benefits from emissions controls, while others monetize ancillary reductions in particulate matter from limiting hazardous air pollutants. For example, the Utility MACT rule's majority of monetized benefits come from particulate matter \"co-benefits.\" The consideration of co-benefits, including those associated with reducing particulate matter, is consistent with standard accounting practices and required under OMB Circular A-4. Congress directed EPA to set emission standards for sources of over 187 hazardous air pollutants listed in the Clean Air Act, many of which are categories of pollutants rather than individual substances. The EPA regulates air pollutants that can be harmful to health, even without specific data on exposure levels or associated illnesses. Particulate matter emissions are a focus due to their link to increased mortality, and many EPA regulations target reducing particulate emissions. Particulate matter emissions are crucial in regulatory impact assessments (RIAs) due to their link to premature mortality. The value of statistical lives saved (VSL) is a key factor in RIAs, with EPA guidelines guiding VSL analyses since 1983. VSL is estimated using \"willingness to pay\" or \"willingness to accept\" methodologies. Surveys ask respondents about their willingness to pay to avoid risks. Revealed preference studies use market data to estimate risk values, like wage-risk studies. Circular A-4 helps standardize measuring benefits and costs of regulatory actions. Circular A-4 helps standardize measuring benefits and costs of regulatory actions by emphasizing the use of willingness-to-pay as the most appropriate measure of opportunity costs. It also recommends using a willingness-to-pay measure for monetizing health benefits to capture pain, suffering, and quality-of-life effects. The circular notes academic studies on values of statistical life (VSL) ranging from $1 million to $10 million but does not recommend a specific VSL for agencies to use. The EPA uses a 1997 estimate of Values of Statistical Life (VSL) updated to current dollars. Recent RIAs have used an estimate of $9.9 million in 2015 dollars. Cost-benefit analysis faces challenges in quantifying costs and benefits due to assumptions, lack of retrospective studies, and difficulty in quantifying or monetizing effects. Cost-benefit analysis involves making assumptions about control technology, production methods, and input costs, which can vary significantly between EPA estimates and stakeholder estimates. Unforeseen implementation difficulties or technology improvements can affect costs. Assumptions often fail to account for broad economic factors influencing industry compliance with standards, as seen with the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards for electric power plants in 2012. The RIA in 2012 predicted an increase in coal-fired power generation and a decrease in natural gas-fired power due to the Air Toxics Standards. However, the analysis did not anticipate the significant drop in natural gas prices by 2015, leading to a shift towards natural gas as a more cost-effective option. The drop in natural gas prices to $2.63 led to utilities retiring coal-fired plants and increasing natural gas usage. Coal-fired power declined to 1,352 billion kilowatt-hours in 2015, while natural gas-fired power increased to 1,333 billion kilowatt-hours. The lack of studies on the actual cost of regulations post-implementation is highlighted by the MATS rule RIA. EPA conducted a retrospective cost analysis in response to the lack of studies on actual post-implementation costs of regulations. The study aimed to improve EPA's cost assessments by examining past regulations. The report highlighted the limited number and scope of ex post cost case studies, making it challenging to draw generalized conclusions. The report analyzed four case studies to determine if sufficient ex post compliance cost information could be gathered from publicly-accessible data sources. While some data is available, cost information is generally lacking, and evidence of overestimation of costs ex ante is inconclusive. EPA often includes unquantifiable benefits in its Regulatory Impact Analyses, citing data and resource limitations as barriers to full monetization. The EPA faces limitations in quantifying and monetizing health and welfare benefits in its Regulatory Impact Analyses. Despite recognizing these difficulties, the agency must exercise professional judgment in determining the importance of non-quantified benefits or costs in overall analysis. EPA is sometimes bound by statute and executive orders to consider costs when promulgating regulations under the Clean Air Act. The EPA is required to estimate costs and benefits for its rules, with benefits usually exceeding costs by a wide margin. However, under the Trump Administration, there is a focus on reducing regulatory costs. Executive Orders have been signed to control regulatory costs and promote economic growth. Executive Order, E.O. 13783, signed in March 2017, focused on Clean Air Act regulations. It requires federal agencies to repeal two existing regulations for every new one proposed. The order emphasizes costs over benefits and establishes annual regulatory budgets for agencies. The Executive Order for FY2017 directs that the total cost of new regulations must be zero unless required by law or approved by the Director of OMB. The Director of OMB will provide guidance to agencies on standardizing regulatory cost measurement, determining new regulations, and eliminating existing ones. The Executive Order for FY2017 requires new regulations to have zero total cost unless approved by the OMB Director. The OMB Director has new authority to provide guidance, identify regulatory budgets, and grant waivers. Some Clean Air Act rules may be exempt from the order's requirements. The Clean Air Act rules may be exempt from the executive order's requirements based on interpretations of the language exempting regulations required by law. The EPA Administrator has authority in multiple sections of the CAA to set standards without cost considerations. Judicially required rulemaking deadlines have been established for EPA regulations. E.O. 13783 mandates reviews of agency actions for potential impacts. The second executive order, E.O. 13783, requires reviews of agency actions that could hinder domestic energy development, focusing on oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear resources. It targets specific Clean Air Act regulations, including the Clean Power Plan and standards for fossil-fueled electric generating units. The order directs the EPA to assess these rules for consistency with its goals and potentially suspend, revise, or rescind them to promote clean energy development. The executive order aims to ensure the safe development of the nation's energy resources, promote clean air and water, and comply with environmental regulations. There is speculation that the rules targeted for review may not automatically be rescinded, as they were originally justified to achieve the order's goals. EPA's administration of the Clean Air Act may see changes regardless of the specific rules reviewed. The EPA's administration of the Clean Air Act under the Trump Administration is expected to function differently than it did under the Obama Administration. The Act gives the EPA Administrator broad discretion in deciding on regulations, which could lead to changes in the stringency of new regulations and the need for new regulations. Legal arguments may arise regarding the power delegated to the EPA by Congress."
