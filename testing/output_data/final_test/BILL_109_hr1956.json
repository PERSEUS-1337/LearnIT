    "content": "The \"Business Activity Tax Simplification Act of 2006\" may remove certain limitations on the application of Public Law 86-272. The \"Business Activity Tax Simplification Act of 2006\" may amend Section 101 of the Act to include solicitations for transactions of property outside the State. The \"Business Activity Tax Simplification Act of 2006\" amends Section 101 to include transactions fulfilled from a point outside the State, expanding the scope beyond tangible personal property sales. The \"Business Activity Tax Simplification Act of 2006\" expands the scope of net income tax prohibitions to include other business activity taxes, prohibiting states from imposing such taxes. The amendments made by subsection (a) of the Business Activity Tax Simplification Act of 2006 apply to taxes for taxable periods starting after the first day of the first calendar year following the enactment date. SEC. 3. Jurisdictional standard for state and local net income taxes and other business activity taxes. No state taxing authority can impose a net income or business activity tax on a person engaged in interstate commerce without a physical presence in the state. Physical presence is defined as being in the state for more than 21 days during the taxable year. Activities in connection with purchasing goods or services for business consumption, news gathering for media distribution, meeting government officials for non-sales purposes, attending educational events, and participating in charitable activities are exempt from state business activity tax. Using an agent to establish or maintain the market in the state is also allowed if the agent does not perform services for any other person in the state during the taxable year. The 21-day limit for leasing or owning property in the State is excluded for tangible personal property used for assembly, manufacturing, or testing, marketing materials, and property ancillary to excluded activities. If the taxable period is not a year, physical presence requirements are adjusted accordingly. Exceptions include entities domiciled in the state and individuals residing in the state. This section does not affect taxation of partners and similar persons. The section does not modify State business tax liability for certain entities with physical presence in the state. It also does not affect a State's authority to enforce laws against illegal activities or abuse in business operations. Certain activities such as the sale of tangible personal property and performance of services that physically affect real property within a State are subject to specific time limits. Live performances before a large audience in a State are also subject to taxation based on the duration of the event. The section discusses taxation rules for live events with over 100 spectators present, without affecting existing tax laws related to interstate commerce. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"net income tax\" as per the Act of 1959 and \"other business activity tax\" as various types of taxes imposed on business activities. The Act defines \"other business activity tax\" as taxes imposed by a State on business activities, excluding sales or use taxes related to goods or services. The term \"State\" includes states, the District of Columbia, and territories. The term \"tangible personal property\" excludes computer software owned and licensed by the owner to another person. The Act applies to taxable periods starting after the first year following enactment, unless stated otherwise."
