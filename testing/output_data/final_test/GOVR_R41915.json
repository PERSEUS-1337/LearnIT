    "content": "Taxpayers who received the homebuyer tax credit have two years from an involuntary conversion to replace the property and avoid acceleration of repayment. Those who bought homes in 2008 and got the $7,500 credit must repay $500 per year, even if the property is involuntarily converted. Taxpayers who received the homebuyer tax credit must report any involuntary conversion on Form 5405. Two options on the form apply to involuntary conversions: one for acquiring a new home within 2 years and another for not planning to acquire a new home within 2 years. Repayment of the credit is required if the property is involuntarily converted. The taxpayer who received the homebuyer tax credit must report any involuntary conversion on Form 5405. Repayment of the credit is required if the property is involuntarily converted. Even if the taxpayer does not intend to replace the property within two years, accelerated repayment is not due until the tax year for the year in which the two-year replacement period expires. In some cases, repayment may not be necessary due to the limitation based on gain from insurance proceeds, condemnation awards, or selling price. If the principal residence is not replaced within the allowed two years, the taxpayer must determine if there was a gain or loss realized on the property. Section 36(f)(3) limits the repayment of the homebuyer credit to the amount. The destruction of a principal residence due to flooding in 2011 does not require repayment of the outstanding balance of the homebuyer credit on the 2011 tax return. This is because the destruction is considered an involuntary conversion, which exempts the taxpayer from the repayment acceleration requirements. If your property is destroyed, an exception to the repayment acceleration requirements applies. If you replace your residence within two years, repayment of the credit will not be accelerated. If not replaced, the credit will be accelerated but reported on the tax return when the two-year period expires. If your residence was purchased in 2008, you must continue repaying the usual amount. If your residence is severely damaged but not completely destroyed, you do not have to repay the outstanding balance of the homebuyer credit on your 2011 tax return. If your house is destroyed in a federally declared disaster area, the involuntary conversion exception for the homebuyer tax credit repayment acceleration does not apply if you replace the property within four years. If your house is destroyed in a federally declared disaster area, you must file Form 5405 with your tax return, indicating the date of damage and your intention to replace the property within two years. Not replacing the property will not result in immediate tax consequences, but if you do replace it within two years, there will be no accelerated repayment of the tax credit. If your house is destroyed in a federally declared disaster area, you must file Form 5405 with your tax return, indicating the date of damage and your intention to replace the property within two years. If you replace the property within two years, there will be no accelerated repayment requirement. You will need to continue paying your scheduled repayment amount in 2011 and 2012 if you do not replace your home within the two-year period. If you do not replace your house within the two-year replacement period, you generally would need to repay the outstanding balance on your credit, but this repayment may be reduced or eliminated depending on whether there was a gain from the involuntary conversion. If there was no gain from the involuntary conversion, no further repayment of the credit is required. If the gain was less than the outstanding balance, the repayment amount would be the gain. The cost basis in the house would need to be reduced by the original amount of the credit for calculating the gain."
