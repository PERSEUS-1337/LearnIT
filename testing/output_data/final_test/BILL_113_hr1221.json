    "content": "The Act titled \"Basel III Capital Impact Study Act\" requires a study to be conducted. The Federal banking agencies are required to conduct a study and issue a report to Congress before making any final rule changes to their general risk-based capital requirements. This includes determining risk-weighted assets and minimum regulatory capital ratios. The Federal banking agencies are required to determine minimum regulatory capital ratios as proposed in the Basel III NPR issued in June 2012. SEC. 3. STUDY AND REPORT. The Federal banking agencies will conduct a study on the impact of the Standardized Approach NPR and the Advanced Approach NPR on regulatory capital requirements of insured depository institutions and holding companies. The study will also analyze the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act affecting capital quality, levels, asset quality, and risk management activities. The Federal banking agencies will identify provisions from the Dodd-Frank Act that affect capital quality, levels, asset quality, and risk management activities of insured depository institutions and holding companies. This includes sections on enhanced supervision, prudential standards, early remediation requirements, and leverage and risk-based capital requirements. The Federal banking agencies will conduct a study to determine the cumulative impact of various provisions from the Dodd-Frank Act on regulatory requirements, including capital quality, levels, asset quality, risk management activities, and regulations on proprietary trading, credit risk retention, and qualified mortgages. The Federal banking agencies will assess the impact of NPRs and identified provisions on required capital levels, risk-weighted asset levels, and capital fluctuations at covered financial institutions. The Federal banking agencies will evaluate the effects of NPRs and identified provisions on risk management tools, residential mortgage lending, home equity lines of credit, and credit availability, especially in low- and moderate-income areas. The Federal banking agencies will assess the impact of NPRs on risk management tools, residential mortgage lending, home equity lines of credit, and credit availability, particularly in low- and moderate-income areas. This includes evaluating the variance in capital levels and asset quality between institutions using different risk weighting approaches, as well as the historical probability of default and loss given default of residential mortgage loans. The Federal banking agencies will issue a report to the Senate and House committees on the results of a study on NPRs impact on risk management tools, residential mortgage lending, and credit availability. The report will include methodologies, assumptions, and required study elements. The report will include the required elements of the study listed in subsection (a). SEC. 4. COMPETITIVE EQUALITY. Each Federal banking agency must ensure that differences in capital standards for banking institutions do not create competitive advantages unless required by law and do not undermine enhanced supervision requirements."
