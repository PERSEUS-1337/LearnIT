The \"Rail Shipper Fairness Act of 2015\" amends rail transportation policy to protect the shipping public, allows shippers to obtain rates from multiple carriers, addresses market dominance issues, and revises terminal facility regulations. The Board shall require a Class 1 rail carrier to enter into a competitive switching agreement if a shipper demonstrates that their facilities are served by a single rail carrier and there is a working interchange with another carrier nearby. Competitive switching cannot be imposed under certain circumstances. The Board may require a Class 1 rail carrier to engage in competitive switching if a shipper shows that their facilities are served by a single rail carrier and there is a nearby interchange with another carrier. Competitive switching cannot be mandated if it is deemed infeasible, unsafe, or if it unduly restricts a rail carrier's ability to serve its own shippers. The requirement is met if the shipper's facility is within the boundaries of a Class I rail carrier's terminal or within a 100-mile radius of an interchange where rail cars are regularly switched. SEC. 4. IMPROVING REASONABLE RATE STANDARDS. (a) Stand-Alone Cost Cases.--Section 10702 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to prohibit rail carriers from charging challenged rates while a maximum reasonable rate case is pending. Rail customers can file a maximum reasonable rate case with the Board after 2 years before a common carrier shipment rate begins. The Board must use market-based revenue divisions methodology in stand-alone cost cases and cannot use cross-subsidy tests. In stand-alone cost cases, if the Board finds the rail carrier to be revenue adequate, the carrier must prove that it is charging a reasonable rate. Additionally, the Board cannot consider alternative transportation options when making determinations under this section. SEC. 5. REVENUE ADEQUACY. Amends Section 10704(a) of title 49, United States Code, by eliminating the Revenue Adequacy Test and introducing a new calculation method for a rail carrier's cost of capital. SEC. 6. SURFACE TRANSPORTATION BOARD STRUCTURAL CHANGES. Chapter 7 of title 49, United States Code is amended to increase the number of members on the board and specify backgrounds required for certain members.
