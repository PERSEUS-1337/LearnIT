    "content": "The Act titled \"Social Security Benefits Protection and Restoration Act of 1997\" aims to protect and restore social security benefits. The Congress finds that billions of dollars in social security taxes have not been credited to American workers' earnings records due to errors in matching policies and employer reports. Approximately 200 million individual earnings reports totaling $200 billion are in a suspense file. The Congress finds that uncredited earnings totaling approximately $200 billion have affected social security benefit payments, denying millions of Americans their entitled benefits. It is crucial for current and future retirees to receive their full benefits, and the impact of uncredited earnings on beneficiaries needs further evaluation. The Act aims to reconcile uncredited earnings affecting social security benefits by compensating beneficiaries appropriately and preventing future mismatches. SEC. 3. STUDY. The Commissioner of Social Security and the Secretary of the Treasury will conduct a study on the Social Security Administration's inability to provide full benefits to American workers due to insufficient information for identifying earnings accounts. The study will focus on the accuracy and maintenance of workers' earnings records for determining eligibility and benefit amounts. The study will focus on proposals to eliminate the backlog of uncredited earnings and resolve discrepancies for determining Social Security benefits. Additional resources may be needed for effective procedures. SEC. 4. REMEDIAL MEASURES. The Commissioner of Social Security and the Secretary of the Treasury will devise procedures to eliminate the backlog of uncredited earnings and prevent future discrepancies. The Commissioner of Social Security and the Secretary of the Treasury must submit a report to the relevant committees within 180 days, detailing the study findings and progress in meeting the requirements. Recommendations for further legislative action may also be included."
