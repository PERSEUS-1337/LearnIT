    "content": "Economists have differing opinions on various policy issues, but there is consensus on the importance of technological innovation for long-term economic growth and the role of government in developing new technologies. Innovation is seen as a key driver of income growth in the US and other developed countries, involving the acquisition and application of new scientific knowledge to create new goods and services. Technological innovation in market economies is driven by firms competing to introduce new products, improve production processes, and enhance management strategies. Despite the economic benefits, private R&D investment is often lower than warranted due to the inability to capture all returns. The returns from innovation may not be fully captured by firms due to factors like reverse engineering, migration of research scientists, and availability of goods at lower prices. Economists refer to this excess of total returns over private returns as spillover effects of R&D, with social returns exceeding private returns by a ratio of two to one on average. The excess of total returns over private returns from innovation, known as spillover effects of R&D, averages two to one. This signals a market failure in resource allocation towards discovery and commercialization of new technical knowledge. Economists recommend public policies to boost private investment in R&D, with the U.S. government supporting research through federal agencies and grants. The U.S. government supports research through federal agencies and grants, providing funding for basic and applied research to achieve specific policy goals like protecting the environment, advancing healthcare, and strengthening national defense. Indirect support includes federal funding for higher education in engineering and natural sciences, intellectual property rights protection, antitrust law allowances for joint research ventures, and tax incentives for business R&D investment. Federal tax law offers expensing allowances and non-refundable tax credits for qualified research expenditures. The expensing allowance and research tax credit are federal tax incentives to support business R&D investment. The expensing allowance simplifies tax accounting, reduces IRS challenges, and encourages R&D investment by taxing returns at a marginal effective rate of zero. The research tax credit, made permanent in 2015, lowers the after-tax cost of qualified research to stimulate more R&D investment. The research tax credit complicates tax compliance for firms investing in qualified R&D. In FY2016, the combined revenue cost of the expensing option and the credit could total an estimated $13.5 billion. The credit has four components: a regular research credit, an alternative simplified credit (ASC), a basic research credit, and a credit for energy research. Taxpayers may claim no more than the basic and energy research credits, plus either the regular credit or the ASC in any tax year. The research tax credit components were extended permanently in December 2015. Claims for the regular credit and ASC depend on qualified research expenditures (QREs) defined by specific criteria. Qualified research must be experimental, technological in nature, and seek to develop new products or processes. The research tax credit components were extended permanently in December 2015. Qualified research must be experimental and technological in nature, aiming to develop new products or processes. Businesses, courts, and the IRS have clashed over the interpretation of criteria for the credit, despite final regulations issued in 2003. Section 41(d)(4) specifies activities ineligible for the credit. The research tax credit does not apply to certain activities, such as research conducted after commercial production starts, adapting existing components to specific customer needs, modifying components for style or seasonal factors, duplicating existing components, data collection surveys, research outside the US, social sciences research, or research funded by another entity. The research tax credit applies to qualified research expenses related to in-house and contract research. For in-house research, the credit covers wages, salaries, materials, supplies, and leased computer time. For contract research, the credit applies to payments made to certain entities conducting qualified research, but not all expenses are covered. The research tax credit does not cover all expenses incurred in conducting qualified research, excluding outlays for depreciable assets, overhead expenses, and fringe benefits of research personnel. Excluded expenses account for a significant portion of business R&D spending. The regular research tax credit has been extended multiple times and modified by Congress. The credit equals 20% of a firm's QREs beyond a base amount, encouraging firms to spend more on R&D. The research tax credit serves a dual purpose by encouraging firms to spend more on R&D and minimizing the revenue cost of boosting R&D investment. The base amount for the regular credit approximates a firm's normal level of R&D investment and is calculated based on certain rules under IRC Section 41(c). The calculation of the base amount for the research tax credit varies for established firms and start-up firms. Established firms are those with gross receipts and QREs in at least three tax years from 1984 to 1988, while start-up firms had their first tax year with both after 1988 or had fewer than three tax years with both. The base amount is determined by a fixed-base percentage and average annual gross receipts in the previous four tax years. Established firms have a fixed-base percentage capped at 16%, while start-up firms start at 3% and gradually adjust based on experience. The regular credit calculation for firms is based on the fixed-base percentage, which determines the odds of claiming the credit. The firm's ratio of QREs to average annual gross receipts must exceed the fixed-base percentage to benefit from the credit. The fixed-base percentage is computed by summing qualified research expenses and gross receipts over specific tax years. The fixed-base percentage is calculated by summing qualified research expenses and gross receipts over specific tax years. For 2016, the base amount is determined by multiplying the average annual gross receipts by the fixed-base percentage. The regular R&E tax credit for 2016 is calculated by reducing qualified research expenses by the base amount or 50% of the expenses, whichever is greater, and then multiplying by 20%. The alternative simplified research credit for 2016 is $8.2 million. The fixed-base percentage for 2016 is 14.9%. The base amount for 2016 is $52 million. The regular R&E tax credit for 2016 is $10.5 million, calculated based on qualified research expenses. The alternative simplified research credit for 2016 is $9.0 million, determined by a different formula. The ASC was added to research tax credits by the Health Care and Tax Relief Act of 2006. The ASC was added to research tax credits by the Health Care and Tax Relief Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-432). A business taxpayer may claim the ASC in lieu of the regular credit, with the ASC equal to 14% of QREs in the current tax year above 50% of average QREs in the previous three years. If no QREs in those years, the credit is 6% of QREs in the current year. The decision to elect the ASC remains until IRS consent to switch to the regular credit. Differences in design mean a company is unlikely to benefit equally from both credits. The ASC was introduced in 2006 as an alternative to the regular research credit, offering benefits for companies with specific conditions like large base amounts, incomplete records, substantial growth, and history of mergers. The AIRC was an option for firms investing in research until 2008 when it was repealed, causing concerns about deterring firms from claiming it. The AIRC was an alternative to the regular research credit, with a different calculation method based on a firm's QREs compared to its average annual gross receipts. Firms were advised to claim the AIRC if their QREs exceeded 1% of their average annual gross receipts in the past four tax years. The AIRC was generally more beneficial than the regular credit for companies with high fixed-base percentages, declining research spending, or rapidly growing sales. Firms collaborating with nonprofit organizations for basic research can claim a separate incremental research credit under IRC Section 41(e). This credit encourages collaborative research with U.S. firms, colleges, and universities by providing 20% of total payments for qualified basic research above a base amount. The Section 41(e) credit provides 20% of total payments for qualified basic research above a base amount. Basic research is defined as an original investigation for scientific advancement without a specific commercial objective, and the credit applies to research done under written contracts by educational institutions and nonprofit scientific research organizations. The Section 41(e) credit provides a tax credit equal to 20% of payments for qualified basic research above a base amount. Payments must go to nonprofit organizations conducting energy research to qualify for the credit. The Section 41(e) credit provides a tax credit equal to 20% of payments for qualified basic research to nonprofit organizations conducting energy research. The credit applies to payments to colleges, universities, federal laboratories, and certain small firms for contract energy research. Eligible small firms must have fewer than 500 employees and the taxpayer cannot own more than 50% of the stock or capital and profits of the firm. The credit is flat and more generous than incremental credits. The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 allowed firms to claim a 50% bonus depreciation allowance for qualified property placed in service between March 31, 2008, and December 31, 2008. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 gave corporations the option to claim a limited refundable tax credit for unused research and alternative minimum tax credits. The credit was capped at $30 million for a single corporation and was set to expire at the end of 2008. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended the first-year 50% bonus depreciation allowance and the option to claim a refundable research and AMT credit through 2009. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Compensation Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended the option to monetize unused AMT credits for qualified property acquired after March 31, 2008. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 extended the option through 2013 for qualified property acquired and placed in service that year. Beginning in 2016, eligible small companies may apply research tax credits against any taxes. Beginning in 2016, eligible small companies with average annual gross receipts less than $50 million can apply research tax credits against alternative minimum tax (AMT) and offset a limited amount of the employer share of the Social Security trust fund tax. The payroll tax credit is limited to $250,000 or the research credit amount. The tax year limit for research credits is $250,000, the current year's research credit, or the Section 38 general business tax credit for eligible C corporations. The payroll tax credit cannot exceed a company's Social Security tax liability in a quarter. The research tax credit cannot be applied against payroll tax liability for more than five tax years. IRS may need to clarify the definition of gross receipts for these limitations. The research tax credit has a size limitation for start-up companies eligible to use it against a portion of their employment tax liability. The credit was introduced in 1981 to boost business R&D spending. In the 1970s, some analysts believed the decline in U.S. productivity growth and competitiveness was due to a lack of research and experimental expenditures. Congress introduced a tax credit for research expenses, initially set at 25% of a company's qualified research expenses (QREs) above a base amount. The reason for choosing this rate is unclear, as there is no evidence of a thorough assessment of the returns on R&D investment. The research tax credit was introduced to bridge the gap between private and social returns on R&D investment. It allowed taxpayers to carry unused credits back three years or forward 15 years. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 extended the credit to 1988, capped it annually, and reduced the rate to 20%. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced the research tax credit rate to 20% and modified the definition of Qualified Research Expenses (QREs). It also created a separate 20% incremental tax credit for payments to universities and certain nonprofit organizations for basic research. The reduction in the credit's rate was not based on its effectiveness but on the goals of TRA86 to lower income tax rates, broaden the tax base, and reduce differences in tax burdens on investments. The regular and university basic research credits were extended through 1989 by the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced the research tax credit rate to 20% and modified the definition of Qualified Research Expenses (QREs). The regular and university basic research credits were extended through 1989 by the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-647). The act also curtailed the overall tax preference for business R&D investment by requiring companies to reduce any deduction claimed for QREs under IRC Section 174 by half of the sum of any regular and basic research credits claimed. This new rule decreased the maximum effective rate of the regular research tax credit by 0.5 times a taxpayer's marginal income tax rate. Growing dissatisfaction with the original credit design led to additional changes in the regular credit under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (OBRA89, P.L. 101-239). Critics were concerned about the formula for determining the base amount of the credit, which was based on a three-year moving average of a firm's QREs. OBRA89 changed the formula for the base amount of the research tax credit to be either 50% of a firm's current-year QREs or the product of the firm's average annual gross receipts in the previous four tax years and a \"fixed-base percentage.\" The fixed-base percentage was set based on a firm's total QREs to total gross receipts ratio from 1984 to 1988, capped at 16%. Additionally, the act made the credit more favorable for start-up firms. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 extended research tax credits through December 31, 1991 and removed the requirement to prorate QREs incurred before January 1, 1991. It also allowed firms to apply the regular credit to current and future lines of business, and required firms to reduce deductions claimed under IRC Section 174 by the amount of the credits. The Tax Extension Act of 1991 (P.L. 102-227) extended research tax credits to June 30, 1992. Despite attempts to further extend the credits in 1992, they expired on July 1, 1992. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA93, P.L. 103-66) retroactively extended the credits from July 1, 1992 through June 30, 1995. The Tax Extension Act of 1991 extended research tax credits to June 30, 1992. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 further extended the credits through June 30, 1995, with modifications for start-up firms. The credits expired again on June 30, 1995, but were reinstated by the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 from July 1, 1996 to May 31, 1997. The research tax credits were extended multiple times, with different rates and provisions for start-up firms, expiring in 1997 but retroactively extended to 1998 and further to 1999. The research tax credit was extended multiple times with increased rates and expanded definitions, including provisions for energy research and retroactive extensions through 2007. The research tax credit was extended through 2009 with increased rates and the establishment of the alternative simplified credit. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 raised the ASIC rate and repealed the AIRC. Additionally, corporations had the option in 2008 to claim a limited, accelerated, refundable credit for unused research and AMT credits. The research tax credit was extended through 2014, with various changes and extensions made by different acts such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the Tax Relief, Unemployment Compensation Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, and the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014. The research tax credit was extended permanently starting in 2015 through the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015. This act also addressed concerns by allowing qualified small businesses to apply the credit against alternative minimum tax and employer Social Security tax. The effectiveness of the credit in encouraging businesses to invest more in R&D is a key question among economists. The research tax credit was extended permanently in 2015 through the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act. The effectiveness of the credit in encouraging businesses to invest more in R&D is a key question among economists. The social benefit of added R&D spending includes profits from new technologies, while the social cost involves loss of tax revenue and administrative costs. Challenges in measuring social returns to R&D investments have led analysts to rely on alternative measures of effectiveness. Analysts have used two measures to assess the effectiveness of the research tax credit: the amount of business R&D investment attributed to the credit and the added R&D induced by one dollar of the credit. These measures focus on direct benefits and costs of the credit, without considering secondary effects. Studies have been conducted to determine the additional qualified research induced by one dollar of the credit, measuring the credit's cost-effectiveness. The effectiveness of the research tax credit is assessed by predicting R&D investment based on past spending, output, demand, and other variables. A dummy variable indicates the impact of the credit on R&D spending. Studies estimate the increase in research expenditures from one dollar of the credit. Hall and van Reenen's 1999 review found that studies from 1981-1983 showed lower estimates of added research from the credit. In 1983, studies showed lower estimates of added research from the research tax credit compared to studies from 1984 onwards. Hall and van Reenen found that one dollar of the credit roughly increased reported R&D spending by one dollar, but they doubted the accuracy of this estimate. They highlighted that companies could inflate estimates by re-classifying non-research expenditures to qualify for the credit. The research tax credit's effectiveness was analyzed in various studies using different methods, time periods, and data sets. The benefit-to-cost ratio varied across studies, with estimates below 1.0 for the period from 1981 to 1985, and higher ratios from 1985 to 1997. Despite differences in study parameters, researchers concluded that the credit incentivized businesses to invest in R&D. The Congressional Budget Office also supported this finding in a 2007 report on federal R&D support. The 2007 report on federal support for R&D concluded that the research tax credit incentivizes firms to increase R&D spending. Studies show that a dollar claimed under the credit leads to an additional dollar spent on R&D, with the credit's effectiveness measured by the tax price elasticity of demand for R&D and the average effective rate of the credit across industries. The research tax credit incentivizes firms to increase R&D spending by reducing the after-tax cost of qualified investments. The average tax price elasticity of demand for all industries and the credit's average effective rate are used to assess its impact on aggregate business R&D investment. The price variable in the equation represents the marginal cost of R&D projects and is used to measure the sensitivity of R&D spending to changes in project prices. Academic studies have estimated the tax price elasticity of demand for R&D in the short or long run, with mixed results. The tax price elasticity of demand for R&D has been estimated to be around 1.0, with studies showing a range of 0.75 to 2.0 in the long run. The average effective rate of the research credit is calculated using claims for the credit, as the IRS does not disclose the total amount awarded. The research tax credit's average effective rate (AER) can be computed using QREs and business investment in domestic R&D. From 2007 to 2012, the AER was 3.6% for business investment in domestic R&D and 5.4% for QREs. The statutory rate for the regular credit was 20% and 14% for the ASC during that period. In 2012, 72% of total QREs were associated with claims for the ASC. The gap between AERs for QREs and business investment in domestic R&D reflects differences in scope. QREs amount to 67% of domestic business R&D spending from 2007 to 2012. The NSF estimate covers domestic R&D funded by firms, based on surveys of business R&D. It includes wages, salaries, materials, supplies, overhead expenses, and depreciation for research activities. QREs represent eligible spending on qualified research, including wages, salaries, materials, supplies, and leased computer time used in qualified research. Excluded are expenditures on buildings and equipment used in research, quality control, routine product testing, and prototype production. The research and development tax credit covers a significant portion of business R&D investment costs, stimulating domestic R&D spending from 2007 to 2012. The credit incentivized companies to increase their spending on domestic R&D, although the extent of this stimulus remains uncertain. The research tax credit incentivizes domestic business R&D investment, but its effectiveness is uncertain due to varying study results and criticisms about its design. Economists and lawmakers generally support tax incentives for R&D, but critics argue that the credit could be more effective. Critics argue that the research tax credit's design needs improvement to generate intended benefits. Key issues include weak incentive effects, disputes over qualified research definition, lack of targeting high economic benefit investments, and non-refundable credits. Solutions are discussed to address these problems. Some critics argue that the research tax credit's incentive effect varies among firms conducting qualified research, potentially defeating the credit's purpose. Evidence suggests that the regular credit's impact differs widely among firms, even those gradually increasing their research investment over time. In 1994, a study analyzed a group of domestic corporations with significant research budgets to determine their eligibility for claiming the research tax credit. Based on a sample of 900 publicly traded U.S.-based companies with large R&D budgets, it was found that 78% of the firms could have claimed the credit, with 44.4% being established firms and 33.5% start-up firms. 22% of the firms could not claim the credit, with 18% of established firms and 4% of start-up firms falling into this category. In a study analyzing domestic corporations with significant research budgets, it was found that 34% of all firms had qualified research expenses (QREs) greater than their base amounts but less than twice those amounts, allowing them to claim credits with a marginal effective rate of 13%. Additionally, 43.8% of all firms had QREs greater than double their base amounts, allowing them to claim credits with a marginal effective rate of 6.5%. Some research-intensive firms could claim no credit or credits with a marginal effective rate half as large as firms with lower propensities to invest in R&D. The regular credit was found to be most beneficial to firms with increased research intensities since their base periods, while least beneficial to those with stagnant or decreased research intensities. Critics argue that the design of the credit is unfair and arbitrary, undermining its purpose of encouraging research-intensive firms to invest more in R&D. Cox's analysis showed a wide variation in the credit's effectiveness among different firms. The regular credit's effectiveness varies among firms based on their research intensities, with some benefiting more than others. Critics argue that the credit's design is unfair and arbitrary, potentially discouraging research-intensive firms from investing in R&D. Cox's analysis highlighted significant disparities in the credit's impact on different companies. The U.S. economy changes significantly over 20 years, leading to different conditions for research-intensive industries today compared to the 1980s or 1990s. Established firms may invest less in R&D due to changing circumstances, impacting their ability to claim the regular credit. Critics argue that the credit's incentive effect is inadequate, focusing on the credit rate needed to increase R&D investments and differences between firms. Critics argue that the average effective rate of the regular credit is too low to support optimal levels of business investment in research. They point to a study by Cox, which focused on the efficacy of the research tax credit in incentivizing firms to invest more in R&D. Cox's analysis suggests that tax incentives must be designed to subsidize R&D spending beyond what firms would do on their own and be large enough to increase after-tax returns on R&D investments. The optimal R&D tax subsidy should double the private after-tax returns on R&D investments by increasing them to 130% of pre-tax returns. This would help incentivize firms to invest more in research and development. The optimal R&D tax subsidy should double private after-tax returns on R&D investments to 130% of pre-tax returns. However, a 30% average effective rate may provide excessive subsidies for projects with below-average spillover benefits and insufficient subsidies for projects with above-average spillover benefits. Lawmakers should be aware of this imprecision in tax incentives for R&D investments. Cox conducted an assessment of the optimal R&D tax subsidy by estimating pre-tax and after-tax rates of return for various hypothetical R&D projects under 1995 federal tax law. He compared the effect of expensing and the credit on after-tax returns for different types of R&D projects with varying economic lives of intangible assets. Expensing equalizes pre-tax and after-tax rates of return by taxing affected assets at a marginal effective rate of zero. Expensing and the regular research credit impact the after-tax rate of return for R&D investments by considering the percentage of total cost that can be expensed and the effective tax rate on income earned by eligible assets. Cox estimated that these limitations result in a marginal effective tax rate of zero for expensing. Cox estimated that expensing and the regular credit together produced median after-tax rates of return ranging from 101.0% to 124.7% for different types of projects. He concluded that existing research tax subsidies did not increase private after-tax returns to R&D investments as expected. Critics assess the incentive effects of the regular credit and ASC using a different measure, focusing on discrepancies between the credits' potential to boost business investment in research to socially optimal levels. The discrepancies between the regular credit and ASC's average effective rates and their statutory rates are largely due to rules governing the use of the credit, such as the basis adjustment under IRC Section 280C(c)(1). This adjustment decreases the marginal effective rate for the regular credit from 20% to 13% and for the ASC from 14% to 9.1%. This impacts business taxpayers subject to the maximum corporate tax rate of 35%. The regular research credit and ASC's average effective rates are affected by rules like the basis adjustment under IRC Section 280C(c)(1), reducing the rates from 20% to 13% and from 14% to 9.1%. The base amount for the regular credit must be at least 50% of a firm's current-year QREs, limiting the credit's benefit for established firms with high QREs to gross income ratios. Start-up firms are also impacted if their QREs to gross income ratio exceeds 6% in their first five tax years or doubles their fixed-base percentages in the following six tax years. The rule affects the regular research credit and ASC's average effective rates, reducing them. It further reduces the marginal effective rate of the regular credit to 6.5%. The exclusion of expenditures for equipment, structures, and overhead costs from the expenses eligible for the two credits impacts the marginal effective rate. The credit's marginal effective rate declines as the share of an R&D investment's cost that is ineligible for the credit increases. For example, if physical capital accounts for half of the cost of an R&D investment, the marginal effective rate of either credit for the entire investment would be half. The marginal effective rate for the regular credit falls to 3.25% for firms subject to the 50% rule investing in research projects with physical capital representing 50% of the total cost. Delays in using the credit lower the present value and decrease the rate, with larger delays and discount rates leading to a bigger decline in the rate. The GAO estimated the weighted average rate for corporations claiming the credit from 2003 to 2005. The database analyzed the weighted average rate of the research tax credit from 2003 to 2005, ranging from 6.4% to 7.3%. To enhance the incentive effect, options include adjusting the statutory rate, relaxing rules, or a combination of both. Cox examined the impact on after-tax rates of return for R&D investments, showing a median after-tax return of 124.7% for labor-intensive projects under the 1995 research tax preferences. Increasing the statutory rate of the research tax credit to 25% and removing the basis adjustment resulted in a significant boost in the after-tax return. The median after-tax return for projects with a three-year economic life increased to 165.8% of the pre-tax return, while for projects with a 20-year economic life, it increased to 130.1%. The research tax credit is non-refundable and subject to limitations under IRC Section 38. Firms with sufficient income tax liabilities can benefit from the credit, but it cannot exceed a taxpayer's net income tax liability. Keeping the regular credit's statutory rate at 20% and eliminating the basis adjustment is suggested for efficiency in boosting the credit's incentive effect. The General Business Credit (GBC) is subject to limitations and cannot exceed a taxpayer's net income tax liability. Unused GBCs can be carried forward 20 years or back one year. Critics argue that the lack of refundability poses challenges for small firms investing heavily in R&D. Some firms invest heavily in R&D during their early years, often losing money. Critics argue that non-refundable research credits may not benefit small start-ups. Suggestions include making the credit refundable for certain criteria or allowing firms to sell unused credits. Eligible companies under five years old with less than $5 million in gross receipts can apply research tax credits against Social Security tax. Eligible companies under five years old with less than $5 million in gross receipts can apply research tax credits against Social Security tax, potentially freeing up $250,000 for R&D. However, disputes over qualified research definitions and expenditures can delay credit utilization for large corporations. The research tax credit is now permanent, removing uncertainty from July 1981 to December 2015. However, there is still doubt over qualifying expenditures, leading to weaker incentive effects for long-term R&D projects. IRS audits may result in smaller credits than claimed, deterring firms from claiming the credit. The original credit from 1981 to 1985 allowed research expenditures eligible for expensing under IRC Section 174 to qualify. The research tax credit is now permanent, removing uncertainty from July 1981 to December 2015. Qualifying expenditures are still in doubt, affecting long-term R&D projects. IRS audits may lead to smaller credits claimed by firms. The original credit from 1981 to 1985 allowed research expenditures eligible for expensing under IRC Section 174 to qualify. In R&D, uncertainty exists when information doesn't clearly guide product development or improvement. The standard for expensing research expenditures under Section 174 is based on the nature of the activity, not the product being developed. Qualifying expenses include direct and indirect costs for developing or improving a product, but not costs for acquiring land or certain other expenses. Congress tightened the definition of qualified research in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 by adding three tests to ensure activities were technological in nature, part of an experimentation process, and aimed at improving business components. The act defined a business component as a product, process, software, technique, formula, or invention used in trade or business. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 added three tests to the definition of qualified research to ensure activities were technological in nature, part of an experimentation process, and aimed at improving business components. The IRS issued final regulations in December 1998 to clarify the meaning and limits of these tests. The IRS proposed that research projects must aim to obtain knowledge that exceeds common knowledge in the field of technology or science, and that the research must rely on principles of physical or biological sciences, engineering, or computer science to evaluate multiple alternatives. The proposed regulations also stated that the research credit would not be denied to companies that made technological advances in an evolutionary manner, failed to achieve the desired result, or were not the first to achieve a particular technological advance. The IRS proposed regulations for research projects in sciences, engineering, or computer science to evaluate multiple alternatives. Criticism arose, especially regarding the \"common knowledge\" test, deemed burdensome and subjective. Tax practitioners and businesses urged the IRS to scrap the test. After reviewing comments and case law, the IRS issued revised regulations. The IRS issued final regulations on the definition of qualified research in December 2000, which differed significantly from the proposed regulations. The final regulations clarified the common knowledge test for determining technological and useful information in research, specifying that it refers to information known by skilled professionals in a field before undertaking a project. The final regulations on qualified research stipulated that a taxpayer could pass the common knowledge test by proving they had a patent for a new business component. New standards were set for determining eligibility of computer software development for the credit, requiring significant economic risk and innovative software development. Despite changes, the regulations faced opposition for retaining the discovery test and including provisions not in the proposed regulations. The IRS retracted the proposed regulations due to criticisms and requested further comments. In December 2001, new proposed regulations were issued, departing from previous guidance by removing the requirement for qualified research to exceed common knowledge in a particular field. The IRS issued proposed regulations in December 2001, changing the definition of the experimentation test and clarifying eligibility for the research credit. Tax practitioners and businesses supported the changes. The IRS published final regulations (T.D. 9104) to clarify the definition of qualified research and the use of the research credit. The regulations state that information is technological if the experimentation process relies on physical or biological sciences, engineering, or computer science principles. The discovery test was removed, and taxpayers are considered to have discovered technological information by applying existing technologies and principles. Having a patent for a business component is seen as conclusive evidence of discovery. The regulations clarified that a process of experimentation must have uncertain outcomes, multiple approaches, and use scientific methods to evaluate efficacy. It often involves refining a taxpayer's understanding of the uncertainty being addressed. The interpretation and application of key tests for determining qualified research activities have long been contentious between companies investing in R&D and the IRS. Issues include defining qualified research, uncertainty over criteria for software development expenses, and determining wages paid to employees. The criteria for determining wages paid to employees involved in qualified research activities eligible for the credit, activities deemed ineligible for the credit if commenced after commercial production, and the need for supportive evidence for claims. Critics suggest replacing the current definition of qualified research with a broader definition of research expenses. Some critics argue for a broader definition of research expenses eligible for the Section 174 expensing option to reduce disputes. They recommend clarifying conditions for internal-use software expenses, activities supporting qualified research, and the start of commercial production. Critics also suggest forming working groups with businesses to develop standards for substantiating claims for the credit. Additionally, they believe the current research credit fails to target projects with significant economic potential. The design of the research credit may result in lower long-term benefits compared to federal research grants. Businesses prioritize short-term profits over expanding scientific knowledge, leading to underinvestment in R&D with high social returns. Federal funding has historically supported basic research in the U.S. The federal government has historically been the main source of funding for basic research in the United States, with a share three times greater than businesses from 1955 to 2008. However, businesses have increased their funding for applied research and development, surpassing the federal share by 88% for applied research and over five times for development by 2008. This shift indicates that companies are more inclined to invest in applied research and development, which offer more certain returns compared to basic research. The text suggests modifying the research credit to target investment in breakthrough products or innovative enhancements. Options include creating a larger credit for basic research, establishing a flat credit, and having the NSF administer the credit for evaluating social returns. This could increase spillover benefits from the credit."
