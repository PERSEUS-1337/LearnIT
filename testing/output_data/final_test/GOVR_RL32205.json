    "content": "Demand for LNG imports in the U.S. has increased due to rising natural gas prices and concerns about domestic shortages. New LNG import terminals have been constructed to meet this demand, with more proposed. Safety concerns exist regarding the federal government's role in addressing LNG safety at these terminals. Various energy policy proposals could impact the need for new LNG terminals by promoting alternative energy sources and conservation. This report provides an overview of recent industry developments in new LNG import terminals. The report provides an overview of recent industry developments in new LNG import terminals, focusing on safety issues, federal regulations, and policy considerations. It discusses controversial safety issues in LNG siting proceedings, including safety zones, marine hazards, and terrorism concerns. The report highlights the impact of LNG terminals on community safety and energy costs nationwide. Some in Congress have proposed changes to safety provisions in federal LNG siting regulation due to concerns about LNG hazards. Legislation in the 110th Congress addressed Coast Guard LNG resources, FERC's siting authority, state concurrence of federal LNG siting decisions, and agency coordination under the Coastal Zone Management Act. Congress may consider additional LNG safety-related legislation or changes in U.S. energy policy to reduce the nation's demand for natural gas or increase supplies of North American natural gas. This report focuses on industry and federal activities related to safety in LNG import terminal siting, primarily on onshore facilities and near-shore shipping. It discusses parts of LNG terminals that transfer, store, and process LNG before injection into natural gas pipelines. Offshore LNG terminal siting regulations are summarized in the Appendix. LNG, or liquefied natural gas, is formed when natural gas is cooled to temperatures below minus 260\u00b0 F. It occupies 1/600th the volume of its gaseous state, making it easier to store and transport. LNG can be regasified for use in heating, cooking, and power generation. In 2009, the US imported LNG mainly from Trinidad, Egypt, Norway, and Nigeria, with additional sources including Algeria, Qatar, and Australia. Future suppliers may include Brunei, Indonesia, Libya, and the United Arab Emirates. The United States has been using LNG commercially since the 1940s, initially storing domestically produced natural gas for high demand periods. By the 1970s, LNG imports began to supplement domestic production. While LNG imports in the US remained small due to low domestic gas prices, countries like Japan heavily relied on LNG imports, with Japan importing 97% of its natural gas supply as LNG in 2002. Other countries such as South Korea, France, Spain, and Taiwan also became significant LNG importers. The United States saw an increase in LNG imports from the mid-1980s through 2000 due to environmental concerns, natural gas-fired electricity generation, and low prices. Domestic gas supplies struggled to meet demand, leading to price volatility. International LNG costs have decreased since the 1970s, making it more competitive. In 2003, the Federal Reserve Chairman urged increased LNG imports to support economic growth. The United States has seen a rise in LNG imports due to environmental concerns, natural gas-fired electricity generation, and low prices. FERC Commissioner Suedeen Kelly anticipates LNG to make a major contribution in the future. Natural gas demand is expected to grow as a preferred fuel for power plants and vehicles under a national carbon control policy. Despite complications from increased domestic shale gas production, analysts project continued growth in U.S. LNG imports. LNG tankers unload at marine terminals for distribution to domestic markets. The United States has seen a rise in LNG imports due to environmental concerns, natural gas-fired electricity generation, and low prices. FERC Commissioner Suedeen Kelly anticipates LNG to make a major contribution in the future. Natural gas demand is expected to grow as a preferred fuel for power plants and vehicles under a national carbon control policy. Despite complications from increased domestic shale gas production, analysts project continued growth in U.S. LNG imports. Onshore terminals consist of docks, LNG handling equipment, storage tanks, and interconnections to regional gas transmission pipelines and electric power plants. Offshore terminals regasify and pump the LNG directly into offshore natural gas pipelines or may store LNG for later injection into offshore pipelines. There are seven active onshore LNG import terminals in the United States: Everett, Massachusetts; Lake Charles, Louisiana; Cove Point, Maryland; Elba Island, Georgia; Pe\u00f1uelas, Puerto Rico; Freeport, Texas; and Sabine Pass, Louisiana. There are two active offshore import terminals, one located in the Gulf of Mexico and a second near Boston, Massachusetts. In addition to these active terminals, some 25 LNG terminal proposals have been approved by regulators across North America to serve the U.S. market. The safety hazards associated with LNG terminals have been debated for decades, with past accidents and ongoing controversies. Despite improvements in technology and standards, serious hazards remain due to the volatile nature of LNG. An uncontrolled release of LNG can lead to fire or explosion, and its extreme cold temperature also poses risks. The hazards of LNG include fire and explosion, as well as extreme cold temperatures. Controversy surrounds the likelihood and severity of catastrophic events. A pool fire from LNG can spread rapidly and intensely, causing thermal radiation that can harm people and property. Experts agree that a large pool fire, especially on water, is the most serious LNG hazard. An LNG vapor cloud fire is a serious hazard that can result from a spill. The cloud may drift and ignite if it encounters a spark, causing a fire that can gradually burn back to the spill site. While LNG vapor clouds are not toxic, they can displace breathable air and cause asphyxiation. LNG vapor clouds are not toxic but can cause asphyxiation by displacing breathable air. They may rise in air as they warm, diminishing the threat to people. LNG could injure people or damage equipment through direct contact due to its extremely low temperature. Environmental damage from an LNG spill would be confined to fire and freezing impacts near the spill as LNG dissipates completely. LNG tankers and facilities could be vulnerable to physical or cyber-attacks. The LNG tanker industry has a record of safety over the last 50 years, with no serious accidents at sea or in port. The double-hulled design of LNG tankers has contributed to this safety record. LNG facilities could be vulnerable to cyber-attacks or attacks on regional infrastructure, which could impact control and safety systems. LNG tankers and facilities have a strong safety record, with no serious accidents at sea or in port over the last 50 years. However, there have been approximately 13 serious accidents at LNG terminals since 1944, with two incidents causing single fatalities. Onshore LNG terminals have a more mixed safety record compared to LNG tankers. The worst petrochemical plant fire in Algeria in over 40 years destroyed a processing plant and damaged a marine berth. The accident was attributed to poor maintenance rather than a facility design flaw. Several technical studies have been commissioned to reevaluate the safety hazards of LNG terminals and associated shipping since the terror attacks of September 11, 2001. Some fear that LNG hazards may be misrepresented by government agencies due to differing conclusions on potential public hazards of accidents or terror attacks. Hazard analyses for LNG terminals rely heavily on computer models to approximate effects of accidents, as historical incidents are limited in scale. LNG hazards models are uncertain, based on calculations and assumptions, required for siting approval. LNG hazard studies rely on calculations and input assumptions, leading to varying conclusions. Different LNG hazard models have resulted in significant differences in safety zone distances. Various stakeholders have sponsored these studies, each with limitations and criticisms. ABSG Consulting study found no release models available for accurate hazard assessment. The existing LNG hazard models lack accurate representation of LNG carriers and pool spread, with limited experimental data for validation. Despite uncertainties, analytic tools can help identify and mitigate hazards. Studies highlight limitations in data and modeling capabilities for analyzing LNG spills over water. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) report highlighted conflicting assessments of LNG spill consequences due to lack of large-scale spill data, creating uncertainty for regulators and the public. Members of Congress expressed renewed concern about LNG hazard analysis. In LNG hazard analysis, distinguishing between hazards and risks is crucial. While worst-case hazard studies attempt to quantify potential effects, assessing risks requires estimating the probability of their occurrence. Some argue that unlikely but significant hazards may not pose unacceptable risks. However, few LNG safety studies adequately address the probability of catastrophic accidents or attacks, due to a lack of historical incidents and detailed terrorist threat information. Decision makers must rely on the best available information in the face of this uncertainty. LNG terminals and tankers receive extensive media coverage despite being few in number compared to other hazardous chemical plants and ships near U.S. cities. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency notes over 500 toxic chemical facilities in urban areas with potential to affect 100,000+ people in worst-case accidents. Other hazardous facilities like oil refineries and liquefied petroleum gas terminals also pose similar safety risks. The U.S. Office of Hazardous Materials Safety reports over 100,000 annual U.S. shipments of hazardous materials. The U.S. Office of Hazardous Materials Safety reports over 100,000 annual U.S. shipments of hazardous marine cargo, including ammonia, crude oil, and volatile chemicals. LNG tanker and terminal operators aim to ensure public safety to avoid civil and criminal liability. Recent examples include Exxon Valdez oil spill settlements and penalties against Olympic Pipeline and Shell Pipeline for a fatal pipeline fire in Bellingham, Washington. In 2003, the U.S. Attorney General announced a crackdown on companies for failing to protect against terrorist attacks on storage tanks and transportation networks. Despite government scrutiny, some doubt LNG infrastructure safety. Companies could still face civil liability for accidents, as seen in the Bellingham case where a $75 million settlement was paid to the families of two children killed in a fire. In 2002, El Paso Corporation settled wrongful death and personal injury lawsuits related to a natural gas pipeline explosion near Carlsbad, New Mexico, which killed 12 campers. Two additional lawsuits sought $171 million in damages. The impact on the company's business is uncertain, as their costs and legal exposure are covered by insurance. The Department of Transportation (DOT) and FERC regulate onshore LNG facilities, with clarified roles through an interagency agreement. The DOT sets safety standards for onshore LNG. The DOT sets safety standards for onshore LNG facilities, with authority stemming from various acts and amendments. DOT issues minimum safety standards for LNG facility siting, but approval authority lies with FERC. The Secretary of Transportation sets safety standards for LNG facility siting, considering factors like facility type, population demographics, land use, physical aspects, and emergency response capabilities. Regulations may impact siting decisions and corrective action can be ordered if a facility poses hazards. The Department of Transportation (DOT) sets safety standards for LNG facilities under the Pipeline Safety Act, with regulations in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 190-199 and 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 193 overseen by the Office of Pipeline Safety. These regulations incorporate NFPA standards for thermal exclusion zones and design guidelines for LNG facilities to withstand various forces and hazards. Operations, maintenance, and employee qualification are also addressed in the regulations. Under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, FERC grants federal approval for the siting of new onshore LNG facilities. FERC exercises LNG siting regulation under its Section 3 authority, approving the import and export of natural gas. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 amends Section 3 to give FERC approval authority over the place of entry and exit, siting, construction, and operation of new LNG terminals. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 amends the Natural Gas Act to give FERC exclusive authority to approve onshore LNG terminal siting applications. It requires FERC to consult with state agencies on safety, permits states to conduct safety inspections, and mandates LNG terminal operators to develop emergency response plans. FERC is designated as the lead agency for coordinating federal authorizations and complying with environmental requirements. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 grants FERC exclusive authority to approve onshore LNG terminal siting applications. FERC sets schedules for federal authorizations and provisions for judicial review. FERC's regulations detail the application process under Section 3 of the NGA, starting with a pre-filing stage followed by a formal application with detailed engineering and safety information. The regulations for LNG facility siting applications require engineering and design information, evidence of safety, and location details. Additional data is needed for facilities in geologically risky areas. Landowners affected by proposed facilities must be notified. Facilities at borders for gas import/export need a Presidential Permit. FERC must prepare an environmental impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act during its review. Applicants must provide environmental reports to aid FERC. Applicants must prepare environmental reports for FERC, analyzing socioeconomic impacts, geophysical characteristics, seismic risk safeguards, air and noise quality effects, public safety issues, and compliance with standards. EPA may assist in the review process, and FERC has approved rules for \"blanket certificates\" to expedite natural gas infrastructure project reviews. FERC has expanded eligibility for \"blanket certificates,\" allowing companies with existing certificates to upgrade facilities without further authorization. Regulations for actions under blanket certificates can be found at 18 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 157.201-157.218. FERC has also established a Liquefied Natural Gas Compliance Branch to oversee safety at LNG facilities, with a team of engineers and experts conducting safety inspections and reviewing facility designs for compliance with FERC orders. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has established a Liquefied Natural Gas Compliance Branch to oversee safety at LNG facilities, working with civil and mechanical engineers, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Department of Transportation (DOT). Jurisdictional issues between federal agencies with LNG oversight responsibilities have historically been contentious, with FERC requiring compliance with DOT's regulations as a starting point but having the authority to regulate more strictly if needed. The roles of the agencies are not clearly defined in relevant federal law. The Pipeline Safety Act does not remove FERC's jurisdiction over LNG safety, despite DOT's authority to set federal safety standards for LNG facilities. FERC and DOT resolved jurisdictional conflicts in 1985 with an agreement allowing FERC to impose stricter safety requirements when necessary. In 2004, FERC streamlined the LNG siting approval process by coordinating with USCG and DOT. USCG reviews marine traffic plans for LNG terminals and issues a Letter of Recommendation for waterway suitability. They ensure safety and security considerations are included in siting reviews and provide guidance to applicants. The Coast Guard provides guidance for LNG terminal siting applications, including additional waterway suitability requirements in reviews by FERC. LNG terminal safety regulations incorporate NFPA standards, which influence safety practices in the United States. The NFPA LNG Standards Committee includes experts from industry and government, such as FERC, DOT, and USCG. The NFPA standards for LNG safety, adopted in 1967 with multiple revisions, are widely recognized internationally. While federal government oversees LNG terminal safety, state and local laws can also impact facilities. States can enforce additional safety standards for LNG facilities under certain provisions of the Pipeline Safety Act. States can enforce additional safety standards for LNG facilities under certain provisions of the Pipeline Safety Act, allowing them to adopt more stringent regulations compatible with DOT standards. Federal agencies retain primary responsibility for regulating interstate facilities, but may delegate authority to state offices for administering safety programs within their boundaries. State regulation of LNG facility safety and siting varies from piecemeal to comprehensive, with all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico participating in the natural gas pipeline safety program. State regulation of LNG facility safety and siting ranges from piecemeal to comprehensive. Arizona, Colorado, and Georgia have specific requirements and administrative systems in place, while generally applicable state and local laws also impact LNG facility planning and development. Federal and state agencies have had jurisdictional disagreements regarding the siting of new LNG terminals. In February 2004, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) disputed FERC's jurisdiction over the siting of a proposed LNG terminal at Long Beach. FERC rejected CPUC's arguments and asserted exclusive regulatory authority for all LNG import terminal siting and construction. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 codified FERC's jurisdictional rulings, leading CPUC to drop its lawsuit challenging FERC's LNG siting authority in September 2005. Proposals for new LNG terminal facilities have raised public concern in many communities due to potential hazards. Some fear that FERC's approval process does not adequately consider safety risks. Congressional attention has been drawn to FERC's exclusive LNG siting authority, regional siting processes, security resources, and terrorism risks. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 gives FERC exclusive authority to approve onshore LNG terminal siting applications to prevent jurisdictional disputes and delays in infrastructure development. States still have influence through federally delegated permitting authorities under various acts. Critics argue that FERC's exclusive authority under P.L. 109-58 gives too much power to the federal government, neglecting state input and concerns in LNG terminal siting decisions. Some lawmakers suggest amending or repealing this authority to allow governors to veto onshore LNG terminal proposals, similar to offshore terminal proposals under the Deepwater Port Act. Some in Congress propose granting governors veto authority over onshore LNG terminal proposals to increase state involvement in siting reviews. Legislative proposals in the 110th Congress aimed to require state concurrence for federal siting approval decisions or repeal FERC's exclusive authority granted in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. In regions like the Northeast with controversial onshore LNG terminal proposals, policymakers advocate for a regional approach to identify suitable sites, citing concerns about public safety and environmental impacts. Some argue for a regional LNG siting process to address public safety and environmental concerns more efficiently than FERC's current proposal-by-proposal approach. A legislative proposal in the 110th Congress suggested establishing a national commission for natural gas infrastructure placement, considering regional energy and environmental factors. FERC officials have expressed openness to regional siting but cite limitations in adopting such a process. While some argue for a regional LNG siting process to address safety and environmental concerns more efficiently, FERC cannot adopt a regional approach due to its lack of land-use authority. FERC officials have expressed skepticism about regional siting processes but have called for more assessment of alternatives in LNG siting decisions. The future shift in FERC's approach towards LNG siting reviews is uncertain, and legislators may need to consider incorporating regional approaches to alleviate state concerns about FERC's current process. The federal pipeline safety law requires the Secretary of Transportation to consider encouraging remote siting of new LNG facilities. The lack of a clear definition for \"remote\" siting has led to reliance on safety exclusion zones. The General Accounting Office supports remote siting as a primary factor in safety due to uncertainties in new technologies and vulnerability to natural disasters and sabotage. In 2003, Representative Edward Markey expressed concern that DOT regulations did not comply enough with the congressional intent of remote siting provisions for LNG facilities. Industry and government officials argue that exclusion zones provide adequate public safety based on current knowledge about LNG technology advancements since 1979. Some experts believe that hazard models from the 1970s were too conservative and that recent models have improved understanding of LNG properties for better design decisions affecting public safety. Experts argue that LNG terminals near populated areas have operated for decades without serious accidents affecting the public. Despite a serious accident in Algeria, it did not lead to catastrophic failure of main LNG storage tanks or public injuries. Some policymakers are calling for amendments to federal energy law to prohibit new LNG terminals in urban areas. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 preserves states' authorities in LNG siting decisions under federal laws. Under the Clean Water Act, states have the authority to enforce water quality standards for projects discharging pollutants into navigable waters. States can use their certification authority to influence the siting of LNG projects by attaching conditions or denying certification. This authority is crucial for states to protect the integrity of their waters. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 allows expedited review in federal court for challenges to federal or state agency actions related to water quality certificates. States can use their authority under the Coastal Zone Management Act to influence permitting of LNG terminals by denying certification required by the CZMA. The Coastal Zone Management Act allows states to deny certification for LNG terminals, which can be appealed to the Department of Commerce. The Department of Commerce can override the state's denial if the activity is consistent with CZMA objectives or necessary for national security. There is a possibility of a regulatory stalemate if a state rejects an application as incomplete under CZMA authority. The Coastal Zone Management Act allows states to deny certification for LNG terminals, which can be appealed to the Department of Commerce. The Secretary of Commerce has the authority to review the decision. The EPAct of 2005 has not significantly changed the balance of power between the federal government and states in the LNG terminal siting process. The courts have addressed the tension between CZMA and federal authority in disputes over proposed LNG terminals. The U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland ruled that a Baltimore County zoning regulation prohibiting LNG facility siting in a critical area of the Chesapeake Bay was not preempted by the Natural Gas Act. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit later reversed this decision, stating that the regulation was not part of the state's Coastal Zone Management Plan. The Supreme Court declined to review this decision. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968 (WSRA) may play a role in the LNG siting process by designating rivers to prevent future development, including projects licensed by FERC. The WSRA prohibits FERC from licensing projects on designated rivers. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (WSRA) prohibits FERC from licensing projects on designated rivers, including potential additions to the system. The LNG industry is concerned that the WSRA could be used to block LNG facility siting, citing a legislative proposal to designate segments of the Taunton River in Massachusetts as \"scenic and recreational\" under the WSRA. Industry representatives are concerned that a provision could hinder the construction of the Weaver's Cove LNG Terminal in Massachusetts. The Center for Liquefied Natural Gas sees this as a congressional obstacle that showcases the challenges faced in opposing projects. Congress is reviewing federal statutes like the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the CWA, the CZMA, and the WSRA to align their objectives. Policy makers are worried about potential terrorist attacks on LNG terminals or tankers in the US, as they could lead to catastrophic fires in ports and nearby areas. The supply chain for energy commodities, particularly LNG, is vulnerable to security threats. The Coast Guard requested funding for additional personnel at key LNG hubs to ensure safe delivery. While no LNG tanker or facility has been attacked by terrorists, natural gas and oil assets have been targeted internationally. The DHS has identified LNG tankers as potential terrorist targets, citing suspicions of associations with terrorist plots in the past. The DHS has identified LNG tankers as potential terrorist targets due to real risks associated with LNG shipments. Experts have differing opinions on the likelihood of LNG infrastructure being targeted by terrorists. Former counterterrorism advisor Richard Clarke believes terrorists have the desire and capability to attack LNG shipping. Industry representatives acknowledge the theoretical possibility of causing an LNG catastrophe to harm people. Experts believe that causing an LNG catastrophe to injure people would be difficult to accomplish. FERC states that LNG facilities are relatively secure compared to other hazardous infrastructures. The perceived threat of a terrorist attack on LNG terminals is considered probable locally, but at the national level, there are many other potential targets with similar or greater hazards. Historical experience provides little guidance on estimating the probability of a terrorist attack on LNG vessels or storage facilities. Former CIA Director James Woolsey believes a terrorist attack on an LNG tanker in U.S. waters is unlikely. Former CIA Director James Woolsey believes a terrorist attack on an LNG tanker in U.S. waters would be unlikely due to the security measures in place at LNG terminals and ships. While there are no specific, credible threats against LNG facilities, the threat environment is dynamic and some threats may be unknown. In today's environment, insiders pose a potential threat to LNG infrastructure. Policy makers must rely on their judgment for LNG security in FERC siting reviews. Congress may explore policies to improve terrorism intelligence sharing related to LNG. Concerns include increased security costs from U.S. LNG imports and potential diversion of resources from other activities. According to Coast Guard officials, resources dedicated to securing maritime LNG could be used for other missions like boating safety, search and rescue, and drug interdiction. The GAO recommended a national resource allocation plan for LNG security, and Admiral Thad Allen expressed concerns about the costs and called for a national dialogue on the issue. The Coast Guard currently lacks sufficient resources for securing dangerous cargoes like LNG. Admiral Allen acknowledged the Coast Guard's lack of resources to secure future LNG deliveries to a proposed terminal in Long Island Sound. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires cost-sharing for LNG tanker security, with FERC officials mandating new terminal operators to cover additional security costs. FERC also recommends private security staff to supplement Coast Guard and local forces. A legislative proposal in the 110th Congress aimed to prevent security plans relying on state or local governments without an LNG security arrangement. In the 111th Congress, the issue of public provision of LNG security continues to be a concern. The Maritime Hazardous Cargo Security Act (S. 1385) introduced a national study to improve maritime transportation security of liquefied natural gas. Analysts suggest additional LNG safety research to reduce uncertainties about terminal and shipping hazards. Various reports on LNG terminal hazards have been issued by federal agencies, developers, and community groups. Additional research on LNG safety is deemed necessary by federal agencies, LNG developers, and community groups. The ABSG report and the 2004 Sandia study both emphasize the need for more refined models and large-scale spill tests. Physical testing on LNG tanker hulls is also recommended to address engineering gaps, especially in the context of potential terrorist attacks. Congress allocated $8 million in 2008 for large-scale LNG fire experiments to address hazard modeling uncertainties. The Department of Energy and Sandia modified their test program to address hazard modeling uncertainties identified in a 2007 GAO report. Despite potential technical limitations, the DOE's study aims to reduce key uncertainties in LNG safety. Sandia completed two large LNG pool fire experiments by December 2009, with results pending. Concerns exist about LNG terminal developers engaging in non-public community lobbying. Legislation in the 110th Congress aimed to require LNG terminal developers to disclose employees and agents involved in promoting terminals to communities. This was seen as a way to ensure transparency in the siting process, but there were concerns about potential First Amendment issues related to government disclosure requirements. The Court has generally upheld disclosure requirements for \"direct\" lobbying of members of Congress, but it is unclear how they would rule on \"indirect\" lobbying efforts. Some argue Congress should reduce the need for new LNG terminals by curbing domestic LNG demand through conservation and renewable energy incentives. The Reinvestment Act of 2009 promotes policies to address energy issues, including the potential hazards of nuclear power and biomass. Encouraging North American natural gas production and construction of an Alaska gas pipeline are proposed solutions to curb U.S. LNG demand. However, these initiatives face technological and cost barriers. The increased production of natural gas in the lower 48 states since 2005 has helped meet U.S. gas demand, but it is uncertain if new domestic supplies can sustain long-term needs. Safety concerns surround proposals for new LNG import terminals in the U.S., as demonstrated by past accidents and the potential for terrorist threats. Lawmakers and the public are worried about these hazards, leading to extensive regulation and security measures for the U.S. LNG industry. Federal, state, and local governments have implemented security measures to protect LNG facilities from terrorist threats. Some stakeholders believe that federal siting requirements for LNG facilities are not strict enough, but federal agencies disagree. Safety concerns related to LNG terminal siting are significant, similar to other energy facilities like nuclear power plants and oil terminals. Policy makers must consider a range of safety hazards associated with U.S. energy supplies when evaluating new LNG terminal proposals. Despite extensive regulations and industry experience, concerns persist. Some stakeholders question LNG terminal safety despite industry experience. Additional research may be needed for key LNG topics. Siting decisions are ongoing, so research efforts must be completed quickly. Revising safety requirements post-construction could disrupt energy supplies. Continued growth in natural gas demand is projected, with LNG imports being one solution. The need to address safety concerns before investing capital is highlighted. Decisions about LNG infrastructure could impact a broader array of natural gas supply policies. The Deepwater Port Act of 1974 delegates authority to regulate deepwater ports to the Maritime Administration and the Coast Guard. Initially focused on offshore oil ports, the Act now includes LNG facilities. The Deepwater Port Act of 1974 delegates authority to regulate deepwater ports to the Maritime Administration and the Coast Guard, initially focused on offshore oil ports but now including LNG facilities. The act sets out a detailed process for offshore facility siting applications and addresses potential threats to the environment or human welfare posed by development of offshore LNG facilities. It also requires regulations for safety zones around deepwater ports. The Deepwater Port Act of 1974 delegates authority to regulate deepwater ports to the Maritime Administration and the Coast Guard, focusing on offshore oil ports and now including LNG facilities. Amendments to the act exempt LNG terminals from limitations on deepwater ports in designated areas. Governors of adjacent states can ensure facility licenses conform to state environmental programs. USCG regulations for LNG facilities are in 33 C.F.R. part 127, detailing siting application requirements. NEPA analysis is crucial for siting and safety decisions at proposed facilities. The Coast Guard plays a key role in safety decisions for offshore facilities, overseen by the Minerals Management Service. Unlike onshore facilities, exclusion zones are not generally required, with safety zones designated on a case-by-case basis. USCG regulations cover emergency procedures, security, fire protection, and design standards for offshore facilities."
