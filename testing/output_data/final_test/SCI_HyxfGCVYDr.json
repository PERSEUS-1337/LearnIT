A new framework called Distillation by Utilizing Peer Samples (DUPS) leverages dark knowledge from the training set to improve guidance for student models. DUPS shows an average improvement of 1%-2% compared to standard training on various architectures. DUPS, a new framework in deep learning, utilizes dark knowledge from the training set to improve guidance for student models. It achieves an average improvement of 1%-2% on various tasks with minimal extra cost compared to standard training on modern architectures. Knowledge Distillation (KD) transfers knowledge from teacher models to student models, allowing for more compact models with higher quality. Recent works by Furlanello et al. and Lan et al. suggest that a stronger teacher model is not necessary for improving student model performance in Knowledge Distillation (KD). It is possible to significantly enhance the student model with an identically structured teacher model, leading to more efficient KD methods. Recent works suggest that a stronger teacher model is not essential for improving student model performance in Knowledge Distillation. Cheaper teachers with considerable effectiveness may exist, as shown by Yang et al. in their Snapshot Distillation approach. Instead of relying on a separate teacher model, a novel approach for KD is proposed, utilizing hidden knowledge in the dataset to generate a surrogate teacher. In a new approach to Knowledge Distillation, a framework using the entire dataset to provide extra supervision signals is defined. A simple yet effective implementation called Distillation by Utilizing Peer Samples (DUPS) is introduced, where each sample gains information from peer samples of the same category. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100 dataset show that DUPS outperforms standard training methods with minimal extra computation cost. Additionally, DUPS surpasses the SnapShot Distillation method on various architectures and is validated on tasks like ImageNet classification and transfer learning. The paper introduces a new framework called Distillation by Utilizing Peer Samples (DUPS) for Knowledge Distillation. DUPS is shown to be effective across different tasks and achieves significant improvement with almost no extra cost. The paper is organized into sections discussing prior works, methodology, experimental results, and conclusions. The process of Knowledge Distillation (KD) involves training a simpler student model using the softened outputs of a complex teacher model. Various techniques such as aligning feature maps and activation boundaries have been developed to improve KD. KD is commonly used to create compact models with high performance and has been effective in tasks like transfer learning and object detection. Despite its effectiveness, one limitation is that improved student network performance in traditional KD comes at a cost. Recently, researchers have focused on the inefficiency problem of Knowledge Distillation (KD). Anil et al. (2018) proposed online distillation, training multiple model copies in a distributed system. SnapShot Distillation addresses the challenge of distilling knowledge by using cyclic learning rate and dividing the training process into mini-generations. Other works also tackle this issue. In this paper, the focus is on architecture-agnostic Knowledge Distillation (KD) to improve general supervision using inter-class information. KD is related to label propagation, where early works used language knowledge to enhance image classification. Recent approaches utilize KD to refine labels, such as specific crop labels, by leveraging pre-trained teachers. In 2018, the concept of Knowledge Distillation (KD) was used to refine labels of specific crops by a pre-trained teacher model, providing more accurate targets for input images. Label Smoothing (LS) was introduced by Szegedy et al. in 2016 to soften labels in the dataset, making them smoother in distribution. Recent works have analyzed the effectiveness of LS and other label-disturb methods. The continuously boosted softened target generated by the whole dataset is shown to be more than just a data-agnostic regularizer like Label Smoothing. In the classical classification setting, Knowledge Distillation (KD) involves training a network fS parameterized with \u03b8 to map input samples to labels. The cross entropy function is commonly used to measure the distance between ground-truth labels and network outputs. Traditional KD incorporates another optimized solution \u03b8 of a function fT into the final loss function, with hyperparameters \u03bbCE and \u03bbKD to balance the contributions of cross entropy and knowledge distillation. Knowledge Distillation (KD) involves balancing the cross entropy term and knowledge distillation term by computing cross entropy or Kullback Leibler divergence between the teacher and student model logits. Various successful implementations include Born-Again Network, Self-Referenced Network, and Snapshot Distillation. In one generation distillation, the teacher signal for a sample is generated internally or from the dataset. For example, Snapshot Distillation uses a sequence of checkpoints as teacher solutions. The formulation of KD is extended in this context. In extending the formulation of Knowledge Distillation (KD), the proposed framework incorporates the entire dataset D and supplementary teacher solutions. Traditional KD implementations by Hinton et al., Born-Again Network, and Snapshot Distillation are special cases of this general formulation. The teacher signal in this framework is denoted as f T (D i ; \u03b8, D), utilizing dataset information effectively. The proposed framework extends the formulation of Knowledge Distillation by incorporating the entire dataset and supplementary teacher solutions. Traditional KD implementations by Hinton et al., Born-Again Network, and Snapshot Distillation are special cases of this general formulation. The framework utilizes peer samples to provide teaching signals that reveal statistical characteristics like inter-class similarity. This information is relatively static and can be shared among samples of the same category, making it cost-effective. Our method extends Knowledge Distillation by utilizing peer samples to provide reliable teaching signals during training. Unlike traditional approaches, we do not heavily rely on cyclic learning rates for distillation. The training process is divided into stages and epochs, with each stage consisting of multiple epochs. By following a specific algorithm, we implement DUPS to distill knowledge within one generation of training. Our method extends Knowledge Distillation by utilizing peer samples to provide reliable teaching signals during training. The training process is divided into stages and epochs, with each stage consisting of multiple epochs. Teacher signals are shared among samples of the same category, simplifying the process. The average softened logit of each category obtained at the last epoch of each stage is used as the \"teacher model\" for training the student model at the next stage. This process involves m \u2212 1 iterations of knowledge distillation between \"teacher models\" and \"student models\" throughout the training. The study focuses on knowledge distillation between teacher and student models in the training process for image classification tasks using CIFAR100 and ImageNet datasets. CIFAR100 contains 100 classes with 600 images each, while ImageNet has 20K categories and 14 million images. Experiments are not conducted on CIFAR10 due to the lack of fine-level categorization. Transfer learning is also utilized with ImageNet. Transfer Learning is used with ImageNet as the source dataset and 4 different target datasets, including Flower102, Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011, FGVC-Aircraft, and Describable Textures Dataset. Natural Language Processing evaluation is done using the Penn Tree Bank dataset. Image Classification models are trained, excluding DenseNet. For image classification, models are trained in 160 epochs except for DenseNet which is trained in 240 epochs due to slower convergence. The initial learning rate is 0.1 for all architectures with a training batch size of 64. Standard data augmentation is applied following Pytorch examples. For CIFAR100, input images are padded by 4 pixels, cropped to 32 \u00d7 32, and horizontally flipped. For ImageNet, images are cropped to 224 \u00d7 224 and horizontally flipped. Input data is normalized. ResNet-101 is used for transfer learning with 40 epochs and a batch size of 64. SGD optimizer with momentum 0.9 and initial learning rate of 0.01 is used. The DUPS model uses SGD optimizer with a momentum of 0.9, initial learning rate of 0.01, and weight decay of 0.0001. Data augmentation methods from ImageNet are applied. Three LSTM models with varying depth are tested: large model (1500 hidden units, 55 epochs), medium model (650 hidden units, 40 epochs), and small model (200 hidden units, 15 epochs). Dropout rates and learning rate decay differ for each model. The DUPS model uses a learning rate of 20 and cosine annealing policy for updating rates. DUPS+ incorporates cyclic learning rate policy with cosine annealing within each cycle. Hyper-parameters for DUPS include \u03bb CE at 0.8 and \u03bb KD at 0.2, using Kullback Leibler divergence for knowledge distillation. Temperature of 6 softens logits, with training divided into 10 stages for image classification and 5 stages for transfer learning and language models. Experiment results and insights on DUPS advantages and disadvantages are presented. The DUPS model, utilizing a learning rate of 20 and cosine annealing policy, is compared with models trained with SGD, Label Smoothing, and Snapshot Distillation. DUPS consistently improves accuracy by 1%-2% across various neural network architectures. Complex architectures do not always outperform simpler ones, highlighting the effectiveness of DUPS in enhancing baseline models. DUPS consistently outperforms Label Smoothing in image classification across different models on ImageNet. It also shows comparable performance to Snapshot Distillation, with DUPS+ combining cyclic learning rate achieving better results. Additionally, DUPS achieves improved results with significantly less training time compared to Snapshot Distillation. Transfer Learning experiments using ResNet101 show that DUPS enhances model performance on various datasets, with improvements ranging from 0.46% to 1.78%. In contrast, LS does not consistently improve results as much as DUPS. DUPS also reduces perplexity values by 1.5%\u223c4.1% in language modeling, leading to better performance in LSTM models. DUPS significantly improves model performance on various datasets, reducing perplexity values in language modeling for LSTM models. The flexibility of DUPS is evident in its effectiveness across different model sizes. Empirical characteristics show a sharp rise in accuracy after involving teacher signals in training epochs. The test accuracy drops slightly at the beginning of each stage but then slowly rises until the next stage. DUPS consistently outperforms SGD with a stable gap. Hyper-parameter choices for DUPS, such as number of stages and random peer samples, are investigated through grid search. Performance of DUPS remains consistent across different combinations of these variables. In this study, the performance of DUPS is found to be insensitive to most hyperparameter combinations. Increasing the number of peer samples to 5 or more results in model accuracy over 77.3%. A good choice of update interval can significantly boost model performance, even with low peer samples. However, low accuracy occurs consistently with a large update interval of 80, limiting teacher-student knowledge transfer opportunities.
