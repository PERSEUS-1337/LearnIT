The Glacier Bay National Park Boundary Adjustment Act of 1998 allows for a land exchange between the State of Alaska and the United States. The exchange must be completed within 6 months after a license is issued to Gustavus Electric Company by FERC. The lands involved must be in accordance with the National Park System laws in Alaska and State land exchange processes. The State of Alaska and the United States must agree on lands to be conveyed within 6 months after a license is issued. If no agreement is reached, the United States will accept land of equal value to satisfy laws, with clear title and no environmental issues. The Secretary manages exchanges of lands in Alaska's National Park System and State lands required by State law. The United States will accept State lands in priority order if no agreement is reached within 6 months. The Secretary manages exchanges of lands in Alaska's National Park System and State lands required by State law, including the copper river meridian. The Secretary manages exchanges of lands in Alaska's National Park System and State lands required by State law, including the copper river meridian. The lands to be conveyed to the State of Alaska by the United States are designated by the Secretary in various surveyed sections containing a total of 2,539.37 acres. The Secretary and the State of Alaska will designate lands for a hydroelectric project based on FERC's determination. The completion of land exchanges may be extended if needed due to legal processes. The term \"land\" includes lands, waters, and interests. Wilderness areas in Alaska will be designated to maintain the same amount of designated wilderness within the National Wilderness Preservation System. The following lands in Alaska will be designated as wilderness areas upon completion of a land exchange authorized by this Act: an unnamed island in Glacier Bay National Park, Cenotaph Island in Lituya Bay, and an area in Glacier Bay National Park. The Act authorizes a land exchange in Alaska to designate certain areas as wilderness, including an unnamed island in Glacier Bay National Park, Cenotaph Island in Lituya Bay, and an area in Glacier Bay National Park totaling approximately 2,270 acres. The Secretary can adjust boundaries to equal the total wilderness acreage deleted from Glacier Bay National Park. The exchange is subject to economic and environmental analyses under various Acts. The Act authorizes a land exchange in Alaska for wilderness designation, including areas in Glacier Bay National Park. FERC held public meetings in Gustavus, Alaska, to gather citizen input on a proposed hydroelectric power project. FERC has determined the minimum land needed for the hydroelectric project in Gustavus. Gustavus Electric Company must submit a financing plan approved by FERC before construction can begin. FERC will oversee Gustavus Electric Company's application for a hydropower project in Alaska, with a deadline of 3 years from the enactment of the Act. FERC retains jurisdiction over the project site. Township 39 South, Range 59 East, partially surveyed, Section 36 (unsurveyed), containing approximately 130 acres. Township 40 South, Range 59 East, partially surveyed, Section 1 (unsurveyed), NW\\1/4\\, SW\\1/4\\, W\\1/2\\SE\\1/4\\, and SW\\1/4\\SW\\1/4\\NE\\1/4\\, excluding certain surveys and allotments, containing approximately 1,015 acres. Allotment A-442, approximately 1,015 acres, will have additional lands included for accretion. FERC, with the Secretary and State of Alaska's approval, will determine the necessary lands for project construction. The National Park Service will be a joint lead agency for environmental documents under NEPA. FERC's approval is required before construction of any hydroelectric power project. FERC must approve a finance plan from Gustavus Electric Company before construction can begin. The National Park Service waives its right to impose conditions on project lands. FERC cannot license the project unless it determines it will not harm Glacier Bay National Park. The licensee must mitigate any adverse effects of the project. The licensee must mitigate adverse effects on Glacier Bay National Park identified by the Secretary after licensing. A condition of the license is the completion of a land exchange before construction begins. The Secretary of the Interior plays a role in identifying and mitigating adverse effects on Glacier Bay National Park by the licensee. A land exchange must be completed before construction begins as a condition of the license. The Secretary will issue a special use permit to Gustavus Electric Company for completing analyses in Glacier Bay National Park. Lands acquired from Alaska will be added to the National Park System, with boundary adjustments as necessary. The Secretary will make adjustments to National Park System unit boundaries in Alaska as necessary, without impacting acreage limitations. Wilderness area boundaries will also be modified accordingly. The Secretary's concurrence is required and should not be unreasonably delayed. SEC. 5. APPLICABLE LAW. The authorities and jurisdiction provided in this Act shall remain in effect until modified or repealed by Congress."
