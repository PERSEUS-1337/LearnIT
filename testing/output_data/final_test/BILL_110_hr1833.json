    "content": "SECTION 1. FEASIBILITY STUDY. The Secretary, through the Bureau of Reclamation, is authorized to conduct a feasibility study to determine the best way to meet water supply needs in the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project area, including potential facility enlargement. The study must adhere to specific guidelines and evaluate various aspects. The Secretary is authorized to conduct a feasibility study to assess water supply options in the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project area. The study must be submitted to the President and Congress, with no federal funds to be used for construction without further authorization. $4,000,000 is authorized for the study. The Secretary is authorized $4,000,000 for a feasibility study in the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project area. Federal funds for the study must be matched by non-Federal funds. No construction to enlarge the project can occur until specified studies are completed. The Secretary is authorized to follow the original congressional intent of the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project by not entering into new contracts that involve excess capacity space or water rights outside the natural basins of the Arkansas or Colorado rivers. Additionally, the State of Colorado will conduct studies related to the project. The Secretary of the Interior may provide financial assistance to Colorado for a study on the impacts of water transfers from the Arkansas and Colorado River basins. The study will evaluate environmental, social, cultural, recreational, and economic impacts. The study will assess the impacts of water transfers from the Arkansas and Colorado River basins, including social, cultural, economic effects, financial implications for sending and receiving communities, and the impacts of water supply and storage methods on the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project area and natural basins within Colorado. The study will evaluate the impacts of water transfers from the Arkansas and Colorado River basins on hydrologic conditions, water quality, flood potential, and stream flows in the Fountain Creek and Roaring Fork River. It will also consider mitigation alternatives, including flood control storage facilities, and feasible options to resolve identified impacts. The study funded under this section will evaluate the effects of water transfers on hydrologic conditions, water quality, flood potential, and stream flows in specific rivers. The Governor of Colorado is required to submit a report to the President and Congress upon completion of the study. $10,000,000 is authorized for this section. SEC. 4. COLORADO RIVER BASIN PROTECTION. The Fryingpan-Arkansas Project's excess water storage capacity cannot be used to divert nonproject water from the Colorado River basin unless certain conditions are met. The Act requires specific conditions to be met for transbasin diversions, including agreements between the beneficiary and water conservation district, compensatory storage, or alternate water supply. Prior to increased diversions of nonproject water, agreements must be submitted to the Secretary of the Interior for review. This section does not set a precedent for other projects. The Secretary of the Interior can contract with entities, public or private, to utilize excess capacity in the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project for diverting, storing, pumping, or conveying nonproject water within the Arkansas River basin in Colorado for various beneficial purposes."
