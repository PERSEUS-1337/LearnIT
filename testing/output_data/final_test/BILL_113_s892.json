The \"Iran Sanctions Loophole Elimination Act of 2013\" authorizes the President to prohibit foreign financial institutions from opening or maintaining correspondent accounts in the US and impose sanctions on those involved in significant currency transactions with Iran. The \"Iran Sanctions Loophole Elimination Act of 2013\" allows the President to sanction individuals or entities involved in transactions with designated Iranian financial institutions or persons under specific acts, regardless of the currency used. The President has the authority to waive the application of these sanctions. The President can waive sanctions under the \"Iran Sanctions Loophole Elimination Act of 2013\" for up to 180 days if deemed vital to national security. A report must be submitted to congressional committees at least 7 days before the waiver takes effect. The section allows transactions in the currency of the country where the person is operating for the sale of agricultural commodities, food, medicine, or medical devices.
