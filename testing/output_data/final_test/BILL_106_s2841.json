    "content": "The \"Truthfulness, Responsibility, and Accountability in Contracting Act of 2000\" includes sections on definitions, certification of compliance, agency reporting systems, public-private competition, contractor performance review, survey of wages and benefits, Comptroller General reports, and applicability. The Act defines \"employee\" as an individual employed in various government departments and agencies, and \"agency\" as any department, agency, bureau, commission, activity, or organization of the United States. The Act defines terms related to government employees, agencies, contractors, privatization, outsourcing, and contracting out. The Act defines terms related to government functions being performed by non-Federal personnel under contracts, including contracting out, contracting in, privatization, and outsourcing. SEC. 3. CERTIFICATION OF COMPLIANCE. The head of each agency must certify compliance with various requirements, including establishing a centralized reporting system, conducting public-private competitions for contracting functions, avoiding arbitrary limitations on managing Federal employees, and reviewing contractor work. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will publish notices in the Federal Register regarding public-private competitions for Federal employee and contractor positions. Agency certifications must be made available to the public upon request and on the World Wide Web. Beginning 180 days after the enactment of this Act, agency heads must obtain certification from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget before entering into service contracts. The Director will publish determinations of agency progress in the Federal Register promptly. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget may waive the applicability of this section to a contract for services in cases of national security, economic harm, or patient care. Any waiver granted will be published in the Federal Register, identifying affected facilities, explaining the justification, and stating the duration of the waiver. During a suspension of contracting authority, the Comptroller General must monitor agency compliance with the Act and report to Congress every 60 days. SEC. 4. AGENCY REPORTING SYSTEMS AND REQUIRED REPORTS. Each agency must establish a centralized reporting system within 180 days of the Act's enactment to generate reports on their contracting efforts, as per guidance from the Office of Management and Budget. Reports on contracting efforts must be submitted to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget within 180 days, detailing the agency's contracting activities from the previous two fiscal years. Each agency must report on their contracting efforts to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, including contract details and reasons for the contracting effort. The contracting effort details required for reporting include the names of officials, competitive process used, cost comparisons between Federal employee and contractor performance. The report on contracting efforts includes details such as the cost of contractor performance, actual savings compared to Federal employee performance, quality control process, number of employees involved in the contracting effort, and related subcontracts. The agency must submit a report on contracting efforts to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget each fiscal year, including details like the type of work, reasons for contracting, and contact information for supervisors. The report must be completed by the end of the first fiscal quarter of the subsequent year. The agency must report on the cost of performance at the time of contracting and the current cost by Federal employees or military personnel. Additionally, agencies must submit a report on the number of Federal employee positions and positions held by non-Federal employees under a contract subject to public-private competition. The Office of Management and Budget will compile and submit these reports to Congress within 120 days after the end of the fiscal year. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will publish notices in the Federal Register regarding the availability of reports to the public. Reports will be made available on the Internet after removing proprietary information, and the Director will review and consult with agency heads on the content of the reports. SEC. 5. REQUIREMENT FOR PUBLIC-PRIVATE COMPETITION. After the enactment of this Act, any decision by an agency to privatize, outsource, or contract for a function must be based on a public-private competition process that compares costs and follows OMB Circular A-76. This applies to contracting efforts after the enactment date and involves consultation with the exclusive representative of Federal employees. An agency must determine cost savings of at least 10% before outsourcing a function to a contractor. During a suspension period, an agency can contract out a function not currently performed by Federal employees if the contractor costs are lower than the costs of Federal employee performance. An agency can hire necessary Federal employees for work acquired through public-private competition, regardless of limitations on employee numbers. SEC. 6. REVIEW OF CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE. If a report shows that the actual cost of privatization or contracting out exceeds anticipated costs for 2 consecutive years, or quality standards are not met, the agency must either hold a new competition or switch to federal employee performance within 12 months. Terminations for convenience are allowed in such cases. The Act allows terminations for convenience at no cost to the government. Agencies must subject an equal number of federal and non-federal positions to public-private competition annually. Agencies can hire necessary federal employees despite limitations for work acquired through public-private competition. SEC. 7. SURVEY OF WAGES AND BENEFITS PROVIDED BY CONTRACTORS. The Secretary of Labor conducts a survey of wages and benefits provided by contractors to non-Federal personnel. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management reviews the survey findings to compare contractor wages and benefits with those of Federal employees, issuing a report within 180 days. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will issue guidance to implement the report submission requirement within 180 days. The Comptroller General will report every 60 days to specific committees on agency compliance with the Act. The Act does not apply to the General Accounting Office or depot-level maintenance and repair of the Department of Defense."
