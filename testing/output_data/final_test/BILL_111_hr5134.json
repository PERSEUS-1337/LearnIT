    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Groundwork USA Trust Act of 2010\". It includes findings. Congress finds that locally organized entities linked through a national program office can lead cost-effective projects responsive to community needs, essential for improving the local environment, economy, and quality of life. Local community involvement in land use is crucial for neighborhood economic success. Neglected vacant lands decrease property values and burden tax bases. Involving citizens in landscaping and maintenance reduces negative stigma, promotes civic pride, and deters vandalism and illicit activities on idle lands. Transforming idle lands and brownfields through cleaning, landscaping, and tree planting adds economic value to communities by increasing occupancy rates and enhancing the sales appeal of nearby real estate. This initiative, exemplified by federally backed Groundwork USA Trusts for over 8 years, turns neglected areas into cleaner, greener community assets.

In this Act, definitions are provided for terms such as \"brownfields,\" \"eligible organization,\" \"Groundwork USA national office,\" and \"Groundwork USA trust.\" These definitions clarify the entities and criteria involved in the Act.
