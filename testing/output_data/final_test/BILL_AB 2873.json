    "title": "AB 2873",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 55.53 of the Civil Code is amended to require a certified access specialist (CASp) to provide a written inspection report for sites that meet applicable accessibility standards. The report must include an identification and description of the inspected structures and areas, along with a signed statement confirming compliance with construction-related accessibility standards. A CASp inspection report for a site must include an itemized list of corrections made, an identification of inspected structures, the inspection date, and a statement indicating the need for corrections to meet accessibility standards. The CASp inspection report must include a list of corrections needed for the site, a completion schedule for the corrections, and a copy of the report must be provided to the business within 30 days of the inspection. The CASp must file a notice with the State Architect within 10 days of inspecting a business, listing details such as the business name, address, inspection date, CASp's name and license number, and a description of the area inspected. The CASp must also post a notice at all public entrances of the building on the inspection date and keep it there for up to 120 days. The CASp must provide a notice to the building owner or tenant after completing an inspection of a public accommodation site. This notice includes information on the correction of construction-related violations and the applicable accessibility standards. Private property owners/tenants are advised to keep written inspection reports and documentation from a certified access specialist. If involved in a lawsuit regarding a site inspected by a CASp, they may be eligible for a court stay and early evaluation conference by providing proof of inspection and a written report. More information can be found at www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-start.htm. \"You can request a written inspection report and other documentation from a certified access specialist who has inspected your property. You can also request a disability access inspection certificate to display on your property.\" Starting July 1, 2010, local agencies must have at least one building inspector who is a certified access specialist. This specialist will provide guidance on compliance with state accessibility standards for inspections related to public accommodations, permits, plan checks, and new construction. If multiple specialists are employed, half must be certified building inspectors. Starting January 1, 2021, all building inspectors in local agencies conducting permitting and plan check services for new construction or renovations impacting access must be certified access specialists. New employees hired after January 1, 2018, must also become certified within 24-36 months of employment. If a permit applicant or member of the public requests consultation from a certified access specialist, the local agency may charge a reasonable hourly rate. The agency can also increase fees to cover costs. Revenues generated must be used to offset compliance costs. CASp inspections by a building inspector are legally equivalent to those by a private CASp. Permit applicants can still hire a private CASp if desired. Every CASp who inspects a public accommodation must provide a numbered disability access inspection certificate to the building owner or tenant. The certificate, signed by the CASp inspector, confirms compliance with accessibility standards and includes the inspector's name and license number. The CASp must maintain a record of the certificate issuance in a dedicated book. Beginning March 1, 2009, the State Architect will offer disability access inspection certificates for purchase by local building departments or CASp. These certificates must comply with specified information requirements and can be displayed at public accommodations. Property owners or tenants are not required to hire a CASp, and their decision not to do so cannot be used to prove lack of intent to comply with the law. The State Architect will establish a program for voluntary certification of certified access specialists by January 1, 2005. Criteria may include knowledge of universal design requirements and testing on access standards for buildings. The State Architect may implement a program with startup funds from the Public School Planning, Design, and Construction Review Revolving Fund. They will work with training organizations to provide statewide training for access specialists. By January 1, 2018, testing and certification of access specialists will begin. Section 4467 of the Government Code is amended to require applicants for local business licenses or permits to pay an additional fee of four dollars from 2017 to 2019. Building permit applicants in areas without business licenses must also pay this fee. From January 1, 2020, applicants for local business licenses or permits must pay an extra fee of one dollar. Building permit applicants in areas without business licenses must also pay this fee. From January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2019, 90% of fees collected under this section will be retained by the city, county, or city and county. From January 1, 2020, they will retain 70%. Up to 5% of the retained funds can be used for administrative costs. The rest will go into a special fund for CASp Certification and Training, prioritizing certified access specialist training and compliance with accessibility requirements. The jurisdiction must have a sufficient number of certified access specialists to meet public needs, as outlined in the Civil Code. The remaining percentage of fees collected under this section will be transmitted quarterly to the Division of the State Architect for deposit in the Disability Access and Education Revolving Fund. The funds must be transferred within 15 days of the end of the fiscal quarter. Up to 75 percent of the funds in the revolving fund will be used for oversight of the CASp program and to reduce the cost of CASp certification and testing. Each city, county, or city and county must submit an annual report to the Division of the State Architect detailing the fees collected, their distribution, and expenditures on administrative services, CASp training, certification, accessibility compliance programs, and contributions to the Disability Access and Education Revolving Fund. If the Commission on State Mandates finds that this act imposes state-mandated costs, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts will be provided according to the Government Code."
