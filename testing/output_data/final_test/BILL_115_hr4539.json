    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Plymouth 400th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act of 2017\". The Congress recognizes the significance of the 400th anniversary of the Pilgrims' arrival in Massachusetts in 1620, the signing of the Mayflower Compact, and the founding of Plymouth Colony. This anniversary will highlight the cultural contributions and traditions that shaped the United States through the interaction of the Wampanoag and English peoples. The Pilgrims and the Mayflower have become symbols of freedom and law. The indigenous Wampanoag people played a significant role in the Pilgrims' arrival in Massachusetts in 1620, including their assistance in the first shared harvest. The Mayflower Compact, signed before the Pilgrims landed in Plymouth, was a cornerstone for self-governance in the New World and influenced the Constitution of the United States. The story of the Wampanoag people, the Pilgrims, and the Mayflower are iconic symbols representing freedom, family, law, and justice. Today, people from around the world visit Massachusetts to see the sights of the first landing in Provincetown, early exploration of the New World along Cape Cod, and the ultimate landing and settlement in Plymouth. There are over 20,000,000 descendants worldwide tracing their ancestry back to the Mayflower passengers arriving in 1620. Massachusetts is home to two federally recognized Indian Tribes - the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah) and the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe. In 2009, Plymouth 400, Inc. was established to commemorate the Plymouth 400th anniversary with themes of exploration, innovation, immigration, self-governance, religious freedom, and thanksgiving. Plymouth 400, Inc. will lead efforts for a commemorative coin series and postage stamps to mark the 400th anniversary of Plymouth Colony in 2020. The proceeds from the coin sales will fund national observances in 2020 and 2021, including events like the signing of the Mayflower Compact and interactions with the Wampanoag people.
