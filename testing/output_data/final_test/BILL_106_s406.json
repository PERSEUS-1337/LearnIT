    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Alaska Native and American Indian Direct Reimbursement Act of 2000\". In 1988, Congress enacted a demonstration program for 4 tribally-operated Indian Health Service hospitals to test direct billing for health services. The program began in fiscal year 1989 and was successful, leading to increased collections for services provided. The demonstration program for tribally-operated Indian Health Service hospitals showed increased collections for services provided under medicare and medicaid programs, reduced turn-around time for billing, and improved efficiency in tracking billings and collections. Direct involvement of tribes in billing and collection processes was found to be more beneficial than the current system managed by the Indian Health Service. Tribes managing their own billings and collections for medicare and medicaid is preferred over channeling activities through the Indian Health Service. The Indian Health Service aims to reduce administrative costs by channeling activities through tribes and tribal organizations, in line with the Indian Self-Determination Act. The demonstration program, initially set to expire in 1996, was extended to avoid interruptions while awaiting a recommendation on its permanency. Providing permanent status to the program would benefit the Indian Health Service and indigenous organizations. The Indian Health Service aims to reduce administrative costs by channeling activities through tribes and tribal organizations. The program allows Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and Alaska Native health organizations to directly bill for health care services provided. The program allows Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and Alaska Native health organizations to bill and receive payment for health care services provided under the medicare program, medicaid program, or from any other third party payor. Reimbursement under the medicaid program for directly billed health care services follows the 100 percent fmap rule. Each hospital or clinic participating in the program will use funds for direct reimbursement. The program allows Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and Alaska Native health organizations to be reimbursed directly under the medicare and medicaid programs for services provided. Reimbursement funds must first be used for hospital or clinic improvements to meet program requirements. Excess funds are to be used for improving the health resources deficiency level of the Indian tribe in accordance with Service regulations. The program established under this section allows Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and Alaska Native health organizations to be reimbursed directly under the medicare and medicaid programs. Hospitals and clinics participating in the program are subject to auditing requirements and oversight by the Secretary. No payments from special funds are permitted. The program allows Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and Alaska Native health organizations to participate in Medicare and Medicaid. Hospitals and clinics must meet participation requirements and are subject to oversight by the Secretary. No payments from special funds are allowed during participation in the program. Native health organizations can contract or compact for the operation of a facility eligible for Medicare or Medicaid participation. The facility must meet Service requirements and be accredited for reimbursement under these programs. The Secretary must approve qualified applications within 90 days. The Secretary must approve qualified applications within 90 days. Participants in the demonstration program before 1999 are automatically approved for the new program. The approved demonstration program will remain valid as long as requirements are met. The Secretary will continuously examine and implement necessary changes to facilitate direct billing and reimbursement under the program. Participants in the program must provide medical records information consistent with the Service's system. Accounting information required for reporting is the same as in the demonstration program. The Secretary can change submission requirements after consulting with participants. Withdrawal from the program is allowed. Participants in the program can withdraw in the same way tribes can return a contracted program to the Secretary. Cost accounting and billing authority will be returned to the Secretary upon withdrawal. Additionally, certain Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and Alaska Native health organizations have the authority to directly bill for healthcare services provided by their hospitals or clinics. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act allows certain Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and Alaska Native health organizations to directly bill for healthcare services provided by their hospitals or clinics under the Social Security Act. The amendments made by this section will take effect on October 1, 2000. Technical Amendment: Effective November 9, 1998, section 405 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act is reenacted as in effect on that date. Effective November 10, 1998, subsection (e) is struck from section 405."
