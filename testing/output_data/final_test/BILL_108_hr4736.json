    "content": "The \"Independent Film Small Business Job Creation Act of 2004\" allows for a deduction for independent film production investments under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Independent Film Small Business Job Creation Act of 2004\" allows taxpayers holding qualified investments to deduct a percentage of qualified expenditures related to the investments. The applicable percentage is based on the taxpayer's investment in the film production entity. Qualified expenditures are defined for this purpose. The \"Independent Film Small Business Job Creation Act of 2004\" allows taxpayers to deduct qualified expenditures for preproduction, production, and post-production of qualified motion picture films. Qualified expenditures are disregarded in determining adjusted basis of property and deductions at the entity level. The \"Qualified Investment\" under the \"Independent Film Small Business Job Creation Act of 2004\" refers to equity investments in eligible independent film production entities used for qualified expenditures in preproduction, production, and post-production of qualified motion picture films. The term \"qualified investment\" includes equity investments in eligible independent film production entities, which would be qualified investments if held by a prior holder. Redemptions are subject to rules similar to section 1202(c)(3), and an equity investment refers to stock in a corporation or a capital interest in a partnership. An \"eligible independent film production entity\" is defined as a domestic corporation. A production entity is a domestic corporation or partnership organized to produce a qualified motion picture film independently, using its own funds or investments. Related persons are defined based on potential loss disallowance under specific tax code sections. The text chunk discusses the criteria for a motion picture film to be considered qualified for certain tax purposes, specifying that the release format does not affect its qualification. The text chunk outlines the criteria for a qualified motion picture film, stating that it must have a budget between $2,000,000 and $20,000,000, with at least 95% of wages or income for services provided in the US. It also excludes films with sexually explicit content and sets a budget limit based on completion bonds. The text chunk discusses the requirements for a qualified motion picture film, including budget criteria, wages, self-employment income definitions, and inflation adjustments for taxable years after 2005. The text discusses recapture events in relation to qualified investments in eligible independent film production entities, with tax implications for the taxable year in which such events occur. Any increase in recapture amount not a multiple of $1,000 will be rounded down to the nearest multiple of $1,000. The recapture amount is the sum of decreased deductions from prior years due to no deduction under this section, plus interest. A recapture event occurs with respect to an equity investment. The recapture event for an equity investment in an eligible independent film production entity occurs if the entity no longer qualifies, the investment proceeds are not used as required, or the investment is redeemed. Any tax increase from this event is not considered a tax under this chapter. The basis of a qualified investment is reduced by any deduction determined under this section. This reduction does not apply to certain sections. Taxpayers can elect to not apply for the credit. The taxpayer can elect to not apply for the credit, and regulations will be prescribed to prevent abuse and impose reporting requirements. Amendments are made to section 1016 and a new item is added to the table of sections. Section 199 addresses independent film production investments, with amendments applying to investments made after December 31, 2004."
