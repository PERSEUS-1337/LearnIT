    "content": "Financial technology, or fintech, encompasses financial innovations that utilize new technologies for services or products. The term has been applied to various innovations like ATMs in the 1960s and mobile payments in the 2000s. Fintech regulation in the U.S. is complex due to fragmented oversight by multiple regulators with different mandates. Fintech regulation in the U.S. is complex due to fragmented oversight by multiple regulators with different mandates. Recent congressional interest has led to hearings, task forces, and legislation relevant to fintech activities post-Dodd-Frank. Financial regulators have used various policy tools to address new technologies impacting institutions and new firms. Financial regulators in the U.S. are divided into three groups responsible for depository institutions, consumer protection, and securities. Their approaches include writing new rules, issuing guidance, creating new charters, examining partnerships, enforcing regulations, and establishing new offices. Table 1 summarizes federal regulators' scope and relevant authorities, such as the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The report discusses various U.S. financial regulators, including banking regulators like the Federal Reserve and the OCC, consumer protection agencies like the CFPB and the FTC, and securities regulators like the SEC and the CFTC. The banking regulators face challenges in ensuring safe interactions between banks and nonbank fintech companies. Banking regulators engage with fintech in various ways, such as amending rules, supervising relationships with fintech companies, granting licenses, and facilitating communication between industry and regulators. Regulatory actions aim to balance risks and benefits of financial technologies. Banking regulators focus on issuing guidance for fintech activities within the current regulatory framework, particularly in relationships between banks and technology service providers. They use their authority to supervise these third-party partnerships as a critical tool. Regulatory actions aim to balance risks and benefits of financial technologies. Banks partner with Technology Service Providers (TSPs) for software and technical support in critical business areas. Regulators are increasingly concerned about how banks manage risks in these partnerships, ensuring TSP activities meet regulatory requirements. The Bank Service Company Act gives regulators authority to supervise TSPs. The Bank Service Company Act (BSCA) allows banking regulators to regulate third-party vendors providing services to banks. Regulators issue guidance on oversight of vendors, with a focus on security measures. In 2017, the FDIC found that many TSP contracts did not address associated risks adequately. In 2019, the FDIC emphasized the importance of addressing business continuity and incident response risks in service provider contracts. The FDIC emphasizes the importance of addressing business continuity and incident response risks in service provider contracts. Banking regulators occasionally issue rules that impact fintech companies, such as the proposed FDIC rule on brokered deposits. Brokered deposits are less stable than core deposits and are typically placed by third-party brokers to maximize interest and ensure FDIC insurance coverage. Brokered deposits are less stable than core deposits and can be prohibited by regulators if a bank is not well-capitalized. Consumers are increasingly using nonbank technology-based tools to transfer money between accounts. The FDIC proposed a rule in December 2019 to allow deposits through new technological channels without being subject to brokered deposit rules. Regulatory concerns led to this proposal to better understand how new products can enter the banking system. The OCC has proposed an Innovation Pilot Program to support testing of innovative products that could benefit consumers and promote financial inclusion. Regulatory sandboxes or greenhouses are being discussed at both state and federal levels to understand the impact of new technologies on consumers and the market. Arizona has already implemented such a program at the state level. The OCC has proposed an Innovation Pilot Program for banks to test innovative products with regulatory tools like interpretive letters and supervisory feedback. The program aims to address risks to consumers and does not permit proposals with potential harm. The OCC and FDIC are considering granting banking charters to nonbank companies, specifically targeting fintech firms. This would subject these companies to the same regulatory framework as traditional banks. Currently, many nonbank financial companies are licensed at the state level, requiring fintech companies to obtain multiple state licenses to operate nationwide. The OCC proposed offering national bank charters to fintech companies in response to the complexity of obtaining 50 state licenses. Despite controversy and legal challenges from state regulators and consumer advocates, the OCC announced in 2018 that it would begin granting charters to fintech firms. Additionally, some states offer bank charters for industrial loan companies (ILCs), which fintech firms have started to explore. The FDIC is considering granting deposit insurance to fintech firms, allowing them to operate as full-service, FDIC-insured banks under certain state charters. Several technology-focused companies have applied to establish new ILCs, which can be owned by nonfinancial parent companies, attracting controversy due to the mixing of banking and commerce. The FDIC is considering granting deposit insurance to fintech firms, allowing them to operate as full-service, FDIC-insured banks under certain state charters. Critics argue that fintech companies owning banks as nonfinancial parent companies could lead to under-regulation of ILC parent companies. There have been moratoriums on approving FDIC insurance for new ILCs in the past, with no new charters granted since 2013. Technology companies applying to establish new ILCs have renewed public interest in the issue. The FDIC is considering granting deposit insurance to industrial loan companies (ILCs), potentially allowing nontraditional banking companies to offer bank services. The Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 provides exemptions for certain financial and commercial companies to own and control industrial banks without becoming bank-holding companies. The FDIC must assess the safety and soundness of proposed institutions and the risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund when granting deposit insurance. The FDIC issued a proposed rule to enhance supervision of insured industrial banks or ILCs becoming subsidiaries of companies not under Federal Reserve supervision. Regulators are interested in promoting innovation in banking, which can benefit consumers with new products like mobile payments but also pose challenges in consumer management. The Federal Reserve and other regulators implement rules for the payments system, with new technologies creating both benefits and risks for consumers. The FedNow Service is an example of a new product for consumers, with the Federal Reserve operating important elements of the payments and settlement system. The Federal Reserve plans to launch the FedNow Service, a real-time payments system for peer-to-peer and business-to-consumer transactions. This new service is expected to impact consumers using electronic payments and mobile apps, offering real-time settlement but potentially making it harder to resolve errors. The Federal Reserve aims to create competition in the market for payments and settlement services to enhance system resiliency. The FedNow Service is projected to be available in 2023 or 2024. The Federal Reserve plans to launch the FedNow Service in 2023 or 2024, offering real-time payments. Regulatory bodies have established working groups to understand the impact of new technologies on institutions and support financial innovation through programs and office hours. The Federal Reserve has established a new website with information on supervisory guidance, staff speeches, and events. Working groups at Reserve Banks address fintech issues. The OCC developed a \"Responsible Innovation\" framework in 2015, creating a group to discuss fintech issues. In 2017, the OCC established the Office of Innovation to implement the framework. The FDIC has also taken steps to support financial innovation. The FDIC has established the FDIC Tech Lab, or \"FDiTech,\" in October 2018 to promote innovation in the fintech sector. The Tech Lab aims to engage with financial and technology companies to improve the safety of institutions, promote competition, increase economic inclusion, and support risk management. The consumer protection agencies, CFPB and FTC, ensure consumer safety and maintain a competitive marketplace in the fintech industry. The CFPB and FTC issue regulations on fintech, focusing on consumer protection and enforcement actions to manage fintech effects on the financial system. Consumer protection agencies, such as the CFPB and FTC, use enforcement actions to regulate fintech companies and ensure compliance with consumer protection laws. They also create safe harbors to encourage innovation and competition in the market. The FTC enforces federal consumer protection and antitrust laws through enforcement actions, including penalties for firms violating regulations. Over the past decade, the FTC has taken action against various firms in the telecommunications, money service, prepaid card, and technology sectors for violating competition and fairness rules. Consumer protection agencies, such as the CFPB, implement policies like the No-Action Letter (NAL) to encourage fintech firms to innovate and provide products that benefit consumers. Programs like sandboxes or greenhouses allow firms to test new ideas under a subset of regulations or safe harbor from enforcement actions. The CFPB introduced the NAL policy in 2016 to support consumer-friendly innovations and gather information on new products. The policy was revised in 2019 to encourage more participation and provide safe harbor to qualifying firms. Sandbox programs were created to allow certain firms to test financial services with temporary safeguards from liability and enforcement actions. The CFPB introduced the Compliance Assistance Sandbox (CAS) policy to allow firms to test innovative products with temporary safe harbor from liability. Participation in the CAS policy is typically time-limited, with extensions available in specific circumstances. The CFPB also offers trials for companies to test new disclosures with safeguards from liabilities, similar to the Trial Disclosure Policy (TDP) released in 2013 and updated in 2019. Additionally, the CFPB has an office for industry stakeholders and a network for policy coordination. The CFPB created Project Catalyst in 2012 to promote innovation in consumer financial products and services. They studied various issues such as access to credit, financial record protection, and peer-to-peer money transfers. The program also included office hours for industry engagement. The CFPB rebranded Project Catalyst in 2018 to centralize policies for consumer-focused innovation through the Office of Innovation. They introduced new programs like the NAL policy and sandbox policy to encourage firms to produce consumer-friendly innovations. In 2019, the CFPB launched the American Consumer Financial Innovation Network (ACFIN) to enhance coordination among federal and state regulators for financial innovation. The FTC hosts events and develops reports on various financial topics to support its investigation authorities and promote financial innovation among federal and state regulators. They have covered issues such as mobile payments, big data, marketplace lending, cryptocurrency scams, and small business financing through forums and events since 2012. In 2018, the FTC focused on cryptocurrency scams in an event for consumer groups, law enforcement, researchers, and the private sector as part of its consumer protection efforts. The SEC and CFTC focus on securities-related activities of fintech companies, using regulatory tools to clarify existing rules, enforce laws, and establish fintech outreach offices. The SEC and CFTC have issued guidance and rules on Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and crowdfunding, as well as enforcement actions against digital asset practices. The SEC also provides safe harbor to digital asset companies through its NAL policy. Companies issuing cryptocurrencies may consider an ICO to raise capital, subject to SEC regulation. The SEC regulates ICOs similar to IPOs for raising capital. The JOBS Act allows startups to raise capital through internet-based crowdfunding. SEC guidance includes rules for robo advisors. The SEC and CFTC issue enforcement actions to ensure compliance with securities and derivatives laws. The SEC has broad enforcement authorities, including the ability to suspend business practices and bring administrative proceedings. The SEC has issued 48 enforcement actions against digital asset-related companies since 2013, while the CFTC has issued more than 20 enforcement actions related to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency fraud schemes since 2018. The SEC grants NALs to provide relief from enforcement actions against companies involved in digital assets. In 2019, three such letters were issued. The SEC established FinHub in 2018 to engage with the public on fintech issues like distributed ledger technology and artificial intelligence. LabCFTC serves as the CFTC's focal point for financial innovation. LabCFTC is an innovation platform for the CFTC to engage with new technologies and promote responsible innovation in markets. It consists of GuidePoint for stakeholder contact and CFTC 2.0 for beta testing new technologies. The Federal Reserve System, established in 1913, serves as the central bank of the United States with the Board of Governors and 12 Federal Reserve Banks. They set policy for depository institutions to ensure they operate safely and comply with laws. Regulatory agencies oversee different types of depository institutions based on their charter and membership in the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve, through its Board of Governors and Reserve Banks, sets monetary policy, supervises state banks, and operates the payments system. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulates national banks and grants charters for banking operations. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insures deposits of banks and regulates state-chartered banks and thrifts. The FDIC manages the Deposit Insurance Fund to insure deposits and resolve failed banks. The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) regulates the federal credit union system. The NCUA is the regulator for federal credit unions, supervising and insuring deposit shares and resolving failing institutions. Consumer protection laws are overseen by the CFPB and FTC, with the CFPB regulating financial firms for unfair practices and the FTC regulating firms for competition and fairness. The CFPB was established by the Dodd-Frank Act to enforce federal consumer financial laws. The Dodd-Frank Act consolidated consumer protection authorities, giving the CFPB new powers to regulate unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices in consumer financial products and services. The CFPB oversees various financial services, including deposit taking, mortgages, credit cards, loan servicing, and debt collection. The FTC, established in 1914, regulates competition and fairness in the market. The Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 created the FTC to protect consumers and promote competition by preventing unfair or deceptive practices. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulate securities, including stocks, bonds, and derivatives. Securities regulators enforce rules and oversee institutions in their jurisdiction. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was established in 1934 to restore confidence in the securities markets after the stock market crash of 1929. It has broad authority to protect investors and promote fair markets. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) was created in 1974 to regulate derivatives markets and implement the Commodity Exchange Act. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) was established in 1974 to regulate derivatives markets derived from the Commodity Exchange Act. It has rulemaking and enforcement authorities similar to the SEC but focuses specifically on futures, options, and swaps. The CFTC implements various initiatives and programs, including the Office of Innovation which engages in outreach with banks, fintech companies, consumer groups, trade associations, and regulators. The Office of Innovation engages with stakeholders through meetings, conferences, and events to provide technical assistance on OCC expectations and regulations. It conducts research, develops content, and collaborates with other OCC units for training on payment technologies. The office coordinates strategies, forms working groups, and aims to reduce regulatory uncertainty while assisting agencies in establishing innovation offices. The OCC provides assistance to agencies in establishing innovation offices and collaborates on cybersecurity issues domestically and internationally. It participates in regulatory forums and serves as co-chair of the Task Force on Financial Technology. The CFPB and FinCEN also have initiatives related to fintech and financial crimes enforcement. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury focused on administering anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorism laws. In 2018, FinCEN launched an Innovation Initiative to encourage innovative approaches to BSA/AML compliance programs in the financial services sector. This initiative includes the FinCEN Innovation Hours Program and regulatory relief programs to facilitate innovation in AML/CFT compliance. FinCEN is considering incorporating testing programs like sandboxes and \"Tech Sprints\" to promote innovation in AML/CFT compliance. The Innovation Hours Program allows financial institutions and technology providers to discuss innovative solutions. Consumers are increasingly using electronic payments, with the CFPB issuing a rule in 2019 to protect prepaid cards similar to debit and credit cards. The Federal Reserve and CFPB are facing challenges in balancing the shift towards electronic payments with the needs of consumers who rely on cash. Regulatory actions may impact fintech companies offering payment services. The Federal Reserve is working on designing a faster payments system and has various groups focusing on fintech and payments issues. The scope of work of these groups is outlined in Table B-2. The curr_chunk discusses various reports related to cybersecurity, fintech, lending, payments, and banking relationships with third-party vendors. These reports provide insights on federal roles, data protection laws, marketplace lending, faster payments, cash usage decline, and technology service providers for banks. The curr_chunk provides information on various reports related to cryptocurrency, blockchain-based payment systems, virtual currencies, digital assets, SEC regulation, capital markets, securities offerings, and initial coin offerings. The curr_chunk includes reports on financial innovation, high-frequency trading, regulatory approaches, and fintech policy issues."
