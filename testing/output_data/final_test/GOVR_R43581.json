    "content": "Ex-Im Bank provides financing when the private sector cannot do so alone or to compete with government-backed financing from other countries. Congressional debate surrounds the rationale for Ex-Im Bank's activities, guided by statutory requirements in its charter. These requirements include ensuring repayment, not competing with private financing, offering competitive terms, considering economic and environmental factors, and supporting specific types of exports. Ex-Im Bank offers various financial products for exports, categorized into direct loans, loan guarantees, working capital finance, and export credit insurance. Repayment terms vary based on factors like buyer, industry, and country conditions. The Bank follows OECD Arrangement guidelines and aims to support specific types of exports. Ex-Im Bank provides direct loans to foreign buyers of U.S. goods and services, usually for U.S. capital equipment and services. Direct loans have no minimum or maximum size but generally involve amounts of more than $10 million. The Bank extends a loan covering up to 85% of the U.S. contract value to the foreign customer of the U.S. company. The loans carry fixed interest rates based on the Commercial Interest Reference Rates (CIRR) and are offered on a long-term basis. Ex-Im Bank's direct lending program saw a drop in budget authority during the 1980s due to budget cuts. Demand for direct loans increased significantly during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. The Bank provides guarantees for loans made by lenders to foreign buyers of U.S. goods and services to cover repayment risk. Ex-Im Bank provides loan guarantees for medium- and long-term financing of U.S. capital equipment and services, with coverage for 100% of borrower repayment risks. The working capital program aims to assist small businesses with exporting potential by providing funds for production or marketing needs. Working capital guarantees provide repayment guarantees to lenders on secured, short- and medium-term loans made to qualified exporters. They cover up to 90% of the principal and interest on export-related accounts receivables and up to 75% for export-related inventory. Products must have more than 50% U.S. content for eligibility. Interest rates are set by the commercial lender, and collateral requirements include export-related accounts receivable and inventory. The Ex-Im Bank provides guaranteed loans for issuing letters of credit with reduced collateral requirements compared to the private sector. Working capital loans are fixed-rate lines of credit for small business exporters. The Bank also offers insurance policies to protect against non-repayment losses for commercial and political reasons, with specific conditions for claim payment. The Ex-Im Bank offers short-term insurance policies to U.S. exporters to reduce the risk of nonpayment by foreign buyers. The policies cover up to 180-day terms, extendable to 360 days for qualifying transactions, and can cover 90%-95% of nonpayment losses. Medium-term insurance is also available for up to five years with a maximum cover of $10 million. The Ex-Im Bank offers medium-term insurance for up to five years with a maximum cover of $10 million to exporters and lenders, covering one or a series of shipments. The Bank insures up to 85% of the contract price prior to delivery, requiring a 15% cash payment from the buyer. It covers 100% of nonpayment due to commercial and political risk, including specialized finance products like project finance for large infrastructure projects. The Ex-Im Bank provides medium-term insurance for exporters and lenders, covering shipments up to $10 million. They offer project finance for large infrastructure projects, with repayment terms up to 14 years. Additionally, the Bank offers structured finance for existing companies overseas, financing projects like fiber-optic cable, oil and gas projects, and manufacturing equipment. Transportation finance is also available for aircraft, ship, and railroad exports based on OECD guidelines. The Ex-Im Bank focuses on supporting U.S. exports to specific sectors and regions, such as exports by U.S. small businesses, renewable energy sources, and sub-Saharan Africa. They also align with Administration goals, like boosting exports under the National Export Initiative. The Bank operates in around 190 countries globally, with a priority on sub-Saharan Africa. Countries under U.S. sanctions are ineligible for support. The Ex-Im Bank focuses on supporting U.S. exports to specific sectors and regions, such as oil and gas, mining, agribusiness, renewable energy, and sub-Saharan Africa. Certain countries, including those under Marxist-Leninist prohibition, are ineligible for support. The Bank prioritizes infrastructure development in emerging economies and does not support military or defense items. It also focuses on supporting exports of U.S. small- and medium-sized enterprises. In FY2014, Ex-Im Bank authorized 3,746 transactions totaling $20.5 billion, a decrease from the previous year. U.S. small businesses make up 89% of transactions by number, while larger companies dominate in dollar amount. Infrastructure projects received almost 56% of total authorizations. Ex-Im Bank has met its small business target in some years but not in others. In FY2014, Ex-Im Bank authorized $20.5 billion in transactions, with small businesses making up the majority by number. Support for renewable energy exports has been below target, possibly due to market limitations. Ex-Im Bank's activity in sub-Saharan Africa has increased compared to previous years. The Bank's authorizations support $27.5 billion of U.S. exports and 164,000 U.S. jobs. Ex-Im Bank finances around 2% of U.S. exports annually, with a higher percentage for certain sectors. The Bank's actual activity depends on alignment with commercial interests and is demand-driven. In FY2014, Ex-Im Bank reported an exposure of $112.0 billion, below the $140 billion statutory cap, distributed across financial products, regions, and sectors. This decrease follows record highs in previous years due to increased demand during the financial crisis and in emerging markets. The Ex-Im Bank's activities have been subject to the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 since FY1992. This Act measures the cost of federal credit programs more accurately and makes them comparable to direct federal outlays. Credit subsidy estimates are calculated by discounting them using rates on U.S. Treasury securities. Since 2008, the Ex-Im Bank has been using offsetting collections to fund its expenses and retain excess funds. These collections are credited in the federal budget to cover the Bank's operations, reducing the need for appropriations from the General Fund. At the start of the fiscal year, the U.S. Treasury provides an \"appropriation warrant\" for the Bank's operations. The U.S. Treasury provides Ex-Im Bank with an \"appropriation warrant\" for operating costs and administrative expenses, established by Congress spending limits. Ex-Im Bank uses offsetting collections to repay the warrant and borrows from the Treasury for medium- and long-term loans. Congress sets upper limits for the Bank's activities and provides a direct appropriation for its Office of Inspector General. For FY2014, Ex-Im Bank had an upper limit of $115.5 million for administrative expenses and $5.1 million for the Office of Inspector General. No additional appropriation was needed due to a negative credit subsidy. Congress allowed carryover funds of up to $10 million until September 30, 2017. In FY2015, the Bank had an upper limit of $106.3 million for administrative expenses, $5.8 million for the OIG, and up to $10 million in carryover authority until September 30, 2018. Ex-Im Bank transferred $674.7 million to the Treasury in FY2014 after covering operating expenses. Ex-Im Bank manages risks in transactions through credit underwriting, due diligence, and monitoring. It has reserves of over $4 billion for loan losses and reported a default rate of 0.175% in September 2014. The effectiveness of its risk management is debated in Congress. The Ex-Im Bank has reported losses exceeding $4 billion with a default rate of 0.175% as of September 2014. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) study indicates that the ultimate impact of recent business transactions on default rates is uncertain. Ex-Im Bank has been able to recover 50 cents on the dollar for defaulted transactions since 1992, backed by the U.S. government and able to take legal action against obligors. Trade finance has expanded with international trade growth. The global market for trade finance is estimated to be around $10 trillion a year, with 80%-90% of world trade relying on trade finance. Export financing is provided by the private sector, government-backed ECAs, commercial banks, capital markets, lessors, and manufacturing self-financing. ECAs play a significant role in certain niches, with around 60 ECAs existing worldwide. The choice between private sector financing, ECAs, or a combination of both depends on credit market conditions and ECA financing terms. The role of ECAs in export financing is becoming more prominent due to tight credit market conditions and regulatory impacts. Private lenders handle most short-term export financing, while ECAs support certain sectors and longer-term financing for large projects. ECA support can make transactions more attractive by mitigating risks and diversifying funding sources. The OECD Arrangement guides financing activities of Ex-Im Bank and other foreign ECAs. The United States leads efforts to reduce subsidy levels in export credits by raising interest rates to market levels. The Arrangement sets minimum interest rates, repayment terms, risk classification guidelines, and other conditions for government-backed export financing. The OECD Arrangement has been revised multiple times, with tighter restrictions on tied aid and sector understandings governing exports. Guidelines on environmental procedures and sustainable lending principles have also been adopted to ensure projects are reviewed for environmental impacts and adhere to international standards. The OECD Arrangement includes sustainable lending principles to prevent debt build-up in developing countries after debt relief. Export credit financing under the OECD Arrangement is exempt from the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. This financing is not considered an export subsidy prohibited by the SCM Agreement for non-agricultural products. The OECD Arrangement does not cover all officially supported export credit activity. In 2013, government-backed export financing conducted by OECD members totaled $97.9 billion, with the US providing $14.5 billion. Emerging markets like China, Brazil, and India, not part of the OECD, also play a significant role in export credit financing, totaling $55.4 billion in new medium- and long-term support. In 2013, emerging markets provided $55.4 billion in export credit financing, with China alone contributing $45 billion. These non-OECD countries may offer below-market financing options that are difficult for OECD ECAs to compete with. Officially backed export credit activities by emerging economies are increasing in strategic markets like oil, gas, renewable energy, and natural resources extraction. Chinese ECAs are increasingly using export credits for export promotion in strategic markets like oil, gas, renewable energy, and natural resources extraction, particularly in Africa. They offer preferential loans for resources or low-cost loans for projects to gain market share. The Export-Import Bank of China announced $1 trillion in financing for African transportation infrastructure projects through 2025. OECD member countries' ECAs also provide export credit financing through unregulated means like market windows. The Export-Import Bank of China and OECD member countries' ECAs provide export credit financing through unregulated means like market windows and untied lending support. The United States historically leads efforts to impose international disciplines on government-backed export credit activity. The United States is directing the Secretary of the Treasury to negotiate reducing and eliminating government-backed ECA financing. Efforts have faced challenges in the OECD, where other countries rely more heavily on exports. Terminating export credit programs may be difficult as non-OECD countries like China, Brazil, and India could continue their financing programs. China, Brazil, and India may continue their financing programs. The United States and China plan to establish an International Working Group on Export Credits (IWG) to develop new international guidelines. Ex-Im Bank's authority has been extended through June 30, 2015, and Congress may consider its future authority as the global marketplace becomes more competitive. In the 114th Congress, legislation related to Ex-Im Bank reauthorization includes H.R. 597 (Fincher) proposing an extension of Ex-Im Bank's authority through FY2019 with reforms such as reducing exposure cap to $130 billion and implementing measures on ethics, fraud controls, and risk sharing. Members of Congress have varying views on how to address Ex-Im Bank's authority. H.R. 1031 (Waters) proposes extending Ex-Im Bank's authority through FY2022 with an increased exposure cap to $160 billion by FY2022, along with reforms on ethics, fraud controls, and risk sharing. H.R. 1605 (Amash) seeks to abolish Ex-Im Bank, similar to a previous bill in the 113th Congress. S. 819 (Kirk) aims to extend Ex-Im Bank's authority through FY2019 with a reduced exposure cap to $135 billion. S. 819 (Kirk) and S. 824 (Shaheen) propose extending Ex-Im Bank's authority with exposure cap adjustments and reforms through FY2019 and FY2022 respectively. The bills include provisions on loan loss reserves, fraud controls, ethics, risk management, auditing, small business financing target, and international negotiations. Negotiations with non-OECD members for a multilateral export credit agreement and identifying non-OECD countries not complying with WTO subsidy rules are key issues. Policy options for renewing Ex-Im Bank's charter include a clean reauthorization, extending termination date, or limited changes like revising exposure cap. Some Members of Congress support reauthorization with reforms to policies and risk management practices. Proponents argue that Ex-Im Bank supports U.S. jobs and exports by addressing market failures and countering foreign government-backed export financing. They believe government backing makes transactions more attractive and provides leverage for repayment. Critics acknowledge individual benefits but argue that the Bank shifts production without permanently increasing U.S. exports. Critics of the Ex-Im Bank argue that it competes with the private sector, picks winners and losers, poses risks to taxpayers, and is considered corporate welfare. They also call for eliminating government-backed export credit activities internationally. Another issue is the debate over the length of time to extend the Bank's authority, with shorter extensions allowing for more frequent congressional oversight and longer extensions providing stability for the Bank and its clients. The Ex-Im Bank's authority has been renewed for varying lengths of time, with recent extensions lasting around four to five years. Short-term extensions have also been granted by Congress, such as one in 2015 extending the Bank's authority through June 30. Renewal of the Bank's charter could include reforms to its authorities, policies, and risk management practices to enhance its ability to fill gaps in private sector financing. Proposed reforms for the Ex-Im Bank aim to enhance its ability to fill gaps in private sector financing, limit its exposure to U.S. taxpayers, and eliminate all ECA activity. Some Members of Congress support allowing the Bank's authority to expire temporarily or permanently, while others may call for specific parameters for winding down its functions. Uncertainty remains over whether Congress will renew the Bank's authority in 2014. Uncertainty over the renewal of Ex-Im Bank's authority in 2014 led to concerns about financing, potentially causing foreign buyers to choose non-U.S. suppliers. If the Bank's authority were to lapse, no new commitments could be approved, but prior obligations could continue. The Bank could still operate and develop a plan for orderly liquidation, with the primary statutory basis for its activities found in its charter. The potential lapse of Ex-Im Bank's authority in 2014 raised concerns about financing and its impact on the U.S. economy. Stakeholders debated the validity of the Bank's role in filling gaps in private sector financing and offsetting competition from foreign ECAs. The absence of Ex-Im Bank support could affect U.S. firms and employees, but doubts remain about its overall impact on exports and employment levels. Determining the precise economic impact of Ex-Im Bank financing is challenging due to various factors influencing U.S. export and employment levels. The potential lapse of Ex-Im Bank's authority in 2014 raised concerns about its impact on the U.S. economy. Supporters argue that without Ex-Im Bank financing, U.S. companies may struggle to compete with foreign competitors backed by government ECAs. Critics believe that allowing the Bank's authority to lapse could lead the U.S. to set an example in eliminating government-backed ECA programs internationally. The reorganization of Ex-Im Bank's functions may be considered as an alternative to reauthorization or a lapse in authority, with motivations including increasing effectiveness, reducing costs, and eliminating duplicative activities. Various proposals have been suggested, such as consolidating trade and export finance functions into a \"Department of Trade.\" President Obama's 2012 proposal aimed to reorganize business- and trade-related functions of Ex-Im Bank and other federal entities into one department. The proposal to consolidate trade functions into one department, as reiterated in the President's FY2016 budget request, has sparked debates on the potential benefits and drawbacks of reorganization. Stakeholders argue that streamlining federal export assistance could be more efficient, while others raise concerns about responsiveness to specific exporter groups and potential duplication of services. Congress may consider revising the Ex-Im Bank's exposure cap, which has been periodically raised since its establishment in 1945. Some stakeholders support increasing the cap to support U.S. exports, while others advocate for maintaining or reducing it. The debate over revising the Ex-Im Bank's exposure cap continues, with some advocating for an increase to support U.S. exports, while others express concerns over the Bank's ability to manage its portfolio. The Administration's proposal seeks to raise the cap to $160 billion by FY2018, but legislation in Congress varies. Proponents argue for maintaining the current balance of stakeholder interests, while long-standing policy debates persist. The debate over revising the Ex-Im Bank's policies continues, focusing on balancing its core mission to boost U.S. exports with other policy interests and comparing to foreign ECAs. One debated policy is the content requirements for exports, with Ex-Im Bank's policy based on supporting U.S. jobs. The Ex-Im Bank's content policy aims to support U.S. jobs by encouraging companies to maximize sourcing of U.S. content. They limit support to 85% of the value of all goods and services in a U.S. supply contract or 100% of the U.S. content in an export contract. Foreign content exceeding 15% reduces the Bank's support proportionally. For short-term contracts, full financing requires 50% U.S. content. Foreign ECAs generally have lower domestic content requirements or none at all. The Ex-Im Bank's content policy aims to support U.S. jobs by encouraging companies to maximize sourcing of U.S. content. Foreign ECAs generally have lower domestic content requirements or none at all. ECAs of other countries have revised their content policies to reflect the changing nature of manufacturing, including the rise of global supply chains and the sourcing of inputs from multiple countries. In the 2012 reauthorization legislation, Congress required Ex-Im Bank to review its domestic content policy for medium- and long-term transactions to evaluate its effectiveness in maintaining and creating jobs in the U.S. and contributing to a stronger national economy through the export of goods and services. Following the review, Ex-Im Bank announced certain policy updates to increase U.S. services exporters' access to its financing. Ex-Im Bank clarified its content policy for U.S. services providers and contracts, including foreign-developed technology. Stakeholders have raised concerns about limitations for U.S. service providers in accessing Ex-Im Bank financing. U.S. exporters are calling for greater support due to global supply chains and foreign ECA policies. U.S. exporters are pushing for more flexibility in Ex-Im Bank's content policy, suggesting lower domestic content requirements, aligning with OECD averages, or covering non-U.S. content for U.S. FTA partners. Labor groups fear reduced requirements may lead to job outsourcing. Ex-Im Bank must consider the impact on U.S. industries and employment when providing loans or guarantees. They are prohibited from supporting production that may compete with U.S. production or create surplus in world markets. The Ex-Im Bank prohibits support for production that may compete with U.S. production or create surplus in world markets, unless the benefits to U.S. industry and employment outweigh the potential harm. Other G-7 ECAs also prioritize transactions that benefit their domestic economy. The Ex-Im Bank is required by law to use economic impact analysis to assess transactions for potential adverse impact on U.S. industry, which can result in denial of financing. The 2012 reauthorization act mandated the development of methodological guidelines for economic impact analyses. In April 2013, revised procedures and guidelines were published, including for aircraft exports. Supporters argue that these requirements ensure the Bank meets its congressional mandate. The Ex-Im Bank's impact analysis requirements ensure compliance with its congressional mandate. Critics are concerned about the policies being burdensome and not competitive with other ECAs. Environmental reviews are conducted for transactions over $10 million, with recent focus on high-carbon projects like coal-fired power plants. Ex-Im Bank's environmental and social due diligence procedures have expanded over time and are more comprehensive than other OECD ECAs. The bank faces competition from less rigorous ECAs like China. Supporters argue for balancing U.S. exporting interests with environmental policy, while some exporters find the environmental impact policies burdensome. The Ex-Im Bank's shipping policy, based on Public Resolution 17, aims to maintain a strong U.S. merchant marine for waterborne export and import commerce. Most supported products must be transported on U.S. vessels, with waivers granted on a case-by-case basis. Supporters argue that maintaining U.S. flag vessels is crucial for national security and the commercial U.S.-flag merchant marine. Cargo preference is seen as a cost-efficient way to support a privately owned U.S.-flag fleet, leveraging transportation expenses to benefit the nation. Without this requirement, the government would need to duplicate sealift capacity at a high cost. These U.S.-flag vessels are also used to transport troops and military equipment. Critics argue that U.S. shipping requirements may make American goods less competitive globally due to higher rates and route scheduling challenges associated with using U.S.-flagged vessels. Capacity constraints are also a concern as there are a limited number of U.S. bulk cargo carriers available. The Ex-Im Bank introduced the co-financing program in 2001 to address concerns about processing time and outcomes for businesses using U.S.-flagged vessels. Co-financing arrangements allow export credit financing from multiple ECAs, enabling goods and services from different countries to be marketed under a single ECA financing package. This collaboration with other ECAs allows Ex-Im Bank to participate in the non-U.S. content portion of export contracts, increasing the chances of U.S. exporters winning sales. In 2013, Ex-Im Bank conducted 51 co-financed transactions totaling approximately $5 billion. In 2013, Ex-Im Bank conducted 51 co-financed transactions totaling approximately $5 billion, with 99% involving aircraft. Changes were made to the co-financing policy to allow collaboration with other ECAs, benefiting the U.S. economy. Some stakeholders seek more flexibility in co-financing arrangements due to concerns about tied aid policies potentially disadvantaging U.S. exporters. Some U.S. exporters are worried about losing sales due to increased tied aid activity by other countries and the more flexible rules of foreign ECAs. There are calls for the Ex-Im Bank to have more funds and authority to compete for export contracts. Challenges exist in obtaining evidence to counter foreign tied aid competition. Congressional mandates on specific export financing raise questions about Ex-Im Bank's focus. Congress may mandate Ex-Im Bank to finance specific types of exports to support strategic U.S. economic sectors and small businesses. However, this targeted assistance could be seen as government interference in the market, potentially causing economic distortions and harming other U.S. firms. This raises questions about Ex-Im Bank's core mandate to support U.S. exports. Ex-Im Bank's fulfillment of congressional mandates for supporting U.S. exports and employment is influenced by market demand and commercial interests. The Bank has met its small business target in some years but fallen short in others. Support for renewable energy exports has been below the 10% target due to market limitations. Stakeholders are concerned about the Bank's prioritization of activities and allocation. Some stakeholders are concerned that Ex-Im Bank's prioritization of activities, allocation of resources, and policies may hinder its ability to consistently meet congressional mandates to support specific exports. Debates over the measure of success often focus on small businesses, with some arguing that the dollar value of support to small businesses may be misleading. Data may not capture all small businesses benefiting from Ex-Im Bank services through their role in the supply chain. Some critics express concern over the allocation of Ex-Im Bank financing to large U.S. corporations like Boeing, questioning the need for taxpayer funds to support private benefits. Congressional worry about the bank's financial soundness and risk management has been ongoing, as its activities are backed by the U.S. government's full faith and credit. The 2012 reauthorization act required Ex-Im Bank to monitor its default rate and develop a plan to reduce it if it exceeds 2%. GAO found that Ex-Im Bank has improved its risk management practices but further enhancements are needed. Ex-Im Bank accepted all of GAO's recommendations. Ex-Im Bank has addressed GAO's recommendations on risk management, including data collection, stress testing, and monitoring default rates. The Bank has made changes such as appointing a Chief Risk Officer and establishing an Enterprise Risk Committee. Debate continues on Ex-Im Bank's risk management and accounting practices. Critics question Ex-Im Bank's risk governance and methodology for calculating expected losses, expressing concern over the Bank's growing exposure and concentrations in areas like aircraft, which they believe pose a risk to U.S. taxpayers and the federal budget. The Ex-Im Bank's risk governance and methodology for calculating expected losses are questioned by critics due to growing exposure and concentrations in risky areas like aircraft. Concerns are raised about the Bank's risk management balance and adequacy of human capital to manage its portfolio effectively. Critics question Ex-Im Bank's risk management framework and governance, citing concerns about expertise in underwriting and due diligence. They argue for a fair value accounting system to accurately reflect the cost of federal credit programs. Fair value accounting considers market risk, providing a more comprehensive measure of federal costs compared to traditional methods. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that Ex-Im Bank would have a negative subsidy of $14 billion under FCRA but a positive subsidy of $2 billion under fair value accounting from FY2015 to FY2024. Some stakeholders question CBO's assumptions, citing Ex-Im Bank's contributions to the U.S. Treasury and low default rate. The OECD Arrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits has been debated for its effectiveness in leveling the playing field for exporters. The U.S. Trade Representative states that it has saved taxpayers $800 million annually and boosted U.S. exports by $1 billion a year. However, concerns are rising due to the growing official export credit activity of non-OECD members like China, Brazil, and India. Concerns about the effectiveness of the OECD Arrangement are heightened by unregulated financing from non-OECD countries like China, Brazil, and India. To address these concerns, strengthening international disciplines guiding ECA activity is suggested, such as encouraging greater engagement with non-OECD economies and negotiating rules to limit government-backed export credit financing in developed countries. Efforts to level the playing field for U.S. exporters by reducing trade-distorting export credit competition and economic losses may involve strengthening international export credit rules or negotiating to eliminate government-backed export financing internationally. However, achieving changes in international export credit rules may be slow due to the complex nature of negotiations and the challenge of developing comprehensive rules covering both developed and developing countries. Critics of Ex-Im Bank advocate for the elimination of government-backed export financing, while supporters argue for its importance. Supporters of the Ex-Im Bank argue that it is necessary to fill gaps in private sector financing due to market failures, even if government-backed export credit activity is eliminated. Discussions about reauthorizing the bank, adjusting its exposure cap, and addressing financial soundness and risk management have intensified due to the changing export finance landscape. These issues are likely to be focal points in the upcoming reauthorization debate in Congress."
