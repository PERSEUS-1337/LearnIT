    "content": "During the \"golden age\" of the U.S. petroleum refining industry from 2004-2007, there was a rapid increase in demand for gasoline and other petroleum products. Refiners benefited from favorable price spreads and operated at maximum capacity, leading to record profits. Unexpected events like hurricanes and concerns over peak oil production contributed to spikes in gasoline prices. Policy makers expressed concerns about insufficient refining capacity to meet growing demand, but now there may be excess capacity affecting profitability and meeting consumer needs. The refining industry's capacity constraints have impacted profitability and meeting consumer demand. Economic conditions have led to lower refinery utilization rates and closures. Vertically integrated oil companies are divesting or spinning off refineries. The concentration of refining capacity in the U.S. Gulf Coast is influenced by petroleum resources. New sources of crude oils are altering logistics, with rail becoming a viable alternative for crude supply. Rail transportation is proving to be a viable alternative for crude supply and product delivery bottlenecks in the refining industry. Refineries must adapt to changing crude streams to ensure cost efficiency and profitability. The availability of new unconventional oil resources in the mid-continent is changing refining economics on both coasts and challenging the Gulf Coast's refining center status. The industry faces new policies that could impact refinery numbers, capacity, and utilization. The report reviews the current production capacity of US refineries, changes in crude oil supply, and the effects on the refining industry. It also discusses policy and regulatory factors that may impact the industry in the next decade, including potential greenhouse gas limits and tax considerations. Crude oil is a complex mix of hydrocarbon compounds with varying characteristics. Crude oil is a mix of hydrocarbon compounds with different densities and molecule sizes. It typically contains 84% carbon, 14% hydrogen, and small amounts of sulfur, nitrogen, oxygen, metals, and salts. The API gravity scale measures the \"lightness\" or \"heaviness\" of crude oils, with light crude having an API gravity above 31.1, medium crude between 22.3 and 31.1, and heavy crude below 22.3. Light crude, like West Texas Intermediate, has low wax and sulfur content. A refinery distills crude oil into products like gasoline, diesel, and jet fuels based on boiling point range. The process involves distillation, cracking, treating, and reforming. Distillation separates light hydrocarbons from heavy ones in an atmospheric distillation tower. Light materials vaporize and rise to the top, while medium weight materials like gasoline and diesel condense in the middle. The distillation process in a refinery separates crude oil into various products based on boiling points. Heavy materials like gas oils condense in the lower portion of the column, while lighter oils are converted into gasoline through processes like fluid catalytic cracking and hydrocracking. Vacuum distillation is used to prevent thermal decomposition. Coking at high pressure and temperature converts low-value residuum to high-value light products like jet fuel and gasoline, with petroleum coke as a by-product. Cracking breaks gas oil into gasoline and jet fuel, while alkylation units recombine lighter hydrocarbons into high-octane gasoline. Hydrotreating removes impurities like sulfur and nitrogen, reducing air pollution from fuel combustion. The refining process involves upgrading gasoline octane-rating using precious-metal catalysts. A 35 API crude can yield 27% gasoline and 25% middle distillate fuels like diesel and jet fuel. U.S. refiners are facing decreased demand and responding by cutting costs and reducing capacity utilization. The refining process involves upgrading gasoline octane-rating using precious-metal catalysts. U.S. refiners are cutting costs, reducing capacity utilization, and closing facilities in response to decreased demand. Despite closures, operable refining capacity in the U.S. has increased over the past decade. For this report, CRS reviewed petroleum refiners primarily producing fuel with an estimated overall refinery capacity exceeding 18 million barrels/day. EIA reported a U.S. operable crude oil distillation capacity of 17.73 million barrels/day in 2011, with a refinery utilization capacity slightly over 86%. EIA also noted prime suppliers of refined products selling around 14.53 million barrels/day. The prime supplier distributes selected petroleum products across state boundaries and local areas, connecting refineries and markets. Regional differences in fuel specifications limit distribution flexibility by pipeline, leading to higher prices and reduced availability in isolated markets like the West Coast. The gasoline market has higher prices and reduced availability in certain conditions due to lack of crude oil pipelines linking PADD 1 and PADD 5 with the rest of the country. Rail shipment is a near-term alternative. Canada supplies PADD 2 refineries through the Alberta Clipper pipeline, while permitting issues delay the Keystone-XL pipeline delivering Canadian syncrude to PADD 3 Gulf Coast refineries. Refining capacity and refinery locations by PADD are compared in figures and tables. Rail freight and the Class I Railroad System of North America are being used as an alternative transport mode by East Coast and West Coast refiners to ship crude from new resources like North Dakota's Bakken Formation. While pipelines face permitting hurdles and environmental opposition, rail sidings can be quickly constructed for loading rail tank cars. Rail offers flexibility in delivery, but pipelines have a volumetric advantage. U.S. refining has seen significant capacity changes in the last two years. In the last two years, several refineries in the United States have undergone changes in operations. The Hovic and Sunoco refineries closed permanently, while others like the Philadelphia and Trainer refineries are scheduled to reopen under new ownership. Motiva's Port Arthur refinery has doubled in size, becoming the largest in the country. Phillips 66 has also expanded its Wood River Refinery to handle more Canadian heavy crude. Refineries on the East Coast are now shifting towards unconventional crude oil sources. Refineries in the United States are shifting towards unconventional crude sources, with the Gulf Coast being the largest refining region. The Midwest and West Coast follow in capacity, while the East Coast is losing capacity to cheaper gasoline imports. The West Coast primarily obtains crude oil from Alaska and California, while the Gulf Coast has nearly 45% of the U.S. refining capacity. The refining industry in the United States is characterized by a concentration of capacity in a few large and complex refineries, with economies of scale leading to increased profitability. These refineries have added coking capacity to convert lower value residuum into high-value gasoline. European refineries are less complex due to less coking capacity. The second quartile consists of refineries with intermediate capacities. The refining industry in the United States has seen an increase in coking processes to convert lower value residuum into high-value gasoline. This shift was driven by factors such as gasoline shortages, oil price spikes, and the declining availability of light sweet crude oils. Coking has enabled refineries to upgrade heavy crude oils, reduce waste generation, and decrease the need for imports, leading to energy-efficiency improvements. The coking process in refineries converts residuum into petcoke, which is used as a substitute for coal in steel-making. Gulf Coast refineries have the highest coking capacity due to their reliance on heavy crude oil imports. The top 10 refiners in the US account for 75% of total fuel production. The top ten firms in the US, including ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Shell, control 75% of the country's fuel refining capacity. These firms operate over half of the refining fleet, with a total of 62 out of 115 refineries. Valero is the largest independent refiner and marketer, while ConocoPhillips split into upstream and downstream units. Marathon Oil Corporation and Marathon Petroleum Corporation operate separately. In 2011, the US consumed 5,327 million barrels of crude oil. In 2011, the United States consumed 5,327 million barrels of crude oil, meeting 39% of its demand through domestic production. Canada supplied 15%, Saudi Arabia 9%, and Mexico 8%. The US sourced 62% of its crude oil from North America, with Canada as the leading importer. Input to US refineries has increased since 2009. In 2011, US refineries consumed an average of 15.3 million barrels per day of crude oil, an increase of 630 thousand barrels/day from 2009. This rise in input does not necessarily indicate a surge in US demand, as product exports have also been steadily increasing. Crude oil imports by the US have decreased since the mid-2000s, while domestic production has been on the rise, with unconventional resources like the North Dakota Bakken and Texas Woodford shales contributing to production levels matching those of 2003. The US has seen a decline in production from the Outer Continental Shelf/Gulf of Mexico, with net imports decreasing while Canadian imports are rising. Refineries rely on specific grades of crude oil for efficient operation, with some depending on heavy crude while others on light sweet crude. The API gravity of imported crude oils has been decreasing over the last 25 years. The API gravity of imported crude oils has been decreasing while average sulfur content has been increasing. U.S. refineries have made investments to convert heavier sour crude oils to high-value products. Light sweet crudes from the Bakken formation and bitumen-derived crudes from the Athabasca oil sands are becoming important feedstocks for U.S. refineries. Pipelines are used to transport diluted bitumen to refineries. The Keystone pipeline transports diluted bitumen, a heavy crude oil comparable to other types produced globally. It may also transport crude oil from U.S. producers in Texas, Oklahoma, Montana, and North Dakota. The benchmark for pricing crude oil futures is West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, known for its high quality. North Sea Brent crude oil is another benchmark with a similar API gravity but higher sulfur content. Brent crude, with higher sulfur content than WTI, is a global benchmark for oil prices. It is refined in Northwest Europe and exported to the U.S. Gulf and East Coasts. Recently, Brent has been priced at a premium of over $10 per barrel against WTI. OPEC uses a basket of crude oils to develop a reference price for monitoring world oil markets. The OPEC basket crude has a 32.7 API gravity and 1.77% sulfur content, making it less valuable than WTI or Brent. U.S. refiners have turned to heavier sour crudes due to the diminishing availability of sweet crudes worldwide. The spot price for WTI crude oil rose during the Iraq War, peaking at $133.88 per barrel in June 2008. In 2012, the average spot price of WTI was over $96 per barrel. Recently, crude produced from North Dakota's Bakken Formation has gained attention. Recently, Bakken crude from North Dakota has been sold at large discounts in the Midwest due to limited pipeline capacity, leading producers to ship it to East and West Coast refineries by rail. Some PADD 1 refineries have restarted operations with the lower-cost Bakken crude. Price volatility in crude oil markets is attributed to various factors such as political tensions, financial speculation, and concerns about global oil production. The U.S. dollar's role as the reference currency for oil prices in the world market also plays a significant role. The U.S. dollar's weakness in mid-2008 was linked to the peak in oil prices, affecting refining profit margins. Despite rising crude oil prices, refiners passed on cost increases to consumers, leading to increased revenue from gasoline sales. The U.S. dollar's weakness in mid-2008 was linked to the peak in oil prices, affecting refining profit margins. Refiners can maintain or increase profits during high crude oil prices, even as total costs decrease with a decline in oil volume passing through the refinery. However, weak product demand can lead to falling product prices and profits as capacity utilization declines. The price spread between light and heavy crude oils fluctuates based on supply availability and refinery adaptations to lower cost crude oil stocks. The price spread between light and heavy crude oils fluctuated, with heavy crude oils selling at a discount relative to light crude during the period of high oil prices from 2004 through 2008. Refiners invested in facilities to process heavy crude oils when the price spreads were favorable, but profitability declined after oil prices fell in 2011. The demand for crude oil is driven by the demand for petroleum products. In 2011, the demand for crude oil is influenced by the demand for petroleum products, such as gasoline. Refiners adjust their product slate to produce more gasoline from each barrel of crude oil. The short-run price elasticity of gasoline is low, around -0.25, meaning a 1.0% increase in gasoline price leads to only a \u00bc % decrease in demand. Consumers find it challenging to reduce gasoline consumption quickly due to fixed factors like commuting distance and fuel-efficiency. The demand for gasoline is influenced by factors like consumer income growth and the fraction of disposable income spent on gasoline. The income elasticity for gasoline demand in the United States is around 1.0, indicating that a 1% increase in income leads to a 1% increase in gasoline spending. This suggests that gasoline demand may rise even with higher prices if income growth outweighs the price effect. The 2007-2008 recession and high gasoline prices led to a 6% reduction in gasoline demand in the United States, causing weak market conditions for the refining industry. This decline continued through 2011, impacting capacity utilization rates, refinery closures, and profitability. Despite potential income growth, the outlook for gasoline demand remains constrained. The gasoline demand in the United States is expected to be constrained by changing attitudes towards petroleum usage, fuel efficiency regulations, and the increased use of alternative fuels in transportation. Leading refiners' net income declined from 2006 to 2011 due to high crude oil prices and weak demand, leading to reduced refining profit margins. High inventories of gasoline and diesel fuel further depressed product prices relative to crude oil costs. The narrowing price spread between light and heavy crude also contributed to lower refining margins and failed capital investments. Valero, an independent refiner and marketer with the most U.S. refineries, saw substantial gains in 2011 despite mixed returns for major integrated oil companies. Refiners invest in capital for various reasons such as expanding facilities, implementing new technology, and regulatory compliance. Expansion and new technology indicate industry expectations of increasing demand and economic growth. Capital investments require initial funds offset by future earnings, qualifying projects with greater discounted future earnings than the initial outlay. Capital investment projects qualify for inclusion in the budget if they have greater discounted future earnings than the initial outlay. The U.S. refining sector has seen mixed capital spending trends, with declines followed by some capacity increases. Despite refinery closures, the industry does not seem to be expanding. Oil companies can adjust to meet changes in demand for petroleum products. Oil companies can adjust to meet changes in demand for petroleum products by building or closing refineries, expanding or reducing capacity, or investing in compliance with regulations. This allows for flexibility in supply adjustments without necessarily expanding the industry. Oil companies can adjust to changes in demand by varying net imports of finished products from other regions, avoiding the need for additional refinery investments. This approach offers flexibility in quickly adjusting imports to meet demand fluctuations, with cost being a key factor in decision-making. Imports of petroleum products can provide flexibility for oil companies to meet domestic specifications at competitive prices without the need for expanding or building new capacity. U.S. total motor gasoline imports averaged about 11% of consumer supply from 2004-2011, while total petroleum products imports made up 17% of domestic consumption. The recession led to reduced imports from 2008-2011, but adjustments were made to reflect lower demand without significant domestic job losses or economic disruptions. Recent trends show U.S. refineries exporting petroleum products to maintain capacity utilization rates efficiently. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 allowed taxpayers to expense 50% of qualified investments in refinery assets to address concerns about domestic refineries meeting fuel demand. This provision was initially temporary and aimed to prevent fuel price spikes when refineries operate at near capacity. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 allowed taxpayers to expense 50% of qualified investments in refinery assets to encourage refinery investment. The provision was extended by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, allowing for tax deductions on refinery construction contracts entered before January 1, 2010, and placed in service by January 1, 2014. This incentive reduces construction costs and promotes additional refinery investments. The provision allowing taxpayers to expense 50% of qualified investments in refinery assets will cost $3.4 billion over the 2009-2013 budget window. The 5% price discount for taxpayers in the 35% tax bracket incentivizes investment in refinery capacity, but the limited effective price discount may offset the tax credit's value. The 2013 budget window estimates a cost of $3.4 billion for a provision related to gasoline refining. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 brought significant changes to gasoline formulations, including the prohibition of lead additives and requirements for oxygenated and reformulated gasoline. Gasoline comes in three formulations and at least three grades, with adjustments for different driving conditions. The EPA designates areas not meeting air quality standards as ozone \"nonattainment areas,\" requiring emission reductions. Reformulated gasoline (RFG) is used to reduce harmful emissions causing ground-level ozone during the summer season. RFG undergoes additional processing to remove volatile components and reduce air pollution. States may opt into the RFG program or establish their own fuel standards, known as \"boutique fuels,\" with tighter summer volatility standards. California has its own gasoline blend, and 12 states require five distinct summer blends. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the Clean Air Act to limit boutique fuels to the number existing as of September 1, 2004. This was done to reduce the proliferation of boutique fuels and their impact on the supply and distribution system. The Clean Air Act RFG standards between 1992 and 2005 included a requirement for oxygen in fuel to reduce ground-level ozone and smog. The gasoline sold in the United States during the specified period contained up to 10% MTBE or ethanol as an oxygenate, octane booster, and volume extender. MTBE was phased out due to groundwater contamination concerns, leading to ethanol becoming the primary fuel oxygenate. Ethanol, mainly produced from corn fermentation, is blended with gasoline at storage terminals instead of at refineries, reducing refinery production. This shift from MTBE to ethanol was influenced by increasing crude oil prices. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) was created by Congress to substitute renewable fuels for gasoline, with a target consumption volume set for 2012. The Energy Independence and Security Act expanded the program to cover transportation fuels, leading to a decline in motor-fuel demand due to economic factors and increased use of ethanol and other biofuels. This shift may influence operators to idle, consolidate, or permanently close refineries. The Energy Independence and Security Act expanded the Renewable Fuel Standard program to cover transportation fuels, increasing the target volume to 36 billion gallons annually. Fuel suppliers are facing a \"blend wall\" limiting ethanol use in gasoline, with a partial waiver allowing up to 15% ethanol (E15) in some vehicles. The EPA approved the use of E15 in 2001 and newer model year vehicles, but not in older vehicles or heavy-duty, motorcycle, and non-road engines. However, infrastructure compatibility, automaker warranties, and state regulations pose challenges for widespread E15 adoption. Fuel suppliers may need to find alternative solutions to address the blend wall issue. EPA is finalizing RFS regulations for 2011 with specific annual volumes for various biofuels. The EPA is finalizing RFS regulations for 2011, including specific annual volumes for various biofuels. Challenges exist for increased biofuel production, such as economic, land use, and policy barriers. Congress is considering cellulosic ethanol to meet RFS requirements, but technological barriers need to be overcome. Emissions standards for greenhouse gases could impact the refining industry. State programs, especially in California, and the possibility of a federal carbon tax could significantly impact refining in the future. EPA finalized rules in 2009 stating that greenhouse gases endanger public health, leading to emissions standards for vehicles and subsequent controls on emissions from new stationary sources. In June 2010, EPA implemented the \"tailoring rule\" to limit permitting requirements to only the largest emitters of greenhouse gases. In December 2010, EPA settled a lawsuit to set NSPS for greenhouse gas emissions from refineries, with a deadline that has since passed. Future federal regulations may impact petroleum refineries, but the timeline for implementation is uncertain. State regulations, particularly in California, have already imposed requirements such as the Low-Carbon Fuel Standard, which mandates a 10% reduction in carbon intensity by 2020. The California Low-Carbon Fuel Standard aims to reduce emissions by using lower-carbon biofuels, but some biofuels may have higher emissions than gasoline. The interactions between California's program and the federal Renewable Fuel Standard could be complex. Compliance costs are expected to increase as the program becomes more stringent. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 requires increased fuel economy standards by 2020. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 raised fuel economy standards to 35 mpg by 2020 and changed the structure of the program. The Supreme Court granted the EPA authority to regulate vehicle GHG emissions. This has led to significant changes in federal vehicle regulation, as reducing fuel consumption is key to lowering emissions. The Obama Administration issued joint rules on vehicle fuel economy and GHG emissions for various vehicle types. By 2020, passenger vehicle standards will require a fuel economy of 49.7 mpg, reducing gasoline consumption significantly. EPA estimates heavy-duty vehicle standards will save 530 million barrels of oil. The petroleum refining industry may face challenges due to a significant reduction in gasoline demand from vehicle fuel economy standards. This could impact the overall levels and mix of refined products, with historical industry cycles closely tied to oil price movements. Investments in new equipment may be needed to refine heavier, more sour crudes as international supply shifts towards these types of crude oil. The refining industry faces challenges from government policies aimed at reducing demand for its output, such as higher fuel mileage standards and increased use of renewable fuels. Electric vehicles could further reduce demand for liquid transportation fuels. These policies were intended to address growing demand for refined petroleum products, but combined with declining motor fuel demand, operators may need to idle. The use of renewable fuels may lead to refinery closures, impacting production capacity in the US. Market forces, technological changes, and regulatory pressures are causing some refineries to close while others expand. Larger refineries may dominate the industry, prompting Congress to monitor competitive conditions and consumer prices. Light oil, also known as conventional oil, has specific properties. Heavy oil, with an API gravity of at least 22\u00b0 and viscosity less than 100 cP, is dense and viscous due to its high content of asphaltenes. Extra-heavy oil has an API gravity of less than 10\u00b0. Natural bitumen, even more dense and viscous, has a viscosity greater than 10,000 cP. Sour crude contains sulfur. Natural bitumen is a very viscous crude oil with high asphaltene content, making up to 50% by weight. Asphaltenes, which are aromatic hydrocarbons, have a tendency to self-aggregate, causing processing and refining issues. Refineries used to burn hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as fuel but now convert it to elemental sulfur due to environmental regulations like the Clean Air Act. Natural bitumen is a viscous crude oil with high asphaltene content, causing processing issues in refining. Canada began producing oil-sand bitumen in the 1960s, refining it into \"synthetic crude\" or \"syncrude\". Different companies started producing various types of syncrude blends, such as Suncor Oil Sands Blend A and Syncrude Sweet Blend. Husky Oil produced Husky Sweet Blend (HSB) by upgrading heavy crude with ebullated-bed hydroprocessing and delayed coking technologies. Athabasca Oils Sands Project (AOSP) introduced Premium Albian Synthetic (PAS) in 2003 using ebullated-bed hydroprocessing. DilBit is a blend of bitumen and natural gas condensates for pipeline shipping, with common streams like Cold Lake Blend (CLB) and Bow River (BRH). The blends mentioned include Lloyd blends (LLB, LLK, WCB) and SynBit, a blend of sweet synthetic crude and bitumen. Some producers market \"SynBit\" due to a shortage of natural gas condensate in Northern Alberta. Common SynBits are Christina Lake Blend (CSB) and MacKay Heavy (MKH). Some condensate is separated from SynBits after delivery to the US and shipped back to Alberta by rail car. The curr_chunk discusses the composition of SynDilBits, which are blends of condensate, hydrotreated synthetic crude, and bitumen. These blends typically contain about 65% bitumen, with the remaining volume split between dilutent streams like Wabasca Heavy (WH) and Western Canadian Select (WCS). The refining processes for crude oil are also mentioned, with a focus on the components in the boiling range of gasoline, kerosene/jet fuel, and diesel fuel. Gasoline's molecular weight is based on the number of carbon atoms, ranging from C5 to C10, while middle-distillate fuels like kerosene, jet, and diesel range from C11 to C18. The refining process in a refinery's atmospheric distillation unit separates crude oil into gasoline, kerosene, diesel fuel, and heavier components based on boiling range. Straight-run petroleum fractions condense and separate, while heavier fractions are cracked to produce more gasoline and high-octane aromatics. Other processes like alkylation produce branched chain hydrocarbons in the gasoline range. Refineries are typically set up to run these processes. Refineries process crude oil into gasoline, kerosene, and diesel fuel through various units like catalytic cracking and coking. Light sweet crude is preferred for gasoline refining due to its easier processing, while heavier and sour crudes require more complex processing. Secondary processing units enable refineries to produce high-value products like gasoline from crude oil, but they also increase complexity and require a supply of hydrogen. Refineries require hydrogen, typically derived from natural gas, for secondary processes. The Nelson Complexity Index rates refinery complexity, with U.S. refineries being the most complex globally. European refineries are less complex and focus on diesel fuel production. Distillation units heat crude oil to convert low-value residuum into high-value gasoline. The refining process involves distillation units that heat crude oil to separate it into various fractions such as liquefied petroleum gases, gasoline, kerosene, diesel fuel, and heavier fractions used for heating oil and lubricants. The Fluid Catalytic Cracker process accelerates the conversion of heavy fractions into gasoline molecules, while the Selective Hydrocracker converts diesel-range material into gasoline, propane, and butane. The refining process involves distillation units that separate crude oil into various fractions like liquefied petroleum gases, gasoline, kerosene, diesel fuel, and heavier fractions for heating oil and lubricants. The Selective Hydrocracker converts diesel-range material into gasoline, propane, and butane. Other processes include Alkylation Plant, Catalytic Reforming, Delayed Coker, Gas Oil Hydrotreater, and Gas Plants for gas collection and separation. The refining process involves various processing units like hydrocracker, hydrotreater, reformer, coker, and cat cracker to separate volatiles into different product streams. Refineries in the Gulf Coast region yield up to 8% jet fuel and over 30% diesel, with an average complexity of 12 to 13. Vapor pressure is a crucial property for gasoline, regulated by the EPA during the summer ozone season to reduce evaporative emissions. During the summer ozone season, gasoline with lower Reid vapor pressure is used to reduce emissions contributing to ground-level ozone. Higher octane-number fuels resist engine \"knock\" caused by premature fuel ignition. Iso-octane, with a rating of 100, is a branched isomer in the paraffin series with eight carbons (C 8 H 18). The octane rating of modern gasoline ranges from 87 to 93, achieved by blending various petroleum distillates and adding oxygenates like ethanol. Cetane is used to rate diesel fuel's auto-ignition ease, with pure cetane receiving a rating of 100. Diesel fuel cetane-number ranges from 40 to 45 in the US and up to 55 in Europe. Diesel fuel formulation blends straight-run cut distillates with cracked stock to meet standardized specifications by ASTM International and EPA. EPA regulates diesel fuel sulfur content to be less than 15 ppm, known as ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD). Sulfur contributes to fuel lubricity, but under reduced sulfur, engines wear out sooner. Fuel can be blended with additives to compensate for reduced sulfur levels. The transition from low-sulfur diesel to ultra-low-sulfur diesel has led to a decrease in sulfur content in gasoline. Diesel engines emit lower CO and CO2 but higher NOx and PM compared to gasoline engines, regulated by the Clean Air Act. Diesel fuel can be blended with additives to compensate for reduced sulfur levels, which can cause engines to wear out sooner. Motor gasoline is a volatile hydrocarbon mixture used in spark-ignition engines, regulated by the Clean Air Act. It includes conventional gasoline, oxygenated gasoline, and reformulated gasoline, but excludes aviation gasoline. Blending components like oxygenates are not counted until blended into the gasoline. E85 is only included in volumetric data on finished motor gasoline production. Motor gasoline production includes conventional gasoline and reformulated gasoline meeting EPA regulations. Excludes blendstock and aviation gasoline. Oxygenated Fuels Program Reformulated Gasoline is included in the reformulated gasoline category. The Oxygenated Fuels Program Reformulated Gasoline (OPRG) includes specially produced blendstock for blending with oxygenates downstream of the refinery. It excludes conventional gasoline blendstocks for oxygenate blending and is intended to meet emissions performance requirements. RBOB for Blending with Alcohol refers to motor gasoline components blended with alcohol like fuel ethanol to raise oxygen content. Fuel Ethanol (E10) is a blend of up to 10% anhydrous ethanol in gasoline. The refinery raises the oxygen content by blending up to 10% anhydrous ethanol (200 proof) in gasoline, known as \"gasohol\"."
