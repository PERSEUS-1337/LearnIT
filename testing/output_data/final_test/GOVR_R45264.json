    "content": "The National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecasts tropical cyclones, including hurricanes in the Atlantic and eastern Pacific Ocean. They provide estimates of the storm's path, intensity, size, structure, storm surge, rainfall, and tornado predictions. This information is used to issue hurricane watches, warnings, and public advisories as storms approach the U.S. coastline. The NHC coordinates various NOAA and NWS resources for hurricane forecasting, starting with observations from satellites, aircraft, ships, buoys, radar, and other sources. The NHC utilizes various sources such as satellites, aircraft, ships, buoys, and radar to create storm-track and intensity predictions for Atlantic hurricanes. NOAA weather satellites, including GOES East and GOES West, provide remote-sensing observations during the early stages of tropical storm development in the eastern Atlantic. NOAA hurricane aircraft and U.S. Air Force aircraft, known as Hurricane Hunters, fly directly into storms if they pose a threat to the U.S. coastline. The Chief, Aerial Reconnaissance Coordination, All Hurricanes (CARCAH) unit coordinates tropical cyclone reconnaissance operations for the National Hurricane Operations Plan (NHOP). Data from Hurricane Hunters and other aircraft are checked at CARCAH and provided to NHC forecasters. Land-based radars provide data when the storm is approximately 280 miles from the coast. Additional measurements are provided by Automated Surface Observation Systems instruments when the storm is close to shore or makes landfall. The NHC uses observational data to generate hurricane forecast computer models as a storm approaches the U.S. coastline. The NHC uses observational data to generate hurricane forecast computer models for the U.S. coastline. These models predict the hurricane track and intensity over a period of three to five days. Different hurricane forecast models may vary in how they process information, leading to differences in forecasts between countries and institutions. The National Hurricane Center produces Atlantic hurricane forecasts, focusing on hurricane track and intensity. Forecast accuracy has improved since the 1960s, with track errors reduced by half since the 1990s. Forecasts now extend out to five days, providing valuable information for emergency managers. Improved hurricane intensity forecasts have seen significant advancements in recent years, with errors reduced to about 15 knots (17 mph) between 72 and 120 hours. This marks the largest incremental improvement since the 1970s, corresponding to a difference of one hurricane category on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. The National Hurricane Center advises preparing for a storm one category stronger than the forecast. The Hurricane Specialist Unit (HSU), Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch (TAFB), and Hurricane Liaison Team (HLT) are key components in the hurricane forecast process. The HSU issues official public forecasts every six hours and collaborates with other countries' meteorological services. The TAFB provides cyclone position estimates and supports the HSU, while the HLT assists in operations and is sponsored by the Federal Emergency Management. The Hurricane Liaison Team (HLT) is activated by FEMA before hurricane season and remains active throughout. It serves as a liaison between NHC forecasters and local emergency managers during tropical cyclone threats, communicating threat levels to officials. Evacuation decisions are the responsibility of state or local authorities. The NWS has statutory authority for weather forecasting and storm warnings, which are coordinated between national centers and local forecast offices. Local NWS offices use NHC forecasts to create their own, taking into account local conditions. Forecast models predict storm surge, an abnormal rise in sea level during intense storms. The storm surge, combined with high precipitation from hurricanes, can create dangerous flood conditions for coastal communities during tropical cyclones. Superstorm Sandy inundated the heavily populated coastline in New Jersey and New York, causing enormous damage. The Storm Surge Unit of the NHC models and predicts storm-surge vulnerability over various coastal areas. The Storm Surge Unit of the NHC operates over U.S. Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands during hurricanes. The NHC faces challenges in predicting hurricane intensity and the potential impact of storm surge and precipitation-caused flooding, which can be the most dangerous elements of a hurricane. Flooding from high rainfall events during hurricanes can cause the majority of storm-related fatalities. The amount of rainfall from a storm may not be related to its intensity. Record levels of precipitation and flooding during Hurricane Harvey continued after it was downgraded. Improving rainfall forecasting would enhance hurricane forecasting. NOAA releases its hurricane season outlook before June 1 each year. In 2017, actual hurricanes slightly exceeded NOAA's forecast. Three major hurricanes caused severe damage in 2017: Harvey, Irma, and. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria caused severe damage in 2017. Track forecasts were better than the previous five-year average, but intensity forecasts were less accurate. Hurricane Harvey made landfall as a category 4 storm, bringing record-breaking rainfall to the United States. Hurricane Harvey in 2017 brought record-breaking rainfall to the United States, with over 60 inches reported near Nederland, TX. The storm caused extensive flooding in southeastern Texas, with some areas receiving 3 feet or more of rainfall. The slow-moving nature of Harvey contributed to its extreme rainfall, as it made a loop before moving offshore again. Hurricane Harvey in 2017 brought record-breaking rainfall to southeastern Texas, causing widespread flooding and resulting in the deadliest U.S. hurricane in terms of direct deaths since Superstorm Sandy in 2012. The storm formed as a tropical depression in the Atlantic Ocean and dissipated over the Tennessee Valley, with NOAA estimating approximately $125 billion in damages. Hurricane Harvey formed as a tropical depression east of the Caribbean islands on August 17, 2017, re-formed as a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico, and had a well-forecast re-formation according to the NHC. The NHC's track forecast for Harvey was better than average, with lower forecast errors compared to the previous five-year period. The accuracy of the official NHC forecast for Hurricane Harvey's intensity was mixed compared to the previous five-year average forecasts. The intensity forecasts for Harvey were better than the average after 48 hours, but the cyclone weakened faster than expected between the 36- and 48-hour intervals. The NHC correctly forecasted that Harvey would remain a weak cyclone in the long-range forecasts. The NHC reported that the rapid intensification of Hurricane Harvey was not well-anticipated, but most guidance had it near hurricane intensity before landfall in Texas. Rainfall forecasts for Harvey were the highest on record, with initial predictions of 20 inches increasing to 50 inches before the storm exited Texas. Hurricane Irma made landfall in Florida as a category 4 hurricane, then weakened to a tropical storm. It had previously reached category 5 strength while impacting Caribbean islands before dissipating over Alabama on September 12. Hurricane Irma did not directly hit Puerto Rico or the US Virgin Islands, but the storm's high winds, rainfall, and storm surge caused significant destruction on the islands of St. Thomas and St. John. Widespread damage was reported, including collapsed fire and police stations, damaged hospitals, and nearly 70% of structures on St. Croix being damaged. The storm resulted in three direct deaths in the USVI and three indirect deaths in Puerto Rico, along with power outages and minor damage to homes and businesses. Other Caribbean islands that were directly hit by Irma experienced near-complete destruction from its category 5-strength winds, rain, and storm surge. Hurricane Irma rapidly intensified, reaching major hurricane force two days after formation and maintaining strength for nearly 11 days. It sustained category 5 intensity for 60 hours, with rare wind speed increases. Irma's repeated landfalls and large wind field caused widespread destruction along its path. Hurricane Irma caused significant storm surge flooding in the southeastern United States, leading to seven direct deaths. The storm's broad wind field and heavy rainfall resulted in flooding along the St. Johns River in Florida. Despite making landfall in southwestern Florida, Irma's impact was felt along the northeastern coast. The official track forecast errors for Irma were lower than the average for the previous five years. Hurricane Maria, the second category 5 hurricane of 2017, became the deadliest storm and worst natural disaster in Puerto Rico's history. It formed rapidly, reaching category 5 intensity with maximum wind speeds of 175 mph over the eastern Caribbean. Hurricane Maria reached category 4 intensity after making landfall on Dominica and then struck Puerto Rico with winds just below category 5 strength. The storm caused significant damage to the US Virgin Islands, particularly St. Croix, before moving offshore into the Atlantic Ocean. Maria never made landfall in the continental United States, dissipating in the Atlantic Ocean on September 30. Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico on September 30, 2017, incapacitating the central electric power system and leaving the entire island without power. The official death toll is 65, but higher unofficial numbers are being debated. NOAA estimated $90 billion in damage, making Maria the costliest hurricane in modern times for the island. Hurricane Maria was the third-costliest hurricane in U.S. history, causing 31 direct deaths in Dominica and significant damage to structures. Forecast models failed to predict its genesis accurately, but track forecasts had fewer errors compared to previous years. Intensity forecasts for Maria varied, with higher errors in the first 48 hours but lower errors in later intervals. According to NOAA, forecast models underestimated Hurricane Maria's rapid intensification on September 18. However, NHC forecasts accurately predicted the storm reaching major hurricane intensity before hitting Puerto Rico, providing 54 hours of advance warning. The Climate Prediction Center's outlook for the 2018 Atlantic Hurricane Season initially predicted 10-16 named storms, 5-9 hurricanes, and 1-4 major hurricanes, with an updated forecast on August 9 indicating a 60% chance of a below-normal season. The August CPC prediction indicates a 60% chance of a below-normal hurricane season, based on climate factors and models. The outlook for the 2018 season has been revised due to cool sea surface temperatures and the potential development of El Ni\u00f1o. The CPC predicts a less active Atlantic hurricane season with factors like where storms form, potential El Ni\u00f1o development, and unfavorable atmospheric circulation patterns. Most activity is expected from August to October, with NOAA issuing updates in August. NOAA does not forecast hurricane landfalls or activity levels in specific regions. Landfalls are mainly influenced by weather patterns. NOAA urges preparation for hurricane season regardless of seasonal outlook. Congress enacted Weather Act to improve hurricane forecasting, focusing on rapid intensification, storm surge prediction, and risk communication research. At a hearing before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, the acting NOAA Administrator praised the improved hurricane forecasts for the 2017 season. However, stakeholders highlighted the need for even better forecasts, citing challenges in predicting the track of hurricanes like Irma and Joaquin. Congress continues to focus on improving hurricane forecasting through the Weather Act. The Weather Act requires NOAA to improve hurricane forecasting through various measures, including experiments to assess observing systems and acquiring backup capabilities for Hurricane Hunter aircraft. Witnesses at a July 18, 2018 hearing focused on recovery activities from the 2017 hurricane season and preparedness for 2018. Congress is likely to maintain interest in federal hurricane forecast abilities every year due to the annual threat hurricanes pose to populated coastal regions of the United States."
