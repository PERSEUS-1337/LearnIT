    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Chapter 13 of Division 26.7 of the Water Code introduces additional funding opportunities to address watershed-related infrastructure challenges in California's disadvantaged communities. The legislation aims to promote projects that address physical blight and deficiencies, as well as fund urban greening projects independently. \"Disadvantaged community\" is defined as a community with significant population densities, industrial facilities, and trade corridor activity. The Disadvantaged Community Enhancement Act of 2015 aims to provide funding for infrastructure challenges in California's most disadvantaged communities. It defines terms like \"distressed watershed\" and \"active transportation program\" to support projects addressing physical blight and deficiencies. The Disadvantaged Community Enhancement Program, established by the Strategic Growth Council, awards grants to disadvantaged communities for community enhancement projects that provide environmental benefits. Eligible applicants include cities, counties, special districts, Native American tribes, and nonprofit organizations. The Disadvantaged Community Enhancement Program awards grants for community enhancement projects in disadvantaged communities. Eligible improvements include urban greening, park development, hardscape conversions, nonmotorized trails, heat island mitigation, and sustainable community planning. Grants are awarded through a competitive process, prioritizing communities with high poverty, unemployment, childhood obesity, and asthma rates. The Disadvantaged Community Enhancement Program awards grants for community enhancement projects in disadvantaged areas, prioritizing those with high poverty, unemployment, childhood obesity, asthma rates, and environmental benefits such as water quality improvement, stormwater capture, and groundwater remediation. Priority is given to projects in distressed watershed areas with industrial facilities and trade corridor activity. To apply for a grant under the Disadvantaged Community Enhancement Program, eligible applicants must submit an application with details on how the grant will address specified factors and environmental benefits. They must also explain how other funding sources will be leveraged for community enhancement. Awards from this program should not replace funding intended for disadvantaged communities."
