The Ponemon Institute found that the number of attacks and their costs have been increasing. The global economy loses about $445 billion annually to cybercrime. The risks to critical infrastructure and national security are significant, with concerns about the ability to guard against cyberattacks. President Obama and Congress are focusing on increasing cybersecurity. President Obama and some Members of Congress prioritize increasing cybersecurity. Companies could enhance cybersecurity by sharing information about cyberattacks at a cost of less than $100,000. Misaligned incentives hinder information sharing. After a cyberattack, notifying law enforcement, other companies, customers, and stockholders is essential. Regulated companies like banks and utilities may be required to inform regulators of cyberattacks. The report analyzes information sharing between government and private companies, among private companies, and with consumers in cybersecurity. Companies notify law enforcement, other companies, and customers after cyberattacks to improve security and prevent financial fraud. The SEC requires publicly traded companies to disclose information that could impact investors' decisions. Understanding economic incentives in cybersecurity can enhance analysis of information sharing. Companies that suffer cybersecurity breaches do not bear the full cost as retailers face chargebacks for stolen credit card transactions. Credit card issuers are not fully compensated for replacing stolen cards, leading consumers to monitor their accounts against cyberattacks. Software companies balance security delays with release costs, sometimes prioritizing quick releases over bug fixes. Companies may prioritize market share or profitability over cybersecurity measures. Many in the cybersecurity field suggest increasing information sharing between individuals, companies, and governments to improve security. Sharing specific attack detection methods and recovery procedures can be beneficial. Legislation has been introduced to promote this critical aspect of cybersecurity. Information sharing in cybersecurity is crucial for organizations to learn about breaches and seek assistance. For example, the Secret Service notified Target and Home Depot of data breaches, while JPMorgan asked the FBI for help with cybersecurity issues. Sharing information can help law enforcement track down attackers and alert other organizations to prevent similar attacks. Broader information sharing can benefit attacked firms by allowing for the development of countermeasures by external entities. Sharing cybersecurity information with competitors can be risky as it may reveal security lessons learned at great expense. Publicly disclosing a cyber breach can lead to customer loss, revenue decline, and stock price decreases. Companies in many states are required to notify consumers of breaches, offering assistance like credit monitoring. Some argue that public disclosure can alert attackers or waste time. Urban Outfitters and others argue that public disclosure of cyber breaches can alert attackers or be a waste of time if information is breached but not stolen. There is a lack of optimal information sharing about attacks, which can lead to harm that is hard to measure. While sharing information can be challenging, it has been shown to increase security. Despite the benefits, most details about breaches are released by third-party experts rather than the companies involved. This reluctance to share information is analyzed in the next section. The reluctance of firms and industry groups to share cybersecurity information is due to concerns about privacy, antitrust laws, and exposing proprietary business information. The Department of Justice has provided guidance to alleviate these fears, stating that cybersecurity information sharing is not considered anticompetitive. However, there are still concerns that firms are withholding information that could enhance cybersecurity. Sharing information about cybersecurity attacks and defenses could lead to faster breach detection and reduced damage. Some organizations are hesitant to share cybersecurity information due to legal and competitive concerns. There are worries about privacy, antitrust issues, and the risk of free-riding. Public disclosure of breaches could lead to customer loss and stock price impact. These fears may be exaggerated but still hinder information sharing efforts. The Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC) Council highlighted the challenges of sharing cybersecurity information to the Government Accountability Office (GAO). A survey of IT executives revealed that the main concern regarding data breaches is the loss of consumer confidence and revenue decline. Companies may be reluctant to share cybersecurity information due to the difficulty in discerning benefits, while the risks and costs are more apparent. Firms may choose not to share cybersecurity information, leading to potential outcomes based on threat significance. If the threat is minor, firms may not develop countermeasures or share information. Significant threats may prompt custom countermeasure development. Financial incentives may influence countermeasure adoption. If a firm cannot obtain a countermeasure, it may hesitate to share threat information due to financial incentives and competition. Industries with similar products benefit from sharing information but may be reluctant due to competition. Strong industry associations could help overcome this. Firms must weigh the competitive advantage of a countermeasure against selling or sharing it. Some firms in the defense industry also offer cybersecurity services. Some firms in the defense industry offer cybersecurity services, while others in industries like water treatment may not. Organizations may choose not to share information to maintain a competitive advantage. However, some firms may share information to cultivate a good corporate reputation or prioritize national security and economic growth over immediate economic incentives. When organizations face a data breach, they often bring in outside experts to investigate and remediate the breach. The consultants negotiate contract terms with the organization, keeping the details confidential. These experts may use their knowledge from previous breaches to assist other companies. Cyberinsurance companies assess clients' cybersecurity practices and may conduct or monitor investigations after a breach to gather technical information for prevention. Organizations share detailed information on breaches to prevent future incidents. Legislation in the 113th Congress encourages information sharing about new threats, best practices, and attack effects. Certain information can be shared automatically, such as malware detection alerts. Target's 2013 data breach, which exposed over 40 million payment card details, highlighted the importance of information sharing. Target's security breach resulted in the theft of 40 million payment card details. Despite having a security system in place to isolate new malware, the security team disabled the function to delete malware automatically. This decision was deemed normal by a chief information security officer, highlighting the challenges of machine autonomy in identifying sensitive information. Effective machine-to-machine sharing requires high levels of trust between firms. To facilitate sharing, firms need high trust levels and technical expertise. Information sharing occurs within private and public sectors, as well as between them. Government contractors, especially those working with the Department of Defense, have strict information sharing requirements. Critical infrastructure industries rely on Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) for sharing critical information. Presidential Decision Directive 63 in 1998 authorized the creation of ISACs to enhance critical infrastructure protection. ISACs are private-sector entities that collect, analyze, and share cybersecurity information. They facilitate communication between members and the government, especially in emergency situations. Various sectors have their own ISACs, like the Defense Industrial Base ISAC and the Retail ISAC. The Multi-State ISAC covers all 50 states and territories. The Food ISAC, classified as critical infrastructure, ceased operations due to a lack of information sharing. The sector ISAC, managed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, includes almost all electricity providers as members. Membership in ISACs is voluntary and varies in participation levels. The FS-ISAC offers different membership tiers, with costs ranging from free to $49,950 annually. Participation rates differ among firms, with the FS-ISAC aiding members in combating cybersecurity issues like denial-of-service attacks. The FS-ISAC assists members in combating cybersecurity issues like denial-of-service attacks. The IT-ISAC has 33 members, including large cybersecurity vendors. However, many major IT companies like Google and Facebook are not members. ISACs cannot prevent free-riding, which may discourage information sharing. The SEC requires publicly traded companies to disclose \"material information,\" including cybersecurity risks and incidents. The Supreme Court defines material information as having a significant impact on investors. One challenge is determining how quickly to announce information, as cybersecurity breaches may require extensive investigation. The DOD mandates that contractors share information on security breaches. Some experts advocate mandatory sharing of cybersecurity information to prevent breaches, citing that third parties discover 75% of data breaches. Others prefer a voluntary approach to reduce regulatory costs on businesses. Inadequate information sharing can lead to suboptimal security and duplication of work. Sharing information, with or without cost, could potentially result in cost savings. Cybersecurity products market can suffer from information differences between buyers and sellers, leading to lower market quality. This concept is similar to the \"market for lemons\" theory by George Akerlof, where buyers struggle to assess product value accurately. Sellers may overstate product quality, making it challenging for sellers of better products to sell at their true value. The cybersecurity products market faces challenges due to information asymmetries between buyers and sellers, leading to lower market quality. Sharing more information could increase market size and quality, reduce duplication of effort, and enhance cybersecurity investment. Currently, clear metrics of effectiveness and objective, trusted, third-party evaluation services are lacking in the cybersecurity market. Information sharing is most beneficial when organizations use similar technologies, as it can help identify weaknesses specific to their systems. However, there is a concern that erroneous information could create new security vulnerabilities. The reputation of those providing information can help ensure its reliability. The Federal Trade Commission's authority to sue is a key enforcement mechanism for cybersecurity. The Federal Trade Commission's authority to sue companies for deceptive cybersecurity practices is a key enforcement mechanism. Greater information sharing could help companies implement uniform security practices, but it may also overwhelm with irrelevant information. ISACs can help analyze and prioritize relevant information for their members. Greater information sharing can boost the $1.3 billion cyberinsurance market by improving risk assessment and security product effectiveness. Insurers play a role in promoting safer practices and verifying systems, potentially making cyberspace more secure. However, cyberinsurance may have limited utility for intangible losses like reputation damage. Two bills in the 114th Congress could impact organizations' willingness to share cybersecurity information. On April 22, 2015, the House passed H.R. 1560, Protecting Cyber Networks Act (PCNA), and on April 23, 2015, it passed H.R. 1731, National Cybersecurity Protection Advancement Act of 2015 (NCPA). House-passed H.R. 1560 became Title I of the bill sent to the Senate, and House-passed H.R. 1731 became Title II. This report briefly discusses a possible conflict in the various provisions of H.R. 1560 and H.R. 1731 regarding cybersecurity information sharing. H.R. 1560 authorizes voluntary cybersecurity information sharing between the federal government and nonfederal entities, preempting any laws requiring disclosure. It includes provisions for small business assistance in cybersecurity information sharing. H.R. 1560 allows institutions to share cybersecurity information without facing legal action, with exceptions for willful misconduct. It amends the National Security Act of 1947 and the Homeland Security Act of 2002, assigning different roles to the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence reported out S. 754, Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA), which authorizes voluntary information sharing between the federal government and nonfederal entities. The legislation aims to prevent the government from requiring cybersecurity information in exchange for sharing information and ensures information sharing without compromising security, privacy, and civil liberties. S. 754 assigns lead responsibility for federal government information sharing to the Director of National Intelligence. It allows nonfederal entities to share cybersecurity information without facing legal action, except in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct. The bill also permits nonfederal entities to share information without violating antitrust laws. Both H.R. 1560 and S. 754 aim to encourage information sharing, with differences in the allocation of certain responsibilities within the federal government. They both facilitate information sharing between federal and nonfederal entities, protecting shared information from disclosure under FOIA and similar laws. The proposed bills, H.R. 1560 and S. 754, aim to increase cybersecurity information sharing by providing protection against legal action and antitrust laws. They limit the use of shared information to cybersecurity and specified serious crimes. Nonfederal entities may be cautious and wait to see how the provisions are applied before participating in information sharing programs. The federal government cannot restrict participation to only those sharing information with them. The bills H.R. 1560 and S. 754 aim to enhance cybersecurity by promoting information sharing without increasing costs significantly. They focus on increasing the impact of shared information and potentially fostering informal sharing networks. Some cybersecurity companies already share real-time information with clients, but the key consideration for nonfederal entities, especially businesses, will be weighing the benefits of sharing information against the associated costs. The bills H.R. 1560 and S. 754 aim to enhance cybersecurity by promoting information sharing without increasing costs significantly. Businesses must weigh the benefits of sharing information against the cost of membership in ISAOs or ISACs, which can be too expensive for small- and medium-size businesses. Recent events, such as the resignations of CEOs at Target and Sony Entertainment, may change attitudes towards data breaches."
