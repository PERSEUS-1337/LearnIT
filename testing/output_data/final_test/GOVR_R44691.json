    "content": "This report provides an overview of FY2017 appropriations actions for accounts traditionally funded in the LHHS bill, which includes discretionary and mandatory appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, as well as related agencies like the Social Security Administration. The LHHS bill is a significant source of discretionary funds for domestic non-defense federal programs. The LHHS bill is a major source of discretionary funds for domestic non-defense federal programs. It is one of the more controversial appropriations bills due to its funding size and program scope, addressing policy issues like restrictions on federal funds for abortion and research on human embryos and stem cells. Congressional clients can refer to the LHHS experts list in CRS Report R42638 for information on specific agencies and programs funded in the bill. The LHHS bill is a significant source of discretionary funds for domestic non-defense federal programs, addressing controversial policy issues. The report provides an overview of major congressional actions on FY2017 appropriations, a comparison of proposed and enacted funding levels for FY2017 and FY2016, and highlights for each major title of the bill. Additionally, an Appendix summarizes budget enforcement activities for FY2017, including information on the Budget Control Act of 2011 and sequestration. This report focuses on appropriations for agencies under the jurisdiction of the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies subcommittees. It excludes funding for agencies funded by other subcommittees. The LHHS bill provides funding for the Department of Labor and most agencies at the Department of Health and Human Services. The curr_chunk discusses funding for various agencies including the Indian Health Service, Department of Education, and related agencies. It notes that funding totals in the report do not include amounts provided outside of the annual appropriations process. Certain direct spending programs receive funding directly from their authorizing statutes and are not reflected in the report's totals. The LHHS bill includes discretionary and mandatory budget authority, with only a portion of mandatory spending provided in appropriations measures. Appropriated entitlements are mandatory programs funded through the annual appropriations process, where authorizing statutes control program parameters. If Congress fails to appropriate necessary funds, entitled recipients may have legal recourse. Most mandatory spending is provided through budget authority from the program's authorizing statute. The funding amounts in this report only include funds provided through appropriations acts, not outside sources. Mandatory amounts for the Obama Administration's budget submission reflect current-law estimates and do not include proposed changes to authorizing statutes that might affect total spending. The report focuses on discretionary funding, which receives more attention during the appropriations process. Sequestration involves across-the-board reductions in discretionary or mandatory spending, with different triggers and processes for each type. Budget authority is the amount of money a federal agency is authorized to commit. The report explains budget authority for federal agencies, including current-year appropriations and advance appropriations. Appropriations bills can provide budget authority for the current fiscal year or future years. The report also discusses how current-year budget authority is measured against 302(b) allocation ceilings during the appropriations process. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31) was signed into law by President Trump on May 5, 2017, providing full-year appropriations for 11 out of 12 annual appropriations subcommittees. The appropriations process involves measuring budget authority against 302(b) allocation ceilings, with scorekeeping adjustments made by the Congressional Budget Office. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31) was signed into law by President Trump on May 5, 2017, providing full-year appropriations for 11 out of 12 annual appropriations subcommittees. The bill included regular, full-year appropriations for LHHS (Division H), totaling $934.0 billion for FY2017, with discretionary appropriations at $173.3 billion, a 1.8% increase from FY2016 levels. The FY2017 LHHS appropriations were not enacted before the start of the fiscal year. Temporary funding was provided by three continuing resolutions. Discretionary programs were generally funded at FY2016 levels with slight reductions under the CRs. Mandatory programs were continued at current law levels. The second CR included new HHS appropriations for activities authorized by the 21st Century Cures Act. The FY2017 LHHS appropriations were provided through temporary funding by three continuing resolutions. New HHS appropriations were included for activities authorized by the 21st Century Cures Act and the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act. These funds were distributed for various purposes, including grants for state responses to opioid abuse, innovation projects at the National Institutes of Health, and specified programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. $35 million allocated for the HHS Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under the WIIN Act for childhood lead poisoning prevention, a voluntary registry of lead-exposed individuals, and an advisory committee. $15 million for the HHS Healthy Start program for health care services to reduce infant mortality rates and address family, maternal, and child health. The House Appropriations Committee's version of the FY2017 LHHS appropriations bill, R44653, was approved with $170.2 billion in discretionary funds, 1.3% less than the President's request. The Senate Appropriations Committee also reported their version of the bill with $760.6 billion in mandatory funding, totaling $930.9 billion for LHHS. The LHHS subcommittee previously reported a bill with $171.6 billion in discretionary funds, slightly less than the President's request. The bill also included $760.6 billion in mandatory funding, totaling $932.2 billion for LHHS. President Obama's FY2017 budget requested $172.5 billion in discretionary funding and roughly $760.6 billion in mandatory funding for a total of $933.1 billion for LHHS. Obama signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 into law, providing $170.2 billion in discretionary funding for LHHS, which was $6.0 billion more than FY2015 levels. Additionally, $718.2 billion in mandatory LHHS funding was allocated, totaling $888.4 billion for LHHS. In September 2016, $1.1 billion in emergency funding for Zika response efforts was enacted. The Zika supplemental provided $1.1 billion in emergency appropriations, with $933 million allocated to HHS. The FY2016 budget totals in this report do not include these emergency appropriations. Table 2 displays FY2017 LHHS budget authority by bill title, along with FY2016 levels. Figure 2 shows the FY2017 enacted LHHS budget authority. In FY2017, HHS received the largest share of LHHS appropriations at $780.2 billion, accounting for 83.5% of the total funding. ED and Related Agencies followed with 7.7% and 7.3% respectively. The majority of HHS funding is mandatory, mainly for Medicaid grants and health care trust funds. In FY2017, HHS received the largest share of LHHS appropriations at $780.2 billion, accounting for 83.5% of the total funding. ED and Related Agencies followed with 7.7% and 7.3% respectively. The bulk of HHS funding is mandatory, mainly for Medicaid grants and health care trust funds. When looking at discretionary appropriations, HHS accounted for a comparatively smaller share, while ED accounted for a relatively larger share. Together, these two departments represented the majority of discretionary LHHS appropriations. The Department of Labor (DOL) is a federal department that provides services related to employment, training, worker protection, income security, and contract enforcement. Annual LHHS appropriations laws direct funding to all DOL entities. The DOL entities primarily focus on two main functional areas. The Department of Labor (DOL) administers workforce development and worker protection programs, including the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) and the Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS). Worker protection services are provided by agencies like OSHA, MSHA, and WHD. The Department of Labor (DOL) oversees workforce development and worker protection programs through agencies like OSHA, MSHA, and WHD. The DOL's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) collects data on the labor market. In FY2017, DOL's discretionary appropriations decreased by 0.7%, contrary to the proposed increase of 5.2% in the Obama Administration's budget request. In FY2017, the Department of Labor's discretionary spending decreased by 0.7%, in contrast to the proposed 5.2% increase. The omnibus bill provided funding for DOL programs, including the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) which authorizes grants for workforce development programs. In FY2017, funding levels for the three WIOA state formula grants remained the same as FY2016 in the omnibus bill. The House committee bill proposed a $20 million increase (+0.7%), while the Senate committee bill suggested a $74 million decrease (-2.7%). The Obama Administration's budget proposed a $138 million increase (+5.1%). The Dislocated Workers Activities National Reserve funding stayed at $221 million, with the President's budget proposing a $10 million increase (+4.5%). The FY2017 House committee bill proposed decreasing funding for the DWA National Reserve from $221 million to $120 million (-45.7%). The committee recommended eliminating the advance appropriation for FY2018 and rescinding the advance provided in FY2016. The FY2017 omnibus directed $20 million of the DWA National Reserve for reemployment and training for workers dislocated from coal mines and coal-fired power plants. The FY2017 omnibus provided $95 million for the Apprenticeship Grant program, with differing funding amounts proposed in the FY2017 President's budget and Senate committee bill. The FY2017 House committee bill did not allocate any funding for the program. Additionally, $400 million was provided for the Community Service Employment for Older Americans program in the FY2017 omnibus, which was the same as proposed in the FY2017 Senate committee bill. The FY2017 omnibus provided $86 million for ILAB, the same as in FY2016. The FY2017 President's budget and Senate committee bill proposed increases of $15 million and $5 million, respectively. However, the FY2017 House committee bill suggested a $54 million decrease for ILAB, aiming to eliminate new international grants. The FY2017 omnibus included provisions related to labor issues, such as accepting private wage surveys for determining prevailing wages in the H-2B program. This program allows temporary employment of foreign workers in non-agricultural sectors, with wages based on local averages. Private surveys can be used if certain criteria are met. The FY2017 omnibus continued provisions related to labor issues, including the selection of an entity to operate a Civilian Conservation Center based on performance, and exempting insurance claims adjusters from overtime protection after a major disaster. Amounts mentioned are based on regular LHHS appropriations only. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) receives funding through annual LHHS appropriations laws, which allocate funds to most HHS agencies. HHS is a large federal department working to improve the health and well-being of Americans. The FY2016 column includes certain adjustments for comparability, while dollar and percentage changes are based on unrounded amounts. Amounts in this section are rounded to the nearest million or billion. The LHHS bill directs funding to five Public Health Service agencies: HRSA, CDC, NIH, SAMHSA, and AHRQ. These agencies support various missions such as healthcare services, medical research, and disease prevention. Additionally, the LHHS bill provides funding for components of CMS, responsible for Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP administration. The LHHS bill provides funding for the administration of Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, consumer protections, and private health insurance provisions of the ACA. It also funds HHS agencies like ACF and ACL, which focus on social services for vulnerable populations. ACL aims to increase access to community supports for older Americans and people with disabilities. The LHHS bill provides funding for various HHS agencies and programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and ACA provisions. Discretionary appropriations for HHS increased by 1.2% under the FY2017 omnibus, a smaller increase than proposed by House and Senate committee bills. The Obama Administration requested a 0.9% decrease in discretionary HHS funding for FY2017. The Obama Administration requested new mandatory funding totaling $1.825 billion for NIH and $590 million for SAMHSA, which would require legislative action outside the annual appropriations process. Additional funding was requested for HHS agencies not reflected in the following tables. Annual HHS appropriations are dominated by mandatory funding, with the majority going to CMS for Medicaid benefits and health care trust funds. In FY2017, CMS received $690.8 billion in funding, accounting for 89% of all HHS appropriations. ACF and NIH received about 4% each. Discretionary funding for CMS constituted only 6% of HHS appropriations, with PHS agencies receiving 63%. NIH received 43% of discretionary funding, while ACF received 25%. The LHHS appropriations in recent years have utilized additional funding mechanisms like the Public Health Service (PHS) Evaluation Set-Aside and the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) to support specific programs. The PHS Evaluation Set-Aside, authorized by the Public Health Service Act, allows for the redistribution of a portion of eligible PHS agency appropriations across HHS for program evaluation purposes. The set-aside is limited by the PHSA but LHHS appropriations acts have often established a higher maximum percentage and allocated \"tap\" funding to selected HHS programs. The FY2017 omnibus maintained the maximum set-aside level at 2.5% of eligible appropriations, with the Obama Administration's proposal to increase it to 3.0% being rejected. The PHS tap now provides funding to only about half a dozen programs within three HHS agencies, compared to more programs in previous years. The FY2017 omnibus maintained the PHS tap funding for a limited number of programs within three HHS agencies, with a shift in funding emphasis towards NIH, which went from being a net donor to a net recipient of tap funds. The FY2017 omnibus increased NIH tap funds by $44 million, making it a net recipient. Tables in the report only show PHS Evaluation Tap funds received by agencies. The ACA authorized funding for trust funds to support PHS agencies, including the Prevention and Public Health Fund. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) was initially appropriated $2 billion for FY2017, but subsequent legislation reduced this amount. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 and the 21st Century Cures Act further decreased PPHF appropriations. PPHF funds are meant to supplement regular appropriations for public health programs and support new programs authorized by the ACA. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) funds are used to supplement regular appropriations for public health programs and support new programs authorized by the ACA. The distribution of PPHF funds is determined by the HHS Secretary, with the CDC commonly receiving the largest share. Provisions in annual appropriations acts have directed the distribution of PPHF funds since FY2014. The Senate committee bill proposed increasing PPHF funds received by CDC to $908 million (+1.8%), while the House committee bill and the Obama Administration requested $944 million (+5.8%). The amounts shown for PPHF transfers in HHS tables reflect estimated effects of mandatory spending sequestration. The discussion compares FY2017 enacted levels with FY2016 and various proposals from House and Senate committee bills and the President's budget. The FY2017 omnibus provided $286 million for Title X Family Planning, the same as FY2016, but $14 million less than the FY2017 Obama Administration request. The House committee bill proposed eliminating funding for Title X of the PHSA and prohibiting the use of HHS funds for Title X. The Senate committee bill proposed increasing PPHF funds received by CDC to $908 million, while the House committee bill and the Obama Administration requested $944 million. The FY2017 appropriations for the Healthy Start program totaled $119 million, a $15 million increase from FY2016. The funds include $104 million from the FY2017 omnibus and $15 million from the second FY2017 CR, available until September 30, 2018. These funds are directed towards health care services to reduce infant mortality rates, address family, maternal, and child health, and mitigate the health effects of lead exposure in Flint, MI. The FY2017 omnibus directed funds for opioid-related and mental health treatment through the health center program. It also encouraged medical schools to enhance training in pain management, substance abuse, and mental health services. CDC's discretionary appropriations for FY2017 totaled $6.3 billion, $23 million more than FY2016. Additionally, $891 million in PPHF transfers were directed to the CDC. No PHS tap funds were directed to the CDC in FY2017. In FY2017, the CDC did not receive any PHS tap funds, continuing the practice from FY2015. The FY2017 omnibus provided additional funding for Injury Prevention and Control (+21.2%) to address the opioid crisis, while Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion saw a decrease (-7.2%). Environmental Health received $164 million in discretionary appropriations, slightly less than FY2016, with $17 million in PPHF transfers. This funding was in addition to $35 million previously appropriated in the second FY2017 CR. The FY2017 omnibus provided full-year funds for activities under the WIIN Act related to lead poisoning prevention, a voluntary registry for lead exposure, and an advisory committee. CDC did not receive specific funding for Zika response in the omnibus, but had received $394 million in FY2016 supplemental appropriations. NIH received $33.3 billion in discretionary appropriations for FY2017. In FY2017, the LHHS bill allocated $33.3 billion in discretionary appropriations for NIH, a $2.0 billion increase from FY2016. This was $3.0 billion more than the Obama Administration's FY2017 request. The omnibus also directed $824 million in PHS tap transfers to NIH, with the majority going to the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS). Each NIH Institute and Center saw an increase of at least 3.0% compared to FY2016, with the National Institute on Aging (NIA) receiving the largest percentage increase of $2.0 billion (+28.2%). In FY2017, the omnibus bill directed NIH to reserve $1.4 billion for Alzheimer's research, marking a $400 million increase from FY2016. Additionally, $352 million was appropriated to the NIH Innovation Account for various research initiatives, including $300 million for the National Cancer Institute, $40 million for the Precision Medicine Initiative, $10 million for the BRAIN Initiative, and $2 million for other research programs. The FY2017 omnibus bill allocated $3.6 billion for the BRAIN Initiative and regenerative medicine research. There were proposed changes to the HHS Nonrecurring Expenses Fund (NEF) in the Senate and House committee bills, but the omnibus did not make any NIH-related changes to the NEF. The NEF allows the HHS Secretary to use unobligated balances for capital acquisitions across HHS. The FY2017 omnibus bill provided $3.6 billion for SAMHSA, which was $35 million more than FY2016 and $131 million more than the Obama Administration's request. Additionally, $134 million in evaluation tap funding and $12 million in PPHF funding were directed to SAMHSA. $20 million was allocated for programs authorized in the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016. The second FY2017 CR included $500 million for grants to support state responses. The FY2017 omnibus bill provided $500 million for grants to support state responses to the opioid crisis, with the funds transferred to SAMHSA. Additionally, $324 million was allocated for AHRQ, a 3.0% reduction from FY2016. President Obama's budget requested $83 million in PHS tap transfers to AHRQ, but the FY2017 omnibus did not direct any. The FY2017 omnibus bill allocated $324 million for AHRQ, a 3.0% reduction from FY2016. AHRQ is also set to receive annual transfers of certain mandatory funds from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) to disseminate patient-centered outcomes research results. The omnibus bill did not include a provision to prevent HHS funds from supporting patient-centered outcomes research. The FY2017 omnibus bill allocated $324 million for AHRQ, with transfers from PCORTF to support patient-centered outcomes research. The House and Senate committee reports included recommendations for AHRQ to consolidate mission areas, expand CAHPS surveys, and improve transparency in preventive care development. The FY2017 omnibus bill allocated $4.4 billion for CMS, with $725 million for Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control activities. $414 million of the HCFAC funding was exempt from discretionary budget caps. The CMS Program Management account received $3.7 billion in flat funding for program operations and administration. The FY2017 omnibus bill allocated $4.4 billion for CMS, including funding for Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control activities. The omnibus maintained a provision allowing the HHS Secretary to transfer funds from the Medicare trust funds for program management activities related to Medicare, with a limit of $305 million. The FY2017 omnibus bill retained a provision preventing certain funds from being used for risk corridor payments associated with qualified health plans. The ACA required HHS to administer a risk corridor program for qualified health plans, where HHS shares in insurers' gains and losses. The omnibus continued to prohibit HHS from making risk corridor payments with funds from the Medicare trust funds or other accounts funded in the LHHS bill. The FY2017 omnibus bill did not include certain limiting provisions from the House committee bill, such as restrictions on HHS spending for risk corridors. It provided $19.3 billion for ACF, slightly more than FY2016 but less than the Obama Administration's request. The FY2017 omnibus bill provided $19.3 billion for ACF, slightly more than FY2016 but less than the Obama Administration's request. It demonstrated continued support for early childhood care and education programs, with increases for the Child Care and Development Block Grant and Head Start program. Additionally, $250 million was recommended for the new Preschool Development Grants program, $100 million less than the President's request. The program aims to improve coordination of early childhood programs for low-income children. The omnibus also allocated $2.0 billion for ACL, a slight increase from FY2016. The FY2017 omnibus bill provided $2.0 billion for ACL, with $28 million in PPHF transfers. Funding for certain ACL programs was preserved, including the Limb Loss Resource Center and the Paralysis Resource Center. Discretionary funding for the State Health Insurance Assistance Program was maintained, albeit at reduced levels compared to FY2016. $40 million was allocated for ACL program administration, consistent with FY2016 levels. The FY2017 omnibus bill allocated $2.0 billion for ACL, with a provision that ACL should fund its administrative costs through its administrative accounts. Annual LHHS appropriations acts commonly include restrictions on federal funds for controversial issues such as abortions, human embryos for research, needle exchange programs, and gun control advocacy. Restrictions on abortion funding have been included in LHHS appropriations acts since FY1977, limiting funding to cases where the life of the mother is endangered or in cases of rape or incest. The FY2017 omnibus bill included restrictions on federal funds for abortions, specifying that funds can only be used in cases of endangerment, rape, or incest. It also prohibited discrimination against healthcare entities that do not provide or pay for abortions. The bill did not include a provision from the House committee bill that would have allowed individuals/employers to opt out of coverage for abortions based on moral or religious objections. The FY2017 omnibus bill included restrictions on federal funds for abortions, specifying that funds can only be used in cases of endangerment, rape, or incest. It also prohibited discrimination against healthcare entities that do not provide or pay for abortions. The bill did not include a provision from the House committee bill that would have allowed individuals/employers to opt out of coverage for abortions based on moral or religious objections. LHHS funds are prohibited from being used to create human embryos for research purposes or for research involving the destruction of human embryos. Funds are also restricted from being used for needle exchange programs, except under specific conditions. The FY2017 omnibus bill retained restrictions on federal funds for abortions, limited gun control advocacy activities, and imposed provisions on HHS for ACA implementation. The FY2017 House committee bill included provisions limiting HHS funds for ACA implementation, such as prohibiting funds for health insurance navigator programs and generating funds from offsetting collections. These provisions were not included in the Senate committee bill or enacted in the FY2017 omnibus. Certain ACA-related provisions were not enacted in the FY2017 omnibus. Amounts in this section are based on regular LHHS appropriations only and do not include mandatory funds provided outside of the annual appropriations process. Amounts are rounded to the nearest million or billion. Dollar and percentage changes discussed are based on unrounded amounts. Amounts do not reflect sequestration or re-estimates of mandatory spending programs. The FY2016 column reflects certain transfers, reprogramming, and other adjustments for comparability. Source materials also adjust FY2016 Department of Education funding levels and account structures. The U.S. Department of Education (ED) was established in 1980 with a mission to promote student achievement and ensure equal access to education. Three-quarters of its discretionary appropriations go to local educational agencies and low-income postsecondary students through Pell Grants. The remaining budget supports activities such as minority-serving institutions, educational research, and career education. The federal government provides roughly 8% of overall funding. The federal government provides a small portion of funding for elementary and secondary education, with states and local districts contributing the majority. For higher education, the federal government offers a significant amount of student aid. Discretionary funds make up the majority of the Department of Education's budget, with proposed increases for FY2017 compared to FY2016 levels. The FY2017 budget for education has seen increases under different proposals, with the Title I-A Grants receiving more funding while the School Improvement Grants program was discontinued. This program is a significant part of the Education for the Disadvantaged account and is authorized by the Every Student Succeeds Act. The Title I-A program, authorized by the Every Student Succeeds Act, provides educational services to low-achieving students in schools with high numbers of low-income families. Funding for Grants to LEAs increased to $15.5 billion in FY2017. The School Improvement Grant program, which supported low-performing schools, was not reauthorized under ESSA, making Title I-A the main source of funding for such schools. The School Improvement Grant program, a key funding source for low-performing schools, received $0.5 billion in FY2016. However, in FY2017, funding for SIG was not recommended by the President, House, and Senate committees. Instead, a newly authorized program in the School Improvement Programs account received funding, while funding for a long-standing teacher support program was reduced. Additionally, a program no longer authorized by ESEA lost its funding. The Student Support and Academic Enrichment (SSAE) State Grants, also known as the \"Title IV-A block grant,\" established by ESSA, provides funding for well-rounded educational opportunities, safe and healthy students, and technology for state educational agencies (SEAs) and local educational agencies (LEAs). The Title IV-A block grant program, established by ESSA, allows funds to be used for well-rounded educational opportunities, safe and healthy students, and technology. The FY2017 appropriation for the program was $400 million, with varying funding recommendations from different committees. There was debate over whether the proposed funding levels would be sufficient for LEAs to carry out the program effectively. The FY2017 appropriations act allowed states to provide subgrants to LEAs by formula or award LEA subgrants of no less than $10,000 on a competitive basis, prioritizing those with the greatest need. The President's request proposed awarding LEA subgrants of no less than $50,000 annually on a competitive basis. The FY2017 omnibus also eliminated funding for Mathematics. The FY2017 omnibus eliminated funding for the Mathematics and Science Partnerships (MSP) program and reduced funding for the Supporting Effective Instruction State Grants by $300 million compared to FY2016. The Pell Grant program provides need-based financial aid to low-income postsecondary students. Pell Grants are a significant source of federal grant aid for postsecondary students, projected to provide around $29 billion to 7.3 million undergraduates in 2018-2019. The FY2017 appropriations maintained level funding at $22.5 billion, with a maximum award of $4,860. The total maximum award increased to $5,920 from $5,815 in FY2016. The FY2017 omnibus implemented year-round Pell Grants, allowing eligible students to receive 150% of the total maximum Pell Grant amount in a single award year to increase retention and graduation rates. To fund this, mandatory funding was reduced from $1.6 billion to $1.3 billion. The Senate committee bill proposed year-round Pell Grants and a $1.3 billion rescission from the Pell Grant program surplus to offset appropriations. The rescission could help reduce the deficit or fund other priorities, as the program was projected to have a $8.6 billion surplus by the end of FY2017. The Senate committee bill proposed a $1.2 billion rescission from the Pell Grant program surplus, which had a cumulative surplus of $8.6 billion by the end of FY2017. Amounts mentioned are based on regular LHHS appropriations only and rounded to the nearest million or billion. The FY2017 funding levels for LHHS related agencies, including discretionary funds, were compared to FY2016 levels. Discretionary appropriations increased by $300 million in FY2017, with the largest share going to the Social Security Administration. The Senate committee proposed a smaller increase than the President's request, while the House committee bill suggested a decrease in appropriations. SSA receives the majority of funding for LHHS related agencies, with about 97% of total appropriations. Most of this funding supports the SSI program for disabled adults, children, and seniors. Discretionary funding for SSA accounts for at least 84% of appropriations, used for administering Social Security, SSI, and supporting Medicare. Following SSA, CNCS is the next-largest agency, receiving around 2% of total appropriations. The SSA LAE account receives the majority of funding for LHHS related agencies, mainly used for administering Social Security, SSI, and supporting Medicare. The FY2017 omnibus provided $12.5 billion to the LAE account, a 2.6% increase over FY2016 levels. The FY2017 omnibus provided $12.5 billion to the SSA LAE account, a 2.6% increase over FY2016 levels. The budget proposed by the Obama Administration and the Senate committee bill would have increased LAE funding by $902 million (+7.4%) relative to FY2016 levels, while the House committee bill would have decreased funding by $264 million (-2.2%). The program integrity portion of the LAE account for FY2017 includes $273 million in \"base\" funding subject to discretionary spending caps, with additional funding exempt from those caps. The FY2017 omnibus provided the maximum amount of program integrity funding permitted under the Budget Control Act for FY2017 ($1.8 billion), a 27.6% increase over FY2016 levels. The FY2017 omnibus maintained funding levels for the NLRB at $274 million, with the House committee bill proposing a decrease of $59 million (-21.6%) and the Senate committee bill maintaining the same funding as FY2016. The omnibus also included a provision prohibiting the NLRB from issuing a directive for electronic voting in collective bargaining representation elections. The omnibus bill for FY2017 maintained funding for the NLRB at $274 million and included provisions prohibiting certain uses of funds related to collective bargaining procedures. The budget enforcement framework includes discretionary spending limits and mandatory spending sequester from the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 affected budget enforcement requirements for FY2017 by increasing statutory discretionary spending limits. The Budget Control Act of 2011 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 increased discretionary spending limits for FY2016 and FY2017, extended the mandatory sequester to FY2025, and outlined mechanisms for reducing mandatory and discretionary spending over an extended period. The LHHS bill only includes funding in the nondefense category. In FY2017, President Obama issued a sequestration order for nonexempt mandatory spending, resulting in reductions of 2% for Medicare and 6.9% for other nondefense mandatory spending, totaling $18 billion. The Budget Control Act does not require sequestration of discretionary spending in FY2017 unless spending limits are breached. The statutory spending limits for FY2017 are $551.068 billion for defense and $518.531 billion for nondefense. The Budget Control Act sets spending limits for defense and nondefense at $551.068 billion and $518.531 billion, totaling $1.070 trillion. FY2017 appropriations did not exceed these limits. Adjustments are allowed for certain programs, such as program integrity initiatives at HHS and SSA. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 expanded the list of activities covered by these adjustments. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 revised SSA adjustment amounts for FY2017-FY2019, and the Cures Act created budget enforcement procedures for specific accounts related to NIH Innovation and the State Response to the Opioid Abuse Crisis. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 revised SSA adjustment amounts for FY2017-FY2019 and the Cures Act created budget enforcement procedures for specific accounts related to NIH Innovation and the State Response to the Opioid Abuse Crisis. Subsequent discretionary appropriations from certain accounts will not count against spending limits, and the LHHS bill contains programs exempt from sequestration. The LHHS bill includes various programs like pay and medical benefits for Public Health Service officers, foster care, adoption assistance, and family support payments. It also covers special rules for programs like unemployment compensation, student loans, health centers, and Medicare. Budget enforcement procedures are based on the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, with the Appropriations Committee receiving spending limits known as 302(b) suballocations. The 302(b) suballocations set spending limits for each subcommittee, acting as caps on appropriations bills. Enforcement is through points of order. The Senate adopted budgetary levels for FY2017 in the absence of a budget resolution. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported initial 302(b) suballocations on April 18, 2016, with subsequent revisions. The House Appropriations Committee also made decisions in the absence of a budget resolution. The House Appropriations Committee adopted interim 302(b) suballocations for appropriations bills in the absence of a budget resolution. An interim suballocation for the LHHS subcommittee was adopted on July 14, 2016. A budget resolution for FY2017 was later adopted in the Senate and House. The Senate Appropriations Committee made revisions to its suballocations, while the House did not officially report its FY2017 suballocations. The table compares Senate FY2017 LHHS suballocations, House interim suballocation, and FY2017 enacted levels with FY2016 appropriations. FY2017 LHHS appropriations were $934 million less than FY2016 levels subject to discretionary spending limits. Adjustments may be made for certain LHHS program integrity activities and emergency requirements. Compliance with discretionary spending allocations is based on current-year budget authority, excluding advance appropriations for future years. Advance appropriations for LHHS accounts are used to manage planning concerns and ensure continuity of operations at the start of a new fiscal year. Current-year budget authority is crucial for determining compliance with discretionary spending allocations, regardless of when the funds were first appropriated."
