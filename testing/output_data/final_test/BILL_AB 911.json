    "title": "AB 911",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature enacts a law authorizing Saddleback Memorial Medical Center to operate a stand-alone emergency room for patient stabilization. The law also requires transparency for hospital closures, including public hearings for general acute care hospitals providing emergency services scheduled for closure. Saddleback Memorial Medical Center in San Clemente can continue providing emergency medical services under its existing license if it transforms its service delivery. The hospital must follow procedural requirements for public hearings as per the Ralph M. Brown Act. Additionally, a new section is added to the Health and Safety Code allowing the operation of an emergency department at the San Clemente campus with specific requirements. The emergency department at Saddleback Memorial Medical Center must operate under its consolidated license, be within 15 miles of the parent hospital, open 24/7, staffed by a board-certified emergency physician, have trained nurses, and offer a full range of laboratory and diagnostic services. The emergency department at Saddleback Memorial Medical Center must meet specialty call requirements defined by the Orange County EMS Agency, have transfer agreements with specialty centers, stabilize and transport patients to higher level care facilities, and operate a fully functioning transport program for patients requiring admission to specialty services. The consolidated license of Saddleback Memorial Medical Center must meet federal and state regulatory requirements, including regulations from CMS and Title 22 of the California Code. This special law is needed due to unique circumstances in providing emergency medical services to San Clemente, Dana Point, and San Juan Capistrano. This act is an urgency statute to ensure emergency medical services in San Clemente, Dana Point, and San Juan Capistrano and provide transparency on hospital closures."
