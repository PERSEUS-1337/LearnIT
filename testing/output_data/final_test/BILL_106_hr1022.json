    "content": "The Act titled \"Y2K State and Local Government Assistance Programs Act\" authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to provide grants to States for specific activities outlined in the Act. Grants must be issued within a 2-year period from the enactment date, with limitations on the number of grants per State and overall. The Y2K Compliance Project under the Act requires grant recipients to make information technology Y2K compliant, supplement funds, and meet Secretary-prescribed requirements. Matching requirements mandate recipients to supplement grant amounts received. The Act requires grant recipients to supplement grant amounts with funds from other sources, including donated materials, building leases, and staff salaries for Y2K compliance projects. The Secretary may waive the matching requirement for states facing undue hardship. The Secretary will award grants based on competitive criteria, prioritizing projects related to Y2K compliance in federal welfare programs. The Secretary may grant funds to a State if the application meets specific requirements, including submission through the state executive office within 45 days of the Act's enactment, a project description with a budget and funding request, a plan for meeting matching requirements, and other necessary information. The application must include all required information, assurances, and certifications as specified by the Secretary. SEC. 6.
