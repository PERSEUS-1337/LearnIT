Congress acknowledges the importance of representative democracy as outlined in the Inter-American Democratic Charter, emphasizing respect for human rights, fair elections, transparency in government, and separation of powers. Responsible public administration, respect for social rights, and freedom of expression are essential for democracy. The Inter-American Democratic Charter allows for intervention in case of unconstitutional alterations to the democratic order in member states. In December 2010, Venezuela's President, Hugo Chavez, passed laws that fundamentally altered the Venezuelan Constitution, leading to restrictions on freedom of speech and political parties. The Permanent Council may undertake diplomatic initiatives to foster the restoration of democracy in such situations. The Enabling Act passed by Venezuela's President, Hugo Chavez, violates democratic principles by granting him extensive powers for eighteen months in various areas, including social, economic, and national security. This legislation also undermines the people's ability to govern themselves and infringes on social rights by controlling education curriculum and ideology in universities. These actions go against the Inter-American Democratic Charter. The Enabling Act in Venezuela, criticized by Secretary General Jose Miguel Insulza and Assistant Secretary of State Arturo Valenzuela, was described as undemocratic and unconstitutional. The Director of National Intelligence's assessment highlighted how the legislation favored Chavez's loyal community councils, potentially undermining democratic principles. According to the Inter-American Democratic Charter, Article 20 can be invoked in case of an unconstitutional alteration of the constitutional regime that impairs democracy in a member state. This leads to the calling of the Permanent Council to take diplomatic actions to restore democracy. If these efforts fail, Article 21 is used to convene a special session of the General Assembly to decide on suspending the member state from the OAS. The OAS can suspend a member state with a two-thirds vote according to its Charter, taking immediate effect. SEC. 2. Invocation of Article 20 of the Inter-American Democratic Charter. The Secretary of State will withhold 20 percent of US contributions to the OAS for meetings that do not discuss Venezuela's violation of the Inter-American Democratic Charter. Contributions will resume when Article 20 is invoked. The OAS discussed Venezuela's violation of the Inter-American Democratic Charter at a meeting of the Permanent Council. Amounts withheld will be used to reduce the Federal budget deficit or debt."
