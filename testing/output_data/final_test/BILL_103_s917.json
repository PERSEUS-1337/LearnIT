(a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Birth Defects Prevention Act of 1993''. Findings include birth defects being the leading cause of infant mortality, affecting thousands of infants annually with chronic disability, and posing excess risks for certain populations based on racial and ethnic backgrounds. Birth defects can result from exposure to environmental hazards, adverse health conditions during pregnancy, or genetic mutations. Lack of information on the number and causes of birth defects hinders prevention efforts. Surveillance and research efforts are underdeveloped and poorly coordinated, leading to undetected outbreaks of birth defects. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section on birth defects prevention and research programs. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section establishing a National Birth Defects Surveillance Program. The program allows the Secretary to award grants, enter into agreements, or provide technical assistance to collect and analyze birth defects statistics by gender and racial/ethnic group. Additionally, the Secretary is required to establish regional Centers for Excellence for Birth Defects Prevention Research to study the causes and correlates of birth defects. The Secretary can award grants for research on birth defects, including gender and racial/ethnic groups like Hispanics, non-Hispanic whites, African Americans, Native Americans, and Asian Americans. Centers of Excellence for Birth Defects Prevention Research can be established through grants or cooperative agreements with various entities. Application requirements must be met for eligibility. The Secretary requires applications for birth defects research grants to include data collection, coordination of surveillance efforts, education for health professionals, and development of prevention strategies. The program funds will not be used to supplant or duplicate State efforts. One of the Centers of Excellence will focus on birth defects among ethnic minorities in a specific area with a high minority population and incidence of birth defects. The Centers for Disease Control will coordinate birth defects prevention activities through a clearinghouse. The clearinghouse will collect and store data from birth defects monitoring programs to facilitate research and policy development. Data will be disaggregated by gender and racial/ethnic groups. The Secretary will award grants for prevention strategies to reduce birth defects incidence and effects. The curr_chunk discusses programs designed to prevent birth defects, including demonstration projects and public information campaigns. These projects aim to enhance prevention services in high-risk areas with a high incidence of birth defects. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of an Advisory Committee for Birth Defects Prevention, which provides advice on prevention and amelioration of birth defects. The Committee makes recommendations on prevention research and intervention priorities. The Advisory Committee for Birth Defects Prevention advises on research priorities, prevention strategies, and disparities among different ethnic groups. It consists of 15 members appointed by the Secretary. The Advisory Committee for Birth Defects Prevention consists of 15 members appointed by the Secretary, including health professionals, representatives from health professional associations, voluntary health agencies, the general public, and representatives from Public Health Service agencies involved in birth defects research and prevention programs.

Additionally, prevention programs and representatives from other Federal agencies such as the Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency are appointed as ex officio liaison members to inform the Committee about agency policies and practices. Appointed Committee members serve a 3-year term, with initial members serving staggered terms of 1, 2, or 3 years as determined by the Secretary. Meetings are held regularly.

The Committee meets regularly and members are compensated based on their employment status. The Secretary is required to submit a biennial report to Congress on birth defects incidence, prevention strategies, and research needs.
