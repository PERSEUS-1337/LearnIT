    "content": "The EPA has proposed regulations for steam electric power plants since 2009, raising concerns about costs and potential impacts. Industry and environmental groups are closely monitoring these rules and their implementation schedules. Critics fear that the cumulative impact of these regulations could lead to the retirement of many electric generating units, jeopardizing the reliability of the nation's power supply. This has been described as a regulatory \"train wreck\" that may impose excessive costs and threaten electricity capacity nationwide. The EPA has proposed regulations for steam electric power plants since 2009, raising concerns about costs and potential impacts. Critics fear that the regulations could lead to plant retirements, threatening electricity capacity. The most recent major rule concerns limits on discharges of wastewater from power plants, part of a suite of Obama Administration utility sector rules. EPA maintains that the regulations will not jeopardize electricity capacity nationwide. The EPA updated standards in November 2015 to reflect modern power plant technology, as part of the 1972 Clean Water Act. Effluent limitation guidelines were established to regulate industrial dischargers, including the steam electric power industry. Since 1972, the EPA has issued guidelines for 57 industrial categories to reduce pollutants introduced into U.S. waters. Effluent guidelines set limits on pollutants through NPDES permits issued by EPA or states. Pretreatment standards apply to indirect dischargers and are enforced by POTWs. Guidelines cover conventional, toxic, and non-conventional pollutants. CWA established effluent limitations for direct and indirect dischargers based on technology performance. Effluent limitations are set based on technology performance for direct and indirect dischargers. EPA considers cost and achievability of controls in establishing limitations. Best Practicable Control Technology Currently Available (BPT) and Best Available Technology Economically Achievable (BAT) are used to determine limits. BPT is based on industry performance averages, while BAT represents the best existing performance in the industry. BAT limitations are the best existing performance for controlling toxic and nonconventional pollutant discharges. Factors like cost and processes are considered. EPA Administrator has discretion in assigning weight to these factors. BAT may involve changes in processes. BCT replaces BAT for controlling conventional pollutant discharges. NSPS are based on the best available control technology. Standards (NSPS) are based on the best available control technology and represent the most stringent control attainable. New plants have the opportunity to install efficient production processes and wastewater treatment technologies. EPA considers cost, environmental impacts, and energy requirements. Pretreatment Standards for Existing Sources (PSES) control pollutants that interfere with POTW operation. Pretreatment Standards for New Sources (PSNS) are similar to PSES in controlling incompatible pollutants. EPA considers the same factors in promulgating these standards. The EPA sets effluent limitations for industrial sources based on Best Practicable Technology (BPT) and Best Available Technology (BAT) to achieve greater pollutant removal over time. New sources must comply with these limitations when they start operating. Effluent Limitation Guidelines (ELGs) apply to direct discharges through NPDES permits and indirect discharges through local pretreatment programs. The steam electric industry guidelines were first issued in 1974 and revised later. The EPA issued effluent limitation guidelines for the steam electric industry in 1974 and revised them in 1982. These rules apply to around 1,100 power plants, including 495 coal-fired plants. EPA is required to review and potentially revise these guidelines every five years. In 2005, EPA identified the need to possibly revise the rules for the steam electric power category due to high levels of toxic and nonconventional pollutant discharges. Power plants are responsible for about 30% of toxic pollutants discharged into U.S. surface waters. Power plant discharges, accounting for 30% of toxic pollutants in U.S. surface waters, have increased due to new technologies like coal gasification and air pollution controls. Wet FGD systems are notably contributing to the rise in pollutant discharges. The pollutant discharges from the electric power industry are increasing each year with additional chemical constituents, accounting for 50%-60% of all toxic pollutants in surface waters. Main pollutants include metals, nitrogen, and total dissolved solids. EPA found that the 1982 regulations did not address these pollutants adequately, especially with the rise of FGD systems at coal-fired power plants. Sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants are expected to be reduced by nearly 80% by 2025 through the use of FGD systems. However, these systems can create a significant liquid waste stream, leading to potential water quality degradation. EPA has identified new wastestreams, such as carbon capture wastewater, that pose challenges for the industry. In 2009, environmental groups sued EPA to push for revised guidelines for power plant wastewater. EPA agreed to propose the revised ELG by July 2012 and finalize it by January 2014. Dates were modified, and EPA proposed revised standards in April 2013, with finalization delayed to September 2015. The EPA announced the final rule on September 30, 2015, published in the Federal Register on November 3, 2015, and effective on January 4, 2016. The revised ELG applies to electric utilities and non-industrial non-utilities in the electric generating industry. Non-industrial non-utilities account for 49% of plants but only 30% of total U.S. generating capacity. Utilities consist of investor-owned utilities, publicly owned utilities, and rural electric cooperatives. There are 1,080 steam electric plants subject to the ELG. The EPA's final rule, effective January 4, 2016, applies to 1,080 steam electric plants with a total capacity of 741,000 MW. These plants represent 19% of the power generation sector but account for 70% of the national electric generating capacity. Most plants burn coal or natural gas, with 74% using multiple fuel types. Coal and petroleum-coke fired plants make up 44% of those subject to the ELG. The primary fuel types for steam electric power plants are gas and coal, with oil and nuclear plants accounting for smaller percentages. The largest plants (>500 MW) make up the majority of capacity, while the smallest plants (<100 MW) provide minimal capacity. The 1982 pollutant discharge limitations apply to various wastestreams from these plants. The 1982 ELG sets standards for pollutant discharge limitations from steam electric power plants, addressing wastestreams such as low volume wastes, material storage, and construction site runoff. The 2013 proposal aims to establish new requirements for processes and byproducts, as EPA found pollutants causing environmental impacts can be reduced with available treatment technologies. The 2013 EPA proposal evaluated eight regulatory options for environmental impacts, identifying four preferred alternatives for existing discharges and one for new sources. The options varied in wastestreams controlled, unit size, and types of controls, with increasing stringency and cost. The 2015 revised rule includes standards for existing and new sources, covering wastestreams like FGD wastewater, fly ash transport water, and flue gas mercury control system wastewater. The 2015 revised rule includes standards for various wastestreams such as water from flue gas mercury control systems, gasification wastewater, and combustion residual leachate. EPA evaluated five regulatory options for existing sources, with BAT and PSES requirements in the final rule being most similar to the proposed rule's preferred option for new sources. The final rule establishes BAT standards equivalent to BPT requirements for combustion residual leachate from landfills or surface impoundments. The final rule for existing sources establishes zero discharge limitations for fly ash transport water, bottom ash transport water, and FGMC wastewater. It also sets numeric effluent limitations for mercury, arsenic, selenium, and nitrate/nitrite in FGD wastewater. The final rule for existing sources includes less stringent limits for pollutants compared to the 2013 proposal. It offers an extended compliance option for FGD wastewater dischargers, allowing them to meet more stringent standards by December 31, 2023. The voluntary option requires the use of chemical precipitation followed by evaporation technology. The final rule for steam electric power plants establishes effluent limitations on mercury, arsenic, selenium, and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) in gasification wastewater. Combustion residual leachate is no longer considered a low volume waste source and is managed using surface impoundments. BPT limits for Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and oil and grease are retained from the 1982 rule. The rule also includes BAT effluent limits. The final rule establishes BAT effluent limits for existing oil-fired generating units and small electric generating units (EGUs) 50 MW or smaller. EPA set BAT effluent limits equal to existing BPT effluent limits for these facilities, citing lower pollutant generation and higher compliance costs for smaller units. The final rule includes an anti-circumvention provision to prevent facilities from bypassing effluent limitation standards by mixing different waste streams. It applies to wastestreams with zero discharge limitations such as fly ash transport water, bottom ash transport water, and FGMC wastewater. New sources must adhere to NSPS for these wastestreams. The final rule establishes zero discharge standards for fly ash transport water, bottom ash transport water, and FGMC wastewater. It also sets numeric standards for mercury, arsenic, selenium, and TDS in FGD and gasification wastewater. The technology basis for handling these wastewaters is similar to BAT limitations for direct discharges. The final rule sets numeric standards for arsenic, mercury, selenium, and TDS in wastewater. The technology basis for these standards is similar to BAT limitations for direct discharges. EPA also prescribes pretreatment standards for existing and new sources discharging wastewater to POTWs. The final rule establishes pretreatment standards to prevent pollutant discharge that could interfere with POTW operation. For existing source discharges to POTWs, zero discharge standards are set for fly ash transport water, bottom ash transport water, and FGMC wastewater. Numeric standards for mercury, arsenic, selenium, and nitrate/nitrite are established for FGD wastewater. Gasification wastewater discharges are also regulated. The final rule establishes pretreatment standards to prevent pollutant discharge that could interfere with POTW operation, including zero discharge standards for certain wastewater streams and numeric standards for others. Gasification wastewater discharges are regulated with specific numeric standards for mercury, arsenic, selenium, and TDS. Compliance costs for existing sources may be higher due to retrofitting pollution controls, while new sources can meet requirements economically with available technology. The steam electric power sector is a significant source of pollutant emissions and discharges. The power sector is subject to pollution control requirements under federal environmental laws, including regulations related to the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. The management of coal combustion residuals (CCR) is also addressed in relation to the CWA ELG rule. Disposal of CCR onsite at power plants can lead to long-term accumulation of dry ash. The management of coal combustion residuals (CCR) at power plants can lead to long-term accumulation of dry ash or wet ash slurry. Risks associated with CCR management include catastrophic releases from surface impoundments and leaching of contaminants, primarily heavy metals, leading to surface or groundwater contamination. Regulation of CCR management primarily falls under individual state jurisdiction. The management of coal combustion residuals (CCR) at power plants is primarily regulated by individual states. In December 2014, EPA finalized a rule establishing national criteria for CCR landfills and surface impoundments under RCRA's Subtitle D non-hazardous solid waste requirements to address the risk of coal ash disposal. EPA will rely on states to enforce the new standards. The scope of the CWA ELG and RCRA rule differ. The CWA ELG and RCRA rule differ in scope. EPA aims to coordinate final RCRA and CWA requirements to minimize regulatory overlap, especially for surface impoundments. The ELG may lead power plants to switch from wet to dry fly ash handling systems, impacting disposal methods. The EPA extended the deadline for closure plan preparation under the final CCR rule by one year compared to the proposed rule. Owners or operators of covered facilities now have 24 months after publication of the CCR rule to understand and comply with regulations. EPA can supplement effluent limitation guidelines with Best Management Practices (BMPs) to control pollutants in plant site runoff and waste disposal. The EPA is considering using Best Management Practices (BMPs) to address impoundment construction, operation, and maintenance in the regulated industrial process to control pollutants in U.S. waters. These BMPs, such as weekly impoundment inspections by qualified personnel, are crucial for ensuring structural stability and early detection of problems. If included in the rule, these BMPs would become conditions in Clean Water Act permits, along with other requirements. The 2013 CWA proposal included BMP provisions for CCR surface impoundments, requiring facilities to submit plans for design, construction, maintenance, and closure to the permitting authority. The 2015 final CWA rule did not include BMPs, allowing time for facilities to raise capital and plan accordingly. The EPA's CCR rule allows facilities time to raise capital, plan, design, and implement technology during planned shutdowns. Changes to FGD wastewater treatment systems and other modifications may take several years to accomplish. BAT limitations for existing sources will apply three years after the rule's effective date, with the rule applying to discharges generated after November 1, 2018. The EPA's CCR rule allows facilities time to implement technology during planned shutdowns. BAT limitations for existing sources will apply three years after the rule's effective date, with the rule applying to discharges generated after November 1, 2018. Permitting authorities have flexibility to set the implementation date for steam electric facilities, with all facilities expected to implement control technologies by 2019. New NSPS and PSNS requirements will apply to new sources after the rule's effective date. Legacy wastewater from existing sources must comply with the final rule by November 1, 2018, while newly generated wastewater will be subject to more stringent requirements. Legacy wastewater from existing sources must comply with the final rule by November 1, 2018, while newly generated wastewater will be subject to more stringent requirements. The 2015 final rule aims to eliminate wastewater in the future through technology upgrades, but does not address legacy wastewaters currently stored in surface impoundments. EPA did not establish zero discharge BAT limitations for legacy wastewater due to unavailability of technologies. The final rule focuses on reducing disposal of ash-containing wastewater in surface impoundments. EPA estimates the rule will lead to cost savings for power plants. The final rule by EPA focuses on reducing disposal of ash-containing wastewater in surface impoundments, with estimated compliance costs for industry of $496.2 million pre-tax and $339.6 million after-tax. Approximately 12% of plants will incur costs associated with the rule. EPA also analyzed the social costs of the final ELG. The EPA analyzed the social costs of the final ELG, estimating total annualized social costs of $479.5 million at a 3% discount rate and $471.2 million at a 7% discount rate. The final rule's limitations and standards are deemed economically achievable. The EPA concludes that the final rule's limitations and standards are economically achievable for the industry. 88% of plants will have zero compliance costs, 8% will have costs less than 1% of revenue, 4% will have costs between 1% and 3% of revenue, and less than 1% will have costs above 3% of revenue. The number of plants with non-zero compliance costs is 50% less than estimated in 2013 due to various factors. Plants in the eastern United States and Southeast are expected to have the highest compliance costs due to EPA rules. Variable production costs at steam electric power plants will increase by approximately 0.3% nationally. Compliance costs are mainly associated with controls on FGD and bottom ash transport wastewater. The final rule reduced total compliance costs compared to previous proposals by maintaining the technology basis for managing combustion residual leachate. EPA considered various factors in developing the final rule. The EPA considered establishing limitations for arsenic and mercury in combustion residual leachate but concluded that the pollutants discharged in this wastestream are a small portion of pollutants from all steam electric power plants. The final rule maintains the BPT standard for this wastestream, representing progress towards eliminating pollutant discharge without increasing costs to permitting authorities. The EPA's final rule on steam electric power plants will reduce the burden on permitting authorities by establishing national BAT standards. It is projected to have minimal impact on electricity production costs, with a decrease of 843 million kWh of coal-fired electricity in 2030. The EPA's final rule on steam electric power plants will have small effects on the electricity market in 2030, with total annual costs estimated to increase by 0.4% nationally. Industrial consumers will experience the highest price increases (0.21% nationally), while residential consumers will have the lowest price increases (0.11% nationally). The EPA's analysis shows that industrial consumers will experience higher price increases due to lower baseline electricity rates. The average annual cost per residential household will increase by $0.03 to $2.67 depending on the region, with a national average of $1.42. The ELG final rule is projected to decrease total coal-fired generating capacity by approximately 0.6%, leading to potential early plant retirements and lower employment in coal-related industries. The EPA's final rule is expected to decrease coal-fired generating capacity, leading to lower employment in coal-related industries. Other fuel sources like natural gas and renewable fuels are projected to increase, with positive labor impacts in industries such as natural gas extraction and power plant operation. Stakeholders criticize EPA for not fully analyzing the job and economic impacts of its regulatory proposals. EPA lacks a robust methodology to assess all potential changes in the economy. EPA lacks a robust methodology to fully assess the impact of regulatory changes on employment levels in the U.S. economy. Uncertainties exist in the analysis, such as assumptions about electricity demand and fuel prices. The agency did not quantify long-run economy-wide regulatory changes in employment resulting from the ELG. The EPA's analysis of the impact of regulatory changes on employment levels in the U.S. economy lacks a robust methodology. Uncertainties exist in the analysis, such as assumptions about electricity demand and fuel prices. The effects of fuel prices on electricity generation are not reflected in the analysis. Estimates of price increases assume 100% pass-through of compliance costs, which may overstate potential impact. State compliance with the Clean Power Plan could lead to different outcomes than EPA's model projects, affecting power plant capacity, production costs, and pollutant reductions. EPA estimated a reduction of 385 million pounds per year in pollutants from the final rule. The final rule will reduce pollutants by 385 million pounds per year, with the largest reduction in nonconventional pollutants. Water withdrawals associated with certain processes will be reduced by 57 billion gallons per year. The reduction in effluent loadings is expected to result in environmental and ecological improvements, benefiting water quality, wildlife, and human health. EPA estimated that reduced pollutant loadings to surface waters would improve water quality by reducing metal concentrations. Metals in combustion wastewater discharges can drastically alter aquatic populations and ecosystems. Selenium concentrations would be reduced by two-thirds under the final rule, leading to fewer waters exceeding selenium criteria. EPA acknowledges varying degrees of completeness in assessing benefits. EPA quantified expected effects and benefits of reduced steam electric discharges, including health benefits like reduced cancer risk from arsenic exposure. However, only a small subset of health benefits could be monetized. Other benefits, such as reduced non-cancer adverse health effects, can be quantified but not monetized due to uncertainties in valuing benefits. Some effects, like reduced sediment contamination and increased property values, cannot be quantified or monetized due to data limitations and gaps in understanding societal values. EPA recognizes limitations and uncertainties in analyzing benefits. The EPA acknowledges limitations and uncertainties in analyzing benefits of reduced steam electric discharges. Some limitations may lead to overestimation, such as revised toxic metal loadings data, while others may lead to underestimation, like not considering mercury exposure in adults. Despite data constraints, EPA projects annualized monetized benefits of the final rule to range from $451 million to $566 million. The EPA evaluated the annual monetized social costs and estimated that they exceed the mid-range annual monetized benefits for the final ELG by $16.5 million using a 3% discount rate and by $74.2 million using a 7% discount rate. The CWA does not require benefits to exceed costs but mandates progress towards eliminating pollutant discharge. Steam electric power plants and the revised ELG are complex industrial operations. Industry's main concern with the 2013 proposed rule was EPA's technical complexity. The 2013 proposed rule by EPA for steam electric power plants was a major concern for the industry due to potential economic burdens and compliance challenges. The final rule will require technological and operational changes that could increase customer costs and reduce plant effectiveness. There are concerns about costly retrofitting and infeasible standards, as well as the timing of new requirements alongside other EPA rules. The EPA addressed timing and coordination issues with other rules in the final ELG and RCRA coal ash rule. Concerns were raised about the impact on small entities, leading to an analysis projecting compliance costs for 22 small entities. EPA is required to convene a Small Business Advocacy Review Panel for most rules under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The final rule will result in compliance costs for small entities, including six owning steam electric power plants and one municipality facing costs exceeding 3% of revenue. The rule establishes requirements for small power plants to mitigate impacts. Stakeholders are concerned about underestimated costs and the lack of a Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act panel. Some stakeholders criticize EPA for not including small business representatives in evaluating the impact of the proposed rule on power plants. The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association argues that compliance costs have been underestimated. Environmental advocates are generally satisfied with the final rule but have concerns about certain aspects not being stringent enough. They advocate for stricter standards, such as dry handling of ash and biological treatment of scrubber waste. Environmental advocates support the final rule's requirement for dry handling of fly ash and bottom ash from power plants but have concerns about compliance deadlines and lack of strict limits on legacy wastestreams. They disagree with EPA's stance on establishing BAT limits for pre-existing power plant wastestreams. Some argue that EPA rules for steam electric power plants are being scrutinized for their stringency, feasibility, and compliance costs. Congressional interest has led to legislation aiming to change EPA's regulatory actions. Following the promulgation of the ELG, attention has shifted to federal courts with petitions for review filed. The focus has shifted to federal courts with petitions for review of the ELG filed in various federal courts of appeals, consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The deadline for new challenges to the ELG is March 16, 2016. The revised ELG regulates six wastestreams from steam electric power plants, including FGD wastewater systems. Approximately 401 FGD systems are in the United States, with 17% being dry systems not subject to FGD wastewater requirements. Wet FGD systems can remove up to 99% of sulfur dioxide, while dry systems typically remove 80% to 90%. Wet FGD systems use a liquid sorbent to transfer pollutants from flue gas. Out of 150 plants with wet FGD systems, 100 discharge FGD wastewater after treatment using various technologies. EPA is involved in regulating these systems. The steam electric industry discharges 16.1 billion gallons of FGD wastewater per year, with most plants using surface impoundments for treatment. Treatment technologies are available for pollutants in FGD wastewater, which contain metals and other pollutants of concern. EPA found that historically, power plants relied on surface impoundments to treat FGD wastewater due to NPDES permits focusing on controlling suspended solids. Metals in FGD wastewater are present in both particulate and soluble forms. Advanced technologies are available for treating FGD wastewater, which contains metals and other pollutants. Chemical precipitation/coprecipitation combined with biological treatment is effective at removing soluble and dissolved forms of metals, nitrogen, and total dissolved solids. EPA determined that 45% of power plants with wet scrubbers can meet the effluent limitations and standards in the 2015 rule. Many plants use FGD wastewater management approaches that eliminate discharge. EPA rejected chemical precipitation alone for FGD wastewater treatment. Fly ash transport water is a significant wastewater source at coal-fired power plants, generated during the transportation of fly ash from boilers using water. This water is typically treated in large surface impoundment systems due to its high volume, with the steam electric power industry producing 209 billion gallons annually. Chemical treatment systems are not effective at removing selenium, nitrogen compounds, and certain metals found in FGD wastewater, making chemical precipitation alone unsuitable for treatment. Fly ash transport water from coal-fired power plants contains high concentrations of metals and total suspended solids. Plants built since 1982 typically use dry fly ash handling systems to eliminate the discharge of pollutants in fly ash transport water. Over 80% of existing coal- and petroleum coke-fired generating units already use dry ash fly handling systems. Studies show that fly ash transport water is a major wastewater source from coal-fired power plants. Studies have found that fly ash transport waters from coal-fired power plants contain high concentrations of metals like arsenic, selenium, and mercury. The 2015 revised rule establishes zero discharge effluent limitations for pollutants in fly ash transport water, based on dry fly ash handling technologies. Older steam electric units tend to use wet systems for fly ash transport, with most plants located east of the Mississippi River. Surface impoundments are not effective for treating fly ash transport water. Bottom ash, also known as \"boiler slag,\" is the heavier combustion residual collected at the bottom of a boiler. It makes up 20%-30% of the ash from a pulverized coal furnace, with the rest being fly ash. Like fly ash, bottom ash can be transported using water to on-site ash impoundments for treatment. EPA found that bottom ash transport waters from wet systems at coal-fired power plants contain significant concentrations of metals. The EPA identified that a majority of power plants transport bottom ash using water, generating a total of 297 billion gallons annually. Many plants have systems in place to manage transport water to reduce discharge into surface waters. The 2015 revised rule requires zero discharge of bottom ash transport water to surface waters, with technologies such as dry handling or closed-loop systems being used for control of pollutants. Over 80% of coal-fired generating units built in the last 20 years have dry bottom ash handling systems in place. EPA found that more than half of entities subject to BAT requirements for bottom ash transport water are already using or planning to use zero discharge technologies. Combustion residuals like fly ash, bottom ash, and FGD solids are stored in on-site landfills or surface impoundments at power plants. Combustion residual leachate, contaminated with metals and other pollutants, is generated when water comes in contact with these residuals. Sources of landfill combustion residual leachate include precipitation percolating through the waste and liquids from the combustion residuals. Power plants manage leachate and stormwater contaminated with pollutants from combustion residuals in various ways, including closure of landfills or impoundments when they reach capacity to prevent environmental release of pollutants. EPA estimated in 2009 that coal-fired and petroleum coke-fired steam electric plants generated combustion residual leachate, with some plants discharging significant amounts of leachate residual. Stormwater that comes in contact with landfilled combustion residuals also becomes contaminated with pollutants like heavy metals. According to EPA, coal- and petroleum-fired power plants collect combustion residual leachate from impoundments and landfills. Most landfills and some impoundments have leachate collection systems, with lined facilities being more common. Unlined impoundments and landfills can lead to groundwater contamination. Leachate can be recycled back to the landfill or plant. Surface impoundments and constructed wetlands are common systems used to treat combustion residual leachate from landfills and impoundments. Physical/chemical and chemical precipitation technologies are also effective in treating pollutants in leachate. EPA established effluent limitations for existing sources based on gravity settling in surface impoundments, while new sources use chemical precipitation/coprecipitation technology. The 2015 rule is based on chemical precipitation/coprecipitation technology for treating combustion residual leachate. This technology effectively removes various metals but is not effective for selenium, boron, and other TDS-contributing parameters. Flue Gas Mercury Control (FGMC) systems are new to the steam electric industry and are used to remove mercury from flue gas emissions. In 2009, there were around 120 operating FGMC systems in the steam electric industry, with 40 more planned by 2020. Most systems use dry methods with oxidizers to remove mercury, while some inject activated carbon into the flue gas. The use of oxidizers may increase mercury concentration in FGD wastewater. Coal-fired power plants can minimize FGMC particulate handling transport water discharge using available technologies. EPA identified 6 plants using water to transport FGMC waste to surface impoundments. The final rule requires zero discharge using dry handling technologies for fly ash disposal. Dry handling systems are well-demonstrated in the industry and would eliminate pollutants in FGMC wastewater. BAT limitations for FGMC wastewater were not based on surface impoundments as they are not effective in removing pollutants. Gasification wastewater from IGCC plants is treated using vapor-compression evaporation systems or cyanide destruction systems. The effluent limitations are based on vapor-compression evaporation technology, as surface impoundments were not effective in removing pollutants. Surface impoundments were not chosen as the basis for BAT limitations in the United States due to their ineffectiveness in removing pollutants from gasification wastewater, especially dissolved solids."
