    "content": "The Act titled \"National Hurricane Research Initiative Act of 2006\" defines key terms like Director and Under Secretary. It establishes the National Hurricane Research Initiative. The National Hurricane Research Initiative, established by the Under Secretary and Director, aims to set research objectives based on a National Science Board report. It focuses on improving hurricane prediction, intensity, and mitigation for coastal populations and infrastructure through a multi-agency effort. The National Hurricane Research Initiative aims to improve hurricane prediction, intensity, and mitigation for coastal populations, infrastructure, and the natural environment. Grants are provided for research in predicting hurricane intensification and understanding air-sea interactions. Research focuses on understanding air-sea interactions during hurricanes, predicting storm surge, rainfall, and flooding, and exploring hurricane modification techniques through human intervention. Research includes improving understanding of hurricane modification effects on precipitation, fresh water supply, and climate. Enhanced hurricane and tropical storm observation using various technologies to better comprehend storm complexity. Developing a national engineering assessment of vulnerable coastal infrastructure. Research includes improving understanding of hurricane impacts on infrastructure like levees, seawalls, drainage systems, bridges, utilities, power, and communications. Additionally, research focuses on the interaction of hurricanes with buildings and housing to enhance construction codes in hurricane-prone areas. Studies also aim to better understand the relationship between hurricanes, climate, and natural ecosystems. Research focuses on improving emergency communication networks and evacuation planning during disasters, including cyber-security and damage assessments during storms. The goal is to enhance the dissemination of hurricane-related information to the public and government. Research focuses on improving computational capabilities for efficient utility of multiple models in hurricane research to assist officials in determining evacuation circumstances and carrying out evacuations. The National Hurricane Research Initiative aims to enhance hurricane research capabilities by collaborating with various federal agencies, research institutes, universities, and disaster-response organizations. This includes working with entities such as NASA, NIST, DHS (including FEMA), and the Department of Energy. The National Hurricane Research Initiative coordinates activities with federal agencies like FEMA, Department of Energy, DARPA, EPA, USGS, and USACE. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy oversees the program's organizational structure. Grants can be awarded to government agencies or nongovernmental entities for research purposes. The Under Secretary and Director will develop best practices for projects funded under subsection (b) and organize national seminars to promote collaborative research. $285,000,000 is authorized annually from 2008 to 2018 for this section. SEC. 4. NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE DATABASE. The Under Secretary and the Director are required to establish a National Infrastructure Database to catalog and characterize physical, social, and natural infrastructure. This database will provide information to government officials, researchers, and help in measuring hurricane impacts and improving building codes and urban planning practices. The National Infrastructure Database is a virtual environment that provides necessary resources to users. $20,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2008 to 2018 for this purpose. SEC. 5. NATIONAL HURRICANE RESEARCH MODEL. The Under Secretary and the Director are required to develop a National Hurricane Research Model for integrative research and knowledge transfer to operational applications. The model will link theoretical, physical, and computational models from various fields, conduct experimental research on hurricanes, and produce measurable results in a comprehensive framework. It will be a distributed and coordinated working environment for research with a culture of interaction and collaboration. The section authorizes $130,000,000 annually from 2008 to 2018 for promoting interaction and collaboration in facilities, cyberinfrastructure, software integration, and data collection platforms."
