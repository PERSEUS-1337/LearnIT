    "content": "The Act titled \"Justice Exists for All of Us Act of 2013\" addresses state \"Stand Your Ground\" laws and neighborhood watch registration. The \"Justice Exists for All of Us Act of 2013\" prohibits states from having \"stand your ground\" laws allowing deadly force without a duty to retreat, except for domestic violence situations. States must also have laws against unlawful establishment of neighborhood watch programs. The \"Justice Exists for All of Us Act of 2013\" requires states to register neighborhood watch programs with local law enforcement and the Department of Justice. States must implement this section within 3 years of the Act's enactment, with possible extensions granted by the Attorney General. Failure to comply may result in consequences for the state. The \"Justice Exists for All of Us Act of 2013\" mandates states to register neighborhood watch programs with law enforcement and the Department of Justice. Failure to substantially implement this section may lead to a state losing 20 percent of allocated funds under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. The Attorney General will assess state compliance, considering any constitutional limitations. The Attorney General and the State must make good faith efforts to implement the section and resolve conflicts with the State's constitution. The Attorney General will consult with the State's chief executive and legal officer regarding the constitution and court rulings. The Attorney General may determine compliance with the Act if a State faces constitutional limitations by implementing alternative procedures. Non-compliance may result in funding reduction. Unallocated funds may be reallocated under specific conditions. The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 allows reallocation of funds to States that fail to implement a section, with funds withheld from non-compliant States used solely for implementation. The term \"State\" is defined in the Act. SEC. 3. STUDY ON \"STAND YOUR GROUND\" LAWS. The Attorney General will conduct a study on \"stand your ground laws\" within a year of this Act's enactment. The study will analyze the impact of these laws on violent death rates and whether women and minorities are disproportionately affected by the use of force authorized by these laws. The Attorney General will report the findings of a study on stand your ground laws to Congress within 180 days."
