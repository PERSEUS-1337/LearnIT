    "content": "Concerns have been raised about the number and variety of products created to document congressional activity, as well as the process for authorizing and distributing printed government documents to Members of Congress and other officials. These concerns reflect broader issues in information management due to significant transformations in printing, publishing, and information distribution, driven by electronic publishing and distribution in the past three decades. The Government Printing Office (GPO) has evolved from traditional paper-based document production to digital dissemination since its establishment in 1861. The enactment of P.L. 103-40 in 1993 mandated the production of electronic versions of Congressional Record and Federal Register, leading to the integration of new technologies into GPO's production processes. The Government Printing Office (GPO) has transitioned from paper-based to digital document production since its establishment in 1861. P.L. 103-40 mandated electronic versions of Congressional Record and Federal Register, leading to GPO providing access to congressional documents online through GPO Access website and Federal Digital System (FDsys) since 1994. The Government Printing Office (GPO) has shifted to digital document production since its inception in 1861. Currently, around 97% of U.S. Government documents are published electronically and available online. This shift has made congressional materials more accessible to a wider audience and has reduced resources needed for production. Some suggest that eliminating paper versions of congressional documents in favor of electronic versions could lead to cost savings and resource efficiency. The Government Printing Office (GPO) has transitioned to digital document production, with 97% of U.S. Government documents now published online. While electronic versions offer cost and resource savings, current laws and user demand still require paper-based documents for congressional proceedings. GPO oversees the distribution of congressional information in both electronic and printed forms, catering to different user preferences. The report provides an overview of issues related to the processing and distribution of congressional information by the Government Printing Office (GPO). It discusses funding, printing authorizations, current practices, and options for Congress. Additionally, it includes data on congressional printing appropriations, production, and distribution. Representative Christopher J. Lee introduced the STOP Act to address overprinting concerns. The STOP Act, H.R. 292, aimed to make bills and resolutions available in electronic format for Congress's use, with exceptions for printed copies requested by committees or members. It passed the House unanimously and was referred to the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. The PRINT Act of 2011, H.R. 1626, introduced by Representative Candace Miller, aims to limit the number of printed copies of the Congressional Record for archival purposes. Similarly, the STOP Act, S. 210, introduced by Senator Tom Coburn, seeks to make bills and resolutions available in electronic format for Congress's use. S. 674, the Congressional Record Printing Savings Act of 2011, introduced by Senator Coburn, aims to limit the number of printed copies of the Congressional Record for archival purposes. The Government Printing Office (GPO) serves as a centralized resource for gathering, cataloging, producing, and preserving published information for the federal government. The Government Printing Office (GPO) is funded through appropriations, a revolving fund, and sales of products. The appropriations bill funds three GPO accounts, with a majority going to the congressional printing and binding (CPB) account. Activities in the revolving fund and S&E accounts do not directly support congressional publishing. The CPB account funding has decreased from $164.3 million in 1985 to $93.73 million in 2010, partly due to savings from reduced staffing and increased electronic distribution. Congressional documents are created each Congress as required by statute or resolution. The distribution of congressional documents is determined by statute, resolution, or the Joint Committee on Printing. GPO can electronically distribute information upon request from a government entity. Special documents, like tribute books for deceased Members of Congress, can be authorized by the House or Senate. The House or Senate can authorize the publication of various documents, such as tribute books and commemorative documents. Examples include printing tributes to retiring Senators, commemorating late Presidents, and updating historical documents on Black Americans and Women in Congress. The Government Printing Office (GPO) reports its work volume in terms of pages and copies produced for congressional documents. Page production is influenced by congressional activity, such as the number of days in session, measures introduced, and hearings held. Demand for printing services increases with more activity, leading to higher page volumes for documents like the Congressional Record and bills. The Government Printing Office (GPO) categorizes its page production into various categories for congressional documents, including the Congressional Record, Miscellaneous Publications, Document Envelopes & Franks, Calendars, Bills, Resolutions & Amendments, Committee Reports, and Documents. These categories cover a range of legislative and procedural materials produced for Congress. The Government Printing Office categorizes its page production into various categories for congressional documents, including House and Senate documents with a congressional number, hearings, and committee prints. Data shows changes in page volume levels since 1985, with no consistent pattern across categories. Between 2006 and 2010, five categories increased in volume, while six decreased from 1985 to 2010. Some categories like bills, resolutions, and amendments, and committee reports showed increases, while others like daily record, calendars, and hearings decreased in both periods. All categories experienced significant volume changes over the two periods. Between 1985 and 2011, categories of congressional printing showed significant volume changes. The authorized number of copies for some products is set in statute, but the actual number printed is generally lower. The Congressional Record is published in fewer paper formats than authorized, reflecting Member needs. The differences in paper formats for congressional documents reflect Member needs. Concerns arise regarding the management and availability of public records in electronic form. The Joint Committee on Printing controls the Congressional Record's arrangement and style, ensuring it is a verbatim report of proceedings. Law authorizes printing in three formats: daily, semimonthly, and bound editions. The Congressional Record is printed in three formats: daily, semimonthly, and bound editions. The daily edition is available online and in paper form by 9 AM each day that Congress is in session. Over 23,000 copies are authorized, with the majority distributed to Congress. The distribution of the paper version of the daily edition of the Congressional Record has been declining every year since FY1985, with a total decrease of 83.21% between FY1985 and FY2009. The number of copies charged to CPB fell by 79.21% between FY1987 and FY2010, while the number of copies charged to agencies and subscriptions dropped by 83.94% during the same period. Between FY2005 and FY2010, the number of copies of the Congressional Record has decreased significantly, with a 21.28% drop for CPB copies and a 52.15% decrease for agencies and subscription copies. Table 3 and Table 4 provide data on the changes in copies produced and distribution from FY1985 to FY2010. In FY2009, approximately 4,242 copies of the daily edition were printed, with 73.5% charged to the CPB account. The decline in paper CPB copies distribution over the past 18 years may be attributed to the introduction of electronic versions. The introduction of electronic versions of the Congressional Record in 1994 led to a decrease in printed copies, with commercial firms also offering material electronically. In 1996, the House stopped distributing CPB copies, resulting in a sharp decline in copies produced and distributed by GPO. The distribution of CPB copies of the Congressional Record daily edition declined between 1987 and 2010. The bound edition is the official version, with GPO printing about 345 copies instead of the authorized 2,400. The semimonthly edition is no longer printed, but a semimonthly index is still produced. All bills and resolutions are printed at least once. The distribution of Congressional Record copies declined between 1987 and 2010. GPO prints various versions of bills and resolutions, with different numbers of printings required. Measures enacted into law are printed three additional times. The printing and distribution of measures vary by type, with fewer copies printed than authorized for most legislative measures. The distribution of printed copies of legislative measures is less than authorized, with GPO producing copies as directed by the House or Senate. Copies of most documents and reports are printed in smaller increments than specified in 44 U.S.C. 701. The Government Printing Office (GPO) produces authorized numbers of printed copies for documents and reports on bills and joint resolutions. Any adjustments to printing requirements can be authorized by legislation or committee order. GPO prints the number of copies requested for congressional documents. Congressional leaders have mentioned that distribution levels are based on available appropriations for printing costs. The reduction in printed congressional documents is attributed to newer printing technologies and the shift towards electronic information access. This has led to a smaller workforce at GPO, fewer printed copies, reduced paper consumption, and lower appropriations. While printing costs have decreased, it is uncertain if further reductions in print runs would significantly cut costs. Congressional printing practices must be changed through JCP rather than appropriations bills. The GPO estimates that prepress processes make up two-thirds of the cost of producing the Congressional Record, with printing, binding, and mailing making up the rest. For FY2011, the cost of producing one page of the Congressional Record is $782, with $532 allocated for prepress and $250 for printing. Potential savings from eliminating printed versions of congressional products are based on the distribution of prepress and printing costs. The distribution of prepress and printing costs for congressional products may result in modest cost savings if printing levels are reduced. However, this could limit access to paper-based documents for users without electronic access and raise concerns about preservation and retrieval of congressional records. Concerns have been raised about the retrieval of electronic congressional records and the costs of document conversion as technology evolves. The preservation of an official version of documents in a \"paperless\" system versus a hybrid system is also a concern. The Government Printing Office (GPO) provides hard copies of the Congressional Record, legislative measures, and laws passed by Congress. Electronic versions are available through the Legislative Information System (LIS) for congressional users and THOMAS for the general public. Congressional rules mandate that legislative measures be signed by the sponsoring Member before introduction and preserved as official documents. The bound Congressional Record, released up to four years after a Congress, is the official archival product. Any shift to electronic documents would need to consider document preservation. A shift to electronic documents in congressional activities would require verification and authentication procedures to ensure accuracy and legitimacy. Congress may need to consider maintaining the status quo, conducting studies, or enacting legislation regarding printing activities. As technology advances, more congressional users may access documents electronically, leading to a decrease in printed copies and potential cost savings. If no congressional action is taken, the Government Printing Office (GPO) will likely continue to integrate newer prepress technologies for potential reductions in printing costs. Congress could authorize studies on congressional printing policies, including how users access documents, distribution practices, and costs of creating paper and electronic documents. The curr_chunk discusses the costs of creating paper and electronic documents, congressional printing practices, and potential changes to transition to \"paperless\" operations. It suggests potential amendments to current printing authorizations and highlights discrepancies in printing authorizations. It also mentions entities that no longer exist but are technically entitled to printing services. Some officials, like Delegates from American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, may not be authorized to receive Congressional Record copies as other Members of Congress. Recipients may no longer need as many printed copies, suggesting they have adequate access or no longer require it. Congress could consider clearer instructions for production and distribution. Congress could consider clearer instructions for the production and dissemination of congressional information by GPO or other official entities."
