    "content": "The \"Entrepreneurial New and Small Business Capital Formation Act of 1995\" allows for the rollover of capital gains on certain small business investments under section 1045 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The section allows for nonrecognition of gain on the sale of eligible small business investments if the taxpayer elects, with specific rules and definitions provided. The term 'eligible small business investment' refers to stock or partnership interest in a domestic entity issued after December 31, 1994, meeting specific criteria. The rules for determining eligible small business investments include an active business requirement for corporations and partnerships. The term 'qualified small business entity' applies to domestic corporations or partnerships meeting certain criteria. The rules for eligible small business investments require that a partnership issuing stock or partnership interest must meet specific criteria: gross receipts less than $20,000,000, aggregate gross assets less than $25,000,000, and assets exceeding liabilities by less than $10,000,000 before issuance. The rules for eligible small business investments require that a partnership issuing stock or partnership interest must meet specific criteria: gross receipts less than $10,000,000, aggregation rules apply for determining gross receipts, and at least 80 percent of assets must be used in the active conduct of a trade or business. For eligible small business investments, entities engaged in startup activities, research expenditures, or in-house research expenses are treated as actively conducting a trade or business. Entities engaged in startup activities or research expenses are considered to be actively conducting a trade or business. Rules similar to section 1202(e) apply, and certain other rules from section 1202 also apply. Gain from a sale can be used to reduce the basis for determining gain or loss of any eligible small business investment purchased by the taxpayer. During a 6-month period, a taxpayer can purchase an eligible small business investment. If the taxpayer realizes gain from selling this investment and elects for nonrecognition of gain, the statute of limitations for assessing any deficiency will be extended to 3 years from the date the Secretary is notified of the taxpayer's cost of purchasing other eligible small business investments. The taxpayer's intention not to purchase other eligible small business investments within a 6-month period or a failure to make such purchase within that period may result in a deficiency assessment before the 3-year limitation. The Secretary will prescribe regulations to prevent avoidance of this section's purposes. The tax code is amended to include new sections 1045, with corresponding conforming and clerical amendments. Sec. 1045 allows for the rollover of gain on small business investments, effective for taxable years ending after December 31, 1994. Additionally, SEC. 3 introduces losses on eligible small business investments under section 1244A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. SEC. 1244A allows for losses on eligible small business investments to be treated as ordinary losses instead of capital losses. This provision applies to investments defined in section 1045(b) and ensures that such losses are attributable to a trade or business for tax purposes. Losses on eligible small business investments can be treated as ordinary losses instead of capital losses, effective for taxable years ending after December 31, 1994."
