Congress acknowledges the fundamental rights of all human beings, including the rights to life, liberty, and security, as well as the right to privacy, freedom of expression, and association. There is a concerning trend of violence against LGBT individuals globally, with many countries criminalizing same-sex relations and passing legislation targeting the LGBT community. Thousands of individuals face harassment, attack, arrest, and even murder based on their sexual orientation or gender identity every year.

Authorities have been complicit in abuses like arbitrary arrest, torture, and sexual abuse. Celebrations of LGBT individuals are forced underground due to inaction or harassment by law enforcement and government officials. Many countries are improving the protection of LGBT rights, despite laws hindering access to HIV/AIDS treatment for this community. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
