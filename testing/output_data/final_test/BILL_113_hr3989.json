    "content": "The \"Disaster Savings Accounts Act of 2013\" allows for deductions for contributions to disaster savings accounts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Disaster Savings Accounts Act of 2013 allows eligible individuals to deduct contributions to a disaster savings account up to $5,000 per taxable year. The term \"eligible individual\" refers to any individual who occupied. The Disaster Savings Accounts Act of 2013 allows eligible individuals to deduct contributions to a disaster savings account up to $5,000 per taxable year. A disaster savings account is a trust created for paying qualified disaster expenses, with specific requirements for contributions. The trustee must ensure that the trust assets are not invested in life insurance contracts and are not commingled with other property, except in a common trust or investment fund. The interest in an individual's account is nonforfeitable. Qualified disaster expenses include disaster mitigation and recovery expenses. Disaster mitigation expenses cover safe rooms, opening protection, reinforcement of connections, and roof coverings for impact resistance. The building code requirements for disaster mitigation include roof covering for impact, fire, or high wind resistance, cripple and shear walls for seismic activity, flood resistant materials, elevating structures above base flood elevation, fire resistant exterior walls, lightning protection systems, whole home standby generators, and other activities to mitigate risks of natural disasters. The term 'disaster recovery expenses' refers to expenses incurred to replace or repair disaster-related uninsured personal casualty losses totaling $3,000 or more. A 'disaster-related uninsured personal casualty loss' is a loss attributable to a federally declared disaster for which a deduction is allowable. A 'federally declared disaster' is defined by specific criteria. A disaster savings account is tax-exempt unless it ceases to be one, subject to certain taxes. Rules for account terminations are similar to those for traditional retirement accounts. Tax treatment of distributions from a disaster savings account is based on whether the funds are used for disaster mitigation expenses. Amounts used for qualified disaster expenses are not taxable, while any unused funds are included in the beneficiary's gross income. Excess contributions must be returned before the due date of the tax return. If excess contributions are made to a disaster savings account, distributions from the account are not subject to certain rules if the distribution is made before the tax return deadline and includes any attributable net income. The excess contribution to a disaster savings account results in any net income being included in the individual's gross income for that taxable year. An excess contribution is any contribution not deductible under this section. Additionally, there is an additional tax on distributions not used for disaster mitigation expenses from the account beneficiary. The disaster savings account of a beneficiary will be increased by 20 percent of the amount included in gross income. An exception applies if the beneficiary becomes disabled or dies. A rollover contribution must meet specific requirements. The disaster savings account beneficiary must deposit any received amount into the account within 60 days. There is a limitation on receiving multiple amounts within a year. The $5,000 amount in subsection (b) will be increased by a cost-of-living adjustment for the calendar year, rounded to the nearest multiple of $50. No deduction allowed under this section for individuals eligible for a deduction under section 151. No deduction allowed under section 151 for individuals eligible for a deduction under this section if the taxable year is less than 12 months. Rules similar to those in sections 219(d)(2), 219(f)(3), and 219(f)(5) apply. The IRS regulations outline various sections related to disaster savings accounts, including employer payments, community property laws, custodial accounts, transfer of account incident to divorce, and treatment after the death of the account beneficiary. No deduction is allowed under section 165 for a loss covered by a disaster recovery expense payment from a disaster savings account. The Secretary may require reports from the trustee of a disaster savings account regarding contributions. The IRS regulations cover disaster savings accounts, including contributions, distributions, excess contributions, and tax implications. A new deduction is allowed for disaster savings accounts under section 224. Section 4973 of the tax code is amended to include a tax on excess contributions to disaster savings accounts.
