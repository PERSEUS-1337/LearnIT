    "content": "The Asian Development Bank Act is amended to authorize a $461,000,000 contribution from the United States to the ninth replenishment of the Asian Development Fund. This contribution is to be made through appropriations Acts and there is an authorization of appropriations without fiscal year limitation for this purpose. SEC. 34. FIFTH CAPITAL INCREASE. The United States may subscribe to additional shares of the capital stock of the Bank, with authorized appropriations for payment by the Secretary of the Treasury. SEC. 2. REPORT ON REFORMS. Congress found at the G-20 Summit in Pittsburgh that additional capital for multilateral development banks must be tied to institutional reforms. The Asian Development Bank agreed to reforms to receive increased capital in the Fifth General Capital Increase. The Secretary of the Treasury must submit a report to specific Senate committees within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Senate and House committees will receive a report on the successful implementation of reforms by the Asian Development Bank for future capital increases as agreed at the G-20 Summit in Pittsburgh and in the context of the Fifth General Capital Increase. Resolution No. 336 aligns with the principles from the Pittsburgh G-20 summit. The Secretary of the Treasury must provide an update report to congressional committees within 18 months of the Act's enactment. SEC. 3. ENHANCING THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL EFFECTIVENESS OF ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS IN THE MEKONG RIVER BASIN. The Mekong River Basin is crucial for food security, with the largest inland fishery and productive wet rice cultivation. It is facing increased vulnerability to climate change impacts. Hydro power development without proper planning is a concern in the region. Individual projects need thorough assessments of environmental, socioeconomic, and sociopolitical impacts, including cumulative and transboundary effects. Without proper study, planning, and coordination, hydro power activities can have serious environmental, social, and political consequences, leading to food, livelihood, and human security gaps, especially for vulnerable populations, and potentially jeopardizing the region's peace and stability. The Secretary of the Treasury will instruct the US Executive Director of the Asian Development Bank to advocate for best practices in climate change adaptation, water management, and food security. They will also promote sustainable transboundary water management and coordination with other assistance programs in the Mekong River Basin to reduce risks to the region's environment and economy. The US will provide financial and policy support to the Mekong River Commission to transition to regional leadership in 2011. This includes fostering Asian Development Bank and bilateral donor support for the US Lower Mekong Initiative in areas like environment and infrastructure development, such as technology transfers for water monitoring and capacity building through workshops and simulations. Subregional centers will also be established. The US will provide support to the Mekong River Commission for regional leadership, including establishing subregional centers of excellence for education, training, and research on environmental, energy, and water management. Studies will assess the impact of climate change on water infrastructure projects in the Mekong River and its tributaries, as well as the viability of the Mekong Delta after upstream water development and rising sea levels. SEC. 4. CONFLICT SENSITIVITY. The policy of the United States is to advocate for conflict-sensitive lending practices by multilateral development banks in conflict or post-conflict countries to prevent exacerbating tensions and promote transparent distribution of project benefits. The United States promotes conflict-sensitive lending practices in multilateral development banks to prevent tensions, ensure transparent project benefits distribution, and strengthen reconciliation and awareness. The Secretary of the Treasury instructs the US Executive Directors to advocate for these policies. SEC. 5. POWER GUIDELINES. The United States policy discourages multilateral development banks from funding coal-fired power plants unless the bank helps the borrower country develop capacity to explore alternative energy options and assess their full costs, including social and environmental impacts. The bank must also evaluate the feasibility and financial resources of low-carbon alternatives. The multilateral development bank evaluates financial resources for low-carbon alternatives and electricity access for the poor. If no viable alternative to a new coal-fired power plant exists, the project must use the best available technology for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The project must address critical national security energy needs, respond to national emergencies, or overcome constraints on economic development. Projects in eligible countries must have well-developed plans to offset greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants. The plans for coal-fired power generation projects in countries not eligible for certain international financial assistance must meet specific conditions. If these conditions are not fully met, the US Treasury Secretary will instruct the US Executive Director at the relevant multilateral development bank to vote against providing any financial assistance for the project. If some but not all conditions are met, there may still be consideration for financial assistance. The US Treasury Secretary may instruct the US Executive Director at a multilateral development bank to vote against or abstain from providing financial assistance for a coal-fired power generation project if some conditions are not fully met. Additionally, the Secretary must submit an annual report to congressional committees on approved coal-fired power generation projects and financial assistance extended by multilateral development banks in the previous 2 years. The annual report to congressional committees includes a list of voting positions taken by the US Executive Director, analysis of conditions met, and details on abstaining votes for financial assistance. It also assesses efforts made by banks or borrowers to meet standards and suggests additional reasonable efforts. The Secretary of the Treasury is required to submit a 5-year report to congressional committees analyzing the impact and relevance of energy sector lending policies in multilateral development banks. SEC. 6. ENERGY SUBSIDIES AND GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE. Congress finds that inefficient fossil fuel subsidies encourage wasteful consumption, distort markets, reduce energy security, impede investment in cleaner energy sources, and undermine efforts to address climate change. The International Energy Agency estimates fossil fuel consumption subsidies cost approximately $557 billion annually. The poorest countries are most vulnerable to climate change impacts and least able to protect their populations. Multilateral development banks can play a role in addressing these issues. Multilateral development banks collaborate with stakeholders in developing countries to promote low-carbon growth and enhance climate change resilience for poverty alleviation. The US policy aims to phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies globally, support clean energy deployment in developing nations, and enhance climate resiliency efforts. The US policy aims to promote low-carbon growth, enhance climate change resilience, and support clean energy deployment in developing countries. The Secretary of the Treasury instructs international financial institutions to promote this policy, focusing on the poorest and most vulnerable countries."
