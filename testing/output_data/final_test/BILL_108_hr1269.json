    "content": "The Act titled \"Coal Energy Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 2003\" defines terms like \"cost and performance goals\" and \"Secretary\" for the purposes of the Act. Title I focuses on coal research and development programs. The Secretary is required to establish cost and performance goals for technologies enabling the cost-competitive use of coal for electricity generation, chemical feedstocks, and transportation fuel by 2007, 2015, and beyond 2020. Consultation with industry and interested entities is mandated in setting these goals. The Secretary is required to establish cost and performance goals for technologies enabling the cost-competitive use of coal for various purposes. This includes consultation with industry and interested entities in setting these goals. Additionally, a study is mandated to be conducted every two years to assess progress. The Secretary, with other Federal agencies, conducts a study to identify technologies and assess costs for achieving cost and performance goals. Recommendations for technology development programs are to be developed for cooperation with industry. The Secretary, in cooperation with industry, develops and demonstrates technologies to achieve cost and performance goals. Recommendations for additional authorities and changes to goals are made based on ongoing research. Expert advice from relevant entities is considered. The Secretary will conduct a program to advance coal-based power production and generation, aligning with various acts. The program aims to meet cost and performance targets. Authorization of appropriations is also provided. The Secretary is authorized to appropriate funds for the program under section 102, including innovations for existing plants, advanced combustion systems, carbon capture research, coal-derived fuels, and advanced separation technologies. There is a limit on the use of funds until 30 days after appropriation. The Secretary is authorized to appropriate funds for the program under section 102, including innovations for existing plants, advanced combustion systems, carbon capture research, coal-derived fuels, and advanced separation technologies. The funds cannot be used until 30 days after the Secretary transmits a report to Congress detailing the proposed use of the funds, including solicitation and evaluation of proposals, technical milestones for coal and related technologies, and how the programs will complement activities authorized under the Clean Coal Power Initiative. TITLE II--CLEAN COAL POWER INITIATIVE\n\nSEC. 201. PROJECT CRITERIA. The Secretary will fund coal energy generation projects that advance efficiency, environmental performance, and cost competitiveness beyond current technologies. Up to 80% of funds will be allocated for coal-based gasification technologies, with specific technical milestones set by the Secretary. The Secretary will set technical milestones for emissions levels in funded projects, aiming for coal gasification projects by 2020 to achieve specific emissions reductions and thermal efficiency targets. The Secretary will set technical milestones for emissions levels in funded projects, aiming for coal gasification projects by 2020 to achieve specific emissions reductions and thermal efficiency targets. Additionally, for coal projects, emissions restrictions will increase over time to achieve specific emission reduction goals by 2010. The Secretary will consult with relevant parties before setting technical milestones for emissions levels in funded coal projects. Thermal efficiency targets for coal of different Btu levels are specified, with increasing emissions restrictions to achieve specific reduction goals by 2010. In projects at existing coal-powered facilities, thermal efficiency improvements are required based on coal Btu levels. The Secretary may fund projects that involve carbon dioxide capture and separation. The Secretary will provide financial assistance to projects that meet specific criteria, including financial viability without additional federal funding, efficient use of award funds, and a demonstrated market for the technology. The Federal government will fund projects to reduce coal utilization costs, enhance coal competitiveness, and demonstrate applicable methods for electricity generation facilities. The Federal share of project costs will not exceed 50 percent. Technologies or emission reductions cannot be considered adequately demonstrated solely based on their use in this program. The use of technology or achievement of emission reduction by facilities receiving assistance under this title will not affect a statute unless specifically referenced. The Secretary is required to submit a report to Congress every 2 years detailing technical milestones and project statuses. Additionally, the Secretary will award grants to universities for establishing Centers of Excellence for Energy Systems of the Future to advance clean coal technologies. Authorization of appropriations is also included. The Clean Coal Power Initiative authorizes $200,000,000 annually from 2005 to 2013 for activities by the Secretary, with funds subject to appropriation and a report to Congress required on proposed fund use and funding levels assessment. The Clean Coal Power Initiative authorizes annual funding for the Secretary's activities, with detailed requirements for proposal solicitation, evaluation, technical milestones, and avoiding past program problems. The Secretary cannot use funds until a report is received, and certain projects are exempt from these requirements. Applicability of subsection (b) excludes projects selected before September 30, 2004."
