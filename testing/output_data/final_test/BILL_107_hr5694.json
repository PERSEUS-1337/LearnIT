    "content": "The \"National Renewable Energy Lands Act of 2002\" defines renewable energy as solar, wind, or geothermal power. Candidate sites are identified for renewable energy production facilities. The Congress finds that expedited development of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies in the US will increase energy independence and security. Renewable energy facilities have less environmental impact than conventional energy sources. The US has abundant solar, wind, and geothermal resources on Federal lands. Solar, wind, and geothermal technologies can be enhanced with integrated hydroelectric storage systems. The development and deployment of renewable energy technologies on Federal lands can be expedited in accordance with relevant laws. Evaluation of federal hydroelectric facility candidate sites. The Secretary of the Interior, through the Bureau of Reclamation and the Bureau of Land Management, will evaluate Federal hydroelectric facilities on Federal lands for potential interconnection with renewable energy generation facilities based on specific criteria. The Secretary of the Interior will evaluate Federal hydroelectric facilities on Federal lands for potential interconnection with renewable energy generation facilities based on specific criteria, including the value of increased ability to address multiple-use concerns and other criteria to be determined. Evaluation of Federal renewable energy production candidate sites. The Secretary of the Interior, with the Bureau of Reclamation and Bureau of Land Management, will evaluate potential renewable energy sites on Federal lands within a year. Criteria include proximity to existing hydroelectric facilities, suitable topography for solar, wind, or geothermal systems, absence of cultural/historic resources, and impact on wildlife. The Secretary of the Interior, along with the Bureau of Reclamation and Bureau of Land Management, will evaluate potential renewable energy sites on Federal lands based on criteria such as impact on wildlife, absence of impediments to development, and proximity to existing facilities. A list of qualified sites will be published for public comment for at least 90 days. SEC. 5. ENGINEERING FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS. The Secretary of the Interior, through the Bureau of Reclamation and the Bureau of Land Management, will conduct an engineering feasibility analysis for candidate sites. This analysis will include cost estimates for additional hydro-related transmission equipment, financial benefits of coordinating renewable energy facilities with hydroelectric facilities, and potential environmental benefits. Improved flexibility in hydrofacility water management due to collocated renewable energy systems may lead to environmental benefits for affected aquatic ecosystems. SEC. 6. LEASING. Upon completion of the engineering feasibility analysis, the Secretary of the Interior will make promising candidate sites available for long-term lease to renewable energy firms through a competitive bidding process. The Bureau of Land Management will advertise the terms and conditions of potential leases. The Director of the Bureau of Land Management shall publicly advertise the terms and conditions for long-term lease agreements for candidate sites. A request for proposals will be prepared to develop the identified sites, and leases issued will be for a minimum of 30 years. Lessees must commence construction of renewable energy facilities within 24 months of signing the lease and be capable of producing electric energy for sale within 36 months. The Comptroller General of the United States will investigate impediments to renewable energy projects on Federal lands and propose measures for their development. Upon contract expiration for Federal hydroelectric facilities, evaluation and implementation of renewable energy sources will be conducted according to defined criteria."
