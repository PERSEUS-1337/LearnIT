    "content": "The damaging effects of invasive species are well-documented, with examples like Burmese pythons in South Florida and Formosan termites in New Orleans. The extent of this \"bioinvasion\" is vast, making it challenging to manage or prevent. Legislation at the federal level is lacking, leaving a gap in addressing these problems. The federal government lacks comprehensive legislation to address invasive species, as states retain the right to regulate wildlife within their boundaries. This decentralized approach limits federal involvement in managing the problem of invasive species, which presents as disconnected crises. The report outlines the invasive species threat, methods of prevention or control, gaps in regulation, and options for congressional action. Laws addressing invasive species threats to agriculture are more developed than those protecting other industries or ecosystems. The responsibilities to protect agriculture from invasives are established in some U.S. regions but not others, with limited federal inspection systems and a reliance on self-reporting by importers. Laws protecting natural ecosystems are less developed, allowing for easy introduction of potentially harmful species without stringent proof of safety. The Lacey Act shifts burden of proof for imports, lacking centralized guidance for responding to new invasive species. Federal assistance is limited and fragmented, with a patchwork of laws and regulations addressing nonindigenous species. Federal efforts, including the National Invasive Species Council, have partially addressed invasive species issues by sharing information and developing policies. However, legislative focus has been on well-established problems rather than filling gaps in current laws. Various invasive species have caused severe economic impacts on U.S. industries and the environment, leading to a wide range of effects such as power outages, loss of property value, contamination of grain, spread of disease, and ecosystem disturbance. Examples of notorious invasive plants include kudzu, melaleuca, cordgrass, salt cedar, purple loosestrife, spotted knapweed, and Russian thistle, which have caused economic and ecological damage through various means such as lowering water tables, poisoning humans and livestock, decreasing crop yields, and increasing pest control costs. Invasive species, including invertebrates like gypsy moths and vertebrates like walking catfish, can lead to significant economic and ecological impacts. Some introducers intentionally brought species like kudzu and starlings to the U.S., causing harm to society. Introductions of non-native species, whether intentional or unintentional, can have detrimental effects on the economy, native fauna, and ecosystems. Both accidental and intentional introductions have led to catastrophic results, such as sea lampreys in the Great Lakes and pigs in Hawaii. The risk of a species becoming invasive is influenced by how similar the new site is to their original habitat. The risk of a species becoming invasive is influenced by the ecological similarity between its origin and the new site. Regions with similar climates and soils tend towards biological homogenization, creating a threat to each other's ecosystems. This process reverses the normal evolutionary pattern, leading to \"biosimilarity\" instead of biodiversity. Near neighbors are less likely to be a source of pests. Some ecosystems are more susceptible to invasive species due to factors like mild climate, geographic isolation, and disturbance of the natural landscape. Islands, remote lakes, and long-isolated areas with unique plants and animals are particularly vulnerable to invasive species. Canada and the United States share similar forests, making Canada less likely to be a source of forest pests for the US. Similarly, desert plants in the southwestern US are likely shared with Mexico, posing minimal threat to each other's native flora and fauna. Hawaii and Florida are highly susceptible to invasive species due to their unique plants and animals. Both states have many threatened and endangered species, as well as a large number of invasives. The mild climates in Hawaii and Florida make it easier for non-native species to survive, attracting businesses that import exotic animals and plants. Florida has seen numerous encounters with exotic animals, including Burmese pythons and monitor lizards. Florida has encountered various exotic animals, including Burmese pythons, monitor lizards, an emu, a kangaroo, serval cats, lemurs, and capuchin monkeys. The state's susceptibility to invasive species is heightened by its status as a major travel destination and transportation hub, increasing the risk of inadvertent introductions. Seaports like San Francisco Bay and Chesapeake Bay are particularly at risk due to the exchange of ballast water, which can lead to successful invasions by non-native species. The risk of invasive species is high in areas like airports with international traffic. Predicting pathways of invasion is possible, such as through brown tree snakes hiding in dark places. Beetles have drawn attention to pallet wood and packing crates as pathways for biotic invasion. Live animals or plants can carry harmful microorganisms, parasites, or seeds. Any living or untreated material could potentially introduce invasive species. Some well-known pathways for species invasions include transportation corridors like railroads, rivers, and highways. In the past, railroads were a major path for new plant establishment, while zebra mussels and Asian carp have spread through waterways. Interstate highways also contribute to the spread of invasive species. Additionally, intentional importation of non-native pets is another common pathway for invasive species introduction. The United States is a major importer of non-native pets, leading to potential escapes and introductions of species like apple snails, goldfish, and lionfish. Woody invasive plants were also introduced through the landscaping industry. Plants introduced by the landscape industry in the United States, such as water hyacinths, have spread widely, leading to criticism and increased regulation of invasive nursery plants. Concerns also exist about the escape of non-native aquatic species, like Atlantic salmon and Asian oysters, which could harm native species. The inadvertent introduction of diseases and pest species, deliberate release of fish into rivers for sport anglers, and intentional introduction of salt cedar from Central Asia into the American Southwest have led to ecological challenges and the need for control measures. The introduction of the salt cedar leaf beetle in 2005 by APHIS to control native cottonwood trees led to a reduction in tree populations. However, the presence of the beetle also affected the nesting habits of the endangered southwest willow flycatcher. Efforts to coordinate research on invasive species led to the formation of NIISS, which aims to facilitate collaboration and information sharing among researchers. The National Institute of Invasive Species Science, based at the U.S. Geological Survey Fort Collins Science Center, aims to develop cooperative approaches for invasive species science. It coordinates data and research to predict and reduce the effects of harmful non-native plants, animals, and diseases in the United States. Another organization, the North American Invasive Species Network, also focuses on invasive species research and collaboration. The North American Invasive Species Network (NAISN) is a non-profit organization formed in 2010 by university and government scientists from North America, including Mexico and Canada. Members include regional university centers, government institutions, and non-profit organizations with invasive species interests. NAISN aims to unify regional efforts into a single network to aid invasive species management and prevention across the continent. Its website offers videos on invasive plants and services focused on data collection. The consortium offers services focusing on data collection and coordination among agencies. Federal laws typically use black lists (allowing anything not listed) rather than white lists (excluding anything not listed). Predicting invasive species' abilities is challenging, considering factors like seed dispersal and nesting habits. The number of seeds produced by plants is a potential indicator of invasiveness. Propagule pressure and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) are strategies used to predict and prevent invasiveness of species. Various factors complicate prediction, but these methods help in analyzing critical points for invasion prevention. Scientists are still studying other factors that may increase invasiveness. Experts view all importations as suspect due to the lack of reliable predictors of invasiveness. A black list of species causing damage to fisheries, endangered species, or agriculture can be prepared based on experience. Preventing the spread of species in the United States may require public education, penalties for shippers, and monitoring. Black lists allow flexibility for industries reliant on importing new species but may not address introductions by unaware individuals. The white list approach aims to predict potential harm from non-native species before their arrival by considering known characteristics. Species not predicted to cause harm are added to a white list, while others are excluded. The existence of a list implies awareness of importing living organisms. Unintentional introductions may not be readily addressed. Many non-native species are intentionally introduced for economic benefits, despite potential ecological harm. Industries like agriculture, nursery, aquaculture, and pet rely heavily on non-native species. While some non-native species can cause ecological damage, others are beneficial. The economic impacts of many non-native species remain unknown. The economic benefits of intentionally introduced non-native species in industries like agriculture, nursery, aquaculture, and pet are vast. These species include food sources like cattle, chickens, honeybees, wheat, kiwi fruit, and soybeans, as well as ornamentals like tulips, chrysanthemums, and dawn redwoods. The introduction of these species was intentional, and their propagation was controlled. The economic benefits of these non-native species exceed many estimates for the annual costs of invasive species. Preventing introductions of invasive species is crucial as controlling them once introduced is challenging. Preventing introductions of invasive species is economically advantageous as controlling established invasive species is difficult and costly. International organizations have developed guidelines for the deliberate release of non-native organisms to assist regulatory bodies in determining the justification for introductions and managing risks. The guidelines developed by international organizations assist regulatory bodies in determining the acceptability of introducing non-native species, implementing necessary measures such as quarantines and inspections to prevent their entry. Quarantines focus on controlling entry pathways and can either prevent organisms from leaving the quarantine area or act on the source before arrival in the country. Quarantines and inspections are used to prevent the entry of invasive species into a country. They focus on controlling entry pathways, such as cargo and luggage inspections at ports of entry. APHIS is responsible for quarantines and inspections for agricultural pests, with some states and territories conducting their own programs. However, these measures may not be effective for all species, especially those entering through uncontrolled pathways or not yet recognized as pests. Control of invasive species involves eradication where possible and reduction to manageable levels where eradication is not possible. Early detection and rapid response are key, with the goal of eradicating small populations before they become established. Various methods, used intensively and in combination, can help prevent the spread of invasive species. To reduce an invasive species population, various methods such as cultural, mechanical, biological, chemical controls, and bounties can be used. Integrated pest management (IPM) combines pest control with ecological understanding for long-term prevention. Pesticides are a last resort after monitoring indicates their necessity. Integrated pest management (IPM) involves using a combination of methods, including cultural, mechanical, biological, and chemical controls, to manage pests effectively while minimizing risks to human health and the environment. Prevention is crucial in limiting the spread of invasive species early on, with practices tailored to the specific species and environment. To prevent the spread of invasive species, various methods can be used depending on the species and environment. This includes removing pests' sources of food, water, and shelter, blocking their access, implementing best management practices, identifying suspect plants or animals, preventing the introduction of seeds/eggs/organisms, detecting and eradicating outbreaks, minimizing disturbance of desirable vegetation, managing stand density and growing conditions, revegetating disturbed sites, and evaluating management periodically. To prevent the spread of invasive species, various methods can be used such as removing pests' food sources, blocking access, and implementing best management practices. Lethal substances like rotenone can be used in confined areas to target pests, while some species can be deterred by substances like tear gas or gasoline. These methods can create pest-free \"islands\" or prevent invasive species from leaving infested areas. Cultural controls in pest management involve modifying the environment to reduce pest spread, such as crop rotation, intercropping, and improved sanitation. Other methods include using barriers, electrifying surfaces, and implementing light to repel nocturnal animals. Cultural control methods in pest management include purchasing certified plants, soil solarization, tilling or mulching weeds, using resistant plant varieties, changing soil pH or fertility levels, irrigation practices, and using beneficial predators. These methods may require additional labor but are effective when combined with other control methods. Mechanical and physical controls involve manual techniques, mowing, mulches, barriers, and heavy machinery for pest removal. Mechanical and physical methods of pest control involve using specific tools, hot water or steam treatment, and steam sterilization of soil. These actions aim to kill pests directly or make the environment unsuitable for them. Mechanical controls also prevent the spread of invasive species by cleaning equipment and using certified weed-free seed and feed. These methods may require specialized equipment or labor commitment for effectiveness. Traps are used for managing invasive aquatic vegetation and rodents, but may be limited by cost and effectiveness on large bodies of water. Various trap designs are available, often used with bait or attractants. Traps may be successful in confined areas but have drawbacks in open situations with abundant alternative foods or low target species densities. Sticky traps have been used on rodents and cockroaches. Baits and attractants are used to draw target species towards a potential food or mate source for monitoring, trapping, or studying. Biological control organisms compete with, prey on, or cause disease in pest species, ideally targeting only the pest species. Biological control organisms are used to target specific pest species, requiring knowledge of both the target and control organism's biology. Laws and regulations govern their introduction, with concerns about potential harm to non-target species. An example is the introduction of mongooses in Puerto Rico to eradicate rats, leading to unintended consequences of harming native animals. Broad-feeding vertebrate animals are rarely used as biological control agents due to these risks. Fieldwork in the species' native habitat is often necessary. Biological control agents are used to target specific pest species, requiring knowledge of both the target and control organism's biology. Fieldwork in the species' native habitat is often necessary to identify effective disease or parasite control. Natural biological control can also occur through adaptive ecosystem response by native species to invasive species. Other forms of biological control may involve planting competing vegetation and managing livestock grazing. Grazing by sheep and goats can be an effective management tool for controlling leafy spurge. In integrated pest management (IPM) strategies, pesticides are a last resort after nonchemical methods have been exhausted. Pesticides are used in combination with other approaches for effective, long-term control while minimizing harm to humans, organisms, and the environment. Chemical control agents can be derived from manufactured (conventional) or natural (biological) sources, with preference for those targeting specific species to avoid harm to nontarget species. For example, TFM is specific in its toxicity. In integrated pest management, pesticides are a last resort after nonchemical methods. Chemical control agents can be derived from manufactured or natural sources, with preference for those targeting specific species. Biopesticides are derived from natural materials and can be divided into three major classes. EPA reports there were 430 registered biopesticide active ingredients in 2014. Biopesticides are derived from natural materials and can be divided into three major classes: pests are controlled by nontoxic mechanisms, microbial pesticides contain microorganisms as the active ingredient, and plant-incorporated protectants are produced by plants from added genetic material. They tend to be less toxic, effective in small quantities, decompose quickly, and target only specific pests. Users need to have knowledge about pests to use them effectively, and their use is commonly part of integrated pest management. Under a bounty system, individuals are paid to catch and kill target species, but high bounties may be needed for a significant impact. Paying bounties can create a market incentive to produce more invasive species. In some cases, drastic measures like removing or poisoning sites where invasive species live may be necessary. One drastic method to control invasive species is to remove or poison their living sites, which works best when the sites are isolated. For example, the Asian longhorn beetle has been eradicated in New Jersey and Illinois by removing trees where they feed. In California, hydrilla was eradicated by draining ponds and filling them with earth. Another technique involves using one species to detect the presence of invasive species, followed by other methods to eliminate them. Dogs trained to detect invasive species can be cost-effective at high-risk entry points like airports and cargo terminals. Current federal laws on invasive species are inconsistent, with stronger regulations in some areas like agriculture and ballast water. However, there is a lack of clear prevention measures across all foreseeable pathways, except for ship ballast water. Early detection and rapid response before a new species establishes itself are not adequately addressed by current laws. The National Invasive Species Council (NISC) is the focal point for federal efforts to control and prevent invasive species across various industries and ecosystems. However, gaps in authority and personnel continue to hinder efforts to limit the entrance and damage from invasive species. Congress could address these gaps by delegating authority to the President or crafting legislation. Without clear federal legal authority, information sharing under NISC and the National Institute for Invasive Species Science (NIISS) becomes crucial. The National Invasive Species Council (NISC) and the National Institute for Invasive Species Science (NIISS) play a crucial role in informing responsible parties about the risks of invasive species. Despite the efforts of agencies like APHIS, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the National Marine Fisheries Service, gaps in authority remain, particularly in regulating the release of species into the wild. APHIS lacks authority to control the release of non-native species like emus and ostriches, or regulate the sale of well-established species like English ivy. The sheer volume of imports raises questions about APHIS's oversight role. The Corps attempts to control aquatic plant species but lacks authority to prevent or regulate. The Corps lacks authority to prevent the release of invasive species, such as hydrilla and Asian carp, caused by aquarium hobbyists and fish aquaculturists. The Fish and Wildlife Service also lacks authority to protect ecosystems from invasive species, except for those regulated under the Lacey Act or that may harm endangered species. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) does not have the authority to stop the importation and release of introduced species that may harm protected species under the Endangered Species Act. FWS relies on evidence of injury before regulating species under the Lacey Act. FWS proposed a categorical exclusion under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to expedite listings under the Lacey Act, but the regulation has not been finalized. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has limited regulatory authority over inland waters, focusing mainly on anadromous species. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) lacks authority to prevent harmful introductions into marine ecosystems, focusing on anadromous species protected under the Endangered Species Act. Legislation to address invasive species could take a species-by-species or pathway approach. The difficulty lies in predicting the risk of species and the knowledge of their importation. Some agencies, like APHIS and FWS, are involved in addressing invasive species. Some agencies, such as APHIS and FWS, analyze the risk of invasive species, but face resource constraints. Faster assessments of species or pathways could enhance effectiveness. Regulation by pathway, like the Non-indigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act, prioritizes prevention over control of established species. The curr_chunk discusses the need for control of established invasive species, involving federal agencies, research, and regulations on ballast water exchange. Suggestions for policymakers include exploring pathways of invasives and cooperating with antiterrorism programs. The curr_chunk suggests creating panels of experts to analyze risks and make recommendations on planned releases of non-native species. This could help prevent unauthorized releases and provide public warnings on planned releases of exotic plants or game fish. The use of federal and other scientists' expertise could be a cost-effective option to prevent ill-advised introductions. An educational campaign, possibly targeting children, could help prevent inadvertent introductions of invasive species. A warning list of species, created by federal and state agencies, could provide information on species needing eradication or control. A gray list lacks regulatory force but could aid in early-phase control efforts. Unification of data and reporting from various agencies is crucial for creating a list of species requiring eradication or control. Industries reliant on importing non-native species should focus on cooperative methods to reduce introductions. Import-dependent businesses have successfully worked to minimize obstacles and prevent new ones, with avenues such as selling sterile animals or implementing educational programs at the point of sale to reduce risks of releasing pets or plants into the wild. A first strike prevention and control center could be authorized by Congress to address the risks of releasing pets or plants into the wild. The National Interagency Fire Center serves as a model for interagency coordination in responding to invasive species like the northern snakeheads in Maryland. Despite improvements in coordination, more progress is needed to effectively manage invasive species. A first strike prevention and control center, similar to the National Interagency Fire Center, could provide critical support for eradicating new invasive species. The National Park Service has implemented Emergency Plant Management Teams to address plant pests efficiently. Expanding this program with multi-agency teams could be more effective in managing new invasions without the need for each federal agency to create separate teams. The United States may take internal steps to prevent exporting invasive species, such as certifying products are pest-free. Disaster aid and relief shipments could inadvertently introduce diseases or pests, so precautions should be taken to reduce this risk. International cooperation is considered in the NISC management plan. The NISC management plan focuses on international cooperation to reduce the import and export of invasive species. It does not address unilateral actions by the United States or assess the impact on U.S. trade. Progress in this area is unclear, and these options may involve multiple committees in Congress. Opportunities for economic and ecological savings may arise from these actions."
