    "content": "The Constitution grants the President the power to make appointments with the Senate's advice and consent. Additionally, the Recess Appointments Clause allows the President to fill vacancies during Senate recesses. Alexander Hamilton described this power as a supplementary method of appointment. The Recess Appointments Clause allows the President to make temporary appointments when the Senate is not in session. This power has been used for administrative continuity and political purposes, including appointing judges to temporary positions. The appointment of judges through this clause has sparked controversy. The Recess Appointments Clause allows the President to make temporary appointments when the Senate is not in session, including appointing judges. The unique status of Article III judges creates a constitutional tension between the President's recess appointment authority and judicial independence, leading to recent litigation. Key issues include defining vacancies that may occur during the Senate's recess, determining the scope of the President's authority to make recess appointments. The Recess Appointments Clause allows the President to make temporary appointments to vacant positions during the Senate's recess. Attorney General opinions and judicial decisions have broadly interpreted this clause, allowing for appointments to all vacancies that exist during the recess. The meaning of \"the Recess of the Senate\" has also been subject to interpretive difficulties. The Recess Appointments Clause allows the President to make temporary appointments during the Senate's recess. Attorney General opinions have differed on when these appointments can be made, with a shift in interpretation occurring in 1921. Attorney General Knox initially limited recess appointments to intersession recesses, but this was later expanded by Attorney General Daugherty to include appointments during shorter recesses. The Daugherty opinion emphasized the functional approach to recess appointments, rejecting the idea of intrasession appointments during brief adjournments. It stated that an adjournment of 5 or 10 days does not constitute the recess intended by the Constitution. The opinion also highlighted the potential for abuse of discretion in presidential appointments. Subsequent Attorney General and Department of Justice opinions have supported this interpretation. The Office of Legal Counsel opinions support the constitutionality of intrasession recess appointments, stating that the clause covers recesses exceeding three days. The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 governs appointments outside the Recess Appointments Clause, specifying who can temporarily fill vacant offices and for how long. This Act has roots dating back to a 1795 law limiting temporary assignees to six months in office. The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 governs appointments outside the Recess Appointments Clause, specifying who can temporarily fill vacant offices and for how long, with roots dating back to a 1795 law limiting temporary assignees to six months in office. Regarding recess appointments, 5 U.S.C. \u00a75503 establishes rules for appointees during a recess, including salary payment restrictions until Senate confirmation, with exceptions for certain circumstances. The Senate must receive a nomination to fill a vacancy within 40 days of the next session. Restrictions on salary payment for recess appointees have been in place for over 60 years to limit the President's recess appointment power. These limitations indirectly control recess appointments by targeting appointee compensation. The constitutionality of these restrictions has not been decided in court. In Staebler v. Carter, concerns were raised about the constitutionality of restrictions on the President's recess appointment power under 5 U.S.C. \u00a75503. Over 300 recess appointments have been made to the federal judiciary, with only four since 1960. Despite controversy, legal challenges to judicial recess appointments have been limited, and the Supreme Court has not addressed the issue. The first legal challenge to President Eisenhower's recess appointment of John M. Cashin as a U.S. district judge arose during the trial and conviction of Dominic Allocco. Allocco argued that Judge Cashin was not constitutionally empowered to preside over the trial, questioning the President's authority to appoint \"temporary\" judges and fill vacancies in the judiciary during Senate sessions. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit addressed these arguments in United States v. Allocco. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that judicial vacancies are not excluded from the Recess Appointments Clause, allowing the President to make recess appointments of judges. They also determined that the President's recess appointment power extends to offices that become vacant while the Senate is in session. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit considered the constitutionality of President Carter's intersession recess appointment of Walter Heen as a U.S. District judge for Hawaii in 1980. They concluded that only judges with Article III protections can exercise judicial power. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that only judges with Article III protections can exercise judicial power, emphasizing the importance of judicial independence over historical practices of judicial recess appointments. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that judicial recess appointments, while widely accepted, were unconstitutional as they violated Article III's requirement for judges to have life tenure and protection against compensation diminution. The en banc decision overturned the panel's ruling in a 7-4 vote. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the Recess Appointments Clause in Article II allows the President to fill judicial vacancies during Senate recesses, citing the equal validity of all Constitution provisions. They emphasized that over 300 judicial recess appointments have been made in history, supporting the constitutionality of such appointments. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the constitutionality of judicial recess appointments, citing historical precedent and rejecting the panel's reliance on the INS v. Chadha decision. They deemed the legislative veto as an impermissible statutory methodology and emphasized the President's power under Article II. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the constitutionality of judicial recess appointments, citing historical precedent and rejecting the panel's reliance on the INS v. Chadha decision. They emphasized the President's power under Article II, concluding that the recess appointee was an extraordinary exception to the prescriptions of Article III. The Supreme Court denied certiorari in Woodley, ending formal legal proceedings. Judge Heen's recess appointment expired at the end of the first session of the 97th Congress, and he was not re-nominated for appointment. President Clinton made a recess appointment of Roger L. Gregory to the Fourth Circuit in 2000, which faced Senate disapproval but was not litigated. George W. Bush also made recess appointments in 2004, selecting Charles W. Pickering for the Fifth Circuit and William H. Pryor for the Eleventh Circuit. These appointments filled vacancies designated as \"judicial.\" President Clinton made a recess appointment of Roger L. Gregory to the Fourth Circuit in 2000, which faced Senate disapproval but was not litigated. George W. Bush also made recess appointments in 2004, selecting Charles W. Pickering for the Fifth Circuit and William H. Pryor for the Eleventh Circuit. The President noted that the appointments were justified due to \"unprecedented obstructionist tactics\" in the Senate, which were deemed harmful to the judicial system. The Pryor appointment, made during a brief intrasession recess, was particularly controversial, as it was one of only fourteen intrasession recess appointments to Article III courts. Intrasession appointments by Presidents were rare before 1943, with only three instances noted. The appointment of Pickering and Pryor during a recess led to legal scrutiny, with the constitutionality of Judge Pryor's appointment being considered by the Eleventh Circuit in Evans v. Stephens. The court determined that recess appointments of judges to Article III courts are authorized by the Constitution, citing historical evidence to support this view. The court supported the constitutionality of recess appointments to the federal judiciary, citing historical evidence and stating that temporary judges appointed under the Recess Appointments Clause are an exception to Article III. The purpose of the clause was to keep important offices filled and government functioning. The court upheld the constitutionality of recess appointments to the federal judiciary, stating that temporary judges appointed under the Recess Appointments Clause are an exception to Article III. President Bush's appointment of Judge Pryor during a legitimate Senate recess was deemed constitutionally permissible. The court accepted historical evidence and the purpose of the clause, concluding that the President's interpretation was correct. The court upheld the constitutionality of recess appointments to the federal judiciary, stating that temporary judges appointed under the Recess Appointments Clause are an exception to Article III. Historical precedent and the purpose of the clause supported the President's interpretation, allowing for appointments during intrasession recesses without a minimum time requirement. The court upheld the constitutionality of recess appointments to the federal judiciary, allowing for appointments during intrasession recesses without a minimum time requirement. The decision concluded that the President did not exceed his constitutional authority in appointing Judge Pryor to an Article III court. Judge Pryor may lawfully sit with the court and exercise all powers of a United States Circuit Judge during his term of office. The decision in Evans upheld the constitutionality of recess appointments to the federal judiciary, allowing for appointments during intrasession recesses without a minimum time requirement. Judge Barkett dissented, arguing for a restrictive interpretation of the term \"happen\" in the Recess Appointments Clause. He contended that the President should only be empowered to make appointments during the recess in which they occur. The dissent in Evans did not address the constitutionality of judicial recess appointments or the validity of intrasession recess appointments, as the vacancy filled by Pryor did not occur during the recess in which he was appointed. Judge Barkett's dissent emphasized the need for a literal interpretation of the Recess Appointments Clause to prevent the President from bypassing the Senate's role in reviewing nominees. This concern applies to both Article III and intrasession appointments. The Senate's authority in judicial recess appointments is highlighted by the Eleventh Circuit's broad interpretation of the President's recess appointment power. This could potentially allow the President to bypass Senate confirmation by making intersession or intrasession recess appointments to any position. The President's ability to make successive recess appointments during short recesses could allow appointees to serve throughout an Administration without Senate confirmation. This broad interpretation of the recess appointment power extends to all vacancies and recesses, with few exceptions. The Supreme Court denied certiorari in Evans on March 21, 2005, with Justice Stevens emphasizing that the denial did not rule on the merits of the constitutional questions raised by the case regarding the President's intrasession appointment power. The Supreme Court's denial of certiorari in Evans did not address the constitutional questions surrounding the President's authority to make recess appointments, as highlighted by Justice Stevens. There is a range of opinions among judges regarding the Recess Appointments Clause, including the scope of the President's general authority. Justice Stevens also noted the presence of significant constitutional questions in this area. The Supreme Court's denial of certiorari in Stephens highlighted significant constitutional questions regarding the President's recess appointment power and its impact on judicial independence under Article III."
