    "content": "The Hardest Hit Fund (HHF) was created in 2010 to prevent home mortgage foreclosures during the housing and mortgage market turmoil of 2007-2008. It provided funding to 19 states to design initiatives tailored to prevent foreclosures. The HHF remains active, with participating states having until December 31, 2020 to use their funds. Established under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, the HHF was part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) authorized by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 authorized the creation of the Hardest Hit Fund (HHF) to prevent home foreclosures. The Treasury allocated $9.6 billion from TARP funds to the HHF for foreclosure prevention initiatives. The Hardest Hit Fund (HHF) received $9.6 billion from TARP funds, allocated to selected states through five rounds of funding. The first four rounds totaling $7.6 billion were allocated in 2010. Additional $2.0 billion was authorized in 2016, bringing the total HHF funding to $9.6 billion. 19 states (including DC) received funds through the HHF for foreclosure prevention initiatives. The Hardest Hit Fund (HHF) provided funding to states hardest hit by the housing and financial crisis of 2007-2008. Five rounds of funding were allocated, with the first four rounds in 2010 and an additional round in 2016 using unused TARP funds. The first round allocated $1.5 billion to states with the greatest home price declines, while the second round allocated $600 million to states with high economic distress. In 2010, the Hardest Hit Fund provided funding to states with high economic distress. Round Three allocated $2 billion to 17 states with unemployment rates above the national average. Round Four provided $3.5 billion to 19 states that had received funding in earlier rounds. In early 2016, after Congress authorized Treasury to provide an additional $2 billion in TARP funds to the program, Treasury allocated this amount to participating states through two phases: Round 5, Phase 1: In February 2016, Treasury allocated $1 billion to participating states based on their population and utilization of previous HHF funds. States had to have used at least 50% of the HHF funding they previously received to be eligible for this funding. Each participating state except Alabama received additional funding in this phase. Round 5, Phase 2: In April 2016, Treasury allocated $1 billion competitively to participating states. All but six participating states received additional funds through this phase. Five states did not apply for funding (Alabama, Arizona, etc.). In early 2016, Treasury allocated $2 billion in TARP funds to participating states through two phases. States had to have used at least 50% of previous HHF funding to be eligible for additional funds. Each participating state except Alabama received extra funding. HHF funds are provided to state housing finance agencies to design programs addressing foreclosures tailored to local conditions. Programs must meet EESA requirements and be approved by Treasury. States receiving third round HHF funding must use it for foreclosure prevention programs targeting the unemployed. State HHF programs targeting the unemployed include Mortgage Modification, Principal Reduction, Mortgage Reinstatement, Unemployment Assistance, and Transition Assistance. Over 80 HHF programs were in 19 states as of December 2016, with each state using funds for multiple program types. Eligibility criteria vary by state for these programs. Transition Assistance, Second Lien Assistance, Blight Elimination, and Down Payment Assistance are some of the ways funds from State HHF programs can be used to prevent foreclosures and support borrowers in various ways. These programs aim to provide relocation payments, modify or extinguish second mortgages, address vacant and abandoned homes, and offer down payment assistance to encourage home buying activity. States have the flexibility to use funds for other approved foreclosure prevention programs as well. States participating in the Hardest Hit Fund (HHF) program can use funds for various foreclosure prevention programs approved by Treasury. As of December 2016, participating states had drawn $7 billion of the total $9.6 billion HHF allocation and disbursed about $5.8 billion. Oregon disbursed the highest share (about 80%) while Alabama disbursed the smallest share (just over 30%). Over 290,000 homeowners had been assisted through the HHF by December 2016, excluding blighted properties removed through some states' programs. States participating in the Hardest Hit Fund (HHF) program must use their funds by December 31, 2020, as set by Treasury. If states fail to meet spending deadlines, Treasury may reallocate funds. Quarterly Program Performance Summaries on Treasury's website show how funds are being used by states. The Hardest Hit Fund (HHF) program requires states to use their allocated funds by December 31, 2020, or risk reallocation by the Treasury. Quarterly reports from the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP) provide oversight on HHF programs, with links on Treasury's website directing to state websites for more information on how eligible homeowners can apply."
