The Act \"Sound Science for Endangered Species Act Planning Act of 2001\" amends definitions and provisions of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, emphasizing the use of empirical or peer-reviewed scientific and commercial data for decision-making. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to require the use of sound science in listing species. Criteria for scientific studies and field data observation are established to support determinations of endangered or threatened species. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to include data from landowners obtained through species observation on their land. Sound science is mandated for recovery planning and listing determinations of endangered or threatened species. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to include additional scientific and commercial data for the preparation of a recovery plan. Interested parties are invited to submit data to the Secretary, who will then acquire additional data for consideration by the recovery team in accordance with section 5. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to include additional scientific and commercial data for the preparation of a recovery plan. Interested parties can submit data to the Secretary for consideration by the recovery team. SEC. 3. PEER REVIEW. Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to include Independent Scientific Review Requirements for actions related to endangered or threatened species. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to include Independent Scientific Review Requirements for actions related to endangered or threatened species, including the determination of proposed actions likely to harm listed species and the proposal of alternative solutions by qualified individuals with expertise in biological sciences. The Secretary must appoint independent scientific reviewers who have no conflicts of interest, are not involved in any related petitions or determinations, and have no financial interests opposing the action. Recommendations for reviewers will be sought from the National Academy of Sciences to maintain a list of qualified individuals. Before finalizing any action, the Secretary must appoint 3 independent scientific reviewers randomly selected from a list maintained by the National Academy of Sciences. The reviewers will provide their opinion on the scientific information within 3 months and will be compensated for their work. Their selection and activities are not subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Secretary must appoint 3 independent scientific reviewers to provide their opinion on relevant scientific information and assumptions within 3 months. The final determination will include a summary of the independent scientific review and an explanation if the majority recommendation is not followed. The report of the peer reviewers must be included in the official record of the proposed action and available for public review before the comment period closes. Improved recovery planning is emphasized in Section 4. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to include the active solicitation and consideration of information from State agencies in consultations. Additionally, the Secretary is required to provide opportunities for participation in consultations to any person involved. The Secretary must allow anyone seeking authorization or funding from a Federal agency for an action subject to consultation to provide relevant information before a draft biological opinion is developed. This includes discussing the effect of the proposed action on the species and potential alternatives to avoid violating regulations. The Secretary must provide information on the status of the species, threats, and conservation measures used to develop the biological opinion, and allow access to the draft opinion upon request. The Secretary must provide information on the status of the species, threats, and conservation measures used to develop the biological opinion, and allow access to the draft opinion upon request. If reasonable and prudent alternatives are proposed by a person, the Secretary must explain why those alternatives were not included in the final biological opinion. Public access to information is ensured for comments and other submissions related to seeking authorization or funding for an action. The Secretary maintains a file for each action and makes the information available to the public, subject to specified exemptions."
