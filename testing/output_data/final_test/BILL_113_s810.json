Congress finds that over 30,000 members of the Armed Forces and veterans have committed suicide since 2009. In 2012, 349 members of the Armed Forces died by suicide, surpassing the number of combat-related deaths. Additionally, over 6,000 veterans took their own lives in the same year. During a 2013 hearing, Jacqueline Garrick from the Defense Suicide Prevention Office highlighted these alarming statistics. The Department of Defense stated that less than half of suicide victims had deployed, with other risk factors like relationships, legal issues, and substance abuse playing a larger role. As combat operations in Afghanistan are reduced, tools to identify suicide risk in Armed Forces members should be prioritized. The Secretary of Defense is required to implement a pilot program for this purpose. The Secretary of Defense is mandated to conduct a pilot program using an online computerized assessment to detect behaviors indicating suicide risk or mental health conditions in members of the Armed Forces. The program will involve 1,000 members each from the regular components of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, as well as 500 members each from the Army Reserve and Army National Guard. The pilot program will involve 500 members each from the Army National Guard, Navy Reserve, Air Force Reserve, Air National Guard, and Marine Corps Reserve. Participants will undergo two online assessments to detect behaviors indicating suicide risk or mental health conditions. The pilot program involves 500 members from various branches of the military who will undergo online assessments to detect suicide risk or mental health conditions. Assessments will cover work performance, substance abuse, financial matters, and relationships. Timing of assessments coincides with annual health assessments required by the Department for participants. Command questionnaires on member behavior will also be conducted by superiors. The pilot program involves 500 military members undergoing online assessments to detect suicide risk or mental health conditions. Questionnaires on member behavior will verify information provided in assessments. Referrals to mental health care providers will be made for those showing risk indicators. Control groups will be established for the program. The pilot program involves 500 military members undergoing online assessments to detect suicide risk or mental health conditions. Referrals to mental health care providers will be made for those showing risk indicators. The Secretary shall establish control groups for comparison. Privacy of information obtained on members will be protected. No information obtained may be used for promotion or other benefits. The report on the pilot program must exclude personally identifiable information on members and be submitted to Congress within 180 days of completion of assessments. It should include a detailed description of the assessments and questionnaires used. The report on the pilot program must include a summary of behaviors detected, number of members at risk of suicide or mental health conditions, care and services provided, and number of members who committed suicide. The report on the pilot program must include a comparative analysis of suicide rates among participants, control groups, and the general Armed Forces population, along with recommendations for extension or expansion. The report on the pilot program must include recommendations for extension or expansion, such as incorporating online computerized assessments into annual health assessments for service members. The term \"appropriate committees of Congress\" refers to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives."
