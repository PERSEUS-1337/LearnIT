    "content": "The U.S. agricultural and food infrastructure is crucial for economic growth. A terrorist attack could harm public trust and the nation's ability to provide food. Zoonotic diseases can infect humans, leading to research for medical countermeasures. The USDA conducts research on animal diseases, including highly contagious pathogens, to protect against outbreaks. The Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC) in New York was historically used for research, but the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) now operates it. DHS and USDA have separate research programs at PIADC. DHS considers PIADC outdated for biodefense and agroterrorism research, as per Homeland Security Presidential Directive 9 (HSPD-9). The Secretaries of Agriculture and Homeland Security are tasked with developing a plan for advanced biocontainment laboratories to research and diagnose foreign animal and zoonotic diseases. The Department of Homeland Security will establish the National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) to meet these obligations. The Department of Homeland Security plans to establish the National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) in Manhattan, Kansas, to conduct research on pathogens. Congressional and public concerns have been raised about the safety, security, and coordination of research at NBAF, as well as the increasing costs. This report outlines progress, funding requirements, timelines, and policy issues for Congress to consider. The Department of Homeland Security plans to establish the National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) in Manhattan, Kansas for research on pathogens. Key issues for Congress include the scope of the laboratory, consequences of a pathogen release, response plans, interagency coordination, construction timelines, and community safety concerns. The new NBAF will exceed the capacity and capability of the current facility, PIADC, with 10% of its space dedicated to BSL-4 laboratories for experiments requiring higher biocontainment levels. Multiple uses and goals are envisioned for the facility, including serving as a unique BSL-3 and BSL-4 livestock laboratory. The new facility, NBAF, in Manhattan, Kansas, will focus on researching pathogens such as foot and mouth disease, classical swine fever, African swine fever, Rift Valley fever, Nipah virus encephalitis, Hendra virus disease, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, and Japanese encephalitis. Research will involve studying how these pathogens enter animals, their effects on cells and animals, and testing newly developed countermeasures. The DHS issued a Request for Expressions of Interest for hosting NBAF in January 2006. 18 sites were selected for further evaluation in August 2006. An intergovernmental review group evaluated these sites, and in July 2007, five sites were chosen as finalists for further analysis. Plum Island was added as a selected site despite not being evaluated during the review process. After selecting final sites for NBAF, potential irregularities in the selection process were identified. Some highly rated sites were rejected in favor of those with lower ratings. DHS claimed decisions were based on factors beyond documented criteria. EIS development involved public hearings and comments. Manhattan, Kansas was chosen as the site in January 2009 based on EIS and other analyses. Other studies used included Threat and Risk Assessment, Site Cost Analysis, and Site Characterization. The selection of the NBAF site in Manhattan, Kansas was based on various studies and analyses, including Threat and Risk Assessment, Site Cost Analysis, and Site Characterization. The selection criteria considered factors such as proximity to research capabilities, workforce, cost, community acceptance, threat and risk, and environmental impacts. The DHS gave more weight to the site's proximity to research facilities related to NBAF's mission. The DHS provided a NBAF project schedule with milestones, timeline, and funding requirements. The initial cost was $451 million with operations starting in 2010, but later projections increased the cost to $915 million. Construction is expected to be completed in 2015 with full operation in 2017, but potential delays could impact costs and future appropriations. The construction cost for the preferred site of the NBAF project is estimated to be $725 million, which is $274 million or 60% higher than the 2005 baseline projection. This cost includes $173 million in infrastructure upgrades and other site-specific costs, as well as $100 million in non-site-specific costs. Choosing a mainland site may help offset some of the construction costs by selling Plum Island. The DHS plans to offset NBAF construction costs by selling Plum Island, which will require deconstruction, decontamination, and remediation. Expenses for this process, along with relocating equipment and projects, are estimated at $190 million. The DHS is seeking $61 million in FY2013 for PIADC decontamination and decommissioning planning. Contributions from the Heartland BioAgro Consortium may lower NBAF construction funding requirements, with an expected $110 million investment in infrastructure upgrades. Actual NBAF funding did not meet early projections, with appropriations lower than initially projected in 2005. Funding for NBAF studies began in FY2006 and FY2007, with Congress appropriating $23 million each year for site selection and pre-construction activities. Additionally, there was a $125 million rescission of unobligated prior year appropriations in FY2007. In FY2008, Congress appropriated $11 million for environmental studies to select a site for NBAF. In FY2009, Congress fully funded the President's $35.6 million request for NBAF construction. In FY2010, Congress appropriated $32 million for NBAF construction and a National Academy of Sciences study. The 110th Congress passed legislation allowing DHS to conduct FMD virus research on the mainland and sell Plum Island. The 2008 farm bill requires the Secretary of Agriculture to provide DHS a permit for live FMD virus possession on the U.S. mainland at a single facility. The 2009 Consolidated Security Act mandates the sale of Plum Island if DHS chooses a mainland site for NBAF. NBAF raises policy issues such as laboratory scope, pathogen release consequences, response plans adequacy, interagency coordination, construction timelines, PIADC and Plum Island disposition, and community safety concerns. In response to congressional mandate, USDA recognized the need for a BSL-4 facility capable of handling large animals as early as 1999. The National Research Council (NRC) also emphasized the urgency of replacing the aging PIADC facility. USDA and DHS have expressed the need for a new BSL-4 facility, but have not publicly detailed their space requirements for it. The DHS, USDA, and HHS developed site criteria and requirements for the NBAF to support research in high-consequence animal diseases. The facility is projected to be over 500,000 gross square feet, with 55,000 square feet designated as BSL-4 laboratory space. The NBAF will be more than twice the size of the PIADC, meeting the requirements of HSPD-9 and providing modern facilities for research activities. The expanded laboratory space at NBAF may pose challenges for federal research planners, requiring efficient interagency cooperation to utilize BSL-4 and BSL-3Ag laboratories effectively. DHS and USDA may need to increase investment in research areas currently done at PIADC to fill the expanded capacity. Additional funding may be needed for experiments requiring BSL-4 laboratory space, potentially diverting funds from BSL-2 and BSL-3 experiments. The DHS and USDA may need to analyze their current and future BSL-3 BSL-3Ag and BSL-4 research requirements to effectively use NBAF. Pathogen release is a potential risk at high-biocontainment laboratories, but guidelines are in place to reduce the probability of accidental or intentional release. HHS and USDA guidelines aim to protect workers and minimize accidental pathogen release based on the properties of the pathogen and experiments being conducted. The established biocontainment levels have increasing levels of rigor, and laboratories adhere to these protocols. Accidental releases and occupational exposures have occurred at high containment labs. Examples of pathogens being found outside containment areas have been documented. Laboratory workers have been exposed to various pathogens since 2004. Congress authorized \"select agent\" regulations in response to security concerns. Additional biocontainment failures are acknowledged by the DHS. The \"select agent\" regulations by USDA and HHS identify pathogens and toxins posing severe threats to public, animal, or plant health. Entities handling these select agents must develop security plans, register with USDA APHIS, and pass security reviews. Critics worry about the adequacy of these protections. Government investigations have found laboratories not complying with select agent rules, leading to fines and suspensions. Pathogens have been accidentally released from high containment labs, raising concerns about potential consequences. The NBAF Environmental Impact Statement addresses the consequences of a foreign animal disease pathogen release from high containment laboratories. The analysis focuses on economic impacts rather than public health, using a limited model to estimate effects of three pathogens. The DHS analyzed the economic impact of potential outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease virus, Rift Valley fever virus, and Nipah virus at NBAF. They found that trade reduction following an FMD outbreak would have a significant economic impact, ranging from $2.8 billion to $4.2 billion. Other studies have also estimated similar costs for FMD outbreaks. The DHS analyzed the economic impact of potential outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease virus, Rift Valley fever virus, and Nipah virus at NBAF. Trade reduction following an FMD outbreak would have a significant economic impact, ranging from $2.8 billion to $4.2 billion. The EIS does not contain an independent estimate of the economic consequences of an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF), but the RVF Working Group estimated the economic impact of a RVF outbreak at multiple sites as $50 billion. Policymakers are faced with a wide range of information regarding the potential for a pathogen release, with the DHS asserting that modern biocontainment equipment and approaches will ameliorate the effects of any potential release. The GAO, however, asserts that the risk of a pathogen release may be minimized but not eliminated. The potential economic effects of a disease outbreak may vary depending on how it manifests. Policymakers question if they have enough information to decide on siting the NBAF on the mainland and if the benefits outweigh the risks of a pathogen release. The USDA has a plan to contain outbreaks from a mainland site, considering factors like outbreak size and detection methods. The plan includes eradicating potentially infected wildlife. The federal government lacks a comprehensive response plan for a Rift Valley fever outbreak, with no assets for vector control. Local mosquito abatement agencies would need to be relied upon in the event of an outbreak, as there are no agreements in place for military involvement in vector-borne disease response plans. The federal government is making progress on addressing the needs of a disease response plan, particularly in relation to NBAF operations. U.S. researchers historically studied contagious animal diseases on an island due to concerns about pathogen spread, but advancements in biocontainment technology now allow for safe research on the mainland. Policymakers are questioning the efficacy of water barriers and air currents in preventing pathogen spread. In the context of NBAF siting and construction, policymakers face a tradeoff between increased infection risk following a pathogen release versus lower costs and operational efficiency. DHS highlighted the risk of pathogens spreading from proposed mainland sites, with Plum Island being the only low-risk option. The DHS highlighted the risk of pathogens spreading from proposed mainland sites, with Plum Island being the only low-risk option. Modern biocontainment technology can prevent accidental releases, but accidents due to human error or maintenance failures could still occur. Some analysts suggest research on certain agricultural pathogens should only be done in geographically isolated laboratories. Denmark, Germany, and Australia made decisions regarding the location of foot and mouth disease laboratories based on risk assessment. The government of Australia contracted FMD research to other countries, while Canada conducts FMD research in a mainland laboratory. Debate about the proposed mainland location of NBAF has focused on an FMD outbreak due to legal restrictions on live FMD virus research in the mainland US. The Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to prevent FMD research on the mainland US. The 2008 farm bill requires the Secretary of Agriculture to issue a permit for live FMD virus research at NBAF on the mainland of the United States. The permit can only be revoked if research is not compliant with regulations, preserving USDA's authority over FMD research. The DHS and USDA agreed to issue a permit for a successor facility to PIADC on the mainland for FMD research. In 2008, GAO found that DHS had not fully assessed the risks of conducting FMD research on the mainland, prompting Congress to direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to complete a risk assessment. In response to concerns about mainland release of pathogens, Congress directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to assess the safety of foot-and-mouth disease work on the mainland. GAO criticized the risk assessment in 2009 for using inadequate models, not considering specific wind conditions, and failing to integrate component assessments. This led Congress to prohibit DHS from using FY2010 funds for NBAF construction until improvements were made. The DHS is prohibited from using FY2010 funds for NBAF construction until a risk assessment is completed. The National Academy of Sciences will evaluate the study, and USDA and DHS are expected to collaborate on research at NBAF. The relationship between USDA and DHS may change due to NBAF's increased capacity and capability. The establishment of the new facility, NBAF, presents an opportunity for policymakers to reevaluate agreements and assign lab space to different agencies. Interagency coordination is crucial for crisis response and disease outbreak management. Clear coordination of roles and responsibilities among all agencies involved in NBAF is essential for effective oversight. The DHS relies on the NSTC Foreign Animal Disease Threat Subcommittee for interagency coordination and R&D efforts. JADO within DHS coordinates R&D strategy for foreign animal disease defense. NBAF will eventually house all research activities from PIADC, which is nearing the end of its design lifetime. Construction and operational status of NBAF must be achieved before downsizing or decommissioning PIADC for research continuity. The smooth transition of research projects, programs, supplies, personnel, and retention of an experienced workforce from PIADC to NBAF is a congressional concern. The DHS and USDA's ability to plan for this transition relies on timely NBAF construction, which has faced multiple schedule extensions. Operations at NBAF were initially estimated to begin in 2013 but have been delayed multiple times, with the latest estimate for completion being January 1, 2015. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has faced challenges with the construction schedule of the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF), leading to extended operation of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC). DHS has implemented a Corrective Action Plan to address security and coordination issues at PIADC. Upgrades at PIADC have cost approximately $41 million, with no additional funding requested since 2008. Completing NBAF and transitioning research there may be more cost-effective and efficient than maintaining PIADC. The DHS has proposed selling Plum Island to offset construction costs of NBAF and PIADC demolition. Congress endorsed this proposal in 2009. The DHS proposed selling Plum Island to offset construction costs of NBAF and PIADC demolition. The proceeds from the sale will be deposited into the Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology account for site acquisition, construction, and related costs. The sale will be conducted through the General Services Administration, with expenses not exceeding 1 percent of the sale price. The DHS plans to sell Plum Island to offset construction costs of NBAF and PIADC demolition. Proceeds from the sale will be deposited into the Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology account for site acquisition, construction, and related costs. Unexpended balances of funds may be transferred for design and construction of a consolidated Department of Homeland Security Headquarters project. The uncertain future of Plum Island assets includes variations in remediation costs and property values, which could impact the proceeds from a future sale. Rental payments for PIADC operation until NBAF completion may reduce net proceeds. Community concerns about a new facility have arisen due to controversies surrounding PIADC operations, including worries about pathogen release and illicit research. The federal government has not acted on suggestions to upgrade PIADC biocontainment facilities from BSL-3Ag to BSL-4 for working on more dangerous pathogens. Concerns about worker safety and potential human infections have been raised. The DHS has tried to address these concerns through informational sessions in the EIS process, emphasizing the importance of community acceptance for the NBAF site criteria. Continued community outreach may be crucial to prevent delays in NBAF construction."
