The Renters Tax Credit Act of 2014, known as the Renters Credit, provides a tax credit for qualified renters based on their income level. The credit amount is determined by the rent reduction for each occupied rental unit. Qualified renters are defined as family units with income not exceeding 60% of the local median income or 150% of the Federal poverty line. The Renters Tax Credit Act of 2014, known as the Renters Credit, provides a tax credit for qualified renters based on their income level. The rent reduction amount is the difference between the fair market rent and the rent charged to the qualified renter, capped at 30% of the renter's income as determined by the state's credit agency. The Renters Tax Credit Act of 2014, known as the Renters Credit, provides a tax credit for qualified renters based on their income level. The renters credit agency of the State determines the specified modest rent based on Fair Market Rent or a state-determined amount within 25% of the Fair Market Rent. The agency also decides on utilities inclusion for the credit. The state may consider utilities cost in rent reduction. The renters credit agency can increase the reduction amount up to 110% without exceeding it. A qualified credit recipient is the owner of the rental unit or the lender of any loan securing the unit. The renters credit agency can allocate credit amounts to qualified recipients based on the identity of the renter and the rental units they occupy. The credit amount is allowed to the owner of the unit or lender for the months the unit is occupied by a qualified renter. The renters credit agency can allocate credit amounts to qualified recipients based on the identity of the renter and the rental units they occupy. Units must meet certain restrictions for allocations to be made, such as being part of a project where no more than 40% of units receive allocations. Additionally, a mobility plan approved by the Secretary must be submitted by the renters credit agency. The renters credit agency allocates credit amounts to qualified recipients based on renter and unit eligibility. State agencies have limitations on credit allocations based on the State renters credit ceiling. The State renters credit ceiling for each calendar year is allocated to the renters credit agency of the State, treating multiple agencies as one. The ceiling is determined by the unused amount from the previous year and a minimum threshold based on state population or $20,000,000. The State renters credit ceiling for each calendar year is determined by the unused amount from the previous year, a minimum threshold of $20,000,000, the State renters credit ceiling returned in the calendar year, and any amount allocated by the Secretary. Unused renters credit carryovers are allocated among certain states based on specific criteria. The credit carryover of a State for a calendar year is assigned to the Secretary for allocation among qualified States for the next year. Unused renters credit carryover is the excess of the unused State renters credit ceiling from the previous year over the aggregate renters credit dollar amount allocated for the year. A formula is used to allocate unused housing credit carryovers among qualified states. The amount allocated to a qualified State for a calendar year is determined by the Secretary based on the state's population compared to all qualified States. Population is calculated according to section 146(j) for the allocation of unused renters credit carryovers among states. The term 'qualified State' for a calendar year refers to a State that allocated its entire renters credit ceiling from the previous year and requested an allocation by May 1. Rules similar to section 42(h)(3) apply, and there is an inflation adjustment provision. In general, after 2013, the $20,000,000 and $17.50 amounts in subparagraph (C) will be increased annually based on the cost-of-living adjustment for that year. Rounding rules apply to the $20,000,000 amount. The $20,000,000 and $17.50 amounts in subparagraph (C) will be increased annually based on the cost-of-living adjustment. Rounding rules apply to these amounts. The term 'renters credit agency' is defined for purposes of this section. The renters credit agency is authorized to carry out activities under this section, including possessions treated as states. The Secretary will prescribe necessary regulations. The renters credit will be part of the general business credit and allowable against alternative minimum tax. Subparagraph (B) of section 38(c)(4) of the Code is amended to include a new clause for the credit determined under section 45S. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code. The amendments made by this section apply to allocations for calendar years after 2014 and taxable years ending after December 31, 2014."
