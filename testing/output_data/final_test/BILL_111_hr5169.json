    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Event Data Recorder Enhancement Act\". Congress finds that event data recorders have the potential to improve motor vehicle safety by enhancing occupant protection systems, accuracy of crash reconstructions, and capturing various crash-related data elements. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has integrated event data recorder data collection in its research databases, and open access to this data will benefit researchers, crash investigators, and manufacturers in enhancing vehicle safety. Studies in Europe and the United States have shown that driver awareness of event data recorders reduces crashes. Different vehicle classes may require specific data systems. The benefits of event data recorders depend on the number of vehicles equipped and infrastructure capabilities. Crash notification systems integrate crash sensing and data recorder technology with GPS. Crash notification systems integrate crash sensing technology with GPS and other electronic systems for early collision notification. SEC. 3. EVENT DATA RECORDERS. The Secretary will require passenger automobiles to have event data recorders starting in model year 2013, with 100% of the fleet required to have them by model year 2015. The Secretary will mandate event data recorders in all passenger automobiles by model year 2015, with standardized data retrieval tools and disclosure requirements for new vehicles. Privacy protections for recorded information will also be enforced. Privacy protections are in place for information recorded by event data recorders in motor vehicles. The data can only be retrieved by the owner, with exceptions for court authorization, owner consent for vehicle maintenance, or government safety agencies for improving vehicle safety. Personally identifiable information must not be disclosed. The requirements of this section apply to all motor vehicles except trailers. The term 'model year' is defined as the manufacturer's annual production period starting on September 1 of a year, including January 1 of the named calendar year. If a manufacturer has no annual production period, 'model year' means the calendar year. Event data recorders are required for all motor vehicles except trailers."
