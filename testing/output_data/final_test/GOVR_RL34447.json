Violating this rule can lead to revocation of their status or taxation on political expenditures. Only two churches have lost their 501(c)(3) status for campaign intervention, including the Church at Pierce Creek in New York. The Church at Pierce Creek in Binghamton, New York, lost its 501(c)(3) status for opposing a presidential candidate before the 1992 election. Other religious organizations like Christian Echoes National Ministry also had their status revoked. The \"Johnson Amendment\" prohibits churches from participating in political campaigns to maintain tax-exempt status. The IRS revoked the 501(c)(3) status of organizations that lobbied, not just those engaged in substantial lobbying. The legislative history of the act does not provide further details on this provision. It has been suggested that the provision was proposed as a way to retaliate against an organization supporting an opponent or as an alternative to denying tax-exempt status to organizations funding subversive entities. IRC Section 501(c)(3) only prohibits campaign intervention, allowing other political activities. Houses of worship with 501(c)(3) status cannot endorse or oppose candidates, publish campaign literature, or contribute to campaigns, but they can engage in issue advocacy and lobbying. Houses of worship with 501(c)(3) status can engage in political activities such as issue advocacy and lobbying, as long as they do not show a preference for or against any candidate. The IRS warns that bias can be subtle, and activities like creating voter education materials must be careful not to show bias by excluding candidates, supporting a slate of candidates, or comparing the church's position on issues with those of the candidates. Houses of worship with 501(c)(3) status can engage in political activities like issue advocacy and lobbying without showing bias for or against any candidate. Factors to consider include timing of material distribution and ensuring equal opportunity for all candidates to speak at events. Nonpartisan atmosphere and no fundraising are key indicators of permissible candidate appearances. The tax laws allow religious leaders to participate in campaign activities as individuals, endorsing or opposing candidates in their private capacity. They should not imply they are speaking on behalf of their house of worship, which should not support such activities. Leaders cannot make campaign-related statements in the entity's publications, events, or using its assets, even if they cover the costs themselves. IRS has special rules for tax inquiries and examinations of churches and other houses of worship to ensure compliance with campaign activity restrictions. An \"appropriate high-level Treasury official\" must have written facts and circumstances to believe that the house of worship may no longer qualify for 501(c)(3) status before the IRS can begin an inquiry. The IRS must then provide written notice to the house of worship explaining the general subject matter of the inquiry and the concerns. The IRS has special rules for tax inquiries and examinations of churches and other houses of worship to ensure compliance with campaign activity restrictions. If the entity's response to the inquiry notice does not address the IRS's concerns, the agency may proceed to an examination of its records and religious activities. The examination notice must include details of the records and activities to be examined, an offer for a conference to resolve concerns, and copies of relevant IRS documents. The inquiry and examination must be completed within two years, and any revocation of 501(c)(3) status or tax assessment must be approved by appropriate IRS counsel. The IRS has special rules for tax inquiries and examinations of churches and other houses of worship to ensure compliance with campaign activity restrictions. Before the IRS can begin an inquiry, an \"appropriate high-level Treasury official\" must reasonably believe that the house of worship may no longer qualify for 501(c)(3) status. The determination was previously made by high-level IRS regional officers, but changes in the agency's structure led to the Director of Exempt Organizations, Examinations making the determination. In 2009, a federal district court ruled that the person in this position was not of sufficient rank to make the determination, leading to the suspension of tax inquiries of houses of worship. The IRS issued proposed regulations for tax inquiries of houses of worship, with the Director of Exempt Organizations responsible for making the determination. Some argue that the position does not meet the criteria of an \"appropriate high-level Treasury official.\" Finalization of the regulations has been delayed, raising concerns about IRS enforcement and potential violations of free exercise and free speech rights. The IRS issued regulations for tax inquiries of houses of worship, with concerns raised about enforcement and potential violations of free exercise and free speech rights. The political campaign prohibition has been challenged for violating churches' First Amendment rights, with conflicting rulings from U.S. Courts of Appeals. In Christian Echoes National Ministry, Inc. v. United States, the Tenth Circuit rejected the argument that the restrictions were unconstitutional. The Tenth Circuit rejected the argument that restrictions on lobbying and campaign activities for nonprofit religious organizations violated the First Amendment. The court emphasized the importance of maintaining the separation of church and state by denying tax-exempt status in cases where there is a compelling governmental interest. The court upheld restrictions on lobbying and campaign activities for nonprofit religious organizations, stating that tax exemption is a privilege, not a right. The limitations did not violate free speech rights, as organizations could choose to limit activities for tax-exempt status. The court emphasized the constitutional justification for keeping church-state separation and neutrality principles, prohibiting government subsidies for organizations focused on legislative goals or candidate elections. The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld the revocation of a church's tax-exempt status for campaign intervention, stating it did not violate free exercise and free speech rights. The church placed ads against Bill Clinton before the election, leading to the IRS revoking its status. The court found the revocation did not substantially burden the church's right to freely exercise its religion. The court upheld the revocation of a church's tax-exempt status for campaign intervention, stating it did not violate free exercise and free speech rights. The church could set up a related 501(c)(4) social welfare organization to establish a political action committee (PAC) for its opinions about candidates. The court rejected the church's claim of viewpoint discrimination by the IRS. The court upheld the revocation of a church's tax-exempt status for campaign intervention, stating it did not violate free exercise and free speech rights. The IRS developed a political activity compliance initiative in 2004 to address concerns about 501(c)(3) organizations violating campaign prohibition. The initiative includes public outreach and a fast-track review process for allegations of campaign activity. Results from 2004 and 2006 were discussed, but no updates or results have been released since 2008. The IRS developed a political activity compliance initiative in 2004 to address concerns about 501(c)(3) organizations violating campaign prohibition. In the 2004 initiative, 132 cases were selected for review, with 63 involving houses of worship. Of the 110 remaining cases, 47 were related to houses of worship. As of the most recent update in 2007, 46 of the 47 cases had been closed, with written advisories issued in 42 cases for engaging in campaign activity. In 2006, the IRS examined 100 cases, with 44 involving houses of worship. By 2007, 14 cases were closed, with advisories issued in four cases for campaign activity. Prohibited activities included distributing biased voter guides and candidate ratings. The IRS examined campaign activity in 2004 and found 269 instances of contributions, including 87 from churches totaling $45,151. Most cases remained open, with one deemed unworthy of examination. The Federal Election Campaign Act prohibits corporations from using general treasury funds for contributions, while the tax code prohibits all 501(c)(3) organizations from making such contributions. The Supreme Court's ruling in Citizens United v. FEC invalidated prohibitions in FECA on corporations and labor unions using general treasury funds for independent expenditures and electioneering communications. This decision was based on the First Amendment, stating that these prohibitions constitute a \"ban on speech.\" Houses of worship with 501(c)(3) status are generally not allowed to engage in these activities regulated by FECA. The Citizens United decision does not significantly impact activities regulated by FECA. Legislation has been introduced to repeal the provision prohibiting 501(c)(3) organizations from engaging in campaign activity. If enacted, houses of worship with 501(c)(3) status could engage in campaign activity without risking their tax-exempt status. The bill would allow 501(c)(3) tax-exempt houses of worship to engage in campaign activity without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status, as long as it is not their primary activity. They would not be required to report these activities to the IRS. The bill allows 501(c)(3) tax-exempt houses of worship to engage in campaign activity without reporting to the IRS, while not jeopardizing their tax-exempt status. It also ensures that the provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 are not invalidated or limited."
