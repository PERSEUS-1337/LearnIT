    "content": "The report discusses the FY2017 defense budget request, congressional action on the NDAA for FY2017, and the Defense Appropriations Act, FY2017. The debate over the defense budget size spanned the end of the Obama Administration and the start of the Trump Administration, concluding about two-thirds through the fiscal year. The FY2017 budget request and initial versions of defense bills were consistent with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA/ P.L. 114-74) led to a disagreement between the Obama Administration, the Senate, and the House regarding the allocation of $18 billion in Department of Defense funds for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). The OCO category was adopted in 2009 for activities in Afghanistan and Iraq, with $5.1 billion of the $58.8 billion in OCO funds intended for base budget purposes in the FY2017 budget request. The House and Senate disagreed on the allocation of funds for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) in the FY2017 budget. The House proposed $23 billion for base budget purposes, while the Senate authorized $8.3 billion. President Obama signed the final NDAA conference agreement. The FY2017 defense appropriations bill provided $586.2 billion in funding for the Department of Defense, including $19.9 billion designated for Overseas Contingency Operations. The bill resulted from House and Senate actions on defense appropriations bills, with the House proposing an increase in OCO funding for base budget purposes. The FY2017 defense appropriations bill allocated $586.2 billion for the Department of Defense, with $19.9 billion designated for Overseas Contingency Operations. The Senate Appropriations Committee's version of the bill did not increase OCO funding for base budget purposes. The Department of Defense's FY2017 military construction budget was funded in an annual appropriations bill, along with a continuing resolution for temporary funding for federal agencies without FY2017 appropriations. The first continuing resolution (H.R. 5323 / P.L. 114-223) for FY2017 provided budget authority from October 1, 2016, to December 9, 2016. The Obama Administration requested an additional $5.8 billion for OCO to support troops in Afghanistan and other needs, bringing the total OCO budget request to $64.6 billion for FY2017. This was followed by a second continuing resolution (H.R. 2028 / P.L. 114-254) providing funding through April 28, 2017. The second FY2017 continuing resolution (P.L. 114-254) provided $5.8 billion for OCO-designated DOD funds, including $1.5 billion requested by the Obama Administration. A new defense appropriations bill, H.R. 1301, was drafted by House and Senate negotiators based on the original FY2017 budget request, with a deduction of $1.5 billion for OCO activities funded by the second CR. The House passed H.R. 1301 on March 8, 2017, but no action was taken in the Senate. A third CR (H.J.Res. 99 / P.L. 115-30) was enacted on April 28, 2017, to extend the provisions of the second CR. On May 3, 2017, a third version of the FY2017 defense appropriations bill passed the House as Division C of H.R. 244, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017. Division C included $14.8 billion in \"Additional Appropriations\" for DOD, designated for Overseas Contingency Operations. H.R. 244 became P.L. 115-31 on May 5, 2017. The FY2017 defense budget request included $551.1 billion for the National Defense function, with 96% allocated to the Department of Defense. Additional funding of $58.8 billion was requested for Overseas Contingency Operations, with later amendments increasing this amount. The Trump Administration requested an additional $30.0 billion in funding for national defense in March 2017, bringing the total amount requested for FY2017 to $655.2 billion. This included $24.9 billion for base funding and $5.1 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). The Obama Administration had previously requested an additional $5.8 billion in OCO funds for FY2017, with a significant portion allocated to operations in Afghanistan and the campaign against the Islamic State. The Trump Administration requested an additional $24.9 billion for DOD base budget activities and $5.1 billion in OCO funding in FY2017. The requested base budget authority was intended to compensate for insufficient funding for combat readiness-related expenses and unanticipated expenses resulting from the FY2017 NDAA. The budgeted 2017 military pay raise was 2.1% compared to 1.6%, with increases for procurement and Operation and Maintenance accounts. The Obama Administration presented the FY2017 defense budget request in the context of various security challenges, including the rise of the Islamic State, Russian-backed proxy warfare in Ukraine, North Korean provocations, Chinese activities in the South China Sea, terrorist attacks in Western Europe, the Syrian refugee crisis, and the Ebola outbreak in 2014. The 2015 National Military Strategy identified key security challenges for the US, including revisionist states like Russia, Iran, and China, and violent extremist organizations like al Qaeda and ISIS. The strategy also highlighted the possibility of conflict with another major power. The FY2017 budget was developed to address these security threats. The FY2017 budget for the Department of Defense prioritized deterring advanced adversaries, enhancing combat effectiveness through modernization, and emphasizing innovation. The \"Third Offset\" initiative focuses on developing advanced technologies to counter enemy advantages in guided munitions, undersea warfare, cyber warfare, and human-machine teaming. President Trump directed a \"30-day Readiness Review\" for the Department of Defense, leading to a $30 billion request for additional funds in FY2017 to address critical budget shortfalls in personnel, training, equipment, munitions, modernization, and infrastructure investment. This request aimed to invest in a larger, more ready, and more capable military force. Congressional deliberations on the FY2017 defense budget have been ongoing. The FY2017 defense budget discussions are part of a broader budget debate under the Budget Control Act of 2011. The Act sets limits on discretionary spending for defense and nondefense programs, enforced by sequestration. The Act does not limit subfunctions but has been applied proportionally. OCO funds are not subject to the limits. The OCO designation can be applied to any appropriation agreed upon by the President and Congress. This has raised questions about exceeding defense spending caps and allowing both defense and nondefense spending to surpass their respective caps. The OCO designation has been used for various activities since 2009, including operations against the Islamic State and reassuring U.S. allies in Europe facing Russian assertiveness. The Obama and Trump administrations' budget requests for FY2017 included $5.1 billion in OCO-designated funds for base budget purposes. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 raised the Budget Control Act limits for FY2017 by $30 billion, with a nonbinding target of $58.8 billion for OCO funding for DOD. The BBA set a $14.9 billion target for international affairs OCO funding. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry argued for a higher FY2017 National Defense base budget of approximately $574 billion, but the Obama Administration's request matched the BBA's $551.1 billion cap. Approximately $5 billion of the OCO request was allocated for base budget activities. The Administration's budget request for FY2017 defense operations would provide a total of $556.1 billion for base budget activities, $18 billion less than previously projected. Chairman Thornberry argued for increasing base defense funding to $574 billion, calling for $23 billion of OCO-designated funding for base budget purposes. This would be $18 billion more than the Administration's OCO request for base budget activities. Thornberry proposed making up for the resulting shortfall in actual OCO requirements with a supplemental appropriations request. The FY2017 House Budget Resolution proposed $574 billion for national defense base budget purposes, with $551 billion designated as base budget funding and $23 billion from OCO-designated funding. The resolution also included reconciliation instructions to reduce the deficit and a policy statement to achieve mandatory spending savings of at least $30 billion. The House Budget Resolution of the 114th Congress aimed for mandatory spending savings of $30 billion over FY2017 and FY2018 and $140 billion over FY2017-FY2026. However, the resolution did not pass, leading to legislative activity on the FY2017 NDAA and defense appropriations bill. The Obama Administration requested $523.9 billion for DOD's FY2017 base budget, a 0.4% increase from FY2016. The Trump Administration's additional request brought the DOD military base budget to $549.5 billion, a 5% increase from FY2016. The DOD budget hovered between $495.0 billion and $496.1 billion in FY2013, reflecting a 7% reduction from FY2012 due to government-wide spending cuts. The Obama Administration's FY2017 budget request was 9% higher than the average annual defense budget since the Vietnam War. Comparatively, it was 14% lower than the peak year of defense spending in FY1985 and 24% higher than pre-9/11 levels. Including the initial OCO request, the total request was 38% more than the FY2000 base budget. The FY2017 DOD budget, including OCO funds, would amount to approximately 3.1% of GDP. Defense spending as a percentage of federal outlays has declined from 41.1% in 1965 to 14.3% in FY2017, projected to decrease to 11.6% by 2021. Mandatory spending and net interest are forecasted to consume 65.1% of budgetary resources. The debate on defense spending for FY2017 played out in Congress' deliberations on the NDAA, aligning with the BCA defense cap. Both the Administration's original budget request and H.R. 4909 passed by the House reflected the BBA agreement on OCO amounts. The House-passed bill allocated $58.8 billion of OCO funding for DOD, with $23.1 billion designated for base budget purposes. The remaining $35.7 billion would cover OCO costs through April 2017, with the option for a supplemental appropriation. The Senate-passed NDAA authorized $523.9 billion for base budget activities and $58.8 billion for OCO, complying with BCA caps and the 2015 BBA agreement. Chairman John McCain proposed an amendment to S. 2943 for an additional $17 billion in OCO funding for base budget purposes. Senator Jack Reed and Senator Barbara Mikulski proposed an amendment to increase non-DOD spending by $18 billion for \"parity\" between defense and nondefense spending. Both amendments failed to achieve cloture, leading to the withdrawal of the McCain amendment and the passage of the bill by a vote of 84-13. The FY2017 NDAA conference report designated $8.3 billion in OCO funds. The FY2017 NDAA, enacted as P.L. 114-328, allocated $8.3 billion in OCO funds for base budget purposes, exceeding the Administration's request by $3.2 billion. President Obama signed the FY2017 NDAA conference agreement on December 23, 2016. H.R. 5293, approved by the House Appropriations Committee, included $510.6 billion in base discretionary budget authority and $58.6 billion for OCO-designated funding, with $17.5 billion designated as \"base budget requirements.\" Despite objections, H.R. 5293 passed the House without amendment on June 16, 2016. The Senate version of the defense appropriations bill, S. 3000, proposed $509.5 billion in discretionary base budget authority and $58.6 billion for OCO requirements. Unlike the House, the Senate did not use OCO funds to increase the base budget. The Senate committee identified $15.1 billion in budget cuts and redirected the savings to national security needs. Additionally, S. 3000 included savings from lower fuel costs and unobligated balances, with efforts to improve funds management and program affordability. The Senate committee proposed programmatic increases aligned with NDAA versions H.R. 4909, S. 2943, and H.R. 5293. DOD's FY2017 military construction budget was funded in H.R. 5325/P.L. 114-223, which also included a continuing resolution for temporary funding. After the initial FY2017 continuing resolution (H.R. 5323/P.L. 114-223), a second continuing resolution (H.R. 2028/P.L. 114-254) provided funding through April 28, 2017, including $5.8 billion for OCO-designated DOD funds. The House passed a new FY2017 defense appropriations bill, H.R. 1301, deducting $1.5 billion for OCO activities previously funded. The House passed H.R. 1301 on March 8, 2017, by a vote of 371-48. A third continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 99 / P.L. 115-30) was enacted on April 28, 2017, to extend provisions for an additional week. The Trump Administration requested nearly $30 billion in additional appropriations for FY2017, with options for Congress to consider. The FY2017 defense appropriations bill, included in H.R. 244, provided $586.2 billion in funding for the Department of Defense, with $14.8 billion designated for Overseas Contingency Operations. P.L. 115-31 was enacted on May 5, 2017, with $19.9 billion allocated for base budget purposes under Overseas Contingency Operations. Both the House and Senate versions of the FY2017 NDAA aimed to enhance DOD's agility and adaptability. The FY2017 NDAA included provisions to enhance DOD's agility and adaptability. S. 2943, as enacted, addresses the organization of DOD leadership and the National Security Council. Section 921 extends the terms of office for the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Section 903 limits the number of persons assigned to the Joint Staff. The FY2017 NDAA included provisions to enhance DOD's agility and adaptability, addressing the organization of DOD leadership and the National Security Council. It limits the number of persons assigned to the Joint Staff, National Security Council, and U.S. Cyber Command. The FY2017 NDAA includes provisions to enhance DOD's agility and adaptability, addressing the organization of DOD leadership and the National Security Council. It limits the number of persons assigned to the Joint Staff, National Security Council, and U.S. Cyber Command. Additionally, Section 922 of the bill aims to enhance the authority of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict to support the U.S. Special Operations Command. Section 901 divides authority over weapons acquisition between two senior DOD officials. The FY2017 NDAA includes provisions to enhance DOD's agility and adaptability, addressing the organization of DOD leadership and the National Security Council. Section 901 divides authority over weapons acquisition between two senior DOD officials, replacing the AT&L position with an Under Secretary for Research and Engineering and an Under Secretary for Acquisition and Sustainment. The rationale behind this move is to separate technology and acquisition missions, with the former focusing on innovation and experimentation while the latter focuses on timely and cost-effective delivery and sustainment of products and services. The enacted NDAA includes provisions to enhance DOD's agility in weapons acquisition. Changes will take effect on February 1, 2018, with a focus on a modular open system approach for major weapons systems and incorporating mature technologies. The enacted NDAA includes provisions to enhance DOD's agility in weapons acquisition, including changes requiring the use of \"mature\" technologies to avoid delays. It also includes modifications to DOD's contracting procedures, such as a preference for fixed-price contracts and limitations on awarding contracts based solely on the lowest price offer. The enacted NDAA includes provisions on contracting procedures, such as the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) offer rule and requirements for a report on bid protest processes. The bill also addresses security cooperation programs and interactions. The FY2017 defense funding bills included provisions to streamline security cooperation authorities and facilitate oversight. The agreed provisions, consolidated into a new Chapter 16 of Title 10 of the U.S. Code, govern military-to-military engagements, exchanges, and contacts. The FY2017 defense funding bills included provisions for payment of personnel expenses, extension of authorities to nonmilitary security personnel, combined exercises with foreign forces, operational support, foreign capacity building, defense institution building, training and equipping foreign forces, and educational activities. The original budget request for military personnel costs in FY2017 was $138.8 billion. The Administration proposed reductions in military manpower and changes in military compensation to reduce personnel cost-per-troop. The FY2017 budget included a total of $138.8 billion for military personnel costs, with a proposed active duty end strength of 1.28 million, a 2.1% reduction from the previous year and an 8.4% decrease from 2011. The Army and Marine Corps have experienced significant reductions in end strength over the past few years, with the Army dropping from nearly 570,000 in 2011 to under 475,000 in FY2016, and the Marine Corps decreasing from 202,000 in 2010 to 184,000 in FY2016. The proposed budget aims for further reductions, with the Senate NDAA supporting the Administration's request while the House bill suggests an increase in troop levels. The House-proposed increase in troop levels would add a total of 1,700 troops to the FY2016 authorized level and 28,715 to the FY2017 total requested by the Administration, with the Army being authorized 5,000 more members than its 2016 end-strength and 20,000 more than the Administration proposed for FY2017. The enacted version of the NDAA authorized 24,000 more personnel than requested, including 16,000 Army troops. The House-passed defense appropriations bill would have added $1.66 billion to cover the personnel costs of the increased end-strength authorized by H.R. 4909. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a defense appropriations bill without additional funding. The House-passed bill, H.R. 1301, added $1.3 billion for higher end-strength and military pay raise. Efforts to reduce military compensation costs are a major theme in recent budget debates. Section 1009 of Title 37 allows for automatic annual increases in military basic pay indexed to the Employment Cost Index. The President has the authority to specify an alternative pay adjustment for private sector wages and salaries, which can supersede the automatic adjustment. Pay raises for military personnel have varied in relation to the Employment Cost Index (ECI) from FY2001 to FY2016. In FY2017, the Obama Administration proposed a 1.6% increase in basic pay instead of the 2.1% increase based on the ECI calculation, saving approximately $264 million. The enacted version of the FY2017 defense appropriations bill included a provision for a pay raise matching the ECI projection. It added $1.3 billion to fund higher end-strength and a military pay raise. Over 80% of the requested funds for armored combat vehicles were allocated to upgrade existing vehicles, with the remainder for developing new vehicles. The budget request included funding for the development of three new vehicles: a troop carrier (AMPV), an amphibious landing vehicle (ACV), and a combat vehicle with a tank-like cannon. It also included funds for the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) and upgrading the Army's fleet of M-1 Abrams tanks. The Army requested an increase in funding for tank upgrades, which was authorized by the House and Senate versions of the NDAA. The House and Senate versions of the NDAA authorized an increased amount for the Army budget request, with the House bill also approving additional funds for M-1 modifications. The enacted NDAA authorized the revised total request but not the additional House increase. The consolidated appropriations bill provided $664 million for M-1 improvements, a net addition of $12 million to the Army's adjusted request. The enacted appropriations bill authorized $595 million for modernizing the Army's fleet of Paladin 155 mm cannons and their ammunition carriers. The Army is replacing the vehicles' tracked chassis with new ones based on the Bradley infantry fighting vehicle. The bill also provides $584 million for Paladin modernization, cutting $10 million from the request due to anticipated contract savings. Additionally, $727 million was requested for upgrading and installing various enhancements in the Army's fleet of Stryker wheeled armored troop carriers. Some funds will be used to enhance older Strykers with V-shaped undersides for blast protection and upgrade firepower with 30 mm cannons. The NDAA trimmed $11 million from the request, with the enacted bill following suit. The House-Senate defense appropriations compromise provided $709 million for Stryker procurement, restoring $8 million from a previous cut. The budget requested $184 million. The budget requested $184 million for the development of the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) to replace Vietnam-era M-113 vehicles. FY2017 funds will be used to complete production of 29 prototype AMPVs for testing. The NDAA authorized the full amount requested for AMPV, as did the defense appropriations bill. The Navy's shipbuilding plans and concerns over size and capability have been a focus for congressional defense committees. The FY2017 budget requested funding for seven new ships, including submarines, destroyers, combat ships, and an amphibious assault ship. The five-year shipbuilding plan includes 38 new ships, down from the previous plan of 48. The budget request for shipbuilding programs includes funding for Virginia class attack submarines with the Virginia Payload Module (VPM) to increase missile payload. The Navy's FY2016 budget proposed building some Virginia class boats with the VPM, while the FY2017-FY2021 plan includes the VPM in all boats procured from FY2020 onwards. The Senate and House versions of the NDAA authorized funding for Virginia class submarines with the Virginia Payload Module (VPM). Additional funding was allocated for advance procurement of components for future boats. The Navy's proposed budget included funding for CVN-79. The FY2017 budget requested $12.9 billion for CVN-79 and $1.37 billion for CVN-80. Congress debated providing AP funding for CVN-81 to reduce procurement costs. The NDAA authorized $2.7 billion for CVN-79 and CVN-80, but did not include AP funding for CVN-81. The House version authorized $2.7 billion for the second and third ships, with an additional $263 million for the fourth carrier not included in the final bill. The enacted appropriation bill provides $2.63 billion for the second and third carriers, cutting $36 million from the request and not funding a fourth carrier. Congress has resisted Navy proposals to retire seven Aegis cruisers in recent years. The Navy proposed retiring seven Aegis cruisers, but Congress rejected the proposal. Congress modified the Navy's plan to temporarily take 11 ships out of service for modernization. The Navy requested to modernize the 11 ships on its preferred schedule, but Congress directed a different schedule in the FY2017 budget. The House and Senate versions of the bill contained provisions regarding the modernization and potential retirement of the cruisers. The Navy's proposal to retire seven Aegis cruisers was rejected by Congress. The FY2017 budget included $3.3 billion for DDG-51 destroyer procurement. Congress provided an additional $1.0 billion for an extra destroyer, which was listed as an unfunded requirement by the Navy. The NDAA authorized the requested funding for destroyers. The Senate versions of the NDAA authorized $3.3 billion for destroyers, with the House bill adding $433 million and the Senate bill adding $50 million for a partially funded ship. The enacted bill authorized the request plus $50 million. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter reduced the planned total of LCS ships from 52 to 40. The Navy's FY2017-FY2021 shipbuilding plan reduced LCS quantities and proposed that only one builder be chosen for future procurement. The FY2017 budget requested $1.1 billion for two LCSs instead of three. The House NDAA version initially included funding for a third ship, but it was ultimately not authorized. The defense appropriations bill cut $71 million from the two-ship request but added $384 million for a third ship. The enacted appropriation bill cuts $36 million from the $1.1 billion requested for two LCSs but adds $475 million for a third ship. The Navy's FY2017 budget proposes using split funding to procure an amphibious assault ship designated LHA-8, with the enacted NDAA authorizing the $1.6 billion requested for the ship in FY2017. The enacted bill (H.R. 244 / P.L. 115-31) trims $5 million from the amount requested for the LHA in FY2017. The Army and Air Force delayed their planned aircraft purchases in their initial FY2017 budget requests, while the Navy sought additional funds from Congress for \"unfunded requirements\" to meet its aviation modernization goals. The Army prioritized readiness over modernization in its budget request, with helicopter programs facing budget cuts. The Army's $3.9 billion budget request for aircraft procurement in FY2017 was less than one-third of the FY2016 budget. The Air Force's budget squeeze has led to a \"bow wave\" of acquisitions, with plans to modernize fighters, bombers, trainers, and other systems exceeding the available procurement budget. The FY2017 budget submission included $4.4 billion for 43 F-35A Lightning II fighters, five fewer than projected. The Air Force's budget request for F-35A Lightning II fighters included $4.4 billion for 43 aircraft, 5 fewer than initially planned. The enacted NDAA authorized the requested amount for 43 fighters, with the House also approving $691 million for 5 additional aircraft. The Senate committee version of the defense appropriations bill would have cut the FY2017 procurement amount by $418 million but added $100 million for advance procurement funds to support higher production rates in FY2018. The enacted appropriation for F-35A fighters includes a net increase of $201 million for 43 aircraft, with $294 million cut for \"efficiencies\" and $405 million added for 5 additional aircraft. The NDAA authorized $2.9 billion for 15 KC-46A tankers, cutting development funds by more than 50% due to unspent prior year funds and fewer issues than anticipated. The House and Senate versions also made adjustments to the procurement and R&D requests for the KC-46A program. The enacted appropriation (H.R. 244 / P.L. 115-31) cuts the procurement request for the plane by $167 million and $32 million from the R&D request. Reductions in planned aircraft procurement were also seen in the Army's FY2017 request, with 110 helicopters instead of the projected 144. Army leaders attributed these deferrals to budget concerns and force structure issues. Specifically, the FY2017 budget request included $929 million for 74 UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters and $565 million for 22 CH-47 Chinook helicopters. The enacted FY2017 NDAA authorized funding for Black Hawk, CH-47 Chinook, and AH-64 Apache helicopters as originally requested. The House-passed version proposed additional funding for 41 helicopters, while the Senate committee version added funds for Black Hawks for National Guard units. The enacted appropriation bill included funding for 5 newly built Apaches and 25 Black Hawks for the Army and National Guard. The Navy has been facing a shortage of strike fighters due to budget constraints and delays in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. Congress has allocated $2.9 billion for 32 F/A-18 aircraft, including electronic warfare models. The FY2017 budget includes funding for 2 F/A-18 Super Hornets and 4 F-35B Joint Strike Fighters. The Navy requested additional funding for 14 Super Hornets and 6 F-35s to address the shortage of strike fighters. The Chief of Naval Operations highlighted the need to improve the inventory of F/A-18F and F-35C aircraft to balance the strike fighter capacity and reduce reliance on legacy-model aircraft. The Navy's proposal to reduce carrier air wings from 10 to 9 is linked to the shortage of strike fighters. This would result in two fewer air wings than carriers due to upcoming fleet expansion. Navy officials argue that this adjustment aligns with current carrier force operations. The Navy's proposal to reduce carrier air wings from 10 to 9 is due to a shortage of strike fighters, aligning with current carrier force operations. Legislative relief may be needed as Section 1093 of the FY2012 NDAA mandates 10 carrier air wings. The enacted FY2017 NDAA includes additional funding for F-18E/Fs and F-35s beyond the budget request. The FY2017 NDAA includes provisions for reducing the number of active-component carrier air wings from 10 to nine until the navy fields enough carriers to support 10 wings or the start of FY2026. The budget request also includes funding for upgrading and replacing U.S. nuclear weapons delivery systems. The FY2017 NDAA approved full funding for the Ohio replacement program to build 12 new ballistic missile submarines. The House and Senate versions authorized the advance procurement funds in the Navy's shipbuilding account. The defense appropriations bill also provided the full amount requested for the new class of missile subs. The budget requested $1.36 billion for the B-21 Long Range Strike Bomber development, almost 40% less than FY2017. The B-21 Long Range Strike Bomber development budget was reduced by $3.5 billion over FY2017-FY2021 due to lower bids. The enacted appropriation provided $1.3 billion for the bomber program, maintaining the originally requested amount. Congress has largely supported the FY2017 budget request for nuclear-armed ballistic missiles and a long-range cruise missile. The Obama Administration requested $1.1 billion for modifications and life-extension of the D-5 Trident II ballistic missile on Ohio-class submarines, $109 million for research on a new ground-based strategic deterrent, and $96 million for the development of a new long-range stand-off missile. The FY2017 NDAA authorized funding for these programs, with the Senate committee version fully funding the ICBM replacement missile and the LRSO. The FY2017 appropriations bill fully funded the request for the ICBM replacement missile and the LRSO, but reduced funding for Trident II modernization. The Obama Administration requested $9.1 billion for ballistic missile defense, a decrease from the previous year. Congressional action authorized funding for selected elements of the missile defense program. The FY2017 budget request included $862.1 million to maintain high operational readiness of the Ground-based Missile Defense system and increase interceptor missiles from 30 to 44 at Fort Greely, AK, and Vandenberg Air Force Base, CA. Congress authorized the requested amount, with interest in establishing a third GMD site in the eastern United States. Three military bases are being evaluated for deployment of the possible third GMD site. The FY2017 budget request included funding for the Ground-based Missile Defense system and increasing interceptor missiles. Congress authorized $15 million for planning a third GMD site in the eastern US. The request also supported the European Phased Adaptive Approach, with plans for Aegis Ashore sites in Romania and Poland. Funding was approved for European missile defense procurement and development. The FY2017 budget request includes funding for Aegis Ashore equipment, SM-3 interceptor missile development, Iron Dome system, Israeli Arrow, and David's Sling weapon systems. The enacted NDAA adds $455 million to the requested $150 million for these programs. Additionally, the Obama Administration's request includes $7.1 billion for Air Force national security space programs to maintain supremacy in space. The United States aims to maintain supremacy in space by funding various space-based systems and launch vehicle programs. The budget request includes funding for the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle program and launch infrastructure to support national security space missions. The enacted NDAA reduces funding for launch procurement and infrastructure programs, citing that the funds were not yet needed. The enacted FY2017 appropriations bill reduced funding for the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program by $253 million, while authorizing $380 million for EELV development, which was $183 million more than requested. The bill also identified a nonbinding FY2017 budget level of $58.8 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), matching President Obama's OCO budget request. President Obama submitted an amendment to the OCO budget request to Congress on November 10, 2016, adding $5.8 billion to the DOD FY2017 OCO budget request. The second FY2017 continuing resolution (H.R. 2028/P.L. 114-254), enacted on December 10, 2016, appropriated $5.8 billion for urgent OCO-designated elements of the DOD budget request. The Trump Administration requested an additional $5.1 billion for DOD funds in FY2017, with $64.6 billion for contingency operations and $5.1 billion for base requirements. This brought the total FY2017 budget request for OCO-designated spending to $69.7 billion. President Obama's amendment to the OCO budget request in November 2016 added $5.8 billion for DOD FY2017 OCO budget. The request included funding for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, intensified operations in Syria and Iraq, and $3.4 billion for the President's European Reassurance Initiative. The House and Senate passed their versions of the FY2017 NDAA before the OCO budget amendment. The House-passed NDAA in February 2016 allocated $58.8 billion for OCO funding, with $23.1 billion for base budget purposes. The remaining $35.7 billion was designated for OCO activities until April 30, 2017, allowing for supplemental appropriations if needed by the new President elected in November 2016. The Senate-passed version of the NDAA in FY2017 authorized $67.8 billion in OCO-designated funds, with $3.2 billion allocated to base budget expenses. President Obama increased the total OCO request to $64.6 billion, resulting in a $9.0 billion increase from the original request. The House and Senate Appropriations Committee versions of the defense appropriations bill aligned with the NDAA in their treatment of OCO funds. The House and Senate committees tracked the NDAA versions, with the House passing a defense appropriations bill providing $58.6 billion for OCO. The Senate committee-approved bill also allocated $58.6 billion for OCO, with no increase for base budget expenses. President Obama's request for $5.8 billion in additional OCO funding led to the enactment of H.R. 2028, providing $5.8 billion in OCO appropriations. Title X of Division C of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (H.R. 244/P.L. 115-31) included $14.8 billion in \"Additional Appropriations\" for the Department of Defense, responding partly to the Trump Administration's request for an additional $30.0 billion. The Trump Administration requested an additional $30.0 billion for the FY2017 budget, with $24.9 billion for the base budget and $5.1 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations. Congress did not raise the defense spending limit but designated $14.8 billion as Overseas Contingency Operations funding to avoid triggering sequestration. The Trump Administration requested an additional $30.0 billion for the FY2017 budget, with $24.9 billion for the base budget and $5.1 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations. Congress avoided triggering sequestration by designating $14.8 billion as OCO funding. The NDAA authorized additional base appropriations by redirecting amounts requested for OCO. Appropriators responded to the request by increasing OCO-designated funds. Table 18 provides OCO funding amounts designated in the NDAA (P.L. 114-328) and additional appropriations designated as OCO funding in Division C, Title X of Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31). Authorization and appropriations actions on selected programs are detailed in the H.Rept. 114-840 Conference Report for the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2017."
