The Congress finds that the United States contributes significantly to international development projects, which often suffer from fraud, corruption, waste, and inefficiency. These issues hinder competition in foreign commerce, and detecting them before they occur is crucial to ensure proper use of resources. The Act aims to promote independent third-party procurement monitoring to ensure transparency, minimize fraud and corruption, and strengthen international trade. The Act promotes independent third-party procurement monitoring to ensure transparency in government procurement practices for US participation in international financial institutions and bilateral nonhumanitarian foreign assistance funds.

The Act defines \"appropriate committees\" as specific Senate and House committees. It also defines \"independent third-party procurement monitoring\" as a program to ensure transparency and prevent fraud in international procurement. The term \"independent\" means that monitoring the procurement process does not create a conflict of interest. The term \"each stage of procurement\" includes technical specifications, bidding documents, evaluation reports, contract preparation, and delivery of goods and services. The term \"international financial institution\" is defined in the International Financial Institutions Act. SEC. 4. REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR COMPETITION IN FOREIGN COMMERCE. The Secretary of the Treasury must submit a plan to promote international government procurement reforms to the President and appropriate committees within 180 days of this Act. The plan includes instructions for the US Executive Director of international financial institutions to oppose the use of US funds until an anticorruption plan with independent third-party procurement monitoring is adopted. Annual Reports must be submitted by the Secretary of the Treasury on the progress of implementing procurement reforms by international financial institutions and countries receiving non-humanitarian assistance. This includes ensuring openness, efficiency, and transparency in government procurement, as well as minimizing corruption and maximizing transparency in the procurement process. No funds can be used for non-humanitarian assistance without these measures in place. No funds for non-humanitarian foreign assistance programs can be used for government procurement unless eligible countries and international financial institutions show progress in institutionalizing transparent, corruption-free procurement practices and independent monitoring. SEC. 5. EXCEPTIONS. The President can exempt a country from Section 4 if it's in the national security interests of the United States. Other exceptions include providing humanitarian aid, supporting democratic reform, creating independent organizations, and promoting a free market economy."
