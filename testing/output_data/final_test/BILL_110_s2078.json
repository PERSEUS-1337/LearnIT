    "content": "Updating state building energy efficiency codes and standards. The Secretary is required to update national model building energy codes and standards every 3 years to achieve energy savings goals of 30% by 2015 and 50% by 2022 compared to the 2006 IECC for residential buildings and ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1 (2004) for commercial buildings. If the 50% goal by 2022 is unattainable with current technology, it may be modified. The Secretary is required to update national model building energy codes and standards every 3 years to achieve energy savings goals. If the goals cannot be achieved with existing technology, a revised goal will be established to ensure maximum energy efficiency. If the IECC or ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1 is revised, the Secretary will determine if the revision improves energy efficiency and meets established targets. The Secretary will amend the IECC or ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1 if a code or standard does not meet energy efficiency targets or is not updated for more than 3 years. The Secretary will amend the IECC or ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1 if energy efficiency targets are not met or if a code is not updated for over 3 years. State certification of building energy code updates must be done within 2 years. The Secretary will publish notices and allow public comment on modified codes and standards. Each State must certify to the Secretary within 2 years that their building codes meet energy efficiency standards, either exceeding the 2006 IECC for residential buildings and ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1-2004 for commercial buildings, or achieving equivalent energy savings. If the Secretary determines otherwise, codes and standards will be revised. Each State must certify within 2 years that their building codes meet energy efficiency standards, exceeding the 2006 IECC for residential buildings and ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1-2004 for commercial buildings, or achieving equivalent energy savings. If the Secretary fails to make a determination, codes and standards will be revised. Each State must certify within 3 years that their building codes meet or exceed energy efficiency standards, based on a review of revised codes or standards. The State building code must achieve equivalent or greater energy savings in buildings. State Certification of Compliance With Building Codes requires states to certify compliance with certified building energy codes within 3 years. The certification must document the rate of compliance through independent inspections of a random sample of new and renovated buildings. Compliance is achieved if at least 90% of buildings meet all code requirements. State certification of compliance with building codes requires states to certify compliance with certified building energy codes within 3 years. Compliance is achieved if at least 90% of buildings substantially meet all the requirements of the code. If a state fails to meet the certification deadline, they must submit a report to the Secretary detailing their status and a plan for completing the certification. The Secretary may grant a one-year extension for certification deadlines if a State shows good faith efforts and significant progress in compliance. Failure to meet the deadline without an extension results in noncompliance with building code certification requirements. In any State not compliant with building code certification requirements, local governments can comply by meeting certification requirements. The Secretary must annually report to Congress and publish a list of compliant and non-compliant States. The Secretary must include estimates of increased energy use and costs for non-compliant States. Technical assistance will be provided to help national building energy codes meet targets. The Secretary will provide technical assistance to States to implement and improve building energy efficiency codes, as well as promote energy-efficient building design and construction. Incentive funding will also be provided to States for these purposes. The Secretary will consider actions proposed by States to increase compliance with building energy efficiency codes and provide additional funding for achieving a 90 percent compliance rate based on energy performance. The Secretary will provide additional funding to States that have adopted and are implementing residential and commercial building energy efficiency codes that meet or exceed certain standards. The Secretary may allocate funds to States or local governments that have adopted and are implementing energy efficiency codes for buildings. Additionally, funds can be used for training officials to implement these codes. $25,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year. The Secretary may allocate funds to States or local governments for implementing energy efficiency codes for buildings. Funding is authorized for fiscal years 2006 through 2010, with additional sums as necessary for subsequent years. There is a limitation on funding provided to States each fiscal year. A technical correction defines the term 'IECC' as the International Energy Conservation Code."
