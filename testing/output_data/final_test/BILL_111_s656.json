    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 2009\" and includes provisions for the adjustment of status. The \"Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 2009\" allows for the adjustment of status for eligible aliens to become lawful permanent residents if they apply before April 1, 2011 and meet certain criteria. The Immigration and Nationality Act does not apply to eligible aliens seeking adjustment of status under the \"Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 2009.\" However, aliens convicted of aggravated felonies or multiple crimes involving moral turpitude are ineligible for adjustment of status. Additionally, aliens who have been subject to orders of exclusion, deportation, or removal are also ineligible. An alien subject to deportation or removal orders can apply for adjustment of status under certain conditions without needing a separate motion. If approved, the Secretary of Homeland Security will cancel the deportation order. Aliens eligible for adjustment of status under specific conditions, including being a national of Liberia and continuously present in the US from January 1, 2009. Family members of eligible aliens also qualify. An alien can maintain continuous physical presence in the US even with absences totaling up to 180 days. The Secretary of Homeland Security can allow an alien facing deportation to seek a stay of removal by filing an application. The Secretary of Homeland Security can authorize an alien in deportation proceedings to work in the US while their adjustment of status application is pending. Upon approval of an alien's adjustment of status application, the Secretary of Homeland Security will establish a permanent residence record. If an application is pending for over 180 days without denial, employment authorization will be granted. Applicants have the right to administrative review. Under subsection (a), aliens have the same right to administrative review as applicants for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act and aliens subject to removal proceedings under section 240. A determination by the Secretary of Homeland Security regarding adjustment of status is final and not subject to judicial review. If an alien is granted permanent residence status, the Secretary of State is not required to reduce the number of immigrant visas available. The Immigration and Nationality Act provisions apply to the section, with definitions and powers of the Secretary of Homeland Security preserved. Eligibility for adjustment of status does not affect the status of lawful permanent residence. Admission for permanent residence under this section does not prevent an alien from pursuing other eligible statuses under different laws."
