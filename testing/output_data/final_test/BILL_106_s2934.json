    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Zero Tolerance for Repeat Polluters Act of 2000\". Congress finds that if a person or entity subject to a civil enforcement action under an environmental law has previously violated the same law at the same site or facility, they were not deterred by previous enforcement actions and should face additional penalties for deterrence. Additionally, current penalty maximums may not adequately reflect the serious public health or environmental consequences of violations resulting from a single catastrophic event. The purpose of this Act is to increase civil penalties for environmental violations in cases where there is a history of violations at the same site or facility, or when a violation leads to a catastrophic event. The purpose of this Act is to increase civil penalties for environmental violations in cases where there is a history of violations at the same site or facility, or when a violation leads to a catastrophic event. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines the term \"Administrator\" as the head of the EPA or a State with enforcement authority, and \"environmental law\" includes laws like the Federal Insecticide Act and Toxic Substances Control Act. The listed environmental laws include the Toxic Substances Control Act, Federal Water Pollution Control Act, Marine Protection Act, Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships, Shore Protection Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Solid Waste Disposal Act, Clean Air Act, and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. The term \"person\" in environmental laws refers to a person, site, or facility owner/operator identified under specific laws. A \"related party\" includes individuals with a defined relationship to the owner/operator or predecessors in cases of mergers. The term \"repeat violation\" refers to a violation by a repeat violator that is the subject of a finding and enforcement action, criminal action, or other agency action. A \"repeat violator\" is a person found to have violated the same environmental law at the same site or facility at least twice during the preceding 5-year period. A repeat violation occurs when a person violates the same environmental law at the same site or facility at least twice during the preceding 3-year period. SEC. 4. ADDITIONAL PENALTY FOR REPEAT VIOLATIONS. In civil judicial or administrative proceedings against a repeat violator for subsequent violations of environmental laws, additional penalties of 25%, 50%, and 100% of the maximum penalty per day may be assessed for first, second, and subsequent violations, respectively. The transfer of ownership or operation of a site or facility to a related party will not affect the liability of the owner or operator for repeat violations under environmental laws, with increasing penalties for each subsequent violation. SEC. 5. ADDITIONAL PENALTY FOR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. In this section, definitions are provided for terms such as catastrophic event, criteria air pollutant, hazardous air pollutant, and hazardous substance. These terms are defined based on their implications under environmental laws. The term \"ozone-depleting substance\" refers to class I or class II substances as defined in the Clean Air Act. An additional penalty is imposed for catastrophic events that pose a risk of serious harm or environmental damage. In catastrophic events without results described in subparagraph (B) or (C), penalties are imposed for emissions of hazardous air pollutants, criteria air pollutants, ozone-depleting substances, and hazardous substances released during the event. In catastrophic events resulting in serious human injury, death, or environmental damage, penalties are imposed for emissions of hazardous air pollutants, criteria air pollutants, ozone-depleting substances, and hazardous substances released during the event. The penalties include $15,000 per pound of hazardous air pollutant emitted, $15,000 per ton of criteria air pollutant or ozone-depleting substance emitted, and $15,000 for each quantity of hazardous substance equal to the reportable quantity specified in regulations. In catastrophic events, penalties are imposed for emissions of hazardous air pollutants, criteria air pollutants, ozone-depleting substances, and hazardous substances. The penalties include $25,000 per pound of hazardous air pollutant emitted, $25,000 per ton of criteria air pollutant or ozone-depleting substance emitted, and $25,000 for each quantity of hazardous substance equal to the reportable quantity specified in regulations. In catastrophic events, penalties are imposed for emissions of hazardous air pollutants, criteria air pollutants, ozone-depleting substances, and hazardous substances as specified in regulations. The penalties may include additional civil penalties for air pollutants falling within multiple categories. The Administrator may also require preventive measures to be implemented by violators in various enforceable mechanisms. The violator assessed penalties must implement preventive measures such as monitoring, recordkeeping, reporting, training, and operational requirements. SEC. 6. PRESERVATION OF AUTHORITY. The Administrator retains the authority to assess penalties under environmental laws and impose stricter measures on repeat violators or in catastrophic events. SEC. 7. EMERGENCY ORDER AND CIVIL ACTION PENALTY AUTHORITY. The Administrator has the authority to issue orders or take legal action against those responsible for endangering human health or the environment. Violators may face fines ranging from $25,000 to $10,000,000, with funds going to the Health and Environment Trust Fund. Up to $500,000 per project can be withdrawn from the fund without further appropriation for costs incurred by the Federal government. The Health and Environment Trust Fund allows for up to $500,000 per project to cover costs incurred by the Federal Government in addressing health or environmental threats that resulted in fines being collected."
