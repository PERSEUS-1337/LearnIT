Each State must submit a 3-year plan to the EPA within one year of this Act, aiming to increase recycling by 75%, reduce water source pollution, limit landfill dumping to non-recyclable materials, and phase out solid waste incineration within 4 years and 6 months. Plans must be adopted after public hearings before implementation. Each State must submit a 3-year plan to the EPA within one year of this Act, aiming to increase recycling by 75%, reduce water source pollution, limit landfill dumping to non-recyclable materials, and phase out solid waste incineration within 4 years and 6 months. Plans must be adopted after public hearings before implementation. The plan must include enforceable limitations, control measures, monitoring systems, data analysis, enforcement programs, and revision processes approved by the Administrator under this Act. The Administrator must ensure that state plans comply with the Act's requirements and involve local political subdivisions in the process. The EPA will establish criteria for plan submissions within 6 months of the Act's enactment to determine compliance. The Administrator must determine if state plan submissions comply with the Act within 6 months. If approved, implementation begins immediately; if rejected, the EPA will provide reasons for rejection, and the state has 3 months to submit a new plan. The State must implement the approved parts of the plan immediately and submit a revised plan within 3 months of the Administrator's disapproval. The Administrator must act on a state plan submission within 12 months of determination, either approving or rejecting it. The Administrator must act on plan submissions within 12 months, approving or rejecting them. Submissions meeting requirements are fully approved, while partial approval is possible for sections meeting requirements. Conditional approval may be granted based on a State commitment to adopt. The Administrator may require plan revisions if the current plan is inadequate, setting deadlines for submission. Conditional approval may be granted based on a State commitment to adopt specific measures within a year. Failure to comply with the commitment will result in disapproval. Each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under this Act shall be adopted by the State after a public hearing. The Administrator may revise any action on a plan without further submission if an error is found, and sanctions may be applied if necessary. The Administrator can impose sanctions listed in section 2 for findings, disapprovals, or determinations related to any plan. A Federal implementation plan must be issued within 2 years if a State fails to submit a required plan or if the submitted plan does not meet minimum criteria, unless the State corrects the deficiency before the Federal plan is issued. The Administrator can impose sanctions listed in section 2 for findings, disapprovals, or determinations related to any plan. If a State fails to submit a required plan or elements, or if an approved plan is not implemented within 18 months, sanctions may be imposed by the Administrator as listed in section 2. The Administrator may impose sanctions on a State for non-compliance, including prohibiting approval of projects or grants under title 23, United States Code, except for safety-related projects. Projects for public transit and certain road constructions may still be approved by the Secretary despite the sanction. The curr_chunk discusses various programs aimed at improving traffic flow and reducing congestion, including construction of lanes for high occupancy vehicles, traffic signalization, parking facilities for multiple occupancy vehicles, vehicle use restrictions in emission-concentrated areas, and breakdown management systems. Incentives are provided to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion, such as construction of lanes for high occupancy vehicles, traffic signalization, parking facilities for multiple occupancy vehicles, vehicle use restrictions in emission-concentrated areas, and breakdown management systems. The Administrator can grant funds to States phasing out solid waste incineration early for eco-friendly disposal methods. Grants range from $25,000,000 to $60,000,000 based on the timeline of phase-out. States transitioning from incineration must establish an Interstate Waste Authority. States phasing out solid waste incineration can limit importation of solid waste."
