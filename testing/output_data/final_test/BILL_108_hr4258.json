    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Rapid Pathogen Identification to Delivery of Cures Act\". The Congress acknowledges the potential threat of terrorists using biotechnology to enhance biological agents, which could undermine current diagnostic, therapeutic, and immune responses. The advancement of biotechnology may increase this risk over time, while natural processes can also lead to the emergence of harmful pathogens. The lengthy and costly process of developing new drugs and vaccines, which can take 10 to 20 years and cost $800 million on average, is a significant barrier to responding effectively to pathogens. Congress has authorized expedited approval processes during emergencies, but it still may take years to implement. There is a lack of coordinated research and development program to quickly develop biodefense medical countermeasures against new pathogens. Existing technologies are not being efficiently utilized to screen drug candidates and manufacture treatments. Private sector firms are shifting away from innovation in infectious disease research towards more profitable medical markets. Public-private investment can significantly reduce the time needed to develop new countermeasures, as the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are quick to adopt new technologies. The Congress declares the national policy to promote technological advancements for faster development of new medical countermeasures to treat infectious diseases. SEC. 304A. RAPID BIODEFENSE COUNTERMEASURES DEVELOPMENT NATIONAL STRATEGY. The Secretaries of Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, and Defense must submit a report to Congress within 180 days of the Rapid Pathogen Identification to Delivery of Cures Act enactment, outlining a strategy to shorten the timeframe for developing and approving countermeasures against new pathogens. The report should address technical obstacles and research needs for faster countermeasure development under emergency conditions. The curr_chunk discusses the identification of research, development, and technology needs to address impediments, existing efforts in Federal agencies, academia, and industry, facilities and resources that can be utilized for research needs among various entities. The curr_chunk proposes a federal program to address research, development, and technology needs, including the allocation of funds, interagency coordination, partnerships with private corporations, and information sharing among different institutions. The curr_chunk outlines considerations for a national strategy, including promoting private sector participation, adjusting regulatory requirements for innovation, addressing liability concerns for countermeasure distribution, and managing technology transfer and intellectual property rights. The curr_chunk discusses the research, development, and technology needs for pathogen identification and priority countermeasures, including initial pathogen characterization, countermeasure discovery, pre-clinical testing, and safety and efficacy animal testing for accelerated approval under emergency conditions. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of safety and efficacy human testing, manufacturing processes, and approval of priority countermeasures under emergency conditions. It also highlights the significance of advanced technologies like automation, computer modeling, bioinformatics, and bioengineering for manufacturing. The curr_chunk discusses the availability of manufacturing capacity for priority countermeasures production under emergency conditions and the importance of national and international collaborative research networks for rapid development and sharing of research results. The Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority to contract with firms or institutions for necessary research and analysis. The curr_chunk defines emergency conditions, pathogen identification, and priority countermeasure. The curr_chunk authorizes $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2005 to carry out the defined emergency conditions, pathogen identification, and priority countermeasure. SEC. 4. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a system for rapid clinical research on new pathogens. An emergency fund will be available for this purpose. SEC. 5. An interagency working group will be formed. SEC. 5. INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP. Amends the Public Health Service Act to include the Secretary of Homeland Security in the interagency working group. Develops a national strategy for rapid development and approval of countermeasures against new pathogens. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include the development of a capability to rapidly identify, develop, produce, and approve priority countermeasures against novel pathogens or toxins. Additionally, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 is amended to include research, development, and procurement at the Department of Defense. The program aims to provide the Federal Government with the ability to quickly develop and approve countermeasures against new pathogens or toxins under emergency conditions. This includes research, development, and procurement to address threats for which no existing countermeasure is deemed safe or effective. The program aims to rapidly develop and approve countermeasures against new pathogens or toxins under emergency conditions, collaborating with Defense and Health and Human Services Secretaries. This includes research, development, and procurement for priority countermeasures when no safe or effective existing countermeasure is available."
