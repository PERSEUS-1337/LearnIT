The Veterans Life Insurance Improvement Act of 2003 allows for payment to an alternate beneficiary if the first beneficiary does not claim within two years after the insured's death. If no claim is made within four years, payment can be made to a beneficiary designated by the insured. For the purposes of the Veterans Life Insurance Improvement Act of 2003, subsection (c)(1) of section 1952 shall be treated as two-year and four-year periods from the enactment of the Act. SEC. 3. REDUCTION IN SERVICE-DISABLED VETERANS INSURANCE PREMIUMS. Section 1922(a) of title 38, United States Code, is amended to update insurance terms and conditions, including premium rates based on specific mortality tables and interest rates. The insurance terms and conditions, including premium rates, are updated based on specific mortality tables and interest rates. Policies issued before 2003 use the 1941 Standard Ordinary Table of Mortality with 2.25% interest, while policies issued after 2003 use the 1980 Commissioners Standard Ordinary Basic Table of Mortality with 5% interest. The insurance terms for policies involving annuities are based on the 1949 Annuity Table with 2.25% interest, while insurance granted under this section is nonparticipating. Premiums and collections are credited to a Treasury fund, and payments are made directly from that fund. Appropriations to the fund are authorized, and waiver of premiums can be done under specific conditions. Insurance coverage under the National Service Life Insurance Act of 1940 cannot be denied due to a service-connected disability becoming total before the insurance's effective date. SEC. 4. The Veterans' Mortgage Life Insurance coverage is increased to $200,000, effective for veterans insured under section 2106 who die on or after the enactment of this Act."
