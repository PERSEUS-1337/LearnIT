The Act titled \"Colorado River Indian Reservation Boundary Correction Act\" was created to address the expansion of the Reservation in Arizona and California. President Grant issued Executive Orders in 1873 and 1874 to secure the southern boundary and prevent conflicts with non-Indians. The Robbins Survey in 1875 added approximately 16,000 acres known as the La Paz lands to the Reservation. In 1907, due to trespasses by miners and cattle, a resurvey of the Reservation's southern and southeastern areas was conducted. In 1914, a resurvey by Mr. Guy Harrington confirmed the boundaries established in 1876. However, in 1915, the Secretary of the Interior reversed the decision to accept the resurvey. The Secretary of the Interior reversed the decision to accept the Harrington Resurvey in 1915, leading to the exclusion of La Paz lands from the Reservation. Historical evidence suggests that this exclusion was based on an error in locating the southern boundary. The La Paz lands hold cultural, historical, and economic significance for the Colorado River Indian tribes. The Colorado River Indian tribes seek to restore La Paz lands to their Reservation, correcting the south boundary as delineated by the Robbins Survey and affirmed by the Harrington Resurvey. The Act aims to ensure public access for recreational purposes and have the corrected boundary resurveyed and marked by the Secretary of the Interior. The Act aims to correct and restore the boundary of La Paz lands for the Colorado River Indian tribes, ensuring public access for recreational purposes. The boundaries of the Colorado River Indian Reservation are defined by the Robbins and Harrington Surveys, including approximately 15,375 acres of Federal land. The Map detailing these boundaries is available for review at the Bureau of Land Management. All excluded lands under Executive Order No. 2273 are restored to the Reservation. The lands excluded under Executive Order No. 2273 are restored to the Colorado River Indian Reservation, held in trust by the United States. Two parcels of Arizona State Lands are excluded from the restoration. SEC. 3. RESURVEY AND MARKING. The boundary of the restored lands must be surveyed and marked according to the public survey system. SEC. 4. WATER RIGHTS. No Federal reserve water rights to surface or ground water on the restored lands. SEC. 5. PUBLIC ACCESS. Public access for hunting and recreation on the restored lands will continue under rules set by the Colorado River Indian Tribes. SEC. 6. ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. The restored lands described in section (2)(a) will retain existing rights-of-way, easements, leases, and mining claims. The United States reserves the right to continue Reclamation projects and access mineral materials for Colorado River maintenance. The Secretary may grant additional rights-of-way for roads, utilities, and accommodations if necessary and without causing harm to the Colorado River Indian Tribes. The proposed right-of-way must comply with federal regulations and other laws, with fees for renewals not exceeding the current federal rate if in compliance. Land taken into trust under this Act shall not be used for gaming purposes as defined in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act."
