    "content": "The \"Automatic Voter Registration Act\" is also known as the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. It allows for automatic voter registration through state motor vehicle authorities. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993, also known as the Automatic Voter Registration Act, mandates that each State's motor vehicle authority must transmit identifying information, including legal name, age, residence, citizenship status, and electronic signature, to the appropriate State election official for individuals requesting services. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 requires States to transmit identifying information for voter registration purposes. States are prohibited from using this information for any other purpose than determining voter eligibility. Upon receiving the information, the State election official must notify the individual and give them a 21-day period to decline voter registration. Upon expiration of the 21-day period from notification, eligible individuals will be automatically registered to vote in Federal elections unless they do not meet eligibility requirements or decline registration. The individual can decline to be registered to vote in elections or if already registered, they do not need to re-register. Amendments are made regarding the timing of registration through a motor vehicle authority before elections. Other conforming amendments are also mentioned in the Act. Amendment to Section 4(a)(1) of the Act allows voter registration through the State motor vehicle authority pursuant to section 5. The amendments made by this Act will take effect after a 180-day period from the enactment date. Individuals who provided identifying information to a State motor vehicle authority before this effective date must have their information transmitted to the State election official by that date, unless the information is no longer valid."
