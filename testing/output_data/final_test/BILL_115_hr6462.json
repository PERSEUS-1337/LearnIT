    "content": "The \"Border Zone Reasonableness Restoration Act of 2018\" allows oversight of power to enter private land and stop vehicles without a warrant. The \"Border Zone Reasonableness Restoration Act of 2018\" amends Section 287(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, redesignating paragraphs and clauses, and changing references from \"Service\" to \"Department of Homeland Security\" and \"Attorney General\" to \"Secretary of Homeland Security.\" The \"Border Zone Reasonableness Restoration Act of 2018\" amends Section 287(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, allowing for the boarding and searching of vessels and vehicles within 25 air miles of the U.S. border to prevent illegal entry of aliens. No vehicle can be stopped beyond 10 air miles without reasonable suspicion. The \"Border Zone Reasonableness Restoration Act of 2018\" allows for patrolling the border within 10 air miles without reasonable suspicion, and the Secretary of Homeland Security may establish a maximum distance of 100 air miles for border patrol authority. The Secretary of Homeland Security can establish a distance less than 10 air miles but not exceeding 25 air miles from the external boundary of the United States for border patrol authority, if certified necessary to prevent illegal entry of aliens. The Secretary of Homeland Security considers various factors when certifying the need for border patrol authority within a specified distance from the external boundary of the United States. Certifications are valid for 5 years and can be renewed, but can be terminated if circumstances change. The Secretary of Homeland Security must annually report to specific committees on certifications made for border patrol authority, including the number of certifications, sectors or districts covered, duration of certification, and justification. Technical and conforming amendments are also made to the Immigration and Nationality Act regarding authorities without a warrant. The undesignated matter following paragraph (2) is amended to insert new regulations and make changes to certain terms. A conforming amendment is made to Section 287(e) of the Immigration and Nationality Act."
