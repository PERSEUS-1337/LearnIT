    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Microbicide Development Act\". Congress finds that women and girls are increasingly affected by HIV/AIDS worldwide, with nearly half of adults living with the disease being women. Young women, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, are at higher risk of HIV infection. Mother-to-child transmission can be prevented by ensuring mothers are not infected in the first place. Many women, especially in the developing world, are unable to insist on mutual monogamy or negotiate condom use with their husbands, putting them at risk of HIV infection. Scientists are developing microbicides as a new prevention tool to stop the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Microbicides are being developed as a new prevention tool to protect women from HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. They could also allow women to become pregnant while protecting them from infection. The lack of HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment has left millions of children as orphans, with a significant number in sub-Saharan Africa. HIV prevention tools like microbicides could also benefit women in the United States. In the United States, women, especially minority women like African-American and Latina women, are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS. The country also has the highest rates of sexually transmitted infections, with young people and women bearing a significant burden. Women under 25 are particularly vulnerable to STIs, experiencing serious health consequences. The microbicide field has gained scientific momentum with products in human trials to measure effectiveness and new products in safety trials. Microbicides are a public health good with potential for large social benefits but limited economic incentives. HIV/AIDS threatens national and global security, impacting individuals, families, communities, economic growth, health budgets, civil society, and armed forces. The development of microbicides relies on government leadership and investment, with public funding needed due to limited economic incentives for private investment. The Federal Government must commit to supporting microbicide research, with key agencies like the National Institutes of Health playing a crucial role in advancing this field. The United States government agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, the United States Agency for International Development, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are actively involved in supporting microbicide research and trials in developing countries. They aim to facilitate the introduction of microbicides as a promising preventative intervention. The United States government is committed to accelerating the development of safe and effective microbicides to prevent HIV. Federal leadership and coordination are needed to eliminate inefficiencies in research efforts. HIV prevention options available as of 2006 are being expanded by various agencies. The current HIV prevention options available as of 2006 are insufficient, particularly in addressing women's needs and vulnerabilities. To genuinely protect themselves, women need the rapid development of new technologies like microbicides that they can initiate. The Office of AIDS Research is focusing on microbicides for preventing HIV/AIDS and other diseases, aiming to address the insufficiency of current prevention options, especially for women. The Office of AIDS Research is prioritizing the implementation of a Federal strategic plan for microbicide research and development, coordinating with other Federal agencies for funding and activities. The Office of AIDS Research is working with the United States Agency for International Development, microbicide research community, and health advocates to expand and coordinate activities for research and development of microbicides to prevent HIV transmission and other sexually transmitted infections. The Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases will lead the Microbicide Development Branch in these efforts. The Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases will establish a branch within the Division of AIDS dedicated to microbicide research and development. Priority will be given to funding and supporting clinical trials, with a focus on trials leading to product licensure. Reports to Congress will be submitted six months after the enactment of the Microbicide Development Act and annually thereafter. The Director of the Office of AIDS Research will submit annual reports to Congress detailing the Federal Government's strategies for microbicide research and development. Reports will include activities, expenditures, and analysis of research efforts. The Director of the Office of AIDS Research will submit annual reports to Congress on microbicide research progress, including basic research, product development, clinical trials, and behavioral science. The appropriate committees of Congress are defined as the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate, the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives. Authorization of appropriations is provided for each fiscal year. TITLE II--MICROBICIDE RESEARCH AT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION. SEC. 201. MICROBICIDES FOR PREVENTING TRANSMISSION OF HIV/AIDS AND OTHER DISEASES. Part B of title III of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include section 317T on microbicides for preventing transmission of diseases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will implement a microbicide agenda, including laboratory and behavioral research for clinical trials. They will ensure enough staff for this agenda and report to Congress annually. The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will submit an annual report to Congress on microbicide research and development activities, as required by the Microbicide Development Act. The report will include a description of CDC activities, expenditures, and be part of the Federal strategic plan on microbicides compiled by the National Institutes of Health Office of AIDS Research. The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will provide an annual report to Congress on microbicide research and development activities. The report will include a summary of expenditures, analysis of activities, progress made towards effective microbicides, and involve appropriate congressional committees. Authorization of Appropriations for the House of Representatives to carry out this section each fiscal year. Title III focuses on microbicide research and development at the United States Agency for International Development, specifically addressing the use of microbicides for preventing the transmission of HIV/AIDS and other diseases. Section 104A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to include a new subsection focusing on the development and implementation of microbicides for preventing the transmission of HIV/AIDS and other diseases. The President is directed to support the program and ensure sufficient staffing for its implementation. The President is required to submit annual reports to Congress on the activities of the Agency related to microbicide research and development, as per the Microbicide Development Act. The reports should include a description of activities conducted or supported by the Agency and a summary and analysis of these activities. The President must submit annual reports to Congress on the Agency's expenditures and progress in microbicide research and development. Consultation with the Director of the Office of AIDS Research is required for preparing the report. Authorization of appropriations is granted to the Agency for necessary sums each fiscal year to carry out the specified subsection. The term 'appropriate congressional committees' is defined as specific committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate."
