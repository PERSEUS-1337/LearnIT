    "content": "The conference report on the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2010 (H.R. 2647) and a compromise version of the FY2010 defense appropriations bill (H.R. 3326) supported the Obama Administration's proposals to terminate major weapons programs like the Air Force's F-22 fighter. This decision aimed to focus resources on equipment better suited for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The bills were approved by the House and Senate, with the President signing the authorization bill into law (P.L. 111-84) on October 28. In December 2009, House and Senate negotiators agreed on a compromise amendment to the Senate-passed defense appropriations bill for FY2010. The bill allocated $497.7 billion for the DOD base budget and $128.2 billion for war costs. It was passed by the House and Senate with overwhelming support and signed into law by the President on December 19 (P.L. 111-118). The bills did not cover funds for President Obama's decision to increase troops in Afghanistan but did include funds for ongoing operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. The enacted defense bills fund the development of an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter despite warnings of a potential veto from the Office of Management and Budget and Defense Secretary Robert Gates. The veto threats regarding the alternate engine program were less definitive compared to President Obama's previous veto declaration on the F-22 production. The Administration opposes the alternate engine program for the F-35 due to potential disruption. Secretary Gates objects to additional funding for C-17 production in the defense bill. Veto threats were less definitive compared to previous issues like the F-22 production. The compromise final version of H.R. 3326 includes $1.5 billion for 10 C-17s, despite objections from OMB and Secretary Gates. The DOD appropriations bill faced a veto threat over funds for VH-71 helicopters, with $100 million added to the program in the final version. The total authorization for military activities of DOD and defense-related activities of other federal agencies is $680.2 billion, including $550.2 billion for the base budget and $130.0 billion for overseas contingency operations. The authorization bill includes funding for the F-22 and an alternative engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, despite President Obama's veto threat against continued F-22 procurement. The Administration expressed objections to funding certain programs approved by Congress, such as the F-22 and F-35 engine, despite potential veto threats. The defense authorization bill included provisions for these programs, with the F-22 being terminated but the F-35 engine program allowed to continue. The conference report on the defense authorization bill included provisions broadening federal jurisdiction over hate crimes to include gender, sexual orientation, and gender identity. It also addressed the treatment of detainees, including those at Guantanamo Bay Naval Station. The compromise version of H.R. 3326, signed into law as P.L. 111-118, allocated $497.7 billion for the DOD base budget and $128.2 billion for FY2010 war costs. It included a 3.4% pay raise for military personnel, higher than the Administration's budget request of 2.9%. The compromise bill for H.R. 3326 allocated $497.7 billion for the DOD base budget and $128.2 billion for FY2010 war costs. It included a 3.4% pay raise for military personnel, higher than the Administration's request. The bill terminated or reduced funding for various weapons programs but also included funding for the F-35 alternate engine and C-17 cargo jets, which the Administration opposed. Additionally, it allocated $100 million for the VH-71 helicopter development. The FY2010 budget includes funding to terminate the VH-71 program, with $100 million allocated for salvage of technologies. The bill cuts $900 million from Afghanistan's army and police force support but adds $900 million for MRAP vehicles. The compromise bill also includes provisions for extending current policies temporarily. The FY2010 budget includes funding for various non-DOD federal programs and activities, such as Small Business Administration loan guarantee programs, the USA PATRIOT Act, Medicare physicians payments, Surface Transportation Authorization, Unemployment insurance, COBRA health insurance subsidy, Satellite television copyright license, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and Poverty guidelines. The President's FY2010 request for the DOD base budget is $533.7 billion. The President's FY2010 request for the DOD base budget is $533.7 billion, which is $20.4 billion higher than the previous year. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates stated that this 4% nominal increase equates to a 2% increase in real purchasing power after adjusting for inflation. Additionally, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided an extra $7.5 billion in DOD appropriations for FY2009, bringing the total to $520.7 billion. The FY2010 request represents a $13.0 billion increase, or 2.5% (not adjusted for inflation). The FY2010 DOD base budget request is $533.7 billion, a $20.4 billion increase from the previous year. Secretary Gates mentioned a $13 billion shift of funds into the base budget for various military expenses, including Army and Marine Corps expansion, medical research, and quality-of-life improvements for personnel. However, in later testimony, he revised this amount to $8 billion. President Obama's FY2010 request for the DOD base budget is $520.7 billion, $7.4 billion more than the previous year. The comparison with the FY2010 budget projected by the Bush Administration is uncertain due to lack of specific details in the budget outline. President Obama's FY2010 DOD base budget request is $520.7 billion, $7.4 billion higher than the previous year. The Bush Administration's projected FY2010 DOD base budget was $524 billion, making Obama's request nearly $10 billion higher. However, when accounting for the $8 billion in programs not funded by the Bush Administration, Obama's request is only $2 billion higher on an apples-to-apples basis. In fall 2008, DOD proposed a FY2010 base budget $57 billion higher than the Bush Administration's projection, but this larger request was not part of the regular budget review process. The Administration's detailed budget request for FY2010 defense appropriations was transmitted to Congress in May 2009. Congress began acting on the annual defense authorization bill shortly after, with the House and Senate passing their versions of the bill in June and July. The House also passed the FY2010 defense appropriations bill in July, followed by the Senate in September. The conference report on the defense authorization bill was filed in October and adopted by the House. The Senate passed the amended version of the bill on September 6 by a vote of 93-7. House and Senate negotiators agreed on an amendment to appropriate $497.7 billion for the DOD base budget and $128.2 billion for war costs. The House passed the compromise version on December 16 by a vote of 395-34, and the Senate passed it on December 19 by a vote of 88-10. The President signed the bill into law on December 19 (P.L. 111-118). The Obama Administration's request for $130 billion for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan during FY2010 was submitted to Congress in May 2009. The review of U.S. strategy for wars was completed in March 2009. President Obama announced the deployment of 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan in December 2009, with estimated costs of $30-35 billion. The Administration is developing a supplemental request for FY2010 to cover additional war costs. The Administration is likely to submit a FY2010 Supplemental to Congress in early February 2010 along with DOD's regular and war requests for FY2011. It is unclear if DOD will include a decrease in troops in Afghanistan in its FY2011 war funding request. The debate on troop levels in Afghanistan started with General Stanley McChrystal's appointment in June 2009. President Obama mentioned transferring forces out of Afghanistan in July 2011 but did not provide a specific timeline. General David McKiernan was replaced due to concerns about rising violence in Afghanistan. General McChrystal submitted a report to Secretary of Defense Gates, highlighting the need for additional resources for a counterinsurgency strategy focusing on population protection and Afghan governance capabilities. The White House initiated a strategy review in response to the report. The White House considered various options for addressing the presence of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and the Taliban insurgency, with General McChrystal advocating for more troops. The main concern was the lack of al Qaeda bases in Afghanistan, with the focus shifting towards sanctuaries in Pakistan. Secretary Gates relayed McChrystal's troop request to the President separately from the strategy assessment. The White House considered options for Afghanistan, ranging from 10,000 to 80,000 troops for training Afghan forces and counter-insurgency operations. Fraudulent voting in the 2009 election raised concerns about the legitimacy of the Karzai government, influencing policy debates. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel emphasized the importance of training Afghan Security Forces over troop numbers. Staff Rahm Emanuel emphasized the need for a credible Afghan partner over troop numbers. President Karzai agreed to a runoff election on November 7, 2009, but his rival Abdullah Abdullah dropped out, leading to Karzai's victory. The United States congratulated Karzai and praised Abdullah for diplomatic restraint. President Obama announced the deployment of an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan on December 1, 2009. Secretary of Defense Gates stated that the President approved deploying 33,000 troops to Afghanistan, bringing the total U.S. forces to 101,000. NATO committed to sending an additional 5,000 to 7,000 troops, potentially reaching General McChrystal's 40,000 request. With NATO allies and the Afghan Army, the total troops in Afghanistan could exceed 190,000. If 30,000 more U.S. troops are approved and NATO contributes 5,000 more, the total could reach almost 230,000 troops in-country. The total number of troops in Afghanistan is almost 230,000, including Afghan and foreign troops, as well as Afghan police forces. Concerns have been raised about deploying additional troops, with public opinion divided on the President's new plan. The FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act and DOD Appropriations Act only address the $130 billion war cost estimate based on the Administration's strategy review. The plan for Iraq involves reducing troops from 140,000 to 35,000-50,000 by August 31, 2010, with all troops to be out by December 31, 2011. President Obama increased troops in Afghanistan by 21,000, totaling 68,000 in FY2010, a 68% increase from the previous year. The $130 billion requested for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in FY2010 is 11% lower than FY2009. The FY2010 budget for war costs is $15.8 billion lower than FY2009 due to reduced troop strength in Iraq and Afghanistan. The $130 billion war funding request was amended to add 22,000 Army personnel temporarily to end the practice of \"stop-loss.\" The budget amendment added 22,000 Army personnel to end \"stop-loss\" practice, reallocating $1 billion from procurement funds. 15,000 troops would be deployed in FY2010, with the remaining 7,000 the following year. House and Senate actions on related bills were completed before the budget amendment, but the Senate's DOD Appropriations Act reflected the amended request. DOD's request included $60.8 billion for Operation Iraqi Freedom and $65.4 billion for Afghanistan. In FY2010, DOD funding of $130.1 billion would be allocated for Operation Iraqi Freedom, Afghanistan, and non-DOD classified activities. Secretary of Defense Gates mentioned that the war funding request did not include about $8 billion for activities expected to persist beyond the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. Funding was shifted to the base budget for activities likely to continue, such as increased Army strength levels, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, countering IED threats, medical care, and Global Train and Equip funds. In FY2010, DOD's funding request of $130 billion could potentially be reduced by $15.7 billion due to various factors such as transferring $8 billion into the base budget and expected decreases in troop strength in Iraq and Afghanistan. Total military personnel funding decreased from FY2009 levels, with planned troop reductions in Iraq offsetting increases in Afghanistan. Operation and maintenance funding remained consistent between FY2009 and FY2010. Operation and maintenance (O&M) funding in FY2010 remained at the same level as in FY2009 and FY2008 despite a planned decline in troop levels. Overall troop strength for Iraq and Afghanistan was expected to decrease by almost 20% in FY2010. Average monthly obligations for O&M in FY2009 were $11.4 billion, a 15% decline from FY2008. Obligations for Iraq decreased by 30% to $7.5 billion, while those for Afghanistan increased by 44% to $3.9 billion. In September of FY2009, DOD obligations spiked to $11.9 billion, above the average for the rest of the year. Despite a planned 20% decrease in troop levels for Iraq and Afghanistan in FY2010, DOD requested similar amounts for military personnel and operation and maintenance. The decrease in funding is mainly due to lower procurement spending on Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles, with DOD opting for a lighter, cheaper version more suitable for Afghanistan. Additionally, DOD is returning to traditional reconstitution practices, only using war funds to replace equipment lost in combat. Congressional action on the Administration's FY2010 war funding request is summarized in Table 4. The conference report on the FY2010 Authorization request largely supports DOD's funding request, with changes including reducing procurement funding by $625 million for Army end-strength increase, decreasing Commanders' Emergency Response Program funding, and adding $600 million for lighter MRAP vehicles for Afghanistan. The FY2010 Authorization conference report supports DOD's funding request with changes including reducing procurement funding for Army end-strength increase and adding $600 million for lighter MRAP vehicles for Afghanistan. Policy changes include deleting funding for the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund and transferring funds for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund to war funding. The authorization conference report supports DOD's funding request with changes, including reducing procurement funding for Army end-strength increase and adding $600 million for lighter MRAP vehicles for Afghanistan. It does not provide $115 million for Guantanamo Bay detainee relocation due to lack of a plan, as per the House and Senate's position. The report also extends war-related authorities and reporting requirements created since 9/11 attacks, such as extensions for Commanders' Emergency Response Program and coalition support funds with caps on funding amounts. The authorization conference report includes provisions for specialized training, supplies, and equipment for nations aiding U.S. military operations. It also extends reporting requirements for DOD support to foreign nations and limits funds for building foreign military capacity to $75 million in FY2010. The authorization conference report extends reporting requirements for DOD support to foreign nations and limits funds for building foreign military capacity to $75 million in FY2010 and FY2011. New reporting requirements for Pakistan include assessing progress towards security and stability, defeating Al Qaeda, and preventing safe havens. Section 1231 of the authorization conference report requires DOD and State Department to assess alternatives for reimbursing Pakistan for support to focus on counterterrorism. Section 1224 mandates quarterly reports on projects funded by the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Fund and DOD's assessment of Pakistan's efforts against Al Qaeda and Taliban threats. The conference report also expands reporting requirements for Afghanistan. Section 1236 expands the semi-annual report on progress in Afghanistan to include new sections on NATO and non-NATO countries in ISAF, covering agreements, progress against insurgency, and reconstruction coordination. Section 1235 requires a study on force levels in southern and eastern Afghanistan, while Section 1225 mandates DOD to certify a program for monitoring defense transfers to Afghanistan and Pakistan before making transfers. Section 1228 requires an assessment and report on \"community-based security programs\" in Afghanistan within 120 days of enactment. The conference report on H.R. 2647 requires reports on Iraq, including personnel levels, equipment remaining, detainee operations, and risks associated with the drawdown. Section 1230 requires a report on the feasibility within 180 days. Section 1230 of the enacted authorization (P.L. 111-84) requires a report within 180 days on the feasibility and desirability of providing monetary assistance to civilian foreign nationals for losses related to U.S. combat activities. Additionally, Section 1226 mandates a report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) assessing DOD's campaign plans for Iraq and Afghanistan, to be updated periodically. Section 1234 requires notification before transferring U.S. equipment to Iraq and Afghanistan, with quarterly reports on the equipment and any potential impact on U.S. forces. The compromise version of the FY2010 DOD appropriations bill limits the total value of equipment transfers to $750 million. The bill provides $128.2 billion for the war in FY2010, $400 million less than requested by DOD. Additionally, there is a request for $1.4 billion for war-related construction in the FY2010 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies appropriations bill. The FY2010 DOD appropriations bill, enacted as Part E of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2010 (H.R. 3288), allocated $5 billion of the requested Operation and Maintenance funds to the Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 3326 differed in their treatment of force protection funding, with the House cutting $1.9 billion from DOD's request. The House cut $1.9 billion from DOD's request for Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles, while the Senate added $1.2 billion for additional MRAP All-Terrain vehicles. The compromise bill allocated a total of $6.28 billion, including $825 million for M-ATVs, transferring funds from the base budget to war funding in both versions. The Senate version proposed transferring $250 million from O&M funds to Title IX, reversing DOD's proposal. The compromise bill transferred $850 million in military personnel funding to Title IX and cut DOD's $1.5 billion CERP request. Both House and Senate expressed concerns about CERP management and oversight. The House and Senate cut DOD's $1.5 billion CERP request in small reconstruction projects. The compromise bill would provide $1.2 billion for CERP and require additional reports on fund usage. The House approved $7.5 billion for Afghan Security Forces training, while the Senate cut it by $900 million for MRAP vehicles, arguing the funds wouldn't be spent in FY2010. The compromise bill incorporated the Senate's reduction to the request for funding to transfer detainees from Guantanamo Bay. Some argue for higher defense spending to avoid cuts in major weapons programs or force size, calling for a baseline defense budget around 4% of GDP. Senator James M. Inhofe is involved in the discussion. Senator James M. Inhofe and Representative Trent Franks introduced joint resolutions calling for a base defense budget equal to at least 4% of GDP, citing the decline in DOD's budget and force structure since the Cold War. This proposal comes at a time when military spending is already robust. The Department of Defense budget increased significantly in FY2009, surpassing Cold War averages. Funding for weapons acquisition also saw a substantial rise. Additionally, supplemental appropriations for war-related costs grew substantially from FY2001 to FY2009. The Department of Defense budget increased significantly from $19.4 billion in FY2001 to $189 billion in FY2008, with a focus on buying new equipment for the Army and Marine Corps. The rise in spending was driven by war-related operating costs and modernizing equipment stock. Future baseline budgets are expected to decline, leading to varying policy implications. The Administration plans to cut the deficit in half by the end of President Obama's first term, which includes limits on defense and non-defense spending. White House budget projections show a decline in defense budget from FY2009 to FY2012, with analysts expecting a flat baseline defense budget in the future. Supplemental appropriations are also expected to decrease, with costs for training and equipment maintenance shifting back to the regular budget. Costs of military personnel have increased significantly in recent years, with Congress approving pay and benefits increases, including pay raises above civilian indices, pay table reforms, increased housing allowances, health insurance for Medicare-eligible retirees, and other benefits. This has led to the need to find additional funding for ground forces upgrades as training and equipment maintenance costs shift back to the regular budget. The cost of military personnel has risen due to increases in retiree survivor benefits, enlistment bonuses, and special pays. Despite potential future declines in bonuses, most past pay and benefits increases are now part of the basic personnel cost. Uniformed personnel now cost 40% more per capita, adjusted for inflation, than in FY1999. Operating costs, including training, repairs, and health care, have grown about 2.7% per year above inflation, reflecting a trend of continued growth in military expenses. The growth in operating costs in defense planning is eroding resources for weapons modernization and other priorities. There is increasing concern about generational cost growth in major weapons programs, with new generations of weapons expected to be more expensive. The rate of cost growth is becoming a significant issue within the Defense Department, as new advanced weapons systems are getting more expensive at a faster rate than in the past. Without increased budgets, trade-offs between new weapons costs and force size may be necessary. The Government Accountability Office has noted significant cost increases in major defense systems compared to original estimates, leading to budget instability and inefficiencies in production rates. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have resulted in increased equipment requirements for ground forces, necessitating modern equipment for National Guard combat units. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have highlighted the need for modern equipment for ground forces, including National Guard combat units. Secretary Gates emphasizes the importance of designing forces for a broader range of national security challenges, including insurgencies, support of allies, and new types of attacks. The need for modern equipment for ground forces, including National Guard combat units, has been highlighted by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Secretary Gates emphasizes the importance of designing forces for a broader range of national security challenges, including insurgencies, support of allies, and new types of attacks. Military planners are facing shortfalls due to new disruptive attacks on U.S. and allied vulnerabilities, leading to a broadening of requirements without a corresponding reduction in older force goals. Congress is considering alternatives to simply providing more money for defense, such as reevaluating plans to add 92,000 active duty troops, reallocating resources among military services, reviewing requirements for expensive new technologies, and shifting resources from military responses to global threats towards non-military prevention methods. Secretary Gates announced budget decisions on April 6, 2009, to reshape America's defense priorities towards non-military prevention methods in response to global threats. The emphasis was on resources rather than policy decisions or ways to achieve desired ends. This strategic shift was based on a continuum of thinking dating back 18 months, outlined in the June 2008 National Defense Strategy and other official documents. The Department of Defense's strategic thought focuses on preparing for hybrid warfare, blending state and non-state actors using advanced technologies and unconventional approaches. Investments and force adjustments are needed to meet these challenges, while still addressing conventional threats. The Department of Defense is operating in a resource-constrained environment, with partnerships playing an increasingly important role in future operations. Secretary Gates' decisions announced in April 6 were somewhat off cycle with Congressionally-mandated defense strategic review processes, raising questions about their strategic basis. The national security strategy and defense strategy are interconnected, with the President required to submit reports annually. The Department of Defense conducts a Quadrennial Defense Review in the first year of each Administration. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) is a rigorous review process conducted by the Department of Defense every four years. The report must include a comprehensive discussion of the national defense strategy of the United States, consistent with the most recent national security strategy. The due date for the QDR is early February 2010. The Obama Administration is broadly on track with the prescribed strategy cycle, but it may not be well-adapted for informing budget priorities in the first year of a new Administration. The National Security Strategy (NSS) was issued by the Bush Administration in March 2006. The Obama Administration is unlikely to publish a new NSS in time for the 2010 QDR. A national security review process led by the National Security Council will set parameters for the QDR. The 2008 National Defense Strategy (NDS) will inform the 2010 QDR and budget decisions for FY2011. Despite the absence of a concurrent QDR or NDS process, budget decisions announced on April 6 were developed over three months. The budget decisions announced on April 6 were developed over three months in an inclusive process involving senior DOD leaders. Several issues were deferred to the forthcoming QDR process, including amphibious capabilities, a follow-on bomber, and strategic requirements. On April 6, 2009, Secretary Gates announced key recommendations incorporated into the Administration's FY2010 budget request to change DOD's strategic direction and improve military personnel's quality of life. Secretary Gates announced recommendations in the FY2010 budget to improve military personnel's quality of life, including completing the Army and Marine Corps expansion, halting personnel reductions in the Air Force and Navy, and funding end strength levels at a cost of $11 billion. The Army and Marine Corps had previously maintained end strength levels of 482,400 and 175,000 respectively, which were deemed adequate until the need to reexamine arose due to prolonged multi-front war. DOD announced plans to increase the permanent end strength of the Army and Marine Corps in response to the prolonged multi-front war. The Army's authorization cap would increase to 547,400 by 2012, while the Marine Corps' cap would increase to 202,000 by 2011. The Air Force, on the other hand, has been reducing personnel numbers in recent years. The Air Force has been reducing personnel numbers to fund equipment modernization programs, with a plan to reduce by 60,000 personnel by the end of FY2009. However, the drawdown was halted in 2008, and the goal is to stabilize the Service at approximately 330,000 personnel. The Navy has been downsizing to reach a goal of 329,000 personnel to sustain 313 ships and 3,800 aircraft by the end of FY2009. Secretary Gates planned to increase funding for troops and their families in FY2010, including $400 million for medical research, $300 million for programs addressing injuries and psychological health, and $200 million for improvements in child care and education. Existing programs previously funded through supplementals would now be included in the base defense budget. The department would spend over $47 billion on healthcare in FY2010, with no mention of cost-saving proposals in the budget submission. In April 2009, Secretary Gates announced that the Defense Health Program request would be fully funded in the FY2010 budget, without any cost-saving proposals included. The DOD had previously proposed increases in Tricare fees for retired beneficiaries, but Congress consistently blocked these fee hikes. In FY 2007, Congress established a DOD Task Force on the Future of Military Health Care to address cost growth issues. The Task Force submitted its final report in December 2007, focusing on sustaining defense health care and cost-sharing structures. The Task Force on the Future of Military Health Care submitted its final report in December 2007, recommending phased-in changes in enrollment fees and deductibles to restore cost-sharing relationships. For example, average enrollment fees for under-65 retiree families would gradually increase from $460 to $1,100 per year. The Tenth Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation in July 2008 suggested setting Tricare Prime premiums for single retirees under 65 at 40% of Medicare Part B premiums and Tricare Standard/Extra premiums at 15% of Part B premiums. Family rates would be double the single rate. The Task Force on the Future of Military Health Care recommended changes in enrollment fees and deductibles for retirees. Tricare deductibles would be linked to Medicare rates, with copayments waived for preventative care and prescription drug payments limited. The DOD's Military Health System Senior Oversight Committee responded to the recommendations, rejecting some cost-sharing suggestions but expressing a desire to charge fees and copays to maintain a generous health care benefit. Secretary Gates is considering charging fees and copays to maintain a generous health care benefit and fair cost-sharing with DOD beneficiaries. He also plans to increase intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance support by $2 billion within the base budget to enhance capabilities for irregular warfare. These details may be included in the official budget submission or DOD's national defense authorization legislative package. Secretary Gates plans to increase intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) support by $2 billion within the base budget, focusing on expanding the use of ISR systems, particularly unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), in Iraq and Afghanistan. This initiative aims to field and sustain 50 continuous orbits of UAVs, including Predator and Reaper-class drones, to enhance situational awareness for locating adversaries and IEDs. The Gates initiative aims to include key tactical ISR systems in the base budget to address the reliance on supplemental funding. Plans for more extensive R&D on ISR systems were announced, focusing on systems linking warfighters and national systems. The DNI and DOD have agreed on deploying new imagery satellites to replace current ones reaching the end of their operational lifespan. The Future Imagery Architecture replacement approach was cancelled in 2005 due to technical difficulties and cost-overruns. New systems are needed, with some Members favoring an alternative approach to the one approved by the DNI. The cost of the new systems is estimated to be around $10 billion, with an additional $500 million recommended by Secretary Gates for global capacity efforts. The satellite program will be funded in the classified National Intelligence Program. The FY2006 National Defense Authorization Act may require Congress to raise the authorized limit for building global partnership capacity under Section 1206. The current authorized amount is $350 million, but there may be a proposal to increase it and expand the types of foreign security personnel eligible for assistance. This aligns with DOD's original proposal in 2005 to assist foreign military and security forces with up to $750 million per fiscal year. The Section 1206 authority, initially controversial, allows DOD to provide assistance to foreign military forces. Originally limited to $200 million per year, it was later amended in the FY2007 NDAA to raise the spending limit to $300 million. Congress has also required the concurrence of the Secretary of State for certain actions under this authority. P.L. 109-364 amended Section 1206 to require Secretary of State concurrence for expenditures. Congress extended Section 1206 authority in FY2009 NDAA, raised spending limit to $350 million, and included maritime security forces. Secretary Gates proposed reducing active duty Brigade Combat Teams from 48 to 45. The Army reorganized into Brigade Combat Teams of 3,000-5,000 troops for independent deployment. This restructuring aimed to increase dwell time and eliminate Stop Loss orders. The transformation from division-centric to brigade-centric units began after 9/11. The FY2006 Quadrennial Defense Review aimed to transform the active Army into 42 Brigade Combat Teams and 75 Modular Support Brigades. In 2007, 65,000 soldiers were added to the force structure, increasing active duty end strength. Secretary Gates recommended increasing personnel assigned to Special Operations Forces by 5% and unspecified increases in transport and aerial refueling aircraft for special operations. The FY2006 Quadrennial Defense Review increased the number of active duty Special Forces Battalions and established a Marine Corps Special Operations Command. Special operations personnel face lengthy training requirements with a high failure rate. Secretary Gates recommended adding $500 million to the base budget to increase the number of deployable helicopters, mainly for recruiting and training Army helicopter pilots. Gen. Martin Dempsey supported the additional funds for this purpose. The Army's Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) plans to address U.S. commanders' complaints in Afghanistan by increasing funding for helicopter pilot training. Currently training 1,200 pilots annually, they aim to reach 1,500 with an additional $500 million. Navy shipbuilding has been a congressional concern due to low procurement rates and cost overruns in recent years. Secretary Gates did not propose significant reductions in Navy shipbuilding despite concerns about cost growth, delays, and deficiencies. Some Members of Congress are frustrated with the situation, but Gates justified his proposals based on strategic vision and modernization requirements. He did not suggest reducing the aircraft carrier force or canceling Zumwalt class destroyers as some had expected. Secretary Gates did not propose significant reductions in Navy shipbuilding despite concerns about cost growth, delays, and deficiencies. He suggested stretching out the schedule for procuring new carriers to one every five years instead of reducing the carrier force from 11 to 10 ships. This adjustment aims to place carrier procurement on a more fiscally sustainable path. Secretary Gates proposed stretching out the carrier procurement schedule to maintain an 11-carrier force through 2040, with a temporary drop to 10 ships for 33 months in 2012-2015. This adjustment aims to place carrier procurement on a more fiscally sustainable path. The drop in aircraft carrier numbers is not due to Secretary Gates's proposed carrier-procurement schedule but because the USS Enterprise is retiring in 2012 at age 51 without its replacement, the USS Gerald R. Ford, entering service until 2015. Gates's proposal to shift carrier procurement to one ship every five years would delay the procurement of the next carrier, CVN-79, by one year from FY2012 to FY2013, potentially increasing costs for both CVN-79 and Virginia-class submarines. This delay could also impact advance procurement funding for CVN-79 in FY2010. Secretary Gates's plan for ship funding in FY2010 depends on efficient contracts for building DDG-1000 and restarting DDG-51 programs. If unsuccessful, only one DDG-1000 prototype may be built, reducing overall ship procurement and workload in shipyards. Secretary Gates proposed reducing ship procurement and workload in shipyards as part of his plan for ship funding in FY2010. He emphasized the need for acquisition and contracting reform in the Department of Defense, stating that the current cycle of adding cost and complexity to fewer platforms must end. The Navy reached an agreement with Bath Iron Works and Northrop to have Bath build all three DDG-1000s, while Northrop would build the first two DDG-51s under the restart program. Northrop and Bath were selected to build DDG-51s under the restart program. Secretary Gates proposed delaying the CG(X) cruiser program to reassess requirements. The Navy plans to replace Ticonderoga-class cruisers with CG(X)s. Gates recommended slowing production of surface combatants but continuing with Littoral Combat Ship procurement. The FY2010 budget requested funding for three more Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) as part of a plan to increase annual procurement rates. The LCS program was restructured in 2007 due to cost growth and construction issues, with a total of 55 LCSs planned since 2006. The Navy announced a restructuring of the LCS program in 2009, canceling plans to build ships for two competing designs. They would choose between the designs in FY2010 and procure two LCS ships that year. Secretary Gates proposed deferring procurement of two ships to FY2011 to assess costs and capabilities. Secretary Gates proposed deferring funding for an 11th San Antonio class amphibious ship in FY2010 to assess the nation's need for amphibious capabilities in the 21st century. He emphasized the importance of being realistic about scenarios requiring direct U.S. military action. Secretary Gates proposed deferring funding for an 11th San Antonio class amphibious ship in FY2010 to assess the nation's need for amphibious capabilities in the 21st century. This could increase the cost of the 11th LPD-17 and the Mobile Landing Platform. Additionally, he announced plans to charter two existing high-speed sealift ships to improve inter-theater lift capability. Secretary Gates recommended various changes to aircraft programs, including a slight reduction in F/A-18 planes for the Navy in FY2010. He rejected calls to continue production of the F-22 in favor of a mix of F-22s, F-35s, and UAVs. Secretary Gates recommended purchasing 30 F-35s in FY2010, increasing funding to $11.2 billion. He also proposed buying 523 F-35s in FY2010-14 and a total of 2,443 over the program's life, marking UAVs as major components of the U.S. combat force. The procurement profile matches the current F-35 program, with a slight increase in aircraft purchases over the five-year defense plan. The Government Accountability Office criticized the $33 billion effort to increase the F-22 purchase plan by 169 aircraft, citing significant financial risk. Secretary Gates recommended ending the program at 187 planes, matching the program of record for the F-22 Raptor. Air Force Chief of Staff stated no military requirement for F-22s beyond 187. During his confirmation hearings in 2008, General Norton Schwartz expressed support for more than 183 but less than 381 F-22 aircraft. Admiral Mike Mullen mentioned a plan for 60 additional planes, deferred to the new administration. In April 2009, Air Force leadership endorsed Secretary Gates's proposal to cap F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft, citing budget constraints and new risk assessments. Congress has historically backed the F-22, adding $523 million in FY2009 for potential advanced procurement. Secretary Gates recommended purchasing 31 F/A-18 Super Hornets for the Navy in FY2010, including 18 F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and 22 EA-18G Growlers. This would be a reduction of nine aircraft from the previous DOD budget. The Air Force is advised to continue developing a new aerial refueling tanker (KC-X) to replace the KC-135. The Air Force's top acquisition priority is to replace the aging KC-135 with a new refueling tanker (KC-X). After a competition was cancelled due to a protest, a new competition began in September 2009. Congress supports replacing the KC-135 fleet, but there is disagreement on the best approach, with some advocating for a \"split\" buy while Secretary Gates remains opposed. Congress has urged DOD to increase KC-X production rates and created a Tanker Replacement Transfer Fund for flexibility in funding. Secretary Gates recommended ending C-17 Globemaster III procurement at 205 aircraft, matching the program of record. General Duncan McNabb stated that strategic airlift requirements could be met with 205 C-17s, 52 modernized C-5Bs, and 59 C-5As. Secretary Gates recommended terminating the VH-71 helicopter due to troubled acquisition history and cost overruns, citing long timelines for delivery of fully capable helicopters. He also decided against purchasing the first lot of less capable \"Increment 1\" aircraft, stating they would only last five to ten years. Congress has expressed concern over cost increases, schedule delays, and foreign. Congress has cut $300 million from the Navy's R&D accounts for the VH-71 helicopter program. Secretary Gates recommended terminating the Air Force CSAR-X helicopter program and reviewing its requirements. The debate over the need for specialized aircraft for search and rescue missions has been ongoing, with concerns raised by former Pentagon Acquisition Chief John Young in 2008. In November 2008, Chief John Young questioned the necessity of the CSAR-X requirement, citing DOD's existing assets for rescue missions. The Air Force argued for a dedicated CSAR aircraft due to critical shortfalls in combat operations. Secretary Gates suggested making CSAR a joint capability to change the acquisition process. Secretary Gates recommended restructuring the ballistic missile defense program to focus on rogue-state and theater ballistic missile threats, aligning with his broader strategic thinking on foreign threats. He aims to adjust DOD investments to improve existing long-range BMD capabilities in a resource-constrained era. To enhance the U.S. long-range BMD system, Secretary Gates proposed adding $700 million for more SM-3 and THAAD interceptors and $200 million to convert six Aegis ships for BMD capabilities. This funding would support maximum production capacity as the SM-3 and THAAD move into full-rate production. Secretary Gates recommended not increasing the current number of long-range ground-based interceptors deployed in Alaska and California. Currently, there are slightly more than two dozen of these interceptors in place to defend against missile attacks from North Korea or Iran. He emphasized the importance of funding research and development to enhance the capability to defend against long-range missile threats. Gen. James Cartwright stated that there are sufficient funds to proceed with plans for a third missile defense site in Europe. Secretary Gates recommended cancelling the Multiple Kill Vehicle (MKV) program due to technical challenges and the need to reassess system requirements. President Obama later cancelled plans for a long-range missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic, opting for a network of mobile radars and interceptor missiles, including the SM-3, to defend Europe against Iranian short and medium-range missiles. U.S. intelligence agencies noted Iran's slower progress in developing long-range ballistic missiles compared to forecasts. Secretary Gates recommended program changes for boost-phase defense, including cancelling the second ABL prototype due to affordability and technology issues. Gen. Cartwright mentioned potential changes in the BMD acquisition process. In response to Secretary Gates's recommendations, senators expressed approval of increases to THAAD and SM-3 but voiced concern about proposed cuts to missile defense funding, stating it could undermine US missile defense capabilities. Secretary Gates aimed to persuade them by showing proposed changes to THAAD and SM-3, sustained work on long-range systems, and continued funding for boost-phase interception. On April 6, 2009, Secretary Gates announced a significant restructuring of the Army's Future Combat Systems (FCS) program, accelerating the deployment of technologies to brigade combat teams (BCTs) while canceling the manned ground vehicle (MGV) component. This decision was made due to concerns about unanswered questions in the FCS vehicle design strategy. Secretary Gates criticized the FCS program for not reflecting lessons from Iraq and Afghanistan, particularly for not including MRAP vehicles. The Army was instructed to restart the program, as it had focused solely on FCS for over a decade without considering alternatives. The FCS program did not consider lessons learned from Iraq and Afghanistan in its design, particularly in relation to the role of MRAPs. There may be challenges in determining a permanent role for MRAPs, which are transport vehicles providing excellent protection but not fighting vehicles like the Abrams, Bradleys, Strykers, or proposed FCS MGVs. Developmental timelines may be impacted if new non-MGV-based variants are developed to replace existing vehicles. Secretary Gates maintained the plan to continue developing the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle for the Marine Corps, pending the results of the QDR. Congress has been skeptical of the FCS program due to its ambitious scope, high cost, and reliance on unproven technologies. There may be resistance to a comprehensive \"systems of systems\" approach for Army vehicle modernization, but commonality between platforms could be seen positively. The FCS program's reliance on defense industry LSIs has faced congressional scrutiny. Congress supports focusing on spinning out sensor and unmanned systems to Infantry Brigade Combat Teams. Concerns include developing the FCS Network and ensuring its functionality and security. Secretary Gates did not mention restructuring the FCS program. The decision to not fund the development of FCS MGVs could be a contentious issue in Congress, especially regarding the NLOS-C program. Other potential issues include the possible resumption of the M-1 Abrams and M-2 Bradley lines if successors are not identified during the Army's vehicle modernization program re-evaluation. Congress may play a significant role in the Army's vehicle modernization program, shaping capabilities and ensuring new ground combat systems align with acquisition reform measures. The budget resolution sets ceilings on national defense spending but does not bind Appropriations or authorizing committees. The budget resolution sets ceilings on national defense spending, indicating support for the President's defense budget proposal. The House version set the FY2010 budget authority ceiling for the \"national defense\" function at $562.0 billion with an additional $130.0 billion for war costs. The Senate version set the budget authority ceiling at $691.7 billion without a separate ceiling for overseas deployments. The House and Senate Budget committees recommended ceilings to accommodate President Obama's FY2010 DOD budget request. The final budget resolution set separate ceilings for national defense base budget and overseas deployments. The resolution was adopted by the House and Senate, and the defense authorization bill was signed into law on October 28. The FY2010 defense authorization bill, signed into law on October 28 (P.L. 111-84), authorizes $680.2 billion for military activities, including $550.2 billion for the base budget and $130.0 billion for overseas operations. The House version of the bill, H.R. 2647, passed with few changes, authorizing $550.5 billion for the base budget and defense-related programs. The House bill authorized $680.5 billion for defense, including $551.1 billion for the base budget and related Energy Department programs, and $129.3 billion for war costs. The Senate bill authorized $680.3 billion, with $551.1 billion for the base budget and $129.3 billion for war costs, requiring a $500 million cut from the total DOD authorization. The House and Senate passed the defense authorization bill, reducing the total authorization to $679.8 billion. Both versions supported the Obama Administration's plan to shift focus on anti-missile defense efforts. The bill included increased procurement of Aegis and THAAD interceptors for near-term missile threats. The $9.3 billion missile defense program was extensively debated during House action on H.R. 2647. Republican-sponsored amendments to increase funding for missile defense programs were rejected. The Senate bill also supported the Administration's missile defense decisions, capping the number of Ground-based Interceptors at 30. Secretary Gates and military commanders believe 30 GBIs are sufficient for the current and future threats from Iran and North Korea. The conference report on the missile defense program includes authorization for $20 million to sustain the vendor base for GBI components and purchase of seven additional GBIs. It also requires the Secretary of Defense to maintain GBI production until a detailed review is completed on the system's sustainability over 20 years. The conference report on the missile defense program authorizes funding to sustain the vendor base for GBI components and purchase seven additional GBIs. It supports canceling the MKV and KEI programs, as well as construction of a second ABL prototype aircraft. Some argue that canceling KEI and using ABL for research only may leave the country without an active program to destroy attacking ballistic missiles. Secretary Gates is reviewing the need for a boost-phase BMD program as part of the current BMD Review and QDR. The current BMD Review and Quadrennial Defense Review are ongoing. The Administration plans to pursue an Ascent Phase BMD program to destroy missiles in the boost-phase. Details are limited, and a report to Congress is required. The FY2010 defense budget review includes the Bush Administration's plan for missile defense in Europe. Secretary Gates is considering the need for a boost-phase BMD program. The FY2010 budget includes funds for the \"third site\" missile defense project in Europe, pending ratification by Polish and Czech parliaments. The proposed site is one of several options to address potential missile attacks from Iran. Both House and Senate bills authorize $353.1 million for missile defense development in Europe. President Obama cancelled the plan for a long-range missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic in 2009. Instead, the DOD will rely on a network of mobile radars and interceptor missiles to defend Europe against Iranian missiles. The President stated that Iran's development of long-range ballistic missiles was slower than expected, but they were progressing quickly in developing missiles that could reach Europe. $309.0 million was authorized for the European defense system proposed by the President in September. The conference report for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 on the European defense system proposed by the President in September includes an independent assessment of the new plan's cost and effectiveness. It rescinds $151.2 million authorized in FY2009 for construction in Poland and Czech Republic associated with the old plan. Congress must authorize construction projects for the new European missile defense plan in the year the work is expected to begin. Additionally, $23.2 million is added to the procurement of SM-3 missiles, and the Navy is required to report on the number of additional Aegis warships needed for the new European defense plan. The Senate version of the authorization bill for major shipbuilding programs, debated as S. 1390, included a provision requiring the Navy to prepare a detailed acquisition strategy for purchasing surface combatants. The bill also aimed to repeal a provision from the FY2008 national defense authorization act regarding nuclear-powered cruisers, destroyers, and large amphibious landing ships. Both House and Senate versions supported the Administration's budget proposal for Aegis warships needed for the new European defense plan. The conference report did not include a provision for purchasing surface combatants. Both House and Senate versions of the bill agreed to buy only three DDG-1000-class destroyers and resume procurement of DDG-51 class destroyers. The House bill would have added $100 million for DDG-51 components, but this was dropped from the final report. Both versions authorized funding for completing the third DDG-1000, continuing development of that class, and procuring one DDG-51. The conference report discusses the development of the CG(X) class of cruisers to replace existing Aegis cruisers. It retains a Senate provision to limit Navy spending until a surface combatant acquisition plan is produced. An additional $15 million is allocated for the radar development of the CG(X) ship. The report also temporarily waives a law requiring 11 carriers in service, allowing the number to drop to 10 between 2013 and 2015. The House Armed Services Committee questioned Secretary Gates's recommendation to slow the rate of future carrier construction, reducing the carrier force from 11 ships to 10 after 2040. A provision was added to H.R. 2647 requiring the Navy to submit a report on the effects of funding a new carrier at a slower rate. The House provision also prevents the Navy from spending funds in a way that would disrupt the planned construction of the next two carriers. The House bill questioned Secretary Gates's recommendation to slow carrier construction, with a provision added to H.R. 2647 requiring a report on the effects of funding at a slower rate. The bill authorized construction of three additional Littoral Combat Ships and included a provision to adjust the cost-cap for inflation. Additionally, the House committee added a provision authorizing the Navy to compile a technical data package for bidding contracts to other contractors. The Navy announced a restructuring of the LCS program, choosing between two designs in FY2010 and contracting for two ships as part of a \"block buy\" of up to 10 ships funded through FY2014. The cost cap was raised to $1.38 billion for the two ships in FY2010. The House and Senate versions of the bill concurred with Secretary Gates's recommendations to terminate development of certain helicopters and cargo jets, but did not authorize funds for additional F-22 fighters in FY2009. The House Armed Services Committee added to the Administration's request by a narrow vote. The House Armed Services Committee voted to add $368 million for 12 additional F-22 fighters to the Administration's request. The Senate Armed Services Committee approved $1.75 billion for seven more F-22s in FY2010, but the Senate later reversed this decision by reallocating the funds. The Senate reallocated $1.75 billion from the F-22 program to cover costs and avoid a veto from President Obama. The conference report retained a provision for preserving tooling for potential future F-22 production. Additionally, the bill authorized funds for developing an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The Senate reallocated funds from the F-22 program to avoid a veto from President Obama and authorized funds for developing an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The bill included an increase in funding for the alternate engine project, offset by cuts in F-35s requested and management reserve funds. The Senate later eliminated authorization to continue work on the alternate engine project due to a veto threat from the Administration. The House bill aimed to delay the retirement of 249 older combat jets, shift funds to continue operating them, and require a report on how the Air Force will fill the gaps left by their retirement. The conference report retained the report requirement but shortened the retirement delay to 30 days and did not fund continued operation of the planes in the interim. The House bill aimed to delay the retirement of older combat jets, shift funds to continue operating them, and require a report on alternative plans to prevent a shortfall in Air Force fighters. The conference report retained the report requirement with modifications and included provisions to pressure DOD to sign a multi-year contract for additional F/A-18E/F fighters. The House bill aimed to delay the retirement of older combat jets and increase funding for long lead-time components for new F/A-18E/F planes. It also called for a comparison of purchasing new planes versus refurbishing older ones and recommended the Navy to field 10 carrier air wings with at least 44 strike fighters each. The Senate committee argued for buying 18 new F/A-18E/F planes in FY2010. The Navy should buy 18 F/A-18E/F model planes in FY2010, as planned, instead of reducing the production to 9 as proposed in the Administration's budget. S. 1390 authorizes $1.57 billion for the planes, an increase of $560 million. The House and Senate committees endorsed terminating development of new ground combat vehicles in the Army's Future Combat Systems program. The House and Senate committees endorsed terminating development of new ground combat vehicles in the Army's Future Combat Systems program. The conference report authorized $215.8 million to terminate the ground combat vehicles projects, while also approving $2.12 billion to continue developing other components of FCS, including active protection systems. The conference report requires the Army to create new programs for a self-propelled cannon and ground combat vehicles. It also mandates DOD to contract with a non-governmental organization to assess research for new vehicle technologies. The House Armed Services Committee recommended upgrades for existing M-1 tanks, Paladin cannons, and Stryker armored vehicles. The committee recommends upgrades for armored combat vehicles, including the active defense system for anti-tank missiles. They suggest replacing Bradleys and M-113s with new vehicles and prioritize upgrading the Paladin howitzer. Funding is authorized for the development of the Marine Corps' Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) for amphibious troop transport. The House Armed Services Committee wants modifications to improve protection against improvised explosive devices (IEDs). The committee directed the Secretary of the Navy to provide a report on EFV survivability options and authorized an increase in end-strength for active-duty members of the armed forces. This includes limits for the Army and Marine Corps, with a total increase of 92,000 personnel over their FY2007 levels. The conference report also authorizes the Army to increase its end-strength. The conference report authorizes the Army to increase its end-strength by 30,000 active-duty personnel through FY2012 and includes a 3.4% increase in basic pay for military personnel. The House bill freezes the implementation of the NSPS and DCIPS pay-for-performance systems, while the Senate version would eliminate NSPS. The Senate version of the bill would have eliminated NSPS unless the Secretary of Defense certified its termination was not in DOD's best interest. The conference report terminated NSPS, requiring employees to transition back to their previous system by January 1, 2012. The House bill aimed to terminate all ongoing \"A-76\" competitions, while the Senate bill focused on competitions exceeding time limits. The conference report imposed a moratorium on new A-76 competitions until DOD meets legal requirements. The conferees stated that new competitions would be barred through October 15, 2010, due to existing legal requirements. The House bill aimed to expand benefits for disabled military retirees, offsetting the cost with budget adjustments. The House passed bill H.R. 2990 to fund the President's concurrent receipt proposal through FY2010. The bill was incorporated into the defense authorization bill by H.Res. 572. The Senate version and conference report did not address the concurrent receipt issue. The final version of H.R. 2647 includes provisions on military commissions. The conference report on H.R. 2647 includes provisions on military commissions, specifying that membership in al Qaeda at the time of an offense would be sufficient for jurisdiction. Confessions obtained through cruel treatment are inadmissible, and other statements of the accused must be found reliable and voluntary by the military judge. The conference report on H.R. 2647 includes provisions on military commissions, specifying that membership in al Qaeda at the time of an offense would be sufficient for jurisdiction. Confessions obtained through cruel treatment are inadmissible, and other statements of the accused must be found reliable and voluntary by the military judge. The requirement for voluntary statements would be waived in combat circumstances. The burden of proving reliability for hearsay evidence lies with the party offering it, rather than the opponent. Prosecutors must disclose exculpatory and mitigating evidence, extending to all information known or reasonably should be known by government officials involved in the case. Additional counsel is provided for those facing capital crimes, with a recommendation for fully resourced defense, especially in capital cases. The conference report on H.R. 2647 includes provisions on military commissions, specifying jurisdiction for membership in al Qaeda at the time of an offense. Confessions obtained through cruel treatment are inadmissible, and statements of the accused must be found reliable and voluntary by the military judge. The burden of proving reliability for hearsay evidence lies with the party offering it. Prosecutors must disclose exculpatory and mitigating evidence. The conference report also addresses the use of classified information and prohibits the use of contract employees for interrogations, with a waiver option for the Secretary of Defense. The conference report on H.R. 2647 includes provisions on military commissions, specifying jurisdiction for membership in al Qaeda at the time of an offense. The report also prohibits the release of non-U.S. citizen detainees held at Guantanamo Bay in the United States or its territories until a plan for their disposition is submitted to Congress. The House version of the bill had a similar prohibition but did not have a set expiration date. The conference report on H.R. 2647 includes provisions on military commissions, prohibiting the release of non-U.S. citizen detainees held at Guantanamo Bay in the United States or its territories until a plan for their disposition is submitted to Congress. It also incorporates provisions from the House-passed bill regarding the treatment of detainees, such as prohibiting the reading of Miranda rights to foreign belligerents captured outside the U.S. and requiring the videotaping of strategic intelligence interrogations. The conference report on H.R. 2647 includes provisions on military commissions, prohibiting the release of non-U.S. citizen detainees held at Guantanamo Bay in the United States or its territories until a plan for their disposition is submitted to Congress. It also requires notification of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) when a detainee comes into U.S. custody at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. The ICRC would have access to detainees as soon as practicable after submitting a request. The report also includes provisions on hate crimes, mirroring the Senate-passed bill and H.R. 1913. Hate crimes are traditional crimes where the offender is motivated by biases against race, color, religion, national origin, and sometimes disability. Federal jurisdiction over hate crimes is limited to certain civil rights offenses. An amendment was adopted during Senate debate to broaden federal jurisdiction over hate crimes by authorizing the Attorney General to provide assistance when requested by a state. The Senate adopted an amendment to broaden federal jurisdiction over hate crimes, allowing the Attorney General to provide assistance for crimes motivated by bias against race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. An additional amendment was passed to ensure that the exercise of free speech and association rights is not violated in implementing the hate crimes amendment. The Senate rejected an alternative amendment on hate crimes penalties, dropped the death penalty provision, and added provisions defining \"state,\" establishing a statute of limitations, and requiring reports on hate crimes investigations. The bill includes provisions on hate crimes penalties, statute of limitations, and mandatory minimum sentencing. It also addresses the conveyance of surplus military property to local authorities with certain restrictions on redevelopment. The bill appoints the Deputy Secretary of Defense as leader of the interagency Guam Executive Council and designates certain entities as \"special purpose entities\" for military housing and utilities on Guam. It requires the use of DOD's unified facilities criteria for construction projects funded by contributions. The bill mandates the use of UFC as the construction standard for projects funded by Japan. It also prioritizes US construction workers over foreign laborers for relocation projects. An Interagency Coordination Group for Guam Realignment, led by the DOD Inspector General, will report on realignment activities to Congress annually. The Senate rejected an amendment on concealed firearms permits. The Senate debated an amendment on concealed firearms permits, which required 60 \"yeas\" but only received 58 votes. They also adopted an amendment expressing the Senate's stance on the START agreement, calling for no limitations on missile defense and a report on nuclear weapons modernization. The Senate rejected an amendment on START follow-on agreement funding and discussed North Korea's state sponsor of terrorism designation. House and Senate negotiators reached a compromise on the FY2010 defense appropriations bill, which was passed by the House and Senate and signed by the President. The bill supports the Obama Administration's proposals to terminate certain weapons programs while funding others, such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and C-17 cargo plane. No additional funding requirements were included in the enacted version of the bill. The enacted version of H.R. 2236 includes funds for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, but does not reflect additional funding for the increase in U.S. troops in Afghanistan announced by President Obama. It also includes provisions for extending non-DOD federal programs and activities temporarily. The FY2010 defense appropriations bill passed by the House includes funds for the development of an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and production of the C-17 cargo plane. The House-passed bill included funding for an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, production of the C-17 cargo plane, and the VH-71 executive helicopter program. The bill also added funds for additional fighter jets, combat ships, and transport ships, as well as continuing production of the F-22 fighter despite the Obama Administration's decision to terminate it. The House passed a bill that included funding for various defense programs, including an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, production of the C-17 cargo plane, and the VH-71 executive helicopter program. Despite the Obama Administration's decision to terminate it, the bill also allocated funds for additional fighter jets, combat ships, and transport ships, as well as continuing production of the F-22 fighter. President Obama had stated he would veto any defense bill providing funding for the F-22, leading to the House adopting an amendment to remove additional F-22 procurement funds. The House committee directed the Secretary of Defense to provide cost and schedule data to the Government Accountability Office for their annual assessment of major weapons programs. The House-passed version of H.R. 3326 concurred with most of the Obama Administration's proposals to terminate or reduce funding for weapons programs, including the VH-71 White House helicopter and F-22 fighter. The Senate version added funds for 18 F/A-18E/F Navy fighters and sustained the production line for these aircraft. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 3326 generally supported the Administration's decisions to slow or terminate some advanced anti-missile systems while increasing procurement of Navy's Aegis and Army's THAAD systems. The bill also added funds for 10 C-17s and $77.6 million for Aegis. The enacted version of the bill adds $77.6 million for Aegis, including funds for SM-3 interceptor missiles and development of improved variants. The bill did not include $41 million for the radar component of the land-based THAAD system, which the Administration opposed. Additionally, $80 million was added to adapt technologies from the Kinetic Energy Interceptor program. Defense Secretary Gates had recommended these changes. The House rejected an amendment to cancel the Kinetic Energy Interceptor program, despite Defense Secretary Gates recommending its cancellation. The Administration objected to rescinding funds for a European missile defense site and the Space Tracking and Surveillance System in the House bill. The bill included $77.6 million for Aegis and $80 million to adapt technologies from the KEI program, as recommended by Secretary Gates. President Obama cancelled the plan for a missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic, replacing it with a network of mobile radars and interceptor missiles to defend Europe against Iranian missiles. The decision was based on U.S. intelligence agencies concluding that Iran's development of long-range ballistic missiles was taking longer than previously assumed. The Administration cancelled the plan to deploy a two-stage version of the GBI in Europe but planned to continue developing the weapon. The Senate Appropriations Committee added $50 million to sustain production capacity for the weapons. Senator Lieberman's amendment required DOD to spend at least $50 million on the two-stage GBI development. The Missile Defense Agency is encouraged to spend $50 million in FY2010 funds on the two-stage GBI program, with a plan to modernize the ground-based system in Alaska and California. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to report on using a certain ship hull form for future ship classes. Both House and Senate versions of the bill approved funding for a third destroyer of the DDG-1000-class. The Navy requested $1.07 billion for the last DDG-1000-class destroyer. The compromise bill allocated $1.38 billion for the ship, including $320.6 million for associated costs. The Senate bill also included funding for a second DDG-51 destroyer and long lead-time components for two DDG-51s in FY2011. The House bill cut $40 million from the development of a new ship class. The House bill cut $104 million from the development of a new class of cruisers, designated CG(X), intended to replace existing Ticonderoga-class cruisers. The Senate bill cut $64 million, providing a total of $46 million for the program. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees agreed that the three Littoral Combat Ships in the FY2010 budget request were not fully funded. The House bill would have added $240 million to fully fund the three ships and an additional $540 million for a fourth LCS, while the Senate committee cut $300 million and directed the Navy to buy only two ships. The Navy announced a restructuring of the LCS program, choosing between two designs in FY2010 and procuring two LCS ships. The enacted H.R. 3326 bill provided $1.1 billion for procurement and $424.5 million for R&D. The R&D funding includes $60 million for developing a technical data package for future contracts. The bill did not include funding for a third Joint High Speed Vessel. The House bill included funding for a third Joint High Speed Vessel, in addition to those requested in the Navy and Army budgets. The bill also incorporated $170 million for long lead-time components for a helicopter carrier. The compromise version of the bill provided funding for two T-AKE class supply ships, while the House bill proposed cutting one ship. Additionally, the bill included proposals to terminate certain major aircraft programs. The House bill included funding for additional military projects, such as C-17 cargo jets and development of alternate engines for fighter jets. There was a debate over funding for F-22 fighters, with President Obama threatening to veto any bill that included funds for their production. The House ultimately rejected a motion to restore F-22 procurement funds. The House bill included provisions to block foreign sales of F-22s and allocated funds for an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The Senate version did not provide funds for F-22 production but allowed for research on an export version of the plane. The House bill allocated funds for an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, but the Senate version did not. The compromise version added $465 million to continue the program without making any offsetting reductions to the funding request for the Joint Strike Fighter. The Administration strongly objected to any action that would delay the F-35 program and threatened to veto the defense bill if it included funding for the alternate engine. The House and Senate versions of the bill added funds for nine additional F/A-18E/F Navy fighters to address a shortfall in carrier-based fighters. The House version proposed $495 million for the planes and $108 million for long lead-time components, while the Senate bill allocated $512.3 million for the additional planes. The final bill included $495 million for the extra planes but no additional funds for long lead-time components. The compromise version of the bill provides $1.61 billion for 22 radar-jammer versions of the F/A-18E/F to address a shortfall in carrier-based fighters. Plans to extend the life of current planes are problematic, and production of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters has been delayed. The Navy and Air Force are considering acquiring \"light attack\" planes as a cost-effective alternative to front-line fighters. The Senate Committee directed the services to treat the project as a \"new start\" acquisition program for 10 C-17 cargo planes, adding $2.5 billion to the budget request. Senator McCain's amendment to eliminate funding for the planes was defeated during Senate consideration of the bill. The Senate rejected Senator McCain's amendment to reallocate $2.5 billion from aircraft procurement to operations and maintenance accounts in H.R. 3326 due to budget rule violations. Another amendment to drop $1.5 billion from the bill was also rejected. The Senate rejected Senator McCain's amendment to reallocate $2.5 billion from aircraft procurement to operations and maintenance accounts in H.R. 3326 due to budget rule violations. Another amendment to drop $1.5 billion from the bill for C-17s was also rejected, despite objections from the Administration. President Obama had previously issued a veto threat over funding for additional F-22s, but did not explicitly threaten a veto for the C-17 funding. The Senate version of the bill also proposed cutting $30 million from the budget for a new aerial refueling tanker project. The GAO nullified the decision to award the tanker program to Northrop Grumman and EADS, upholding Boeing's protest. The bill would provide $291.7 million for the tanker program and $294.8 million for five long-range executive transport planes. The compromise version of the bill would allocate $294.8 million for one C-37 and four C-40s. The budget request included $85.2 million to wind down the development of presidential helicopters VH-71s. The House bill proposed adding $400 million to continue testing and outfitting five VH-71s already built. The compromise bill would cut $55 million from the request and add $100 million. The bill would cut $55 million from the request and add $100 million for program technologies. Both House and Senate versions accepted the cancellation of the CSAR-X program. The House bill proposed cutting $80 million from CSAR-X development costs and adding $140 million for new helicopters. The Senate bill did not include funding for CSAR-X but allocated $90 million to buy new HH-60Ms. The bill allocated $90 million to buy two new HH-60Ms and begin development of a replacement for the HH-60M. It tracked the Senate bill's action on CSAR-X and supported restructuring the Army's Future Combat Systems program. The House version would have provided $2.67 billion for FCS, while the Senate bill would have cut $368 million. The compromise version allocated $2.55 billion for FCS, a reduction of $332 million. The House version of the bill would have cut $50 million from the $293 million requested for the Marine Corps's Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) development due to delays and cost increases. The compromise version of the bill, like the Senate bill, would fund the request. Additionally, the Senate adopted an amendment to prevent the retirement of 249 older combat jets. The compromise version of H.R. 3326 retains a provision prohibiting funds for contractors requiring binding arbitration as a condition of employment. The Secretary of the Air Force must submit reports before making proposed changes related to retiring planes assigned to Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard units. The Senate approved a provision, offered by Senator Al Franken, requiring binding arbitration in cases of sexual assault or harassment with a vote of 68-30."
