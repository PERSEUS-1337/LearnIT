If a bank's outstanding loan balance exceeds 50 percent of its capital, it must sell a portion of the loans to reduce the balance. Additionally, eligible cooperative associations can have ownership interests in domestic or foreign parties to support their business operations, with financing available if the ownership interest is less than 50 percent. If an eligible cooperative association's ownership interest in a party is less than 50 percent, financing will be limited to that percentage. A bank for cooperatives cannot provide financial assistance for relocating a plant or facility from the US to another country.
