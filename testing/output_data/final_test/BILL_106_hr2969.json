    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Ecosystem and Indigenous Peoples Protection Act\". It includes findings and expresses the sense of the Congress. The Congress acknowledges the positive impact of environmental assessment procedures adopted by the World Bank Group but highlights ongoing issues with decision-makers' use of environmental information and inconsistencies in policy implementation. Current environmental safeguards in taxpayer-supported international financial institutions, like the World Bank, are inadequate. The Bank often does not provide full environmental assessments for its activities, and when assessments are done, they are not always shared in a timely manner. Internal evaluations show that these assessments have little impact on project decisions, with many projects failing to adhere to environmental policies or meet performance goals. United States taxpayers are affected by these shortcomings under current law. Under current law, US taxpayers are required to fund projects even if opposed by the US Executive Director of the institution. For example, taxpayers will contribute $27.2 million for a project harming Tibetan and Mongolian indigenous peoples, despite US voting against it. World Bank projects have resettled over 543,000 people from 1986-1993, with almost 3 million more to be resettled under the current portfolio. The World Bank's inspection panel found an imbalance in project execution, particularly in resettlement and environmental measures. US funding should be contingent on avoiding adverse environmental impacts. Congress seeks a broader policy framework for environmental and social protection at the World Bank Group. The World Bank Group sets environmental standards for international financial institutions, but fails to comply with them. In 1999, most of the Bank's lending was for programs exempt from these policies. The board and management hinder the inspection panel's ability to investigate policy violations. The inspection panel was established to investigate Bank policy violations in response to calls for more accountability. The United States and other donor governments agreed to improve transparency in the World Bank Group. Congress believes the Bank has not made significant progress in complying with environmental policies and should apply them to all lending. The World Bank's inspection panel should have the authority to cover all institutions in the World Bank Group without interference in its independence. SEC. 1308 of the International Financial Institutions Act amends Title XIII to prevent US funds from supporting World Bank Group operations that do not comply with environmental and social policies. SEC. 1308 of the International Financial Institutions Act prohibits US funds from supporting World Bank Group projects with adverse environmental impacts or violations of environmental policies. The International Financial Institutions Act prohibits US funds from supporting World Bank Group projects with adverse environmental impacts or violations of environmental policies. The Act also requires institutions to verify that all costs of involuntary resettlement are paid by entities other than those resettled, and to implement a pay-for-performance policy for employees involved in projects violating environmental or social policies. The International Financial Institutions Act prohibits US funds from supporting World Bank Group projects with adverse environmental impacts or violations of environmental policies. The Act instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to use US influence to oppose funding for projects with significant adverse environmental impacts or violations of environmental or social policies. The institution's directors vote on project approval without disclosing environmental assessments, technical information, feasibility studies, and other related documentation to the public and the US Executive Director. The text discusses the categorization of projects with environmental and social impacts, opposing financial assistance for projects that violate environmental policies, and enforcement measures by the Secretary of the Treasury against international financial institutions providing assistance against US opposition. The Secretary will reduce payments to institutions receiving financial assistance if they violate environmental policies, based on the total amount of assistance provided for the project compared to all projects during the assistance period. The Secretary of the Treasury, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Administrator of the Agency for International Development will prepare annual reports on compliance with environmental policies by US Executive Directors at World Bank Group institutions and the number of approved projects. The United States Executive Directors at World Bank Group institutions and the Secretary of the Treasury will work to release problem project watch lists and non-compliant projects. Reports on compliance with environmental policies and approved projects will be submitted annually by the Secretary of the Treasury, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Administrator of the Agency for International Development. The Agency for International Development must submit reports to specific Senate and House committees.
