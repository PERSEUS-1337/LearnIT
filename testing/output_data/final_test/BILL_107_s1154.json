    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Justice for United States Prisoners of War Act of 2001\". The Congress finds that during World War II, US prisoners of war in Japan were forced to provide labor for Japanese corporations, violating international law by not paying wages, promoting torture, and withholding food and medical treatment. The Government of Japan admitted liability for illegal conduct towards Allied Powers, including inhumane treatment of prisoners of war. Despite this, the Treaty waived all private claims by US nationals, including prisoners of war. Japan agreed to provide more favorable terms in war claims settlement agreements with non-Treaty countries. Japan extended more favorable terms in war claims settlement agreements with non-Treaty countries, allowing claims by their nationals against Japanese nationals without limitation. Under the Treaty, Japan is obligated to extend the same terms to the United States, including US Armed Forces members held as prisoners of war. The United States owes a debt to servicemembers held as prisoners of war by Japan during World War II for their sacrifices after Japan's aggression at Pearl Harbor, Bataan, and Corregidor. Pursuing justice through lawsuits in the United States is consistent with national interests and should not be preempted by any other law or treaty. Despite requests for disclosure, the US Government has withheld Japanese records related to chemical and biological experiments on US servicemembers held as prisoners of war during World War II. SEC. 3. SUITS AGAINST JAPANESE NATIONALS. In actions against Japanese defendants by US Armed Forces members seeking compensation for mistreatment or unpaid wages during WWII, federal courts apply state statute of limitations, not waiving US claims under the Treaty. This provision expires after 10 years from enactment. SEC. 4. APPLICABILITY OF RIGHTS UNDER ARTICLE 26 OF THE TREATY OF PEACE WITH JAPAN. The US Government aims to ensure that any war claims settlement agreement between Japan and another country with more favorable terms than those in the Treaty will be extended to the US for claims by US nationals who were POWs forced to provide labor under inhumane conditions during WWII. SEC. 5. AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION ON CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL TESTS BY JAPAN DURING WWII. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs can request information from other departments regarding chemical or biological tests conducted by Japan on US POWs during WWII. This information can be shared with individual members of the Armed Forces who were POWs. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines key terms such as \"Japanese defendant\" as a Japanese national or entity under Japanese law, \"State\" as including various regions, and \"Treaty\" as the Treaty of Peace with Japan signed in 1951."
