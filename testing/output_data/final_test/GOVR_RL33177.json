The $30 billion in insured losses led insurers to reconsider offering terrorism coverage due to the uncertainty and potential massive losses involved. Many argued that terrorism risk is essentially uninsurable by the private market. The lack of insurance against terrorism loss was feared to have wider economic impacts, especially on large-scale developments in urban areas. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA) was passed by Congress in response to the disruption in the insurance market after the 9/11 attacks. It created the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program as a temporary measure to provide a government backstop for terrorism losses and allow the private industry to develop the capacity for covering terrorism risk. While terrorism insurance has become more widely available under TRIA, there is still a need for more robust terrorism models for insurers to offer widespread coverage without government support. Some argue that the private market is not capable of offering terrorism insurance without government support, while others believe that the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) is hindering the growth of the private market. Congress responded to the expiration of TRIA with two bills, one from the Senate and one from the House. The House bill H.R. 4314 was incorporated into S.467, which was passed on December 7, 2005 as the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act. Senator Dodd introduced S.467 to extend TRIA until 2007 with changes to coverage and deductibles. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act, passed on December 7, 2005, aimed to increase the insurance industry's aggregate loss retention amount from $15 billion in 2005 to $20 billion by 2007. The Department of the Treasury reported that TRIA had stabilized the insurance market, but the Administration required significant changes to reduce taxpayer exposure for an extension. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs approved S. 467 with amendments to extend the program for two years and increase the private sector's exposure to terrorism risk. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act, passed on December 7, 2005, aimed to increase the insurance industry's aggregate loss retention amount. S. 467 continued to increase deductibles and aggregate retention, while also reducing the types of insurance covered by the program and raising the size of a terrorist event necessary to trigger the program. It was passed by unanimous consent in the Senate on November 18, 2005. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act, passed on December 7, 2005, increased deductibles and aggregate retention for the insurance industry. H.R. 4314, introduced by Representative Baker, was amended by the House with text from H.R. 4314 before passing. Amendments by Chairman Oxley, Representatives Frank, and Wasserman Schultz were adopted, making changes to insurance deductibles, program trigger amounts, and requirements for exempt commercial purchasers. The amended bill H.R. 4314 expanded coverage to include domestic terrorist events and group life insurance, while removing commercial auto insurance. It also increased the event trigger to $50 million in 2006 and added $50 million for each subsequent year. The amended bill H.R. 4314 expanded coverage to include domestic terrorist events and group life insurance, while changing insurer deductibles and federal share of insured losses based on event size. It also introduced TRIA Capital Reserve Funds for insurers to set aside reserves for terrorist events.

The House passed the amended version of S. 467 on December 7, 2005, and appointed conferees to resolve differences with the Senate. The Executive Office of the President supported S. 467 but opposed adding lines of coverage, including group life insurance. The Senate did not appoint conferees and instead took up the issue. The Senate did not appoint conferees on December 7, 2005, but passed an amendment to S. 467 on December 16, 2005. The House then passed this version on December 17, 2005, and it was signed into law on December 22, 2005, as Public Law 109-144. The main change was an increase in the retention amount to $25 billion and $27.5 billion for 2006 and 2007. The House-passed S. 467, which was signed into law as Public Law 109-144, replaces a previous law (P.L. 107-297) with a similar structure. The section numbers cited in the comparison are those of the bill and law."
