    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Federal Student Loan Refinancing Act\" and it includes provisions for student loan consolidation. Section 459B of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to include temporary loan consolidation authority for certain loans made after July 1, 2006. Borrowers with specific types of loans can consolidate them into a Federal Direct Consolidation Loan during a specified period. The categories of loans eligible for consolidation include loans made after July 1, 2006, under specific conditions. Borrowers with qualifying loans can consolidate them into a Federal Direct Consolidation Loan within a defined timeframe. The Secretary must consolidate eligible loans within 90 days of the Federal Student Loan Refinancing Act's enactment. Borrowers will be notified in writing before consolidation, informing them of the lower interest rate. The Secretary must consolidate eligible loans within 90 days of the Federal Student Loan Refinancing Act's enactment, with repayment plans remaining unchanged. Borrowers with multiple loans will have the consolidation process initiated within 90 days. The Federal Student Loan Refinancing Act requires borrowers to submit a loan consolidation application, be notified of fees and interest rates, and endorse the application to consolidate their loans. The borrower must endorse and submit the loan consolidation application to the Secretary within 6 months. The interest rate for a Federal Direct Consolidation Loan is 4 percent, or lower if the weighted average of the borrower's outstanding loan interest rates is below 4 percent. The interest rate for a consolidated loan is less than 4 percent, calculated as the weighted average of the borrower's outstanding loan rates or a fixed rate of 4 percent minus 0.4 percent of the consolidation loan balance. An origination fee of 0.4 percent applies to certain consolidated loans. The origination fee for a consolidation loan is 0.4 percent of the principal balance, added to cover loan costs. If loans being consolidated include a specific type, the interest rate on the Federal Direct Consolidation Loan is reduced by 0.25 percent. Borrower benefits are not affected by consolidation. Consolidation under this section offers benefits such as deferment, forbearance, accumulation of monthly payments for loan forgiveness, and participation in repayment plans. Exemptions from other laws include exemption from the Paperwork Reduction Act and inapplicability of certain rulemaking requirements under the Higher Education Act of 1965 and title 5, United States Code."
