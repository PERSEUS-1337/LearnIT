    "content": "The Medication Error Prevention Act of 2002, also known as the Medication Error Prevention Act, establishes a voluntary reporting program for medication errors and the development of recommendations to prevent such errors. The Medication Error Prevention Act of 2002 establishes a reporting program for medication errors. If approved by the Secretary, reported information is privileged in judicial and administrative proceedings. The criteria for the reporting program include being operated by The United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Incorporated. The Medication Error Prevention Act of 2002 establishes a reporting program where health care providers voluntarily submit medication error information for developing recommendations to prevent errors. The program operates under agreements with providers to govern the use of the submitted information. The reporting program reserves the right to disclose medication error information to third parties for research, education, standards setting, and public health purposes. Federal officers and employees are prohibited from disclosing medication error information. The agency is restricted from disclosing medication error information received from a reporting program, except as authorized by agreement. This privilege applies in civil and administrative proceedings for healthcare providers, protecting information submitted to the program. The privilege protects medication error information in patient records and information developed separately by providers. It also applies to information received by reporting programs and other entities through agreements. The submission of medication error information to reporting programs by health care providers does not waive any privilege that may exist with respect to the information. Definitions include individuals and organizations providing health services such as physicians, nurses, pharmacists, hospitals, clinics, and other entities. The term 'medication error' refers to preventable events that may cause inappropriate medication use or patient harm. This includes errors in professional practice, product labeling, dispensing, administration, and monitoring. 'Medication error information' is data related to medication errors developed by healthcare providers. A 'reporting program' is an approved program for reporting medication errors."
