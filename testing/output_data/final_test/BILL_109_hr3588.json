    "content": "The Act titled \"Medicare Home Health Telehealth Access Act of 2005\" allows access to telehealth services in the home. The Medicare Home Health Telehealth Access Act of 2005 amends Section 1895(e) of the Social Security Act to include telehealth services provided by home health agencies for individuals receiving home health services. Telehealth services must be ordered as part of a certified plan of care by a physician and not substitute for in-person home health services. The Medicare Home Health Telehealth Access Act of 2005 allows telehealth services provided by home health agencies for individuals receiving home health services. Telehealth services must be ordered as part of a certified plan of care by a physician and meet criteria established by the Secretary for eligibility and payment. The Secretary establishes standards and qualifications for telehealth services for home health purposes. Different modes of telehealth are considered based on service time and telecommunications functions. A telecommunication that is only a phone call or consultation between practitioners is not considered a visit. Telehealth service is defined for this section. The Secretary establishes standards and qualifications for telehealth services for home health purposes, including technology-based professional consultations, patient monitoring, training services, clinical observation, assessment, and treatment. The Secretary will update HCPCS codes for telehealth services annually, and payment and coverage conditions are not waived. The Secretary sets standards for telehealth services in home health, including consultations, monitoring, training, and treatment. Costs of telehealth services must be reported on cost reports by home health agencies. Effective October 1, 2006, criteria and standards for telehealth services must be implemented by July 1, 2006. Starting October 1, 2006, home health visits for Medicare eligibility and payment will now include telehealth services, with multiple telecommunication encounters in a 24-hour period counting as one in-person visit. SEC. 3. REMOTE MONITORING PILOT PROJECTS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to conduct pilot projects in various locations to incentivize home health agencies to use monitoring technologies to improve health outcomes and reduce program expenditures. Individuals eligible for the pilot projects will be identified based on specified criteria. The pilot projects incentivize home health agencies to use monitoring technologies to improve health outcomes and reduce program expenditures. Participation is not limited to individuals receiving home health services under Medicare. Home health agencies participating in the pilot projects will receive incentive payments based on the reduction in program expenditures realized. The Secretary will calculate reductions in program expenditures for individuals in the pilot project compared to those not in the project. Incentive payments will be limited to ensure overall program expenditures under title XVIII of the Social Security Act are controlled. The Secretary will implement pilot projects within nine months of the Act's enactment. Home health agencies may receive payments for services provided to eligible individuals under title XVIII of the Social Security Act. If pilot projects result in decreased federal expenditures, they may be expanded. The Secretary may initiate or extend comparable projects in additional areas to maintain or enhance health outcomes for participating beneficiaries under title XVIII of the Social Security Act."
