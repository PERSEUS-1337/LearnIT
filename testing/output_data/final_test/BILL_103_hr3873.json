The Urban Watershed Restoration Act of 1994 outlines key findings by Congress regarding the disproportionate impact of water quality degradation on urban communities. It emphasizes the need to empower residents to revitalize urban water bodies, create jobs for youths, and utilize effective biological techniques for restoration. The Urban Watershed Restoration Act of 1994 highlights the importance of watershed management programs to address loss of species diversity, invasion of exotic species, lack of public access to waterways, and the benefits of citizen monitoring in protecting urban waterways. The Urban Watershed Restoration Act of 1994 emphasizes the significance of watershed management programs in addressing various issues related to urban waterways. The Urban Watershed Restoration Act of 1994 aims to enable local organizations to undertake urban watershed restoration programs with assistance from Federal, State, and private entities. It also focuses on restoring urban waterbodies to benefit their communities and achieve the goals of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act in degraded urban areas by maintaining water quality and biodiversity. The Urban Watershed Restoration Act of 1994 aims to support the restoration of urban waterbodies and promote activities such as fishing, swimming, and drinking water supply. It also aims to provide funding for small local businesses and nonprofit organizations focused on urban watershed restoration, promote careers in this field for youths, create project opportunities for conservation corps, and encourage coordination in urban watershed efforts. The Urban Watershed Restoration Act of 1994 aims to promote coordination of urban watershed restoration projects, increase public access to urban waterways, and create new wetland and riparian environments for stormwater management and biodiversity. The Urban Watershed Restoration Act of 1994 aims to establish a program for urban watershed restoration projects. The Urban Watershed Restoration Act of 1994 establishes a National Urban Watershed Restoration Program under Section 319 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. The Program is administered by states with successful urban river restoration programs or by the Regional Administration if a state lacks such a program. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency assists states in combining funding from the Program and other related programs to reduce inefficiencies. At least 25 percent of funds are allocated for carrying out the Program, including project grants and technical assistance selected by the Administrator or the State. The Federal share of project costs under the Program shall not exceed 60 percent and must be matched by non-Federal sources. The maximum amount for individual projects is $500,000, and simplified contracting procedures will be developed by the Administrator. The Administrator will develop simplified contracting procedures for grants under the Program and may waive Federal contracting requirements for grants under $100,000. Projects must meet specific requirements and be jointly nominated by a governmental entity and a private citizen's organization in the urban watershed area. The sponsors must submit a proposal for the project, ensuring consistency with regional restoration priorities and relevant water quality plans. The project sponsor must ensure that the project aligns with stormwater discharge and sewer overflow permits, as well as the goals of the Program and relevant plans. Priority is given to projects that meet these criteria under the Program. The Program prioritizes projects that assist communities in meeting stormwater discharge and sewer overflow permit requirements, implementing national estuary plans, and developing stream protection measures. Factors considered include alignment with program goals and relevant plans. Priority is given to projects in low-income urban areas that address water pollution, stormwater drainage, habitat loss, erosion control, or landscape degradation. Projects supporting ecologically-oriented businesses are also favored. The project will employ and train State and local conservation or service corps in watershed restoration and monitoring, employ youth, support diverse community coalitions in low-income urban areas, and restore urban waterways providing benefits to urban fisheries. The project will prioritize ecological restoration methods, train urban fishers and aquatic resource users affected by habitat degradation, involve local schools and organizations in water quality programs, and assist municipal sponsors in compliance. The Program funds eligible project costs for ecological restoration of wetlands, streams, lakes, and rivers, debris removal, creating diverse aquatic habitats in urban areas, constructing new wetlands and riparian areas, and reducing urban runoff. The Program funds projects for ecological restoration, including reclamation, revegetation, streambank restoration, floodplain riparian zones creation, fish passage barrier removal, and watershed citizen group organization for restoration activities. The Administrator assists project sponsors in coordinating with other agencies, academic institutions, and community organizations for ecological restoration activities. This includes watershed landscape projects, geographical surveys, mapping, identification of riparian restoration sites, and employment of youths in conservation or service corps. The Regional Administrator can enter into cooperative agreements with agencies for technical assistance in projects under the Program. A nondegradation policy prohibits development or degradation of wetlands. Reports are required. The Regional Administrator must submit annual reports on the Program's implementation in their region, with improvement recommendations. The Administrator must also report to Congress on the Program's implementation and make recommendations for its continuation and improvement. Definitions for the National Urban Watershed Restoration Program include ecological restoration, the Program itself, and the role of Regional Administrators. The Environmental Protection Agency defines 'urban watershed' as a watershed within an urbanized area or lands owned by an Indian tribe, and 'watershed' as all lands draining into a single waterbody."
