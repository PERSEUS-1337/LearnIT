The \"Native American Sacred Lands Act\" defines sacred lands as geophysical or geographical areas with cultural or religious significance for Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations. The term \"undertaking\" is defined in reference to the National Historic Preservation Act. SEC. 2. PROTECTION OF SACRED LANDS. Federal agencies must accommodate access to Indian sacred lands, avoid damage, and consult with tribes. Federal lands can be designated unsuitable for certain undertakings if they are likely to cause significant damage to Indian sacred lands. Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations have the right to petition federal departments or agencies to designate federal lands as unsuitable, providing supporting evidence for their claims. Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations can petition federal departments to designate federal lands as unsuitable if they may cause harm to sacred sites. Oral history is considered as important as other evidence. Any person can submit relevant facts with evidence before a hearing is held within 90 days of receiving the petition. A public hearing must be held within 60 days of the petition, with a written decision to follow. After a public hearing, the head of the department issues a written decision on the petition. Within 60 days, the decision can be appealed to a Federal agency appeals board or through a civil action. The decision is not final until the appeal process is completed. Civil actions can be taken for relief in accordance with the regulations. The United States district courts have jurisdiction over civil actions or claims against the Secretary of the Interior or head of another Federal agency related to this section. They can order relief such as money damages, injunctive relief, or mandamus to compel compliance with the Act or regulations. The Equal Access to Justice Act may also apply. The Access to Justice Act applies to actions under this Act. A final decision of unsuitability for Federal lands prohibits undertakings immediately. The Secretary of the Interior can withdraw lands included in the decision with consent. Federal lands deemed unsuitable under section 204 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 will have the Secretary's decision serve as the required documentation. Any unsuitability decision for Federal lands under the Secretary of the Interior or Agriculture will be included in the relevant land use plan. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 or the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 are relevant legislation. SEC. 4. CONFIDENTIALITY. SEC. 4 of the Act ensures confidentiality by prohibiting the release of information related to Native American cultural practices or sacred lands obtained during the petition filing or hearing process, with penalties for intentional disclosure. Subsequent violations of this section may result in a fine of up to $100,000 or imprisonment for up to 5 years, or both. An exception applies if all persons involved waive the application of this section. SEC. 5. GRANTS. The Secretary may provide grants to Indian tribes for activities related to this Act. Authorization of Appropriations is provided. SEC. 6. REGULATIONS. SEC. 6. REGULATIONS. The Secretary must consult with Indian tribes in developing regulations under this Act, using effective processes and consensual mechanisms. The Act becomes effective upon enactment, and any failure to promulgate regulations will not affect the effective date. SEC. 7. CONSULTATION UNDER OTHER LAWS. This Act does not impact consultation processes under other Federal laws."
