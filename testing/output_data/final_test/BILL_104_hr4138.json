    "content": "The \"Hydrogen Future Act of 1996\" is also known as the Hydrogen Act. It defines the Department of Energy as the \"Department\" and the Secretary of Energy as the \"Secretary.\" The Act focuses on the use and development of hydrogen as a fuel source. The \"Hydrogen Future Act of 1996\" amends Public Law 101-566 to direct the Department of Energy to conduct a research program on hydrogen production, storage, transport, and use for various applications. It also includes provisions for reporting to Congress. The Secretary is required to submit a detailed report to Congress by January 1, 1999, on the status and progress of programs authorized under the Hydrogen Future Act of 1996. The report must include an analysis of program effectiveness and recommendations for improvements from the Hydrogen Technical Advisory Panel. Amendments are made to Public Law 101-566 regarding reporting requirements. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress by January 1, 1999, on the programs authorized under the Hydrogen Future Act of 1996. The report should analyze program effectiveness and include recommendations from the Hydrogen Technical Advisory Panel. Amendments are made to reporting requirements in Public Law 101-566. Amendments include changing the punctuation in paragraph (2) and striking paragraph (3). SEC. 103. HYDROGEN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. Amendment to Section 104 of Public Law 101-566 (42 U.S.C. 12403) to focus on hydrogen research and development. The Secretary is mandated to conduct a hydrogen research and development program focusing on production, storage, transportation, and use of hydrogen for various applications. The program aims to enable the private sector to demonstrate the technical feasibility of hydrogen utilization. Special attention will be given to resolving critical technical issues hindering the introduction of hydrogen into the market and accelerating research in key areas such as economic hydrogen production using renewable energy sources. The Secretary is authorized to evaluate new technologies for economic hydrogen production, storage, and utilization, ensuring they do not compete with private sector research activities. The Secretary is authorized to arrange tests and demonstrations for improved technology related to renewable energy systems for isolated communities currently reliant on diesel fuel for power production. Funding for research proposals will be provided through competitive evaluation processes. The Secretary will provide funding for research proposals through competitive evaluation processes, with a requirement for non-Federal funding efforts and a commitment from non-Federal sources for at least 50% of the development costs. Activities under this section should not duplicate those carried out by the Federal Government or industry, and the Secretary will establish guidelines in consultation with other stakeholders. The Secretary will establish terms and conditions for Federal funding in consultation with other agencies, consistent with the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. Section 2026 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 is amended and repealed effective October 1, 1998. SEC. 104. DEMONSTRATIONS: The Secretary must secure a commitment from non-Federal sources for at least 50% of the demonstration costs. \n\nSEC. 105. TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER: The Secretary will promote the exchange of generic, nonproprietary information and technology developed under this chapter among industry, academia, and the Federal Government to benefit the U.S. economy.\n\nSEC. 106. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. SEC. 106. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Amends Section 109 of Public Law 101-566 to allocate specific funding amounts for fiscal years 1996 to 2001. The Secretary of Energy will solicit proposals for projects integrating fuel cells with photovoltaic systems or systems for hydrogen production from solid waste. Proposals will be evaluated competitively, with preference given to joint proposals from academic institutions, industry, and government entities. The Secretary of Energy will require a commitment of at least 50% non-Federal funding for development or demonstration proposals. Federal funding terms will be established in consultation with other agencies, consistent with international agreements. SEC. 202. Authorization of appropriations for activities totaling $50,000,000 for fiscal years 1997 and 1998, available until September 30, 1999. TITLE III - DOE Scientific and Technical Program Quality, SEC. 301. Temporary appointments for scientific and technical experts in Department of Energy research and development programs. The Secretary can appoint scientists, engineers, and other technical personnel from academic or research institutions for a limited term. The Department can cover travel expenses for these individuals and their families. The Department may provide a per diem allowance to individuals appointed for a limited term, in lieu of transportation expenses for their family and household goods. Employer contributions to retirement, life insurance, and health benefit plans for short-term appointees can be made from Department appropriations.
