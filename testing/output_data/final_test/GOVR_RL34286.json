    "content": "Insurance is regulated at the state level, not federal, due to a Supreme Court ruling in 1868. The McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945 reaffirmed states as the main regulators of insurance. Congress has considered repealing or amending this act over the years. In 1974, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act preempted state laws on health benefits. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) federalized regulation of health insurance, preempting state laws. In 1980, Congress limited the FTC's oversight of the insurance industry. A bill in the early 1990s aimed to expand federal oversight of insurance but did not pass. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 reaffirmed states as the main regulators of insurance but also allowed for greater federal involvement. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) removed legal barriers between securities firms, banks, and insurers, leading to more direct competition among the three groups. Insurers face challenges with 50 different state regulators and laws, causing complaints of overlapping and contradictory regulations. The insurance industry initially resisted federalization of regulation but split when faced with increased competition, with larger insurers favoring some form of federal involvement. In response to the changing financial services industry, some members of Congress have introduced various legislation, including a mandatory federal charter for insurance and the idea of an Optional Federal Charter (OFC) for insurance. Larger insurers tend to support federal regulation, while smaller insurers prefer the state regulatory system. Life insurers compete more directly with banks and securities firms, leading them to favor a federal charter more than property/casualty insurers. Legislation for an Optional Federal Charter (OFC) for insurance has been introduced in multiple Congresses. The OFC bills aim to create a dual regulatory system, allowing insurers to choose between a federal charter or a state charter. Some suggest applying OFC legislation only to life insurers due to the uniformity of life insurance products and competition they face. The recent financial crisis impacted the debate on federal chartering for insurers. Some arguments for federal chartering were strengthened, while others were weakened. Concerns arose about financial institutions choosing their regulators. A federal charter bill in the 111th Congress addressed these issues. Amendments were proposed for federal licenses and regulation of specific insurance lines. Representative Dennis Moore suggested creating an optional federal license. Dennis Moore proposed an amendment for a federal license for reinsurers, while Ed Royce and Melissa Bean proposed a similar amendment for financial guarantee insurers. These amendments were withdrawn before any votes were taken. H.R. 2609 was later included in H.R. 4173, which became the Dodd-Frank Act without a federal charter for insurance. Moore then introduced a standalone bill for a federal license for reinsurers. Various arguments for and against a dual regulatory system for insurance have been presented. The regulation of insurance companies at the federal level needs to be revamped to enhance competitiveness with other federally regulated financial institutions. Arguments for dual chartering include addressing systemic risk, having a knowledgeable insurance advocate in Washington, DC, and promoting speed to market for product approval. The Dodd-Frank Act created a \"Federal Insurance Office\" without regulatory powers, while the Comptroller of the Currency has set a precedent for expanding bank products through preemption of state laws. The need for revamping federal regulation of insurance companies to enhance competitiveness with other financial institutions is highlighted. Arguments for dual chartering include addressing systemic risk, having a knowledgeable advocate in Washington, DC, and promoting speed to market for product approval. The creation of a regulatory environment accommodating growth and innovation through competition between federal and state regulators is emphasized. National treatment for insurers to do business in all states and avoid higher costs of state regulation is crucial. The potential difficulty insurers face in international trade without national level regulation is mentioned. The benefits of greater insurance supply and lower costs for consumers due to national competition are outlined. Arguments against federal regulation of insurance companies, advocating for maintaining the state regulatory system, are also discussed. State insurance regulation is praised for its quality and understanding of local markets. It is seen as more flexible, adaptable, and diverse, reducing the impact of poor regulation. State regulators have strong incentives to be effective, unlike a potentially redundant and costly federal bureaucracy. Concerns include fiscal damage from reduced state premium taxes, fragmentation from dual chartering, and a \"race to the bottom\" between state and federal regulators. Regulators are vying for more favorable treatment for insurers to gain greater oversight authority and budget. The federal chartering question revolves around who should regulate - the federal government, states, or a combination. Past federal chartering bills have leaned towards less regulatory oversight compared to state regulators, sparking controversy. H.R. 1880 introduced federal regulation for the insurance industry, creating the Office of National Insurance and a National Insurance Commissioner within the Department of the Treasury. The bill aimed to establish a federal chartering and regulatory system for insurers, agencies, and producers, with the commissioner appointed by the President for a five-year term. The federal regulatory system in H.R. 1880 would have applied to property/casualty and life insurance and reinsurance, with federally licensed insurance producers allowed to sell surplus lines insurance. Nationally licensed insurers, agencies, and producers would have been exempt from most state insurance laws, enabling them to operate nationwide without state requirements, except for state premium tax laws. The bill H.R. 1880 would have affected state taxes on surplus lines insurance, forbidding states not the home state of the insured from collecting these taxes. It would have disallowed the NIC from regulating insurance rates and forms, a significant change compared to current state regulations. H.R. 1880 would have given the commissioner power to set form requirements for insurers and designate a systemic risk regulator for insurance. It also proposed creating a \"Coordinating National Council for Financial Regulators\" with broad oversight powers. H.R. 1880 proposed creating a \"Coordinating National Council for Financial Regulators\" with oversight powers, allowing insurers to choose between federal or state systems, with specific non-optional aspects for insurer conversion and federal chartering. Representative Dennis Moore introduced H.R. 6529 on December 16, 2010. H.R. 6529, introduced by Representative Dennis Moore, aimed to create a federal license for reinsurers under the authority of the Federal Insurance Office. S. 40 and H.R. 3200, introduced by Senators John Sununu, Tim Johnson, Representatives Melissa Bean, and Edward Royce, also addressed insurance regulatory reform but did not progress to hearings or markups. The House Financial Services Subcommittee discussed regulatory reform in October 2007, focusing on the possibility of an optional federal charter for the insurance industry. S. 40 and H.R. 3200 proposed creating a federal regulatory system with an Office of National Insurance and a National Insurance Commissioner overseen by the Secretary of the Treasury. Funding for the office would come from fees on insurers, and the commissioner would be appointed independently. The proposed federal regulatory system for the insurance industry would have been funded by fees on insurers. The National Insurance Commissioner would have been appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for a five-year term. Holders of a national license would have been exempt from most state insurance laws, allowing them to operate nationwide without state requirements. The system would have applied to property/casualty and life insurance, excluding title insurance and including surplus lines insurance. Rate regulation would not have applied to national insurers, and form regulation would have been significantly reduced compared to state regulations. Fees to cover the system's costs would have been assessed on those under the federal system. The proposed federal regulatory system for the insurance industry would have been funded by fees on insurers. National insurers would have continued to pay state premium taxes, with no loss of revenue to the states. State regulation of surplus lines insurance would be reformed, allowing only the state where the insured resides or does business to tax surplus lines insurance. National insurance producers would have been allowed to sell surplus lines insurance. Federal antitrust laws would have applied to national insurers, with minor differences between S. 40 and H.R. 3200. The differences between S. 40 and H.R. 3200 include allowing non-U.S. reinsurers to file financial data according to International Financial Reporting Standards, limiting jurisdiction to federal courts, and clarifying antifraud language. These bills also reduce rate and form regulation compared to the current system, which varies by state. S. 40 and H.R. 3200 disallowed rate and form regulation for national property/casualty insurers, requiring only maintenance of policy forms. National life insurers had to meet general standards and file forms before use. S. 2509 and H.R. 6225 were introduced but did not see direct committee action in the 110th Congress. In 2006, bills similar to those in the 110th Congress were introduced, with differences including the exclusion of surplus lines insurance. The 2007 bills added anti-money laundering compliance requirements for national insurers and excluded them from offering title insurance. They also included new guaranty fund language, shifting focus to a qualified association or fund. Senator Ernest Hollings introduced S. 1373 on July 8, 2003, to regulate interstate insurance sales. S. 1373, introduced by Senator Hollings in 2003, aimed to create a federal commission within the Department of Commerce to regulate interstate property/casualty and life insurance, preempting most state regulation. The bill granted full regulatory powers to the commission, including licensure, rate approval, solvency regulation, and market conduct oversight. H.R. 3766, introduced in 2002 by Representative John LaFalce, proposed creating an optional federal charter for national insurers under a new federal agency within the Treasury Department. The federal charter would have allowed national insurers to underwrite both life insurance and property/casualty insurance, with the director having regulatory authority over solvency and policy forms. Rate regulation would have remained with state insurance regulators. The proposed legislation introduced by Senator Charles Schumer in late 2001 aimed to give the director authority to enforce unfair practices rules against state-licensed insurance producers selling products from national insurers. It would have set federal minimum standards, encouraged community investment by national insurers, required reporting of community sales data, and prohibited discrimination based on geographic location. The proposed legislation introduced by Senator Charles Schumer in late 2001 aimed to establish a federal agency within the Treasury Department called the Office of the National Insurance Commissioner. This agency would oversee National Insurance Companies and National Insurance Agencies, exempting them from most state insurance laws and imposing fees to cover federal expenses. The bill would apply to all lines of insurance and require NICs to participate in state insurance guaranty associations. The Schumer proposal aimed to establish a federal agency called the Office of the National Insurance Commissioner to oversee National Insurance Companies and Agencies. NICs would participate in state insurance guaranty associations, with a federal backup for non-qualifying states. The NIC would not regulate rates or policy forms, and federal antitrust exemptions would be limited to certain activities. Each NIC would be licensed for specific lines of insurance, with affiliated companies allowed to underwrite different lines."
