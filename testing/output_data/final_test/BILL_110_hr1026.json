    "content": "The \"Agricultural Export Facilitation Act of 2007\" is the short title of this Act. The purpose of the Act is outlined in the findings and purpose section. The export sector of United States agriculture contributes positively to the country's trade balance. Since 2000, Cuba has purchased approximately $1.4 billion worth of agricultural products from the United States. In 2004 and 2005, Cuba purchased around $383.9 million and $346 million, respectively, in food and agricultural products from the United States. This trade contributes positively to the US agriculture export sector. To maintain competitiveness, US exporters must have reliable physical access to Cuba, which currently requires special licenses under existing regulations. The issuance of special Department of the Treasury licenses for travel to Cuba for sales-related activities faces administrative delays and periodic denials. A blanket statutory authorization for sales and transport-related travel to Cuba by US exporters would remove bureaucratic impediments endorsed by Congress in the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. Visas for Cuban purchasers of agricultural products authorized under the Act have been delayed or denied, affecting family farmers and small producers. Agricultural products lacking resources for sales delegations to Cuba are denied access to potential purchasers. Issuing visas to Cuban nationals for meetings with US exporters authorized under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 is a simple solution. Visas should also be issued to Cuban phytosanitary inspectors for on-premise inspections of potential US exporters. The Act requires \"payment of cash in advance\" for US agricultural exports to Cuba. The implementation of the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 has caused commercial uncertainty by freezing payments to US exporters from Cuba unnecessarily. This has hindered agricultural sales to Cuba under the Act. Congress did not intend for payment to be received in advance according to the Act's legislative history. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 intended for payment to be made in advance before Cuban purchasers take possession of authorized products. Currently, direct payments between Cuban and US financial institutions are prohibited, leading Cuban purchasers to use third-country banks for payments, incurring additional fees. Permitting direct payments would benefit US exporters. The Act aims to allow US exporters to receive payment directly from Cuban purchasers, reducing transactional fees and facilitating sales of agricultural products. Travel to Cuba for authorized sales activities under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 is permitted. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 allows for travel to Cuba for sales and marketing activities, including product exhibitions, and transportation of products by sea or air. Sales and marketing activities related to travel to, from, or within Cuba by a United States person for exploring the market or engaging in sales activities with products under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 are defined as exhibiting, negotiating, marketing, surveying the market, and delivering and servicing products. The term 'United States person' includes employees, executives, sales agents, consultants, exhibitors, and members of trade organizations promoting the interests of producers, manufacturers, or distributors of products authorized for sale. The Secretary of the Treasury will establish necessary regulations for this subsection. SEC. 4. VISAS ISSUED FOR TRADE ACTIVITIES UNDER TRADE SANCTIONS REFORM AND EXPORT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2000. (a) Issuance of Visas for Cuban nationals conducting activities related to purchasing US agricultural goods under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. Consular officers may issue nonimmigrant visas if the national is admissible to the US. \n(b) Periodic Reports required from the Secretary of State to specific committees every 3 months. The Senate and House committees require reports on visas issued to Cuban nationals for purchasing US agricultural goods under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. Reports must detail each application received and its outcome. SEC. 5. CLARIFICATION OF PAYMENT TERMS UNDER THE TRADE SANCTIONS REFORM AND EXPORT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2000. Section 908(b)(4) of the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 is amended to clarify the term 'payment of cash in advance' for agricultural commodities or products. SEC. 6. Authorization of direct transfers between Cuban and United States financial institutions under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 allows for unrestricted direct transfers from Cuban to US financial institutions for authorized product payments."
