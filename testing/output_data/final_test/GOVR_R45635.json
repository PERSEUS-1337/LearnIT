    "content": "The federal government is the largest employer in the nation, with over two million workers in the U.S. and abroad. Most employees work in the competitive service of the executive branch, where applicants compete based on objective standards. There are also excepted service and Senior Executive Service (SES) classifications with different hiring and removal standards. SES positions are not part of the competitive service and include senior managerial roles with different pay scales. The report examines the three service classifications in the federal government - competitive service, excepted service, and Senior Executive Service (SES). The competitive service includes civil service positions in the executive branch, with OPM administering entrance examinations. SES positions are senior managerial roles with different pay scales. OPM administers entrance examinations for civil service positions in the competitive service, assigning numerical ratings on a 100-point scale. Applicants rated 70 or more are eligible for appointment and placed on lists of eligibles. Agencies request certificates of eligibles from OPM to fill positions, considering at least three individuals for each opening. The competitive service includes various types of appointments, such as continuing positions. The competitive service includes different types of appointments: continuing, term, and temporary. Continuing positions require a one-year probationary period before converting to a career appointment. Term appointments last more than one year but less than four years for special projects or reorganizations. Temporary appointments are for a period not exceeding one year to fill short-term positions or meet temporary employment needs. Employees in the competitive service are paid according to the General Schedule. General Schedule salaries are based on equal pay for equal work, with pay distinctions based on performance. Employees are advanced to the next step at specified intervals until reaching the maximum pay rate for their position. Pay rates are comparable to non-federal rates, and any disparities should be eliminated. Employees in the competitive service maintain specified notice and appeal rights. Before an agency may suspend a qualifying employee for 14 days or less, they must provide advance written notice with specific reasons. Similar notice is required for other adverse personnel actions. For more severe actions like removal or suspension for more than 14 days, the agency must give at least 30 days' advance written notice. Employees have the right to respond and provide evidence to support their case. Adverse actions for federal employees can be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). Agencies must prove misconduct, show a connection to civil service efficiency, and impose a reasonable penalty. Appellants can challenge actions based on errors, prohibited practices, or non-compliance with the law. The excepted service in federal employment consists of positions not in the competitive service or SES, exempt from competitive examination by OPM when impractical. Positions are categorized into four schedules, with Schedule A including non-confidential roles. Schedule A positions are non-confidential roles with no need for applicant examination, including attorneys, chaplains, and short-term critical hiring positions. Schedule B positions also do not require applicant examination but need to meet basic qualification standards set by OPM. Schedule C positions are policy-determining or involve close relationships with agency heads or key officials, including most political appointees. Schedule D positions in the excepted service are not of a confidential or policy-determining nature and are difficult to recruit for through competitive examination. These positions include STEM occupations and roles in the Presidential Management Fellows Program, requiring applicants to meet basic qualification standards. Employees in the excepted service are paid according to the General Schedule and have similar notice and benefits as those in the competitive service. Employees in the excepted service, including preference eligibles, have similar notice and appeal rights for adverse personnel actions as those in the competitive service. Preference eligibles must complete one year of continuous service to access these rights, while non-preference eligibles need to meet specific criteria or serve a probationary period. The Senior Executive Service (SES) is a group of high-level government administrators who manage major programs and projects in federal agencies. SES positions are generally managerial or supervisory roles above the GS-15 grade and do not require appointment by the President or confirmation by the Senate. SES members act as intermediaries between political appointees and career civil servants. The Senior Executive Service (SES) consists of high-level government administrators overseeing major programs in federal agencies. There are over 7,000 permanent SES positions, divided into career reserved and general categories. Career reserved positions require career appointees to maintain impartiality, while general positions can be filled by various appointees. SES appointments include career, noncareer, limited term, and limited emergency appointees. The Senior Executive Service (SES) includes career appointees selected through a competitive process, noncareer appointees chosen by agency heads, and limited term/emergency appointees with non-renewable terms. Career appointees must be certified by a Qualification Review Board (QRB) before appointment, while noncareer appointees require OPM approval. Limited term and emergency appointees are a small subset of the SES. Limited emergency appointees in the SES are a small subset with non-renewable terms, used for specific needs or urgent situations. Title 5 of the U.S. Code limits the number of noncareer and limited term appointees in SES positions. The SES pay structure is based on individual performance and agency contribution, assessed through a rigorous appraisal system approved by OPM. The SES appraisal systems, subject to OPM standards, aim to make meaningful distinctions based on relative performance. Title 5 sets different pay rates for SES members, with a minimum rate of basic pay at 120% of GS-15, step 1, and a maximum rate equal to Level III of the Executive Schedule. The Senior Executive Service (SES) members' total compensation is capped at the rate for Level I of the Executive Schedule, including bonuses and awards. Title 5 allows for a higher range of SES pay for agencies with OPM-certified performance appraisal systems. It also outlines procedures for adverse actions against SES members. Career SES appointees can only be removed or face adverse action for specified reasons after completing a probationary period. Career appointees in the Senior Executive Service (SES) can only be removed for misconduct, neglect of duty, malfeasance, or failure to accept reassignment. They must receive advance notice and can appeal to the MSPB. A single unsatisfactory rating may result in reassignment or removal, while two unsatisfactory ratings within a certain period lead to removal. SES appointees cannot appeal these actions to the MSPB but can request a review. SES career appointees have specific removal protections, including the right to appeal to the MSPB. Noncareer appointees lack similar protections and can be removed at any time, with removal procedures at the discretion of the agency head. Congress has implemented special removal requirements for SES members at the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act allows the VA Secretary to take action against SES career appointees for misconduct or poor performance. SES employees at the VA have expedited notice and appeals rights compared to other federal agencies."
