    "content": "The Act titled \"Product Safety Notification and Recall Effectiveness Act of 2003\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 outlines the findings and purposes of the Act. The Consumer Product Safety Commission conducts around 300 recalls of hazardous consumer products annually. Manufacturers lack contact information for most consumers, hindering effective communication about product recalls. The Consumer Product Safety Commission staff has found that maintaining consumer product purchase data is crucial for effectively notifying consumers of product recalls. Consumer contact is a key factor in motivating consumer response to recalls. Many consumers do not return purchaser identification cards due to concerns about marketing and personal information requests. The purpose of this Act is to improve recall effectiveness by requiring simplified, marketing-free product registration cards to increase consumer participation in product recalls. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has already implemented similar cards on child safety seats, leading to higher recall compliance rates. The Act aims to enhance recall effectiveness by mandating manufacturers to include simplified product safety owner cards or develop electronic registration for certain consumer products. It also encourages creativity in notifying consumers about product recalls. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines terms from the Consumer Product Safety Act, including \"covered consumer product\" which includes juvenile products and small household appliances. Juvenile products are intended for children under 5 years old and include items like cribs. The Act defines various juvenile products, including cribs, toddler beds, high chairs, bath seats, gates, playpens, strollers, walkers, swings, child carriers, bassinets, cradles, and children's toys. It also mentions a product safety owner card as a standardized identification card supplied with consumer products by manufacturers. The Act defines juvenile products like cribs, high chairs, strollers, and toys. A product safety owner card is provided by manufacturers with consumer products to collect minimal personal information for recall purposes. Small household appliances include toasters, blenders, and coffee makers. Rule requiring system to provide notice of recalls of certain consumer products. The Commission must create a rule mandating manufacturers of consumer products to establish a system for notifying consumers of recalls. This system must include product safety owner cards, Internet registration, or other methods to maintain a database for recall notifications. Alternative methods may involve online registration and consumer information databases. The Commission must establish a rule requiring manufacturers to use electronic methods like tagging, barcodes, and embedded chips to notify consumers of product recalls. The rule must consider a staff proposal for a Purchaser Owner Card Program and may exclude low-cost items. The Commission must issue a proposed rule within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The Commission must establish a rule for manufacturers to use electronic methods for product recalls and may exclude low-cost items. The final rule must be promulgated within 270 days of the Act's enactment, with the option to extend the deadline upon timely notice to relevant committees."
