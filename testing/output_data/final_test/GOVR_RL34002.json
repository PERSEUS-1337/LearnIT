    "content": "The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program provides rental assistance to low-income households through local public housing agencies. Shaped by the 1998 assisted housing reform act, the program has faced scrutiny and calls for reforms due to funding constraints and the need for cost-saving administrative changes. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program administers approximately 2 million vouchers through over 2,500 local Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) across the country. PHAs vary in size and jurisdiction, with some overseeing as few as 10 vouchers and others managing almost 90,000. This diversity has been criticized by researchers and housing advocates who argue for regional administration of housing programs. Housing programs should be regionally administered, unlike other social services which are state-level. The voucher program's state-level administration could improve coordination with other services, but may reduce local control. PHAs prefer the current locally driven system due to their important local connections. HUD has encouraged consolidation of PHAs by providing guidance on transferring voucher programs. Federal statutes and regulations set program features, but PHAs have discretion in areas like managing waiting lists and screening tenants. PHAs must outline their programs and local decisions in five-year and annual plans. The voucher program allows PHAs to use local discretion in developing five-year and annual plans, as well as administrative plans, with public input. Vouchers help families pay housing costs in the private market by covering the difference between rent and tenant contributions. HUD funds PHAs to renew existing vouchers, with new vouchers called incremental vouchers. Funding for new incremental vouchers has been provided since FY2008. Since FY2008, appropriations acts have funded incremental vouchers for targeted populations, such as homeless veterans and families in the child welfare system. PHAs receive funding for rent subsidies and administrative costs, earning fees on a per-voucher basis. The program is governed by extensive regulations and guidance, with past reform proposals aiming to simplify it into a block grant system. The concept of block-granting the voucher program raises concerns among low-income housing advocates, who argue that block granting could lead to funding cuts, less federal oversight, and reduced transparency in fund allocation. Existing rules and regulations are seen as necessary to protect tenants. The Moving to Work (MTW) Demonstration allows some PHAs to receive federal housing assistance funding in block grant form, providing added flexibility for innovation. However, critics argue that MTW lacks transparency and clear objectives, allowing detrimental proposals like time limits and work requirements for assisted families. Some families can use vouchers for mortgage costs if their local PHA offers a homeownership voucher program. The George W. Bush Administration prioritized increasing first-time homebuyers using homeownership vouchers to help lower-income families build assets and wealth for long-term financial security. However, the homeownership program has minimum requirements that some families may struggle to meet, such as income and employment standards. Financial stability is crucial for maintaining homeownership, especially for families in low-wage or unstable job markets. Given recent housing market turmoil, the future growth of the voucher program is uncertain. The future growth of the voucher homeownership option is uncertain due to recent turmoil in the housing market. The number of closings has decreased in recent years, with families required to pay an income-based rent of 30% of their adjusted incomes. This rent structure is based on the concept of affordability for low-income families. The concept of affordable housing for low-income families is based on the idea that housing costs should not exceed 30% of their income. However, this percentage may vary depending on individual circumstances, with some families able to afford up to 40% or 50% towards housing costs. The current voucher program allows families to choose to pay up to 40% of their income initially, and even more upon lease renewal. In the past, the standard was set at 25% of family income. Critics argue that the current rent calculation may not accurately reflect the varying financial situations of low-income families. Critics argue for flexibility in rent calculation for low-income families, suggesting options like flat or tiered rents. Flat rents would be fixed and below-market, regardless of income changes. Families can choose flat rents but switch back to income-based rents. Tiered rents would set different flat rents based on income tiers, with rent changing only when moving between tiers. PHAs can adjust rent tiers to impact tenant rent costs and voucher expenses. Moving to flat or tiered rents can save money or serve more people, but may burden low-income families. Many PHAs, including those in the Moving to Work program, have adopted alternative rent structures for administrative ease. The current rent structure in the Section 8 program is complex, leading to high levels of errors in subsidy calculations. A HUD study found that over 60% of calculations had errors, resulting in $1 billion in over- and under-payments. This led to the program being designated as \"high risk\" by the GAO. HUD has implemented initiatives to reduce errors, such as accessing the National Directory of New Hires for income verification and using the Enterprise Income Verification system for fraud detection. HUD has implemented the Enterprise Income Verification system to detect fraud and improve income verification for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs). Efforts have led to a 60% reduction in erroneous payments, totaling $440 million in FY2009. The Quality Control study found that 42% of subsidies were inaccurately calculated. GAO removed the rental assistance program from its high-risk list in 2007. Adopting flat or tiered rents could reduce errors in rent calculations and work disincentives for families. The public housing program faces challenges with under-reporting income, while the voucher program lacks a mandatory earned income disregard. PHAs may choose to disregard increased earnings but risk funding cuts or sanctions from HUD. Flat or tiered rents allow families to increase earnings without rent changes, but advocates prefer income-based rents for better responsiveness to income changes. The current system for calculating income for rent-setting purposes has been criticized as cumbersome and prone to errors. Changes to the method of calculating income could simplify the rent-setting process, but could also result in some families paying more than is considered affordable. Anticipating low-income families' future incomes can be challenging. Anticipating low-income families' future incomes is challenging due to variable employment and family composition. PHAs verify incomes using third-party sources, which can be time-consuming. Adjusted income for rent-setting is calculated by deducting amounts for dependents, elderly/disabled households, child care, disability, and medical expenses. The complexity of the income determination system contributes to errors in rent determination, with statutory requirements necessitating congressional action for changes. The current voucher program has statutory and regulatory requirements that PHA groups want simplified. HUD is considering ways to improve the income calculation process, but no major changes have been made yet. The program targets assistance to very low-income and extremely low-income families, with a focus on serving the neediest families. Serving lower income families leads to higher costs per voucher, limiting the number of families that can be assisted in a limited funding environment. The George W. Bush Administration advocated loosening targeting standards in the voucher program to serve more families or reduce costs. Low-income housing advocates support retaining current income eligibility requirements, arguing that the neediest households face the heaviest rent burdens. The voucher program currently has no time limits or work requirements for recipients. The public housing program has rules for subsidy termination based on income levels or non-compliance. There is an eight-hour work requirement for some tenants, but many are exempt. Advocates suggest implementing time limits and work requirements to incentivize recipients to increase their incomes and leave the program. Time limits and work requirements in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program have helped decrease the caseload. Many communities have long waiting lists for assistance, and turnover is crucial to serve those families. Families with children tend to leave the program relatively quickly, with a median stay of two and a half years. However, it is uncertain whether these changes increase families' incomes or lead to self-sufficiency. Research based on the 1996 welfare reform changes indicates that increases in work do not always result in higher total income for poor families. Most households require work supports like child care and transportation assistance to achieve financial self-sufficiency. Low-income families leaving the voucher program struggle to afford housing costs, with less than 1% able to afford fair market rent. Additional funding and supportive services are needed to help families become financially stable. Advocates suggest providing incentives for families to increase work efforts and incomes through programs like the Family Self-Sufficiency program (FSS), which deposits increased rent payments from work earnings into escrow accounts. However, not all Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) offer FSS programs, with 28,469 voucher program participants enrolled as of 2008. The impact of FSS is unclear, but initial profiles show higher income increases for FSS participants compared to non-participants. The Housing Quality Standards (HQS) inspections are crucial for ensuring safe housing for voucher program participants. However, delays in the leasing process due to inspections can deter landlords from participating, leading to families missing out on units in tight markets. Some HQS failures for minor violations can also cause payment withholding until compliance is met. The Housing Quality Standards (HQS) inspections are essential for safe housing in the voucher program. Delays in leasing due to inspections can discourage landlords from participating, impacting families in tight markets. Substandard housing prevalence varies by region, with calls for inspection requirement changes to balance PHA flexibility and tenant protection. Section 8 vouchers are nationally portable, allowing families to move between PHA jurisdictions. When families with Section 8 vouchers move between PHA jurisdictions, the receiving PHA can either absorb the voucher or bill the originating PHA for it. Absorbing means serving the family with one of its vouchers, while billing means administering the voucher on behalf of the originating PHA and seeking reimbursement. Billing PHAs receive a partial administrative fee but retain the voucher for reissuance when the family leaves the program. Proposals have been made to simplify the administrative process of portability for Section 8 vouchers, such as limiting portability between jurisdictions with agreements or creating a national pool of vouchers. These proposals may restrict families' choices in housing. Portability for Section 8 vouchers allows families to move to areas with better opportunities, but research shows mixed results. Advocates call for more funding for mobility counseling and performance standards to improve mobility. Some suggest state or regional administration over PHA-level to enhance mobility. The cost of a voucher in the Housing Choice Voucher Program is determined by the difference between the rent for a unit and the tenant's contribution, which is usually 30% of their income. Prior to FY2003, HUD reimbursed PHAs for the actual cost of vouchers, but changes in the rental market and program rules led to rising costs. (For more information, see CRS Report R42832, Choice and Mobility in the Housing Choice Voucher Program: Review of Research Findings and Considerations for Policymakers) In response to rising costs in the voucher program, the Bush Administration proposed changes to funding and factors affecting cost growth. Congress only changed how PHAs received renewal funding in FY2005, based on the previous year's funding amount. This new formula was more predictable and easier for HUD to administer. In response to rising costs in the voucher program, the Bush Administration proposed changes to funding and factors affecting cost growth. Congress reverted back to a funding formula based on actual costs and utilization in FY2007, which has been adopted each year since. Some PHA groups called for changes to the voucher program structure to better control costs. Some Members of Congress are concerned about the rising cost of the Section 8 voucher program, driven by market factors such as declining tenant incomes and increasing rents. Calls have been made to expand the Moving to Work Demonstration to promote self-sufficiency among assisted families, increase housing choice, and reduce costs. HUD can select up to 30 PHAs to participate in the demonstration and receive waivers of most rules governing public housing. HUD can select up to 30 PHAs to participate in the Moving to Work Demonstration, where agencies can merge funds, alter policies, and make other changes with HUD approval. Rules outside of the U.S. Housing Act cannot be waived, and participating agencies must continue to serve low-income families. Agencies have used the flexibility provided by MTW differently. Some PHAs have made changes to their voucher and public housing programs under the Moving to Work Demonstration, including altering eligibility and rent policies. Industry groups support MTW expansion for better management of federal funding, while low-income housing advocates oppose it due to concerns about serving higher income families. Some PHAs may choose to serve higher income families than allowed by the U.S. Housing Act, disconnecting rent-setting policies from income and potentially increasing rents. Concerns arise that in a limited funding environment, such policy changes may be necessary to balance budgets. The existing MTW program lacks rigorous evaluation, making it difficult to assess the effectiveness of different reforms adopted by MTW agencies. Several bills in the 110th and 111th Congresses aimed to expand the MTW program, but none were enacted. The Moving to Work Charter Program Act in the 112th Congress proposed to expand and modify the program. The Section 8 Voucher Reform Act suggested replacing MTW with a new Housing Innovation Program. The Housing Innovation Program (HIP) would replace the existing Moving to Work program, maintaining some aspects like blending public housing and voucher funding. HUD would designate up to 60 agencies for HIP, with the option to add 20 more. Selection process based on bill priorities, diverse agency group, performance standards, and evaluation for successful models. HIP would include limits on agency policies. In the 112th Congress, the House Financial Services Committee discussed the Moving to Work Improvement, Expansion, and Permanency Act of 2011, which aimed to make the MTW program permanent, lift the cap on participating agencies, and modify the program's purposes. The draft bill included changes to reporting requirements and a transition mechanism for existing MTW agencies. The draft Affordable Housing and Self Sufficiency Improvement Act (AHSSIA) proposed reforms to the Housing Choice Voucher program, including transferring administrative responsibilities to states, implementing time limits and work requirements, and allowing PHAs to experiment with rent-setting policies. Recent bipartisan reform bills have been narrower in scope compared to earlier proposals. Recent bipartisan reform bills for the Housing Choice Voucher program have focused on changes to existing rules rather than a complete overhaul. Bills like the Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2006 and 2007 were introduced in Congress but did not pass. Similar legislation in the 110th Congress also did not result in reform. A new version, the Section Eight Voucher Reform Act of 2009, was introduced in the 111th Congress. The Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2009 (H.R. 3045) was introduced in the 111th Congress but was not enacted. In the 112th Congress, a similar version of the bill was proposed by Representative Waters, aiming to simplify the income calculation process and modify the inspection process for PHAs. No reform legislation has been introduced in the 113th Congress. The Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2009 proposed changes to the inspection process for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs), allowing inspections every other year. It also included provisions for portability vouchers, alternative rent structures, downpayment assistance for homebuyers, and a new funding allocation formula for PHAs. Additionally, it aimed to establish a new administrative fee formula and performance rating system. The Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2011 (H.R. 1209) underwent changes compared to the previous version, with the removal of controversial firearms provisions. The Section Eight Savings Act of 2011 (SESA) was discussed in hearings by the House Financial Services Committee, with revised draft versions circulated for consideration. The revised draft versions of SESA and SEVRA were discussed in the House Financial Services Committee, with changes made to both bills. The new draft reform bill, AHSSIA, included provisions beyond the Section 8 voucher program. AHSSIA, like SEVRA, addressed inspection of units under the program but did not allow the use of withheld rent for repairs. AHSSIA proposed changes to income eligibility and tenant rent calculations for assisted housing programs, including increasing minimum rent thresholds and expanding the Moving to Work (MTW) program. It also included provisions to modify the Family Self Sufficiency (FSS) program. The draft legislation proposed changes to the Family Self Sufficiency (FSS) program, combining public housing and Section 8 voucher versions into one program. It would make participation in FSS mandatory for large PHAs, create a new funding distribution formula, and prohibit PHAs from terminating tenancy for program non-completion. Additionally, AHSSIA would require HUD to conduct a demonstration on promoting economic security for non-elderly, non-disabled assisted tenants, and authorize the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) for converting certain assisted housing properties to new Section 8 rental assistance. The AHSSIA legislation proposed changes to public housing and Section 8 voucher programs, including mandatory participation in the Family Self Sufficiency program and funding distribution reforms. It also included provisions for a demonstration on promoting economic security for assisted tenants and authorization for the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program. The President's FY2014 budget request sought statutory changes to broaden the definition of \"extremely low-income\" for HUD's rental assistance programs. The AHSSIA legislation proposed changes to public housing and Section 8 voucher programs, including revisions to income deductions for rent calculation, capping utility allowances based on family size, altering inspection requirements, and testing different rent-setting models. These changes were estimated to reduce the cost of HUD rental assistance programs."
