    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Accelerating Innovation in Medicine Act of 2013\" or the \"AIM Act of 2013\". Congress recognizes the importance of innovation in health care technology, especially in bringing medical devices to the market. Delays in patient access through government health care programs can hinder the introduction of new medical devices. Patients under the Medicare program are open to self-pay arrangements for medical items and services. Enabling health care technology manufacturers to designate products directly available to self-pay patients will promote innovation, increase patient access, save taxpayer dollars, and reduce administrative burdens. This allows for additional data collection on outcomes and clinical effectiveness. The curr_chunk discusses collecting data on outcomes and clinical effectiveness for potential Medicare coverage. Establishment of manufacturer opt-out program for medical devices. The Secretary will establish the Accelerating Innovation in Medicine (AIM) List of Medical Devices excluded from coverage under the Social Security Act. This list will prevent insurance benefits and payments for listed devices, with individuals responsible for payment if they choose to receive them. The AIM list requires written consent from manufacturers for inclusion of medical devices. Manufacturers must submit a request to the Secretary for device inclusion, especially if seeking FDA approval. The AIM list requires manufacturers to submit a request for device inclusion to the Secretary, following FDA approval or clearance. If the device is exempt from approval requirements, the request must be submitted by the first business day of the month. The AIM list requires manufacturers to submit a request for device inclusion to the Secretary, following FDA approval or clearance. Devices included in the AIM list are listed for 3-year periods and can be removed at the manufacturer's request. Manufacturers must provide data on clinical studies for their device to remain on the AIM list for a subsequent 3-year period. Failure to do so may result in removal from the list upon the Secretary's discretion. The Secretary has the authority to remove or not renew a medical device from the AIM list. The term \"medical device\" is defined in section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The listed devices will be posted on a public website and updated regularly. No regulations are required for this process. The Secretary is not required to promulgate regulations for the AIM list. Informed consent is necessary for providers to charge for devices under this title. Failure to obtain informed consent results in no charge for the device. Section 1862(a) of the Social Security Act is amended accordingly. In paragraph (24), ``or'' is removed. In paragraph (25), the period is replaced with ``; or''. A new paragraph (26) is added for medical device expenses on the AIM list."
