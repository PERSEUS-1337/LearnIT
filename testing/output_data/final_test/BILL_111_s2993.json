    "content": "The Act is titled the \"10 Million Solar Roofs and 10 Million Gallons of Solar Water Heating Act of 2010\". Congress recognizes the potential for increasing electricity production in the US from distributed solar photovoltaics and solar water heating systems. The upfront cost is a barrier to deployment, but over time, these systems are cost-effective. Investment in solar technology will create economies of scale, making electricity prices competitive with fossil fuels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Photovoltaics reduce greenhouse gas emissions, do not emit harmful pollutants, utilize existing rooftop space, and do not require additional land. Distributed solar PV enhances energy security, meets peak power demand without new infrastructure, and stimulates green job development. Rebate programs in some States increase solar energy deployment. The State of California leads in installed solar photovoltaic systems with over 500 megawatts due to rebate programs. New Jersey follows with 90 megawatts of installed solar capacity. Hawaii leads in solar water heating systems and will require new homes to have them starting in 2010, saving households $600 annually. The United States lags behind in solar technology adoption despite inventing it, ranking fourth in installed solar behind Germany, Spain, and Japan. There are over 1,500,000 solar water heating systems in the US, utilizing the sun as a free fuel source. Florida ranks second in installed solar hot water systems and has used rebate programs for solar systems. The State of California leads in installed solar photovoltaic systems with over 500 megawatts, while New Jersey follows with 90 megawatts. Hawaii leads in solar water heating systems and will mandate them in new homes starting in 2010, saving households $600 annually. Solar water heating systems have the potential to displace fossil fuel use in water heating, reducing costs and carbon dioxide emissions in homes in the United States. Homes spend over $13 billion on energy for water heating, equivalent to 11.4 barrels of oil per home and accounting for 30% of carbon dioxide emissions. Solar water heating systems can help reduce these costs and emissions. Rebates are available for purchasing and installing photovoltaic systems and solar water heating systems. The Secretary of Energy will provide rebates for installing solar photovoltaic and water heating systems to increase the number of systems in the US over a 10-year period. The Act provides rebates for installing solar photovoltaic and water heating systems in the US, with eligibility criteria for recipients and system capacity limits. The Act offers rebates for solar photovoltaic and water heating systems in the US, with eligibility criteria and system capacity limits. Information on available incentives is provided to recipients. The Secretary may identify other qualifying entities. Rebates are based on wattage for solar systems. The rebate for solar systems is based on installed capacity per watt, with specific maximum amounts set. The rebate for solar systems is based on installed capacity per watt, with specific maximum amounts set. The dollar per watt rates for solar systems have decreased over the years: 1.75 in 2010 and 2011, 1.5 in 2012, 1.25 in 2013, 1 in 2014 and 2015, 0.75 in 2016 and 2017, and 0.5 in 2018 and 2019. The Secretary may adjust maximum rebate amounts for solar water heating systems to ensure deployment aligns with the Act's purposes and market conditions. The rebate amount for solar water heating systems in 2010 is capped at $1 per watt thermal-equivalent of installed capacity. The maximum rebate amount for solar photovoltaic or solar water heating systems decreases over time based on market conditions and the Act's purposes. The rebate cannot exceed 50% of the remaining cost after considering all other incentives and tax credits. The authority provided under this section is in addition to any other financial assistance for installing solar systems. Appropriations are authorized as necessary for implementation."
