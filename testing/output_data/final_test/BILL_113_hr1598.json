    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Veteran's I.D. Card Act\" and includes provisions for a Veterans Identification Card. Congress finds that currently, veteran identification cards are only issued to veterans who meet specific criteria, leaving out those who have served a minimum obligated time but do not qualify. This results in veterans having to carry official discharge papers to prove their status, which is impractical for accessing goods, services, and promotional activities. The Department of Veterans Affairs is urged to provide a general purpose veteran identification card to veterans who do not meet specific criteria, allowing them to demonstrate their status without carrying official discharge papers. The infrastructure is in place to produce these cards and a small payment can cover the cost. The bill proposes issuing a veteran identification card to eligible veterans upon request, with specific criteria including an honorable discharge, providing official military documents, and paying a fee. The card must display the veteran's photo and name, state it is not proof of benefits, have a unique ID number, and serve as proof of veteran status.

The card must display the veteran's photo and name, state it is not proof of benefits, have a unique ID number, and serve as proof of veteran status. The Secretary will charge a fee for the card, determined to cover necessary costs. The Secretary will review the determination for the veteran identification card every five years. Amounts collected for the card will be deposited into a Department account for this purpose. The card does not provide proof of benefits or entitle the veteran to any benefits under this title. The Secretary ensures secure information handling for the identification card, may establish procedures for replacements, coordinates with the National Personnel Records Center, and conducts outreach for advertising. This section does not affect identification cards provided to veterans enrolled in the healthcare system. A covered veteran is defined as a veteran meeting certain criteria. A \"veteran\" is defined as someone not receiving retired pay under title 10 and not enrolled in the patient enrollment system. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections in the chapter. The amendments made by this Act regarding the Veterans identification card will take effect 60 days after the enactment of the Act."
