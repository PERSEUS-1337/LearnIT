    "content": "The grand jury plays a unique role in the criminal justice system, serving as both a sword and shield of justice. It has the power to accuse or not accuse individuals of federal crimes, conducting secret investigations and approving trials. Key aspects include the relationship between prosecutors and the grand jury, witness rights, secrecy, and the rights of investigation targets. The grand jury, an ancient institution, evolved from being an accuser to also a protector by the American colonial period. It was enshrined in the Bill of Rights with extraordinary powers and deference, serving as both an accuser and a protector. The grand jury is afforded extraordinary powers and exceptional deference. While the Fifth Amendment right to grand jury indictment is only required in federal cases, in most states, prosecution can begin with an indictment or information filed by the prosecutor. Changes to the federal grand jury system are often driven by concerns for fairness or prosecutorial excesses. The authority of a federal grand jury is broad but limited to investigating possible violations of federal criminal law within its district. The grand jury has the authority to investigate possible violations of federal criminal law within its district, even without probable cause. It can conduct inquiries based on suspicion, tips, rumors, or evidence provided by the prosecutor. The investigation continues until all available clues are pursued and all witnesses are examined. Federal law requires United States District Courts to summon grand juries when public interest demands. The Attorney General can request a special grand jury in larger districts or where criminal activity is high. Historically, the sheriff selected grand jury members, a practice that continued in England and colonial America. Federal law once governed grand jury selection, but now it is the court's responsibility. The grand jury selection process is now governed by the court, following the Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968. Federal grand jurors must be U.S. citizens, 18 years or older, residents of the judicial district for at least a year, able to read and write English proficiently, mentally and physically fit to serve, and free of pending felony charges or felony convictions without restored civil rights. Discrimination based on various factors is prohibited, and jurors must be selected randomly from a diverse community. The grand jury selection process is governed by the court, and challenges to the selection can be made by a defendant, government attorney, or excluded group member. Historical justification exists for not disqualifying a potential grand juror based on bias. While some courts assert grand juries must be unbiased, the focus is on avoiding improper influences that could create bias within the panel. The grand jury panels consist of 16 to 23 members, with 16 needed for a quorum and 12 for an indictment. The size of panels is a remnant of common law, with little explanation for the specific numbers chosen. The movement to abolish the right to indictment in many states led to a reduction in panel sizes, but there have been few suggestions for a comparable reduction at the federal level. The federal grand jury consists of 23 members, with 16 needed for quorum. Alternate grand jurors can be selected, and the court appoints a foreperson and deputy foreperson. Grand juries sit until discharged, typically for 18 months with a possible 6-month extension. Special grand juries in high-crime districts can serve up to 36 months. The federal grand jury consists of 23 members, with 16 needed for quorum, and can sit for up to 36 months. The proceedings are held behind closed doors with jurors, government attorney, witnesses, and a recorder present. The attorney presents evidence, and the grand jury may also conduct investigations. Today, the grand jury acts on evidence presented by witnesses rather than personal knowledge of jurors. The attorney for the government arranges witness appearances before the grand jury and assists in questioning. Grand jury witnesses usually appear under subpoena, which can be issued at the panel's request. Failure to comply with a subpoena may result in consequences for the witness. Failure to comply with a grand jury subpoena may lead to civil or criminal contempt charges. Lying to the grand jury can result in perjury charges. Witnesses cannot provide information directly to the grand jury without going through the court or the government's attorney. Potential defendants or grand jury targets, along with their counsel, do not have the right to appear before the grand jury unless invited or subpoenaed. Cooperation with investigations is expected unless self-incrimination or privilege is involved. In the context of grand jury investigations, witnesses are expected to cooperate and may be arrested or incarcerated if they fail to comply with a subpoena. Witnesses can claim privilege but must still testify if subpoenaed, with fewer restrictions on the grand jury's investigative power. The grand jury is entitled to every individual's evidence, even if it may be burdensome or damaging. Grand jury subpoenas may override protective court orders, but the grand jury's authority is not unlimited. Witnesses are expected to cooperate, even if testimony may be damaging, and federal evidentiary privileges are governed by the Federal Rules of Evidence. Federal law on privileges is guided by common law principles interpreted by US courts. There are three levels of privilege recognition: some privileges like doctor-patient are not recognized, some like journalist-source are recognized for limited purposes, and some like clergy-communicant are recognized as evidentiary privileges for grand jury purposes. Evidentiary privileges do not exist in cases of physician-patient, accountant-client, researcher-source, parent-child, employer-stenographer, banker-depositor, draft counselor-client, and police observation post. The curr_chunk discusses various recognized or developing but qualified privileges, including those for critical self-evaluation, journalists, presidential communications, state legislators, and more. These privileges may be uncertain against a grand jury subpoena. The curr_chunk discusses the privileges that can provide grounds for quashing a grand jury subpoena, including attorney-client, attorney work product, clergyman-communicant, informer identity, spousal immunity, spousal communications, and psychotherapist-patient. The attorney-client privilege and attorney work product privilege are commonly cited in motions to quash grand jury subpoenas. The attorney-client privilege covers confidential disclosures made to obtain legal assistance, but does not protect criminal communications or client identity/payment details. The attorney-client privilege may not constitute grounds to quash a grand jury subpoena, except in cases where disclosure would implicate the client in criminal activity, reveal the client's identity as a crucial link in incriminating evidence, involve unlawful fee payment, or contain confidential communications in the fee contract. The attorney work product privilege protects materials prepared by a lawyer for litigation purposes. The attorney work product privilege, like the attorney-client privilege, is subject to a crime/fraud exception. It belongs to both the client and attorney, allowing either to claim it. The Sixth Amendment right to counsel can sometimes be used to quash a grand jury subpoena, especially if the client has already been indicted or arrested. The Sixth Amendment right to counsel can be used to quash a grand jury subpoena in cases where the client has been indicted or arrested. The subpoena may only be quashed if it is shown to be motivated by harassment, results in a conflict of interest, or undermines the attorney-client relationship. The First Amendment guarantees may also provide grounds to avoid a contempt citation or quash a subpoena in extreme circumstances. The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, but in the context of a grand jury subpoena, what may be considered unreasonable in other circumstances is often deemed reasonable. Grand jury subpoenas do not require probable cause or approval from a magistrate, and the opportunity to challenge them before compliance makes them less intrusive than warrants. \"Forthwith\" subpoenas are generally considered constitutional, either because the recipient consents or due to exigent circumstances. The Fourth Amendment is visible in Rule 17(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which allows for the quashing of a grand jury subpoena if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive. A grand jury subpoena is presumed to be reasonable unless there is particularized proof of irregularities in the process. Compliance may be deemed unreasonable if it requests irrelevant items for the investigation. The Fourth Amendment allows for the quashing of a grand jury subpoena if it commands the production of irrelevant items, lacks specificity, or is unreasonably burdensome. However, it is not unreasonable or a violation of the Fifth Amendment to subpoena a witness for voice or handwriting exemplars, bank records, DNA samples, or fingerprints. The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination does not give an absolute right to refuse to respond in a grand jury inquiry. The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination does not confer an absolute right to decline to respond in a grand jury inquiry. A witness may refuse to present self-incriminating testimony before the grand jury, but cannot protect pre-existing personal papers on the grounds of self-incrimination. The privilege is personal and does not apply to corporate records. The Fifth Amendment due process clause and Rule 17 can be used to challenge grand jury subpoenas if there is potential abuse or unfair practices. A grand jury subpoena can be challenged if it is issued solely to prepare the government's case against an indicted target. It cannot be used for civil cases or to question a Member of Congress's legislative acts. Federal law prohibits the use of evidence obtained through illegal wiretapping, allowing witnesses to refuse to respond to inquiries based on such information. The grand jury subpoena can be challenged if it is issued solely to indict the witness, and there is debate over whether foreign sovereign immunity can be used to avoid compliance. The classification of information as confidential may or may not protect it from a federal grand jury subpoena, and the impact of regulatory limitations on the subpoena power is uncertain. Failure to comply with guidelines in the United States Attorneys' Manual does not typically invalidate a grand jury subpoena. The secrecy of federal grand juries is crucial for their proper functioning, as it limits who can attend and when information can be disclosed. While there are exceptions for balancing justice, the secrecy serves to prevent escape and ensure freedom for the process. The secrecy of federal grand juries is essential to prevent interference, protect witnesses, and encourage honest disclosures. It also safeguards the innocent from unnecessary exposure and expenses. However, there are exceptions where revealing grand jury proceedings may serve public interest or prevent miscarriages of justice. Conditions for disclosing grand jury proceedings vary depending on the context, with rules balancing the public interest in confidentiality against the need for disclosure. Rule 6 allows for disclosure to a second grand jury without court approval, while disclosure to a civil litigant requires court approval after weighing conflicting interests. The rule emphasizes that secrecy obligations must align with its provisions and prohibits unauthorized disclosures. Grand jury secrecy prohibits unauthorized disclosures by certain individuals involved in the proceedings, but witnesses are generally allowed to disclose their testimony. However, there are exceptions such as the Stored Communications Act which may impose nondisclosure orders on communication service providers regarding grand jury subpoenas. The secrecy rule covers matters occurring before the grand jury but does not always prevent disclosure of information. Grand jury secrecy under Rule 6(e) protects the workings of the grand jury, not the information disclosed. It does not always prevent disclosure of information previously presented to the grand jury for an unrelated purpose. The rule also shields ancillary proceedings and records to avoid frustration of its purpose during litigation. The rule of grand jury secrecy allows for disclosure of information under certain circumstances, such as when the individual is not bound by secrecy, when disclosure is not considered revealing grand jury matters, or when disclosure is directed by the court for a judicial proceeding. Government attorneys and employees may access grand jury information for various purposes, including preparing for civil litigation. Disclosure to them without court approval is possible under certain circumstances outlined in the rule. The Supreme Court limits disclosures of grand jury material to attorneys and employees assisting in the criminal process. Grand jury evidence of certain foreign and terrorist activities can be disclosed to law enforcement officials without prior judicial approval. Additionally, disclosure of information concerning foreign nations can be made to various officials without court approval, with notification to the court afterwards. Disclosure of grand jury matters for judicial proceedings can be court approved. The Supreme Court limits disclosures of grand jury material to attorneys and employees assisting in the criminal process, with some exceptions for certain foreign and terrorist activities. Disclosure of grand jury matters for judicial proceedings can be court approved, with guidelines provided by the Supreme Court in United States v. Baggot. The Supreme Court restricts the disclosure of grand jury material to those involved in the criminal process. Disclosure for judicial proceedings must be directly related to identifiable litigation, not just potential future litigation. Baggot's criteria state that disclosure for purposes like a tax audit, unrelated to a judicial proceeding, is not permitted. The Supreme Court limits grand jury material disclosure to those in the criminal process. Disclosure for judicial proceedings must be directly linked to identifiable litigation, not potential future cases. Court-approved disclosures require a strong showing of particularized need, with petitioners needing to demonstrate the material is necessary to prevent injustice in another legal proceeding. The Supreme Court limits grand jury material disclosure to those in the criminal process, requiring a strong showing of particularized need. The district court has discretion to judge each case on its own facts, with the need for disclosure weighed against the need for continued secrecy. The disclosure of grand jury activities post-inquiry and discharge is less compelling, especially if criminal proceedings have concluded. Courts distinguish between requests for documents and witness transcripts, with a focus on the need for disclosure balanced against the risk of retaliation. Requests to disclose matters before the grand jury may be granted to resolve inconsistencies in witness testimony or refresh recollection. Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(ii) allows court-approved disclosure upon a defendant's request showing grounds for a motion to dismiss the indictment due to grand jury matters. Disclosure to another federal grand jury is permitted without court approval under Rule 6(e)(3)(C), removing the need for particularized need or court approval. The grand jury matters can be disclosed to state, military, or foreign enforcement authorities upon petition by the government attorney. A criminal defendant has the right to access their own grand jury testimony related to the charged crime. Additionally, the Jencks Act allows defendants to request and receive a copy of a witness' relevant grand jury testimony after trial. Congress has authorized disclosure of grand jury matters for enforcement of banking laws, including civil penalties for bank fraud and embezzlement. The disclosure of grand jury matters is limited and requires clear congressional intent. While certain provisions allow for sharing information with bank regulatory agencies, the general rule of secrecy must be upheld. Some courts have permitted disclosure in specific instances, but overall, the confidentiality of grand jury proceedings is protected. Some courts have allowed disclosure of grand jury matters under specific circumstances, even when Rule 6(e) would typically prevent it. Violations of grand jury secrecy can result in criminal or civil contempt, disciplinary actions, or court injunctions. Improper disclosure of grand jury matters may lead to disciplinary proceedings and potential violation of obstruction of justice laws. Convening a grand jury can result in four outcomes: indictment, no indictment, discharge without action, or submission of a report to the court. An indictment accuses a person of a specific crime with a detailed statement of the offense. An indictment must contain the elements of the offense charged and inform the defendant of the charge. A federal capital or infamous crime requires the concurrence of 12 jurors in an indictment. The grand jury decides to indict based on probable cause, with the defendant having the right to waive a grand jury in noncapital cases. Misdemeanors may or may not be tried by indictment. The grand jury has the authority to indict based on probable cause, but it is not obligated to do so. The prosecution can resubmit a case for reconsideration, and the grand jury can reexamine a matter even after prior deliberations. The defendant cannot complain if the grand jury chooses not to indict, and the process of sending forward \"reports\" or \"presentments\" is somewhat unclear. The grand jury has the authority to report on organized crime in special cases, but most federal grand juries do not have the express authority to issue reports. However, they may have common law authority to prepare reports under certain circumstances. The district court that empanels the grand jury has the discretion to determine whether the reports should be sealed, expunged, or disclosed based on factors such as the content of the report and the public interest. The court has the power to discharge a grand jury panel at any time within its term for any reason it sees fit, including balancing public interest against harm to individuals named, availability of remedies, and intrusion on state and local government prerogatives. Defendants can seek dismissal of indictments for grand jury irregularities, but success is rare unless the indictment fails to charge a federal crime. The courts are receptive to dismissal motions based on constitutional violations, such as indictments tainted by racial or sexual discrimination, immunized testimony, violations of privileges, evidence obtained illegally, or false testimony. Courts may dismiss a grand jury indictment for various reasons, including government misconduct, selective prosecution, vindictive retaliation, outrageous conduct, or unjustifiable delays. Unless there is a constitutional challenge, a valid indictment from a legally constituted grand jury is typically immune from dismissal. A valid indictment from a legally constituted grand jury is usually immune from dismissal, but the supervisory power can be used to dismiss an indictment for misconduct before the grand jury. The decision to dismiss an indictment is only appropriate if the violations substantially influenced the grand jury's decision to indict or if there is grave doubt that the decision was free from such influence. A district court may not dismiss an indictment for errors in grand jury proceedings unless such errors prejudiced the defendants. Timing is crucial, as a claim of prejudice based on grand jury irregularities may lose its force after a trial jury finds sufficient evidence to convict a defendant. The supervisory power to dismiss an indictment is limited and usually indictments will not be dismissed for various reasons such as failure to present favorable evidence, improper instruction on applicable law, or failure to advise a witness of their target status. The grand jury proceedings included errors such as the presentation of inaccurate evidence, breach of secrecy, unauthorized individuals present, hearsay evidence, and evidence obtained illegally. Additionally, there were issues with the indictment process and lack of all jurors hearing the evidence. The government may move for dismissal of an indictment under Rule 48(a) with the court's approval, but the court's authority to deny dismissal is limited to cases where it would go against the public interest. Dismissal at the government's request is usually without prejudice, allowing for reindictment unless certain legal barriers are present."
