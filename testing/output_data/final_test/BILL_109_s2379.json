    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new deduction for health and long-term care insurance costs for individuals without employer-subsidized health plans. This amendment adds a new section, 224, to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. In general, individuals can deduct the amount paid for medical care insurance for themselves, their spouse, and dependents. This deduction does not apply if the taxpayer or their spouse participates in an employer-sponsored health plan where the employer covers some or all of the costs. Employer contributions to cafeteria plans, flexible spending arrangements, Archer MSAs, and health savings accounts are excluded from gross income and treated as paid by the employer. Additionally, a health plan not described in the previous subparagraph shall be treated as such if all health plans of persons treated as a single employer. The text discusses how certain health plans are treated as a single employer under specific sections. It also mentions the separate application of health insurance and long-term care insurance. Additionally, it excludes subsection (a) from applying to coverage under certain federal programs. The text excludes any amount paid for coverage for an individual if they are already covered under specific medical care programs listed in various sections of the Social Security Act, United States Code, or the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. Exceptions apply for qualified long-term care. The text specifies that certain payments for coverage under a qualified long-term care insurance contract are exempt from a deduction. Additionally, continuation coverage under FEHBP that is comparable to coverage under section 4980B is also exempt. Only eligible long-term care premiums can be deducted for qualified long-term care insurance contracts, and deductions are not available for ancillary coverage premiums. Payments for vision care, specified illnesses, or hospitalization are not considered for deduction. Special rules apply for coordination with deductions for health insurance costs of self-employed individuals and medical expense deductions. Regulations will be prescribed for implementation, including requirements for employers to report to employees and the Secretary. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to allow a deduction for health and long-term care insurance costs. Various sections of the Code are amended to include this new deduction. Regulations will be implemented, requiring employers to report necessary information to employees and the Secretary. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to allow a deduction for health and long-term care insurance costs. The table of sections for part VII of subchapter B of chapter 1 of the Code is updated to reflect this new deduction. Sec. 224 allows a deduction for health and long-term care insurance costs, effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2006."
