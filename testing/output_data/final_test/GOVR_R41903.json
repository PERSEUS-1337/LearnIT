    "content": "Witnesses in federal criminal cases may be arrested, held for bail, and sometimes imprisoned until they testify, as per 18 U.S.C. 3144. This practice has been in place since the early days of the Republic and has not been directly challenged for constitutionality. The Supreme Court has acknowledged the importance of disclosing knowledge of crimes, allowing even innocent individuals to be detained as material witnesses without bail. The federal material witness statute allows for the arrest and detention of individuals who are both witnesses and suspects in a crime. The Supreme Court's decision in Ashcroft v. al-Kidd upheld the constitutionality of detaining material witnesses with a valid warrant, even if the arresting authority had an improper motive. The federal material witness statute is used regularly, especially in immigration offenses involving foreign nationals. Critics argue that since September 11, 2001, there have been abuses of the statute's authority, with seventy individuals, mostly Muslims, being arrested and detained. Justice Kennedy noted that the Court's ruling in Ashcroft v. al-Kidd is limited to the arguments presented and does not resolve the legality of the Government's use of the statute in this case. The federal material witness statute allows for the arrest and detention of individuals if their testimony is crucial in a criminal proceeding and it may be impractical to secure their presence by subpoena. No witness can be detained if their testimony can be obtained through deposition, and release may be delayed until a deposition can be taken. Critics argue that there have been abuses of this statute's authority, especially since September 11, 2001, with many individuals, mostly Muslims, being arrested and detained. Justice Kennedy noted that the legality of the Government's use of the statute in these cases remains unresolved. An arrest warrant for a witness with material evidence in a federal criminal proceeding can be issued by federal or state judges. Section 3144 allows arrest at the request of any party in a criminal trial, but its application in grand jury proceedings is less clear. The purpose of this statute is to preserve evidence for criminal proceedings. The government may seek a section 3144 arrest warrant for grand jury witnesses if it's impracticable to secure their attendance with a subpoena. The term \"material\" evidence is not clearly defined, but it generally refers to evidence that can influence a decision. The government can obtain a material witness arrest warrant for grand jury witnesses if it's impractical to secure their attendance with a subpoena. Probable cause must be shown that the witness can provide material evidence and that relying on a subpoena is impractical. The federal bail laws apply to material witnesses arrested under section 3144, with an escalating system favoring release, followed by release with conditions, and detention as a last option. Arrested material witnesses are entitled to counsel during bail proceedings and may be appointed an attorney if unable to retain one. Evidence of difficulty serving a grand jury witness may not always justify an arrest warrant issuance. A defendant or material witness may be released on personal recognizance or bond, with the court considering factors like deposition, character, health, and community ties. If unable to comply with release conditions, a material witness may be detained unless their testimony can be secured by deposition. The federal bail laws prioritize release, followed by release with conditions, and detention as a last resort for material witnesses. The federal deposition rule allows a detained material witness to request their deposition to secure their release if further detention is not necessary to prevent a failure of justice. The court must order the deposition and prompt release upon a showing that the testimony can be adequately secured by deposition. The release of a witness following the taking of their deposition may deny a defendant the benefit of favorable testimony. A request for a witness' deposition must show \"exceptional circumstances\" and be in the \"interest of justice.\" The court may authorize depositions to be taken sua sponte to release a detained material witness. The government must periodically report to the court on the justification for holding a material witness in custody. The witness is entitled to daily fees while in custody and may receive transportation and subsistence upon release. Failure to appear after release may result in prosecution, especially if it involves avoiding testifying in a felony case. Witnesses at Congressional hearings have raised concerns about the authority under 18. Following September 11, 2001, the authority under 18 U.S.C. 3144 was misused to indefinitely incarcerate possible terrorist suspects, avoiding constitutional protections such as probable cause and time-limited detention. Witnesses were held in solitary confinement, interrogated without counsel, and often not brought before a grand jury or court. The government has apologized for wrongful arrests in some cases. The government has apologized for arresting the \"wrong guy\" in cases where material witnesses were victims of federal investigators and attorneys jumping to wrong conclusions. The Justice Department stated that the material witness statute is a long-standing law, not a creation of the USA PATRIOT Act, and witnesses are usually released after testimony. H.R. 3199 aimed to amend the USA PATRIOT Act for periodic review of its exercise. The proposed amendment to the USA PATRIOT Act aimed to add responsibilities to the Justice Department Inspector General's designee, including reviewing detentions under section 3144 of title 18, United States Code. The proposed amendment to the USA PATRIOT Act aimed to add responsibilities to the Justice Department Inspector General's designee, including reviewing detentions under section 3144 of title 18, United States Code. The provision to report twice a year on implementation to the Judiciary Committees was dropped from the bill before House passage. No similar provision was found in the Senate-approved bill or the final enacted legislation. Senator Leahy introduced S. 1739 to rewrite section 3144, establishing a preference for postponing arrest of material witnesses. The proposed amendment to the USA PATRIOT Act includes provisions for material witness warrants, such as limiting detention to 5-day increments for a maximum of 30 days, requiring an initial judicial appearance without delay, and mandating the Attorney General to report annually on the number of warrants sought and granted. The existing statute prohibits the detention of material witnesses if their testimony can be secured by deposition and further detention is not necessary to prevent a failure of justice. The proposed amendment to the USA PATRIOT Act would eliminate the reporting requirement for material witnesses held in custody for more than 10 days. The 109th Congress did not take further action on legislative proposals to amend section 3144, which deals with the arrest of material witnesses in criminal proceedings. If a witness's testimony is crucial and they cannot be subpoenaed, a judicial officer may order their arrest. However, a material witness cannot be detained if their testimony can be secured by deposition, and further detention is unnecessary to prevent a failure of justice. Release of a material witness may be delayed until their deposition can be taken, as further detention is not needed to prevent a failure of justice."
