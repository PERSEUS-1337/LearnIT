The Secretary of Defense, with input from the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury, can waive the limitation on procuring goods or services from individuals supporting covered Iranian persons if it is deemed important to national security. The waiver must be justified and notified to Congress at least 30 days prior to taking effect.
