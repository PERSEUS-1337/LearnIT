Each State notified can submit a proposal within a specified period for public comment. The Secretary provides guidance to states during the preparation of these proposed actions. The Secretary must approve or disapprove proposed State Protective Actions within 45 days of submission. If disapproved, written comments must be provided explaining the reasons for the decision.

The Secretary may revoke approval of a State Protective Action if the State fails to implement the action or if the action does not make measurable progress towards achieving recovery criteria for the population. The Secretary can also terminate the effectiveness of a State Protective Action if necessary.
