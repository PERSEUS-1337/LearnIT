    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pacific Defenders of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act\". Congress finds that Guam and Wake Island were captured by Imperial Japanese forces during World War II, leading to atrocities against prisoners. Major General Edward King led the defense of the Bataan peninsula until April 9, 1942. Major General King surrendered soldiers from the United States and the Commonwealth of the Philippines into enemy hands on April 9, 1942. The soldiers were then forced to march 65 miles without food, water, or medical care in the Bataan Death March, resulting in the deaths of many. Lieutenant General Wainwright surrendered the remaining troops on Corregidor Island on May 6, 1942. In May 1942, 11,000 troops on Corregidor Island surrendered to the Japanese after fighting from April 29 to May 9. 1,600 more US prisoners died at Camp O'Donnell due to poor conditions. The Japanese started transferring prisoners of war to various locations by sea. During World War II, Allied prisoners of war were transported by sea to various locations in Asia under harsh conditions. Many prisoners died from asphyxia, starvation, and dysentery on overcrowded cargo ships known as the hell ships. More than 126,000 prisoners were transported on 156 voyages, with over 21,000 Americans killed or injured. In June 1942, 6,000 US prisoners were transferred to Cabanatuan for hard labor. During World War II, Allied prisoners of war were subjected to harsh conditions, including hard labor and mistreatment. The Santo Tomas Internment Camp in Manila housed 3,000 Armed Forces members who suffered from disease, starvation, and abuse. The camp also held United States Army and Navy nurses, known as \"the Angels of Bataan and Corregidor,\" who continued to serve despite being imprisoned. Operation Blacklist was initiated in 1945 to locate and repatriate all prisoners of war. The prisoners of war from World War II were honored for their courage and perseverance during captivity under brutal conditions. The people of the United States are forever grateful for their sacrifice and loyalty. The prisoners of war from World War II were honored with a Congressional Gold Medal for their courage and perseverance during captivity under brutal conditions. The Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate will arrange for the presentation of a gold medal to honor members of the Armed Forces who fought in defense of Guam, Wake Island, and the Philippine archipelago during World War II. The medal will recognize those who died or were imprisoned by the Japanese military in various locations until September 2, 1945. The Secretary of the Treasury will design and strike the medal, and arrangements will be made for the transfer and display of the medals. Following the presentation of the gold medal to honor members of the Armed Forces who fought in World War II, it will be given to the Smithsonian Institution for display and research. Congress suggests that the medal should also be displayed at other locations associated with the honored individuals. The Secretary is authorized to produce and sell bronze duplicates of the gold medal at a price covering all expenses. The medals created under this Act are considered national medals according to the United States Code."
