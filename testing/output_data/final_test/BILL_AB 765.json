    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature finds that teachers in state-funded child development programs are denied living wages, contributing to the gender pay gap. Nonprofit agencies struggle to provide health insurance, leading to program closures. Inadequate reimbursement rates and lack of cost-of-living adjustments have decreased buying power by 22% since 1980. The Legislature aims to provide state-funded child development programs with annual cost-of-living adjustments equal to those given to K\u201312 education programs. They also seek to eliminate gender pay inequity, ensure high educational standards, and retain skilled teachers by increasing the standard reimbursement rate. The Superintendent is required to establish standards and reimbursement rates for child development programs, taking into account program length and service hours. Parent fees will cover additional services costs, and the Superintendent must consult with applicant agencies when setting rates. The reimbursement system must be approved by the Joint Legislative Budget Committee, and the Superintendent can create regulations for service conditions and enrollment hours. The standard reimbursement rate for child development programs is $9,024.75 per unit of average daily enrollment for a 250-day year, with annual cost-of-living adjustments. It does not cover mandated costs related to minimum wage, health insurance, fees, program requirements, or other legislative actions. The standard reimbursement rate for child development programs will be increased to provide a living wage, health insurance, and retirement benefits for employees, support recruitment and retention of teachers, ensure program stability and quality, and achieve gender pay equity. Cost-of-living adjustments will be made annually to maintain buying power. Agencies with rates above the standard will need to reduce costs incrementally to meet the new standard. The plan allows for adjusting reimbursement rates on a case-by-case basis to maintain service levels for agencies below the standard rate. Increases are based on loss of resources, local child care rates, increased costs, and documented needs to maintain services. Priority is given to agencies with the lowest rates. Expansion of child development programs is limited to the standard reimbursement rate. The Superintendent may reduce the percentage of reduction for a public agency serving more than 400 children, with a collective bargaining agreement, or other extenuating circumstances determined by the Superintendent."
