    "content": "The Act titled \"Beaches Environmental Assessment, Closure, and Health Act of 1999\" is referred to as the short title. The purpose and findings of the Act are outlined in section 2. Congress finds that the Nation's beaches and coastal recreation waters are valuable public resources used for recreation by millions of people annually, hosting out-of-State and international visitors. Tourism in the coastal zone generates billions of dollars annually, but pollution in coastal waters is not restricted by political boundaries. The environmental quality of coastal waters has declined due to increased population and urbanization in the watershed, with varying levels of protection provided by different coastal States. The Act aims to establish consistent criteria and procedures for monitoring coastal recreation waters to protect public health and safety. It also emphasizes the need to address exceedances of these criteria to eliminate sources of pollution and improve environmental quality. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include Title VII - Beach and Coastal Recreation Water Quality. Definitions for coastal recreation waters and floatable materials are provided. \"SEC. 702. ADOPTION OF COASTAL RECREATIONAL WATER QUALITY CRITERIA BY STATES.\" States must adopt water quality criteria for coastal recreation waters consistent with EPA guidelines within 3.5 years of the enactment of this title. Failure to comply will result in the EPA's criteria becoming enforceable. The EPA's water quality criteria for coastal recreational waters must be adopted by states within 3.5 years, or the EPA's criteria will become enforceable. Criteria issued by the Administrator under section 304(a)(1) will apply as the water quality criteria for coastal recreational waters for the State. \"SEC. 703. REVISIONS TO WATER QUALITY CRITERIA.\" The Administrator will conduct studies in cooperation with the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere to provide additional information on potential human health risks from coastal recreation waters, indicators for detecting harmful pathogens, and methods for accurate and timely testing. The Administrator will issue revised water quality criteria for pathogens in coastal recreation waters harmful to human health, including indicators and testing methods, based on studies conducted in cooperation with the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere. The Administrator will issue revised water quality criteria for pathogens in coastal recreation waters, including a list of indicators and testing methods, to be reviewed and revised at least once every 5 years. \"SEC. 704. COASTAL BEACH WATER QUALITY MONITORING.\" The Administrator will publish regulations within 18 months for States to monitor coastal recreation waters and beaches for water quality compliance and public safety. Monitoring requirements will include methods, frequency, and locations based on recreational use periods, extent of use, proximity to pollution sources, and storm events. The Administrator will publish regulations for States to monitor coastal recreation waters for water quality compliance and public safety, including detecting harmful pathogens and exempting certain areas from monitoring requirements. States must provide prompt notification to local governments and the public. The notification of an exceedance of water quality criteria for State coastal recreation waters must include prompt communication of the occurrence, nature, extent, location, and substances to local governments. Signs must be posted to notify the public during the exceedance period. The Administrator must periodically review and revise regulations related to water quality criteria exceedances, with states required to implement monitoring and notification programs in accordance with these regulations within specific timeframes. The Administrator will establish core performance measures for testing, monitoring, and notification programs, delegating responsibilities to local government authorities. State resources will be available for program implementation if delegated authority follows Administrator's guidance. Additionally, the Administrator will assist States in implementing uniform monitoring procedures for floatable materials. The Administrator will establish uniform assessment and monitoring procedures for floatable materials in coastal recreation waters. They will also create a national coastal recreation water pollution occurrence database and list communities complying with regulations. The Administrator will submit a report to Congress every 4 years with recommendations for improving coastal recreation water quality and evaluating State implementation efforts. Additionally, grants will be provided to States. The Administrator may make grants to States for fulfilling requirements under sections 702 and 704, with a cost-sharing limit of 50%. Grants will only be given to States demonstrating implementation of monitoring and notification programs. Authorization of appropriations is outlined in section 707. Authorization of appropriations for grants to States under section 706 is set at $9,000,000 for each fiscal year 2000 through 2004, with an additional $3,000,000 allocated for other provisions of this title during the same period."
