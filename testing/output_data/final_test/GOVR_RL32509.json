Deadlines for submission were set at the beginning of each regular session of Congress. The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 mandated the President to submit annual budget proposals to Congress, with deadlines set at the start of each regular session. Over time, the deadline for budget submission was changed several times, with the current law requiring submission between January and February. As the federal budget grew in size and complexity, Congress sought more detailed and updated budget information from the President. The House Rules Committee emphasized the need for improved budgetary information to effectively analyze the President's program and forecast government expenditure and revenue levels. The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 made changes to the federal budget process in response to Congress's request for more detailed information. The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 made changes to the federal budget process by requiring the President's budget to cover not just the upcoming fiscal year but also the four ensuing fiscal years. Additionally, the act mandates a mid-session review of the budget to be submitted to Congress. The mid-session review deadline was changed to July 15 due to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 enforced deficit targets for the annual budget and mid-session review. BBEDCA extended the same constraint to the preparation of the mid-session review, which must include substantial changes in estimates, obligations imposed after budget submission, current information on budget matters, and additional information deemed advisable by the President. The content and structure of the mid-session review have varied by President, typically including technical re-estimates and updates. The President's mid-session review may include optional elements such as technical re-estimates, updates to economic assumptions, changes to Treasury condition, revised summary tables, and discussion of potential effects of appropriations. Changes to budget authority requested must be accompanied by supporting information. The mid-session review may include discussion of pending budgetary reforms, legislative proposals, and administration initiatives. Presidents have submitted mid-session reviews on time and late since FY1973. Controversy has occasionally surfaced. Controversy has occasionally surfaced regarding the timing of mid-session review submissions to Congress. Table 1 shows submission timing for FY1973-FY2017, with an average delay of 7.80 days. The deadline for FY1973-FY1975 was June 1. The deadline for the mid-session review submission was changed from June 1 to July 15 by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The review was often submitted late, with an average delay of 8 days, ranging from 1 to 52 days. When late, it was delayed by an average of three weeks. In 22 out of 45 years, the review was submitted on time or early. The mid-session review deadline was changed to July 15 by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Submissions were often delayed, with an average delay of 8 days. In some instances, the review was submitted just before the deadline, while in others, it was submitted weeks in advance. Delays of more than three weeks occurred on nine occasions between FY1985 and FY2012 under different administrations. During the Reagan Administration, mid-session reviews were often delayed, with submissions between 22 and 46 days late for four consecutive years. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Reaffirmation Act of 1987 was enacted to address the growing deficits and budgetary gridlock. Title I of P.L. 100-119 amended the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to modify the sequestration process. A requirement was added for the President to include preliminary sequestration estimates in the mid-session review for the fiscal year. The Director of OMB must deliver this mid-session report by July 15 to ensure accurate deficit reduction calculations. The sequestration process was modified by Title I of P.L. 100-119, requiring the President to include preliminary sequestration estimates in the mid-session review for the fiscal year. This change led to improved submission records starting from FY1989. President Reagan's mid-session review for that year was 13 days late, but the submission record improved during the George H. W. Bush Administration. The requirement under the 1985 Balanced Budget Act was effective for three years but was terminated under the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990. The Clinton Administration delayed the submission of the mid-session review for FY1994 to reflect the impact of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. President Clinton signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 into law on August 10 (as P.L. 103-66) and transmitted the mid-session review for FY1994 to Congress on September 1, 48 days late. This stirred controversy in Congress as some Members wanted an updated assessment of the budgetary situation before voting on the conference report. Senator Domenici's amendment, which was tabled by the Senate, emphasized the importance of timely submission of the supplementary budget as required by law. President Clinton's mid-session review for FY1998 was delayed until September 5, 1997, the longest delay in over 25 years. Unlike the controversy surrounding the FY1994 review, the delay for FY1998 was not contentious. In May 1997, an agreement was reached to balance the budget by FY2002, and President Clinton signed two reconciliation acts into law on August 5. President Clinton signed two reconciliation acts into law on August 5, implementing balanced-budget policies that resulted in $247 billion in savings over five years. President George W. Bush submitted a transition budget for FY2002 in April, recommending a $1.6 trillion tax cut over 10 years while preserving the Social Security surplus. In May, Congress adopted the budget resolution for FY2002, affirming a commitment to a smaller tax cut and preserving the Social Security surplus. The on-budget surplus was estimated to be $30 billion for FY2001 and $48 billion for FY2002. A revenue reconciliation measure providing the recommended tax cuts was signed into law by President Bush on June 7. The FY2002 mid-session review, issued on August 22, showed a drop in on-budget surpluses for FY2001 and FY2002 to $1 billion each due to unexpected economic weakness. This led to significant reductions in funds available for defense spending and other priorities, creating tighter budget constraints for completing FY2002 appropriations before the fiscal year began on October 1. The FY2009 deficit estimate was reduced in the May budget submission, with a decrease in the financial stabilization reserve placeholder but an increase in the FY2010 deficit estimate. President Obama's budget proposal for FY2010 was delayed due to the presidential transition year and rapidly changing economic conditions. Some Members believed the delay in the mid-session review submission was an attempt to withhold unfavorable information. The FY2012 mid-session review, submitted after the Budget Control Act of 2011, projected lower deficits for FY2012 and the following 9 years. It reflected changes resulting from the legislation and efforts to withhold unfavorable economic news. The mid-session review for FY1999, submitted early by President Clinton, revised deficit estimates to a surplus of $39 billion, sparking congressional interest in addressing surpluses in the following years. President Clinton's mid-session review for FY1999 showed a surplus of $39 billion, leading to congressional interest in tax-cut legislation. Clinton suggested reserving the surplus for Social Security changes. Some believe he used the budget news to strengthen his position in negotiations with Congress. President must submit a supplemental budget summary to Congress before July 16 each year. The President must provide Congress with detailed information on expenditures, obligations, and financial conditions of the government for the current and future fiscal years. This includes estimated expenditures for authorized programs and balances carried over from previous years. The submission must be made before July 16 each year. The President must provide Congress with a statement of changes in budget authority, estimated outlays, and receipts for the fiscal year, based on current information. This includes the effect of changes on the information submitted under section 1105 and supporting information as practicable. The submission must be made before July 16 and is subject to the same rules as the budget submitted under section 1105."
