    "content": "The Act titled \"Critical Access to Health Information Technology Act of 2005\" establishes a Health Information Technology Grant Program. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a program to award grants for improving health information technology in rural areas. Grants will be awarded to States to carry out State plans and subgrants will be given to local entities. Grant amounts are based on the number of critical access hospitals in each State. The State receiving a grant must designate a lead agency to administer financial assistance, develop the State plan, and coordinate funds with other health care programs. To be eligible for the grant, the State must establish a State plan. The State plan must identify the lead agency, use funds for health information technology and administrative costs, ensure benefits statewide, and consult with hospital associations on fund usage. Local grants are awarded competitively by the lead agency using grant funds. Local grants are awarded competitively based on selection criteria including the need for health information improvement and serving low-income or medically underserved communities. Eligible entities must be government-owned or private nonprofit hospitals. The critical access hospital in a rural area must submit an application to the state lead agency detailing how the grant funds will be used and providing necessary information for selection criteria. The agency may require applicants to apply selection criteria, set measurable objectives for fund use, evaluate activity effectiveness, maintain records, cooperate with oversight, plan for sustainability, and provide necessary information and assurances. An entity receiving a local grant must use the funds to offset costs related to clinical health care information systems and health information technology after December 31, 2005, to improve healthcare quality and patient safety. Additionally, the funds can be used to enable health information technology for the collection and use of clinical data. The local grant funds are used to offset costs for clinical health care information systems and technology to improve healthcare quality and patient safety. Eligible costs include purchasing, leasing, and installing computer software and hardware, as well as making improvements to existing technology. The local grant funds can be used for purchasing, leasing, and implementing computer software and hardware, as well as providing education and training on information systems and technology to improve patient safety and quality of care. The local grant funds can be used for integrating clinical decision support tools that combine patient-specific data with national treatment guidelines, allowing providers to track improvement rates. The grant limit is $250,000. The lead agency of a State receiving the grant must report annually on amounts received and allocated to State recipients. The Secretary reviews State compliance with grant requirements, including allocation amounts, expenditure breakdowns, and monitoring effectiveness. If a State fails to comply with the plan or grant requirements, the Secretary notifies the lead agency and stops further payments after a hearing. The provisions of this section preempt applicable Federal and State procurement laws for health information technology purchased under this section. Amounts appropriated under this section are in addition to other Federal program grants for rural hospitals. $10,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2006 to 2008. SEC. 3. REPLACEMENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will replace ICD-9-CM with ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS by October 1, 2006. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will ensure the implementation of the ICD-10-PCS by October 1, 2009, upgrading HIPAA transactions and NCPDP Telecommunications Standards to newer versions. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has the authority to adopt standards for electronic health care transactions recommended by the Accredited Standards Committee X12 in relation to the transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS. The Secretary must issue a Notice of Intent within 30 days of the enactment of the Act regarding the adoption of these standards. The adoption of HIPAA transactions version 5010, NCPDP Telecommunications Standards version 5.1, and ICD-10-CM/ICD-10-PCS must occur by specific dates for compliance with transactions after those dates. Covered entities and health technology vendors must adhere to these rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 mandates the updating of new versions and editions, ensuring prompt availability of procedure codes until ICD-9-CM is replaced by ICD-10-PCS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must adopt modifications without a recommendation from the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 requires the adoption of new procedure codes before the transition to ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS on October 1, 2009. The rule promulgated under subsection (a) is not subject to judicial review and applies to transactions after October 1, 2009. This section does not affect the application of other classification methodologies or codes like CPT and HCPCS. The Department of Health and Human Services distributes codes not covered by the International Statistical Classification of Disease and Related Health Problems."
