    "content": "Certain socioeconomic activities such as transportation, communications, banking, and electricity supply are crucial for the country's functioning and security. Disruptions in these activities, along with specialized functions like intelligence gathering, could have a significant impact on national well-being. These activities are supported by critical infrastructures that are complex and interconnected, making them vulnerable to disruptions from various factors. The report discusses the vulnerabilities of critical infrastructures to disruptions caused by various factors such as poor design, natural disasters, and intentional human actions. The need to reexamine protections in light of terrorist threats, following the events of September 11, 2001, is highlighted. The report tracks the evolution of critical infrastructure protection policies but does not delve into specific protections for individual infrastructures. The report discusses the vulnerabilities of critical infrastructures to disruptions caused by various factors such as poor design, natural disasters, and intentional human actions. It highlights the need to reexamine protections in light of terrorist threats post-9/11. Federal executive documents and legislation outline a policy and strategy for protecting critical infrastructure, defined as systems vital to national security and economic well-being. Presidential Policy Directive/PPD-21 emphasizes strengthening security and resilience against physical and cyber threats. The federal government collaborates with states, localities, and critical infrastructure owners to identify and assess vulnerabilities to threats. Owners and operators are primarily responsible for protection, response, and recovery, but the government can intervene if necessary. The federal government collaborates with states, localities, and critical infrastructure owners to identify and assess vulnerabilities to threats. In areas where owners are unable or unwilling to provide adequate protection, the government may intervene. The President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection was established in July 1996 to address cyber threats and recommend a national policy for protecting critical infrastructures. The President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection (PCCIP) released a report to President Clinton in October 1997, highlighting the need for action in cybersecurity due to the growing population of computer-literate individuals and vulnerabilities in computer networks. The Commission recommended greater cooperation between the private sector and government to address these threats. The President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection emphasized the importance of collaboration between the private sector and government in cybersecurity. The government's role is to provide information on intrusion techniques and defense strategies, while the private sector owns and operates critical infrastructure. The Commission proposed establishing a top-level policy-making office, a council with corporate executives and government officials, information clearinghouses, attack warning capabilities, awareness programs, and legal support for assurance measures. The Commission's report recommended streamlining legal structures to support assurance measures and expanding research in technologies for intrusion detection. Presidential Decision Directive No. 63 set a national goal to protect critical infrastructure from attacks by 2003, with interruptions being brief, infrequent, manageable, geographically isolated, and minimally detrimental to the US welfare. Presidential Decision Directive No. 63 (PDD-63) identified critical infrastructures in the United States that should be protected, including information and communications, banking and finance, water supply, transportation, emergency services, public health, and energy production. Lead agencies were assigned to each sector to appoint Sector Liaison Officials to work with the private sector in enhancing security measures. The PDD-63 assigned duties to the National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter-terrorism, who reported to the President through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. The National Coordinator chaired the Critical Infrastructure Coordination Group, the primary interagency working group for developing and implementing policy and coordinating the federal government's internal security efforts. The PDD-63 established the Critical Infrastructure Coordination Group to develop and implement policy for securing critical infrastructure. Each federal agency had to designate a Critical Infrastructure Assurance Officer (CIAO) responsible for securing critical infrastructure assets. Agencies had 180 days to develop plans, to be fully implemented within two years and updated every two years. The PDD-63 established the Critical Infrastructure Coordination Group and required federal agencies to designate a Critical Infrastructure Assurance Officer. Plans were to be implemented within two years and updated every two years. A National Infrastructure Assurance Council was set up, including private operators and government officials. The Council would meet periodically and provide reports to the President. The National Coordinator would act as the Executive Director. The PDD also called for a National Infrastructure Assurance Plan, integrating plans from various sectors and addressing vulnerability assessments, remedial plans, warning requirements, response strategies, reconstitution of services, education programs, and research needs. The PDD established the Critical Infrastructure Coordination Group and required federal agencies to designate a Critical Infrastructure Assurance Officer. Plans were to be implemented within two years and updated every two years. A National Infrastructure Assurance Council was set up, including private operators and government officials. The Council would meet periodically and provide reports to the President. The National Coordinator would act as the Executive Director. The PDD also called for a National Infrastructure Assurance Plan, integrating plans from various sectors and addressing vulnerability assessments, remedial plans, warning requirements, response strategies, reconstitution of services, education programs, and research needs. Additionally, the PDD set up a National Plan Coordination Staff to support the plan's development. The Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office (CIAO) was established to integrate sectoral plans into a National Plan, support individual agencies in developing their internal plans, coordinate national education and awareness programs, and provide legislative and public affairs support. The National Plan, now under the Department of Homeland Security IPIS program, established policy-making bodies and addressed cybersecurity concerns. It called for a national capability to detect and respond to cyberattacks in progress, proposed FIDNET and FedCIRC, and gave the FBI authority to expand computer crime capabilities into the NIPC. The Directive established the NIPC as the focal point for federal threat assessment, vulnerability analysis, early warning capability, and response coordination. Agencies were required to share information about threats and attacks on infrastructure, with the NIPC serving as the conduit for information sharing with the private sector. The FBI established INFRAGARD to interact with private sector firms for information exchange on network security, expanding to include cyber and physical security after September 11. Each FBI field office has a Special Agent Coordinator who forms chapters with interested companies from various industries. Any company can join INFRAGARD, which is geographically oriented. INFRAGARD allows companies of all sizes and industries to join local chapters for information sharing and contingency planning in case of cyber attacks. The program was initially under the NIPC before being managed by the FBI's Cyber Division. The FBI also had the Key Assets Initiative (KAI) since the 1980s to enhance physical and cyber protection. The program for critical infrastructure protection was expanded to include cyber dimension and is now managed by the Department of Homeland Security. The Bush Administration reviewed options for overseeing this protection, continuing support from the Clinton Administration. The Bush Administration streamlined the National Security Council by consolidating responsibilities into Policy Coordination Committees. There was a debate on whether the NSC should remain the focal point for coordinating critical infrastructure protection. Richard Clarke advocated transferring this function directly to the White House. Another debate revolved around establishing a government-wide Chief Information Officer. The Bush Administration considered creating a government-wide Chief Information Officer (CIO) to oversee federal non-national security computer systems and collaborate with the private sector. However, they decided against it and opted for a Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget to oversee agency CIOs. Additionally, there was a proposal to establish a National Homeland Security Agency by expanding the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) with the Coast Guard, Border Patrol, and Customs. The Hart/Rudman Commission recommended expanding FEMA to include the Coast Guard, Border Patrol, and Customs Service, with a directorate for critical infrastructure protection. Despite initial resistance from the Clinton and Bush Administrations, Congress introduced bills to establish such an agency. In June 2002, the Bush Administration proposed a new department similar to the Commission's recommendation. After the 9/11 attacks, President Bush signed Executive Orders related to critical infrastructure protection, later amended due to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. E.O. 13228, signed in October 2001, established the Office of... E.O. 13228, signed in October 2001, established the Office of Homeland Security to develop a national strategy for securing the US from terrorist threats. It coordinated efforts to protect critical infrastructure and ensure rapid restoration after a terrorist attack. The Office of Homeland Security was established by E.O. 13228 in October 2001 to develop a national strategy for securing the US from terrorist threats. Many functions of the Office were later transferred to the Department of Homeland Security. The Homeland Security Council, consisting of key officials, advises the President on homeland security matters. The Executive Orders amended the Office of Homeland Security, adding the Secretary of Homeland Security to the Council. E.O. 13231 established U.S. policy to protect critical infrastructure and created the President's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board. The President's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board, consisting of federal officials, was established to recommend policies and coordinate programs for protecting information systems for critical infrastructure. Chaired by a Special Advisor to the President for Cyberspace Security, the Board proposed a National Plan and reviewed agency budgets related to its purview in coordination with the Office of Homeland Security. The Special Advisor, reporting to both the Assistant to the President for National Security and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, proposed policies and programs to protect the nation's information infrastructure. The E.O. 13231 established the National Infrastructure Advisory Council to advise the President on information system security for critical infrastructure. Subsequent amendments abolished the President's Board and Special Advisor positions, with the Advisory Council now reporting to the President through the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Office of Homeland Security released a National Strategy for Homeland Security in July 2002. The National Strategy for Homeland Security, released in July 2002, identified protecting critical infrastructures and key assets as a key mission area. It expanded the list of sectors to include public health, the chemical industry, postal and shipping, defense industrial base, and agriculture. Additionally, it added continuity of government and operations to the list and combined emergency fire service, law enforcement, and medicine as emergency services. The National Strategy for Homeland Security in July 2002 identified critical infrastructures and key assets as key mission areas. It reassigned sectors to different agencies, introduced key assets, and emphasized working with the private sector and non-federal entities. The National Strategy for Homeland Security in July 2002 focused on critical infrastructures and key assets, emphasizing collaboration with the private sector and non-federal entities. It outlined activities such as working with the private sector, assessing vulnerabilities, and developing a national plan. The Strategy also highlighted the need to prioritize assets based on their criticality and balance security costs with benefits. The Strategy did not create new organizations but anticipated the establishment of a Department of Homeland Security. It was updated in October 2007 with minor changes related to improving resilience. Additionally, in December 2003, the Bush Administration released Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7). In 2003, the Bush Administration released Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7), updating the policy and roles of agencies in critical infrastructure protection. The Directive emphasized the Secretary of Homeland Security's coordination role and Sector-Specific Agencies' responsibilities in identifying and prioritizing protective measures. It also outlined the expanded critical infrastructures and key assets, as well as the relationship between the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies. The Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 outlined the roles of agencies in critical infrastructure protection. It established the Department of Homeland Security's cybersecurity unit and the responsibility of the Office of Management for government-wide information security programs. The Department of Homeland Security is responsible for transportation security, while the Department of Transportation controls the national air space system. The Directive also created the Critical Infrastructure Protection Policy Coordinating Committee to advise on infrastructure security policy. The Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 assigned the Department of Homeland Security as the Lead Agency for the chemical and hazardous materials sector. It required Lead Agencies to report annually on their efforts with the private sector and mandated federal agencies to develop plans to protect critical infrastructure by July 2004. In 2013, Presidential Policy Directive 21 superseded HSPD-7, focusing on Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience. The evolution of critical infrastructure protection policies, based on PDD-63, aims to safeguard infrastructures crucial for people, economy, government services, national security, and national morale. The goal is to minimize disruptions, especially those causing significant casualties, by collaborating with private sector owners and operators. The government established an interagency group to coordinate critical infrastructure protection policies, with certain agencies assigned to specific sectors. A Council was formed to advise the President, and operational units like the CIAO and elements of the National Infrastructure Protection Center were later moved to the Department of Homeland Security for better coordination. The Undersecretary for National Protection and Programs is now responsible for implementing these policies. The Department of Homeland Security plays a more active role in identifying critical assets, assessing vulnerabilities, and recommending protective measures. There is a greater focus on physical threats post-September 11, leading to some debate and organizational instability initially. The early executive orders segregated cybersecurity from the physical security mission. The Obama Administration continued many of the homeland security policies from the Bush Administration, including a review of the White House security structures. President Obama merged the Homeland Security Council and the National Security Council staff into the National Security Staff while maintaining the independence of the two councils. The Obama administration merged the Homeland Security Council and the National Security Council staff into the National Security Staff, while maintaining their independence. A review of federal cybersecurity policies was ordered, leading to the appointment of a White House official to coordinate cybersecurity activities. Proposed legislation in 2012 aimed to enhance cybersecurity, including a regulatory framework for critical infrastructure sites. The Obama Administration proposed cybersecurity legislation in 2012, but it did not become law. Instead, Executive Order 13636 was issued in February 2013, focusing on information sharing and developing a cybersecurity framework for critical infrastructure. The Executive Order issued in February 2013 directed key government officials to produce reports on cyber threats to the U.S. homeland and expanded the Enhanced Cybersecurity Services program to all critical infrastructure sectors. It also defined a cybersecurity framework for infrastructure owners and operators to reduce risks. The Executive Order issued in February 2013 directed government officials to develop a cybersecurity framework for critical infrastructure. Agencies were instructed to review their cybersecurity regulations and consider adopting the framework's standards. Bills addressing cybersecurity issues were introduced in the 113th Congress. In the 113th Congress, several cybersecurity bills were passed, amending laws such as the Federal Information Security Management Act and establishing the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center. However, issues regarding information sharing between the government and private sector remained unresolved. In response, the Obama Administration issued Executive Order 13691 in February 2015 to promote private sector cybersecurity. In 2015, Executive Order 13691 was issued to promote private sector cybersecurity information sharing. The order assigned the Secretary of DHS to support the establishment of Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs) and authorized the creation of an ISAO Standards Organization. The NCCIC was designated as a critical infrastructure protection program to facilitate cybersecurity information sharing between the federal government and ISAOs. Bills addressing legal barriers to information sharing were introduced in the 114th Congress. In the 114th Congress, legal barriers to information sharing were addressed with the introduction of PPD-21, which focused on Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience. This directive called for an evaluation of the public-private partnership model, identification of data requirements for efficient information exchange, development of situational awareness capabilities, and updates to the National Infrastructure Protection Plan and Research and Development Plan for Critical Infrastructure. PPD-21, introduced in the 114th Congress, focused on Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience. It reflected an increased interest in resilience and an all-hazard approach in critical infrastructure policy. The directive updated sector designations and gave energy and communications sectors a higher profile. It required the National Infrastructure Protection Plan to focus on the reliance of other sectors on energy and communications infrastructure. The Obama Administration has maintained or slowly expanded policies governing physical security. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with a focus on preventing terrorist attacks and responding to them. It consolidated various agencies with homeland security functions. The act also emphasized expanding cybersecurity policies for critical infrastructure protection. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Department of Homeland Security, focusing on preventing and responding to terrorist attacks. It integrated various agencies for critical infrastructure protection, including NIPC, CIAO, FedCIRC, NISAC, DOE energy security, and NCS, under the IA/IP Directorate. TSA and Coast Guard were placed in separate directorates. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Department of Homeland Security, integrating various agencies for critical infrastructure protection under the IA/IP Directorate. The act assigned the rank of Undersecretary to the head of each Directorate, including TSA and Coast Guard. Responsibilities of the IA/IP Directorate included analyzing information to identify terrorist threats, assessing vulnerabilities of key resources, and determining risks posed by attacks. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Department of Homeland Security, integrating various agencies for critical infrastructure protection. The act assigned Undersecretaries to head different Directorates, including TSA and Coast Guard. The IA/IP Directorate's responsibilities included analyzing information for terrorist threats, assessing vulnerabilities, and determining attack risks. The act also provided protections for critical infrastructure information voluntarily provided by non-federal entities. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Department of Homeland Security, integrating various agencies for critical infrastructure protection. The IA/IP Directorate's responsibilities included analyzing information for terrorist threats, assessing vulnerabilities, and determining attack risks. Secretary Chertoff proposed restructuring the IA/IP Directorate and renaming it the Directorate of Preparedness, merging the IA function into a new Office of Intelligence and Analysis. The renamed Directorate included elements from the Office of State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Department of Homeland Security, integrating various agencies for critical infrastructure protection. Secretary Chertoff proposed restructuring the IA/IP Directorate and renaming it the Directorate of Preparedness, including the creation of a Chief Medical Officer position and the transfer of U.S. Fire Administration and Office of National Capital Region Coordination. The restructuring also involved the addition of Assistant Secretaries for Cyber Security and Telecommunications, and Infrastructure Protection, with a focus on facilitating grants and overseeing nationwide preparedness efforts for first responders, public health, infrastructure, and cyber security. The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 (referred to as the Post-Katrina Act) made changes to infrastructure protection, including relocating the Homeland Security Operations Center and creating a new Directorate of Policy. This Act reunited the Department's preparedness, response, and recovery activities within a restructured Federal framework. The Post-Katrina Act restructured FEMA, transferring the Office of Grants and Training to FEMA while leaving other activities in the Preparedness Directorate. It also established the Office of Emergency Communications under the Assistant Secretary for Cyber Security and Telecommunications. The Department of Emergency Communications, under the National Protection and Programs Directorate, was reorganized by Secretary Chertoff in response to the Post-Katrina Act. This included renaming the Preparedness Directorate and establishing the Office of Emergency Communications. The Secretary of Homeland Security reorganized various offices within the National Protection and Programs Directorate, including moving the U.S.-VISIT program and creating a new Office of Health Affairs. The reorganization consolidated bio-defense efforts and transferred the Biosurveillance program. The IPIS program, focusing on critical infrastructure protection, remained within the NPPD. The organizational structure for critical infrastructure within DHS continues to evolve. The structure within DHS responsible for critical infrastructure has evolved over the years. The NPPD now includes the Federal Protective Service, Office of Biometric Identify Management, Office of Cyber and Infrastructure Analysis, Office of Cybersecurity and Communications, and Office of Infrastructure Protection. The number and breakdown of sectors and lead agencies have also changed. The Bush Administration and PPD-21 expanded the number of critical infrastructure sectors. In 2008, DHS designated Critical Manufacturing as the 18th sector, including sub-groups from various manufacturing industries. PPD-21 also adjusted sector designations, such as National Monuments and Icons under Government Facilities. The Bush Administration and PPD-21 expanded critical infrastructure sectors, adding Critical Manufacturing as the 18th sector. Sectors were renamed, such as Postal and Shipping becoming a subsector of Transportation, and Banking and Finance renamed Financial Services. PDD-63 required Lead Agencies to select Sector Liaison Officials and Coordinators, with some sectors facing challenges due to diversity or fragmentation. Some sectors, like banking, telecommunications, and energy, have more experience working with the federal government and ensuring system performance. Sector Coordinators were chosen for most sectors under PDD-63, typically from relevant trade organizations. Cooperation among competitors raised trust and antitrust concerns. The Sector Coordinators were chosen from relevant trade organizations to coordinate critical infrastructure protection activities with the federal government. In December 1999, sectors formed a Partnership for Critical Infrastructure Security to share information and strategies across sectoral lines. The Partnership for Critical Infrastructure Security, a private sector initiative, coordinated input for national strategies and the National Plan. The Bush Administration introduced a new Critical Infrastructure Protection Partnership Model, expanding government and owner/operator representation through Government Coordinating Councils and Sector Coordinating Councils. The Water Sector Coordinating Council expanded to include owner/operator and government representatives from various organizations. The Water Government Coordinating Council, chaired by the Environmental Protection Agency, includes representatives from multiple government agencies. The Sector Coordinating Councils, including the Water Sector Coordinating Council, work independently from the federal government and provide input into national infrastructure protection plans. The Department of Homeland Security formed exempt advisory committees in 2006 to support this model. The Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) was established as an exempt committee from the Federal Advisory Committee Act to facilitate open discussion between sector coordinating councils and government coordinating councils. Members include owner/operators from sector coordinating councils and government entities from government coordinating councils. DHS acts as the Executive Secretariat for CIPAC. The DHS has established the Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) as an exempt committee to facilitate discussions between sector coordinating councils and government coordinating councils. Various presidential directives have called for the development of comprehensive national infrastructure protection plans, including the National Infrastructure Assurance Plan and the National Plan for Critical Infrastructure and Key Resources Protection. These plans aim to prioritize and coordinate the protection of critical infrastructure and key resources. The National Plan for Information Systems Protection was released in January 2000 by the Clinton Administration, focusing on cyber-related efforts within the federal government. The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace, released by the Bush Administration in February 2003, addressed all stakeholders in the nation's information infrastructure. The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets was released in February 2003, addressing stakeholders in the nation's information infrastructure. The Department of Homeland Security missed the deadline for the National Infrastructure Protection Plan but published an Interim Plan in February 2005, leading to complaints from the private sector about lack of consultation. The Department of Homeland Security released a draft National Infrastructure Protection Plan in November 2005 after complaints from the private sector about lack of consultation. The final version was approved in June 2006 and revised in early 2009 to include all-hazard and resiliency concepts. The 2006 NIPP outlined processes for national risk management efforts, including asset selection, threat assessments, vulnerability analysis, consequence evaluation, risk determination, and mitigation prioritization. The 2006 NIPP outlined processes for national risk management efforts, including determining risks, identifying potential risk mitigation activities, and prioritizing those activities based on cost-effectiveness. Sector Specific Plans (SSPs) were due 180 days after release of the NIPP, with all 17 sectors meeting the deadline by the end of 2006. The 2006 NIPP outlined national risk management processes, with SSPs due 180 days later. 7 of 17 plans were made public, while the rest were designated For Official Use Only. The GAO reviewed 9 SSPs, finding varying levels of development and comprehensiveness. DHS considered SSPs a first step, planning to review sectors' progress annually. Updates were made in 2009 and 2013, with a decision in 2010 to update the NIPP and SSPs every four years. The 2013 NIPP builds upon previous versions, emphasizing resiliency and an all-hazard approach. It introduces seven core tenets and twelve action items for the national effort. PDD-63 initially proposed a single ISAC for information sharing, but this evolved into sector-specific centers. ISACs operate 24/7/365 to exchange incident and threat information between government and the private sector. ISACs were formed to report, analyze, and share incidents and threat information from owner/operators and the government. They focus on cybersecurity but some also include physical security. ISACs operate under two primary models: members establishing their own operations or utilizing existing industry/government groups. sectors like banking, information, water, oil and gas, railroad, and mass transit follow the first model, while electric power and telecommunications sectors follow the second model. The telecommunications sector, using the National Coordinating Center (NCC), and the emergency fire services sector incorporated ISAC functions into existing operations. Different federal financial support models were developed for ISACs, with some receiving startup funding from their Lead Agency. ISACs have formed a group called the ISAC Council to exchange critical infrastructure information between the federal government and stakeholders. The Department of Homeland Security has various information sharing systems like US-CERT and the Homeland Security Information Network for exchanging critical infrastructure information. US-CERT publishes updates on computer vulnerabilities and manages the National Cyber Alert System. HSIN facilitates real-time connectivity between government law enforcement agencies. The Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN) provides real-time connectivity between all levels of government and critical infrastructure sectors. The Infrastructure Protection Executive Notification Service (ENS) alerts major industrial firms to incidents, disseminates warnings, and conducts teleconferences. The Critical Infrastructure Warning Network (CWIN) ensures secure communications between DHS and various agencies, the private sector, and government entities. The Critical Infrastructure Warning Network (CWIN) facilitates secure communications between DHS and other agencies, private sector, and international entities. The Homeland Security Act defines Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs) as entities for gathering and analyzing critical infrastructure information to prevent, detect, mitigate, or recover from compromises. The ISAOs, unlike ISACs, are not sector-oriented. E.O. 13691 instructed the expansion of ISAOs for cybersecurity information sharing. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 assigned the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate to access, receive, analyze, and integrate information to identify terrorist threats and assess vulnerabilities. The Department of Homeland Security collaborates with stakeholders to develop a methodology for identifying critical infrastructure facilities, systems, and functions. The Department of Homeland Security collaborates with stakeholders to develop a uniform methodology for identifying critical infrastructure facilities, systems, and functions with national-level criticality. This includes building a comprehensive database, maintaining assessments of vulnerabilities and preparedness, and guiding protective actions and resource investments. The National Protection and Programs Directorate carries out these responsibilities, seeking to identify critical infrastructure assets through various mechanisms. The Critical Infrastructure Prioritization Program and the Critical Foreign Dependencies Initiative, supported by analysis from the National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center and the Office of Infrastructure Analysis, identify critical assets based on hazards, vulnerabilities, and potential consequences. DHS offers assistance to asset owners/operators for vulnerability assessments and risk reduction. Regional Resiliency Assessment Program (RRAP) expands on these efforts. The Regional Resiliency Assessment Program (RRAP) expands vulnerability assessments to consider clusters of critical infrastructures and key resources within a geographic region. Participation in assessments and adopting risk-reducing recommendations is voluntary. DHS tracks adopted recommendations and supports infrastructure protection at the state and local level through grant programs like the State Homeland Security Formula-based Grants and the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI). The State Homeland Security Formula-based Grants, Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) Grants, Port Security Grants, Rail and Transit Security Grants, Intercity Bus Security Grants, and Highway Security Grants support first responder needs and infrastructure protection. Recipients must identify critical infrastructure assets, conduct assessments, and develop plans to reduce vulnerabilities. President Obama's EO 13636 tasked NIST with developing a Cybersecurity Framework for a Voluntary Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity Program. NIST released Version 1.0 of the Framework on February 12, 2014, to enhance the security of information networks. Congressional focus on critical infrastructure protection has centered on assessing DHS's efforts, with ongoing debates on improving information sharing and the need for additional regulations, primarily in the context of cybersecurity. Information sharing in homeland security involves a complex web of connections between federal agencies, intelligence agencies, law enforcement, defense, civilian agencies, state and local counterparts, the private sector, and the public. Various mechanisms have been established to facilitate this information sharing, which may raise concerns about inefficiencies but could also create a highly connected network. In the wake of September 11, there has been a push to improve information sharing in homeland security. The USA PATRIOT Act has eased restrictions on sharing information between national law enforcement and intelligence agencies. The legislation establishing the Department of Homeland Security and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act aimed to improve communication and coordination among intelligence agencies and promote information sharing at federal, state, local, tribal, and private sector levels. Recent executive orders and legislative efforts focus on sharing cybersecurity information between the federal government and other entities. The legislation aims to improve sharing cybersecurity information between the federal government and private sector while protecting privacy and providing liability protection for companies. This exchange may raise privacy concerns due to the nature of cybersecurity information involving malware in electronic messages. The federal government is increasing information sharing among stakeholders while maintaining control over who can access the information. Various designations like critical infrastructure information and sensitive security information are used to control the flow of information. Critical infrastructure protection heavily relies on the private sector's cooperation. Successful information sharing for protection relies on the private sector and government sharing information, but there are concerns about openness and protecting sensitive information. The government wants specific details on threats, while companies want to safeguard their vulnerabilities and incidents. Both sides are wary of potential regulatory actions or liabilities. The ability to hold sensitive information will be crucial for effective information sharing. Sharing information between government and the private sector is complex due to concerns about confidentiality and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Legislation like the Homeland Security Act and Public Health Security Act provide exemptions from FOIA for critical infrastructure and security-related information. However, there is uncertainty about how much information can be shared on assets. Critics argue that FOIA exemptions for critical infrastructure information and sensitive unclassified data are too broad, hindering public debate and technological progress. Owners of critical infrastructure are encouraged to voluntarily share information with the government. The federal government encourages voluntary sharing of information about vulnerability assessments and risk assessments across various sectors. Some sectors, like nuclear power plants and maritime transportation, have specific regulations mandating vulnerability assessments and security plans to address potential threats. The Coast Guard reviews vulnerability assessments and security plans required by the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness Act. Community drinking water systems must conduct vulnerability assessments and incorporate the results into their emergency response plans, which are submitted to the EPA. The Act also mandates facilities engaged in food production to register with the Department of Health and Human Services and keep specified information on record. The FY2006 DHS appropriation bill authorized the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue regulations for vulnerability assessments and security plans for certain chemical facilities. Sectors like information and telecommunication, oil and gas, and commercial buildings are encouraged to conduct similar activities but not mandated. The security community, Obama administration, industry, and Congress have debated regulating cybersecurity for critical infrastructure assets. Difficulty passing regulations due to concerns about costs, benefits, and duplicative reporting requirements. Federal funding for critical infrastructure protection is challenging to determine. The Homeland Security Act requires the President's Budget to include a budget analysis of homeland security activities, with a focus on critical infrastructure protection. However, changes in accounting methods have made it less clear how much is spent on critical infrastructure. The Bush Administration defined six categories of homeland security activities, including critical infrastructure and key asset protection. The Homeland Security Act mandates a budget analysis of homeland security activities, focusing on critical infrastructure protection. The Bush Administration identified six categories of homeland security activities, including critical infrastructure and key asset protection. This category encompasses funding for agencies to safeguard their infrastructure and collaborate with other entities to reduce vulnerabilities. DHS coordinates national efforts and engages in activities like threat analysis, risk analysis, and information sharing to protect critical infrastructure, including border and transportation security measures. For FY2010, OMB reorganized homeland security activities into three new categories: prevent and disrupt terrorist attacks; protect American people, critical infrastructure, and key resources; and respond to incidents. This restructuring makes it difficult to compare funding figures with previous budgets. The category \"protect American people, critical infrastructure, and key resources\" now includes more activities than before, expanding beyond the previous \"critical infrastructure and key resources protection\" category. The OMB reorganized homeland security activities into three new categories for FY2010, including preventing and disrupting terrorist attacks, protecting critical infrastructure, and responding to incidents. The funding for defending against catastrophic events has significantly increased, covering activities to protect the general population from weapons of mass destruction. However, the OMB accounting no longer accurately represents all activities related to defending against catastrophic events. It is challenging to track all federal activities for critical infrastructure protection and within the Department of Homeland Security. The Department of Homeland Security funds critical infrastructure protection activities through various agencies, with a significant portion allocated to the Infrastructure Protection and Information Security (IPIS) Program. IPIS supports the Office of Infrastructure Protection, Office of Cybersecurity and Communications, and Office of Cyber and Infrastructure Analysis in coordinating national risk reduction efforts. The Office of Infrastructure Protection (OIP) and Office of Cybersecurity and Communications (OCS&C) work together to identify and mitigate risks to the nation's critical infrastructure from terrorist attacks or natural events. The Office of Cyber and Infrastructure Analysis (OCIA) provides analytic support to OIP and OCS&C, focusing on information and communications networks. Funding is aligned with this organizational structure to support critical infrastructure protection activities. The Administration requested $1,312 million for the IPIS program for FY2016, a net increase of $123 million above the amount enacted for FY2015. Other infrastructure-related programs within DHS, such as FEMA's grant programs, also support protecting critical infrastructure assets. The Administration requested $1,043 million for various security grants including Public Transportation Security, Railroad Security, Port Security, and Urban Areas Security Initiative. These grants support first responder capabilities and critical infrastructure protection expenses. Congress has not agreed to aggregate these grants into a single National Preparedness Grant Program. The Administration requested $1,043 million for the National Preparedness Grant Program in FY2016. TSA oversees aviation security with a budget of $5,639 million in FY2015. Congress provided $917 million for surface transportation security in FY2015 and the Administration requested $7,092 million for FY2016. The Science and Technology Directorate budget supports research and development in cybersecurity, risk analysis, explosive detection, blast protection, modeling and simulation, safe cargo containers, and more for critical infrastructure protection. The Science and Technology Directorate budget supports research and development in critical infrastructure protection, including cybersecurity, risk analysis, explosive detection, blast protection, and safe cargo containers. Funding allocation for critical infrastructure protection-related research is challenging to determine due to budget program structures. For more information on DHS's Science and Technology program and legislation on critical infrastructure research and development, refer to CRS Report R43064."
