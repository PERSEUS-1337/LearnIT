    "content": "The \"Arctic Science Endowment Act\" may be cited as the short title for this legislation. The purpose of the Act is outlined in the findings section. The United States is an Arctic Nation with a 700-mile border with the Arctic Ocean, over 100,000,000 acres of land above the Arctic Circle, and a broader Arctic area including the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands. The region is home to an indigenous population relying on marine mammals, fish, and wildlife. Temperatures have warmed by 3 to 4 degrees Celsius in the past half-century, twice the global average, leading to rapid diminishing of the Arctic ice pack. The Arctic ice pack is rapidly diminishing and thinning, with estimates that the Arctic Ocean may be ice-free in summer within 30 years. These changes are impacting indigenous communities, ecosystems, and wildlife, while also opening up new areas for possible development in offshore oil and gas, commercial fishing, marine shipping, and tourism. Existing federal research programs lack coordination in addressing the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of a changing Arctic Ocean. The lack of research integration and synthesis in the changing Arctic Ocean has hindered understanding of climate change impacts. Improved scientific understanding is crucial for developing effective climate change adaptation strategies. The purpose of the Act is to establish a permanent environmental sentinel program for research, monitoring, and observation activities in the Arctic Ocean. The Act aims to establish a permanent environmental sentinel program for research and monitoring activities in the Arctic Ocean. It seeks to promote a resilient ecosystem and human uses of natural resources through understanding ecosystem functions and tracking natural resource management effectiveness for improved performance. The Act defines key terms such as \"Board\" as the North Pacific Research Board, \"Commission\" as the Arctic Research Commission, and \"Program\" as the Arctic Ocean Research, Monitoring, and Observation Program. The Arctic Ocean Research, Monitoring, and Observation Program is established by the Board with input from the Commission. It includes long-term scientific research, monitoring, and observation activities related to marine ecosystems, fisheries, wildlife populations, and the Alaska Ocean Observing System in the Arctic. The Arctic Ocean Research, Monitoring, and Observation Program, established by the Board with input from the Commission, focuses on marine research, monitoring, and modeling to support planning, decision-making, and evaluation related to Arctic fisheries, marine mammals, and environmental changes. Initial projects include research on Arctic cod, forage fishes, and marine mammal responses to sea ice loss. The Arctic Ocean Research, Monitoring, and Observation Program aims to study marine mammals' responses to sea ice loss and disturbances for at least 3 years. Additionally, the Alaska Ocean Observing System in the Arctic Ocean will provide real-time data on environmental conditions. The Board and Commission will jointly develop a comprehensive Arctic Ocean science plan in coordination with other science plans in the region. The development of the Arctic Ocean science plan is informed by a synthesis of existing knowledge about the Arctic ecosystem, including ecosystem functions, sources of stress, and ecosystem changes. The plan will undergo initial review by the National Research Council and periodic updates every 5 years thereafter. The Board and the Commission, with input from the National Research Council, will review and update the Arctic Ocean science plan as needed. The Board will use this plan to prioritize and award grants for research activities. Grants will be awarded for research, monitoring, and observation activities outlined in the program, with the limitation that grants cannot be awarded until the required plan is prepared. Conditions, considerations, and priorities will be taken into account when awarding grants. When awarding grants for research activities in the Arctic and subarctic regions, the Board prioritizes long-term projects addressing marine ecosystem and wildlife management needs. They also focus on establishing and operating the Alaska Ocean Observing System in the Arctic Ocean, while recognizing the value of local ecological knowledge. The Arctic Research Commission prioritizes research projects incorporating local ecological knowledge, ensures data availability to the public, and considers annual recommendations for research priorities. The Arctic Research Commission reviews ongoing research activities and submits recommendations to the Board. SEC. 5. ARCTIC OCEAN RESEARCH, MONITORING, AND OBSERVATION TRUST FUND. This section adds a new trust fund for Arctic Ocean research, monitoring, and observation. A trust fund called the 'Arctic Ocean Research, Monitoring, and Observation Trust Fund' is established in the Treasury of the United States. It will receive appropriations and taxes from section 4461 for financing the Arctic Ocean Research, Monitoring, and Observation Program without needing further appropriation. The Arctic Science Endowment Act establishes a program with annual funding of $20,000,000 until the Trust Fund reaches $400,000,000. The table of sections for subchapter A of chapter 98 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding a new item. The Arctic Ocean Research, Monitoring, and Observation Trust Fund financing rate is amended in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Arctic Ocean Research, Monitoring, and Observation Trust Fund financing rate is amended in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to include specific rates for crude oil and petroleum products. The amendments apply to items received or entered after the enactment date of the Act."
