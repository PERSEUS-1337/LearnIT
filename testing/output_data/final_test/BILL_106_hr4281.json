    "content": "The \"ICCVAM Authorization Act of 2000\" defines \"alternative test method\" as a method that reduces animal use, minimizes pain/distress, or replaces animals with non-animal systems. \"ICCVAM test recommendation\" is a report summarizing peer-reviewed test method results. SEC. 3. INTERAGENCY COORDINATING COMMITTEE ON THE VALIDATION OF ALTERNATIVE METHODS. The Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) is designated as a permanent committee under the National Toxicology Program. The purposes of ICCVAM are to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of Federal agencies. The ICCVAM aims to enhance Federal agency test method review, eliminate duplicative efforts, optimize scientific expertise utilization, validate new test methods, and reduce animal testing. It is composed of heads from various Federal agencies. The ICCVAM aims to enhance Federal agency test method review, eliminate duplicative efforts, optimize scientific expertise utilization, validate new test methods, and reduce animal testing. It is composed of heads from various Federal agencies including the Department of Transportation, Environmental Protection Agency, Food and Drug Administration, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Library of Medicine, and Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Additionally, any other agency that develops, employs tests using animals, or regulates based on animal toxicity testing is included. The Director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences will establish a Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) to advise ICCVAM and the National Toxicology Program Interagency Center. The Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) will advise ICCVAM and the National Toxicology Program Interagency Center on activities related to the evaluation of alternative toxicological methods. The SAC membership includes representatives with expertise in developing or evaluating new test methods. The Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) advises on alternative toxicological methods for various industries regulated by Federal agencies and national animal protection organizations. The SAC advises on alternative toxicological methods for industries regulated by Federal agencies and national animal protection organizations. The ICCVAM, selected by the Director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, reviews and evaluates new test methods. The SAC advises on alternative toxicological methods for industries regulated by Federal agencies and national animal protection organizations. The ICCVAM reviews and evaluates new test methods, facilitates interagency and international harmonization of test protocols, provides guidance on validation criteria, and submits test recommendations for scientifically valid methods. The ICCVAM reviews and evaluates new test methods, facilitates interagency and international harmonization of test protocols, and provides guidance on validation criteria for chemicals within a regulatory framework to reduce, refine, or replace animal test methods. Public petitions for new or alternative test methods with valid scientific evidence are considered for review. Final ICCVAM test results are made available to the public. ICCVM provides test recommendations to Federal agencies and reports on its progress under the Act every two years, starting 12 months after enactment. SEC. 4. FEDERAL AGENCY ACTION. Federal agencies must identify and forward relevant test methods that require or recommend animal testing to ICCVAM within 180 days of receiving a test recommendation. They should also promote and encourage the development and use of alternatives to animal testing methods to comply with federal regulations. The Federal agencies must validate new toxicity test methods before requiring their application. They must review ICCVAM test recommendations within 180 days and promote alternatives to animal testing. Federal agencies must adopt ICCVAM test recommendations unless they find them inadequate for their regulatory goals, do not generate equivalent data, do not test for specific chemicals, or endpoints. ICCVAM test recommendations must be adopted by federal agencies unless they are deemed unsuitable for fulfilling specific test needs or regulatory goals. SEC. 5. APPLICATION. This Act excludes research using biotechnology techniques or related to the causes, diagnosis, treatment, control, or prevention of diseases in humans or animals. Federal agencies can still use test methods recommended by ICCVAM. Manufacturers not required to perform animal testing are not obligated to do so under this Act. Submission of test methods and data is not restricted by this Act. The Act does not prevent a party from submitting test methods or scientific data directly to a Federal agency for use in a regulatory program. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
