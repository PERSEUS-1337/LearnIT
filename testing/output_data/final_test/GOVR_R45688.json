    "content": "Timber harvesting on federal lands is a long-standing activity that can be controversial. Most timber harvesting occurs on lands designated for multiple uses, making it challenging for land management agencies to determine the appropriate balance between timber harvesting and other uses. Congress has authorized timber harvesting on certain federal lands, with the majority of harvests occurring on the National Forest System and public lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management. Timber harvesting occurs on federal lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Forest Service (FS). The FS manages 144.9 million acres of forest, while the BLM manages 37.6 million acres. Together, they make up 76% of federal forest area in the United States. Timber harvesting involves cutting and removing trees for wood products like lumber and paper. Timber harvesting on private, federal, or non-federal publicly owned lands is mainly conducted on private lands in the United States. The Forest Service (FS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) conduct timber sales as a common method for allowing timber harvesting on their lands. A timber sale involves purchasing a contract to cut and remove specified timber, with FS and BLM receiving revenue from the sale. Data on timber harvesting, including volume and value, is sourced from FS and BLM and may include timber harvested through sales or other methods. Both FS and BLM conduct timber sales for sustainable harvesting on their lands, following principles of multiple use and sustained yield. They designate areas for timber management, calculate yields, plan timber sales, determine timber value, and conduct competitive sales open to the public. Timber harvesting also occurs on National Park System and National Wildlife Refuge System lands for specific purposes. The Secretary may permit timber harvesting on NWRS for habitat conditions. Timber harvesting is rare on both FS and BLM lands. The report provides an overview of timber harvesting on FS and BLM lands, including statutory authorities, planning activities, sales, volume, and value trends. The National Forest System comprises nearly 193 million acres across 154 national forests and grasslands. The National Forest System contains 144.9 million acres of forest and woodland, with 66% considered timberland. The forests were reserved from public lands in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, initially managed by the DOI and later transferred to the USDA and the Forest Service. Congress specified the purpose of these forests to improve and protect the forest, provide a continuous timber supply, and protect water flows. Timber sales of dead, matured, or large growth trees were authorized, with expanded purposes and management goals for the national forests. The Multiple Use-Sustained Yield Act of 1960 expanded the purposes for national forests to include fish and wildlife habitat, recreation, energy and mineral development, and livestock grazing in addition to timber harvesting and watershed protection. Management of forest resources is to be organized for multiple uses in a harmonious manner to meet the needs of the American people. The act also directs sustained yield of products and services without impairing the lands' productivity, emphasizing long-term land use and resource management. Plans set the framework for land management. The Forest Service engages in long-term land use and resource management through interdisciplinary planning processes with public participation. Plans guide implementation of activities like timber harvesting, with sustainable harvest levels. Revenues from timber sales are used for various purposes specified by Congress. The National Forest Management Act of 1976 requires the Forest Service to prepare land and resource management plans, to be revised every 15 years. Regulations have been issued to implement this planning requirement. The Forest Service issues regulations to implement planning rules and establish procedures for developing forest plans. Forest plans guide management by specifying objectives, standards, and guidelines for resources and activities, including timber harvesting. Lands unsuitable for timber production must be identified, while all other lands are considered suitable. The Forest Service issues regulations for developing forest plans, which guide management by specifying objectives, standards, and guidelines for resources and activities, including timber harvesting. Plans must contain the allowable sale quantity for timber removal annually over a ten-year period, developed with public participation and in accordance with environmental statutes like NEPA. Forest plans may consider harvesting for various purposes, such as habitat improvement and fire risk reduction.

Forest plans may consider harvesting for various purposes, such as habitat improvement and fire risk reduction. When identifying lands suitable for timber production, the plan must address timber harvesting and delineate areas where such activities may occur based on forest type, geographic area, or other criteria. FS conducts timber sales to achieve plan objectives, establishing a sale schedule, timber sale project plan, and estimating volume offered, acreage, and harvest methods. Site-specific timber harvests must comply with NEPA and relevant statutes, including environmental analysis and review before individual sales. FS marks and appraises timber to be offered, designating it through physical marking, written descriptions, or other methods. The Forest Service conducts timber sales by creating sale packages with prospectus, contracts, and other documentation, advertised at an appraised starting price. Interested parties bid on the package, with the contract awarded to the highest bidder. The winning bidder must conduct the timber harvest according to specified terms within 3 years. Timber sales generate revenue, with funds retained by FS for various purposes determined by Congress. The Forest Service may distribute receipts from timber sales among funds at their discretion, including depositing all revenue in a single fund. These funds can be used for various purposes without further appropriation. Timber harvesting from the National Forest System fluctuates over time, with revenue levels and expenditures managed by the FS. The volume of timber harvested from the national forests increased slowly from 1898 until the 1940s, with FS lands supplying 2% of U.S. timber supply by 1940. In the post-World War II era, timber harvest volume from the NFS grew significantly, rising from 1-3 billion board feet annually in the early 1940s to more than 10 BBF in some years of the 1960s and 1970s. Harvest from the NFS rose from 9% of total U.S. harvest in 1952 to 16% in 1962 and 1970, and 15% in 1976. Timber harvest volume on FS lands declined from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s due to clear-cutting reducing tree volume. This period coincided with recessions in 1980 and 1982, impacting demand. Timber harvests rose in the early 1980s to the early 1990s, reaching levels of over 12 BBF per year. In 1986, timber harvests from the NFS accounted for 13% of total U.S. timber harvests. However, in the early 1990s, harvested timber volume began to decrease, with NFS supplying 11% of total U.S. harvested timber in 1991, and 5% in 1997. By 2011, NFS supplied 2% of U.S. wood. The decline in NFS timber supply from 5% in 1997 to 2% in 2011 may be attributed to various factors such as statutory changes, management priorities, decreasing domestic demand, volatile prices, and the impact of the northern spotted owl listing in 1990. These factors have led to a complex landscape for forest management and have affected harvest levels over time. The listing of the northern spotted owl under the Endangered Species Act in 1990 has impacted timber harvest levels, with volumes remaining consistent between 2 BBF and 3 BBF annually from FY2004 onwards. Despite the national timber market being affected by the 2008 housing market collapse, timber volumes harvested from FS lands saw little change. Harvest values have fluctuated over the years, with peaks in the early 1940s, FY1979, and FY1989, but values from FY2001 onwards have generally remained stable. In FY2018, FS harvest value was approximately $188.8 million, with values fluctuating between $100 million and $300 million in FY2018 dollars since FY2001. Harvest volume varies by region, with Region 6, Region 8, and Region 9 being the largest producing regions in both private and public forestry. Harvest volume and value are influenced by factors such as timber type, age class, site suitability, and legal limitations on land use. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) administers federal lands in twelve western states, with 37.6 million acres being forested. The Oregon and California (O&C) lands contain 2.4 million acres of forest. BLM's authority to harvest timber on public lands was limited until the Materials Act of 1947. Congress authorized BLM to manage forest materials on public lands through the Materials Act of 1947 and further defined its responsibilities with the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA). FLPMA requires BLM to manage public lands for multiple use and sustained yield, ensuring a regular output of renewable resources without harming productivity. The O&C lands in western Oregon, mostly managed by BLM, are subject to their own statutes. FS manages 18% of the O&C lands, totaling 492 thousand acres, including the Oregon and California lands and the Coos Bay Wagon Road (CBWR). The O&C lands, including the Oregon and California lands and the Coos Bay Wagon Road lands, are managed by BLM and FS. BLM's mandate to sell timber on these lands comes from the O&C Act, which directs sustainable forest management for various purposes. Congress has instructed BLM to engage in long-term land use planning through interdisciplinary processes with public participation. Plans guide specific activities like timber harvesting. The BLM implements site-specific activities, including timber harvesting plans for sustainable harvest levels. These plans guide sales to generate revenue as directed by Congress. BLM follows land use planning procedures under FLPMA, with regulations dating back to 1979. Plans must involve public participation and comply with environmental statutes like NEPA. Resource management plans under the BLM planning rule are to be monitored and evaluated indefinitely, with amendments as needed. The BLM follows land use planning procedures under FLPMA, with regulations dating back to 1979. Resource management plans under the BLM planning rule include monitoring and evaluation standards. BLM identifies indicators for desired forest outcomes and management actions to achieve them, such as sustained yield areas for timber harvest. The allowable sale quantity is determined for a ten-year period, with annual forest product sale plans made. Site-specific timber harvests must comply with NEPA and relevant statutes. BLM designates timber for sale, appraises its value, prepares a sale contract, and advertises it at an appraised starting price. Interested parties bid on the contract, with the highest bidder awarded the contract if legal conditions are met. The winning bidder conducts the timber harvest according to contract terms, with harvests generally completed in three years. Timber sales generate revenues, which are allocated based on various factors and funds established by Congress. BLM may allocate timber sale revenues among funds at its discretion, including depositing all revenues in a single account. Some funds are permanently appropriated to BLM and may be used without further congressional action. Timber harvesting is one of many authorized uses of BLM lands, with historical data on BLM timber harvesting being unavailable. The data provides information on timber offered for sale, sold, and harvested from BLM lands, along with economic and historical factors. Historical cut data is available from FY1994 onwards, with past sales data also available. The data shows a decline in public domain timber offered for sale starting in 1991, with larger volumes sold prior to FY1990 compared to recent volumes offered for sale. The investigation did not consider O&C lands. Volumes harvested from BLM lands ranged between 100 and 260 MMBF from FY1995 to FY2000 and FY2004 to FY2018, with a peak in FY2015 at 258 MMBF. Harvest values have generally increased since FY2001, reaching $41.3 million in FY2018. Since FY2011, BLM has harvested timber worth $50 million (FY2018 dollars), with a cut value of $41.3 million in FY2018. The harvest value on BLM lands remained relatively stable during the 2008 recession compared to the late 1990s. BLM harvest values per unit of timber are higher than FS values due to the timber type harvested. Most timber harvests on BLM lands are on O&C lands, with 93% of the average total volume harvested from FY2014 to FY2018. This reflects the forest cover, dominant use for forest production, and the size of the forest industry in the Pacific Northwest. Timber production on federal lands in the Pacific Northwest is influenced by various factors such as timber type, age class, and site suitability. Balancing timber harvesting with other land uses is challenging, driven by environmental factors, market forces, and land management policies. Efforts to change harvest levels must align with sustained yield provisions, with Congress considering legislation to prioritize or exclude certain uses in specific regions. The public expresses preferences for timber harvesting on federal forests, with some supporting current production levels while others want to see it increased or decreased. Supporters cite benefits to the timber industry and forest health, while opponents raise concerns about ecological and human impacts. Opponents of timber sales argue that it has negative impacts on environmental quality, wildlife habitat, forest character, recreation, tourism, and cultural values. They also believe that timber sales prioritize the timber industry over other interests. Congress may debate issues like timber sale revenues, NEPA, ESA, and special harvest authorities. Funding details and related issues are not covered in this report. The report does not cover funding levels, expenditures, or related issues."
