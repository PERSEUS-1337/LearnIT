    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Women's Preventive Health Awareness Campaign\". Congress finds that well-woman visits are essential for women's preventive care, including screening tests, medical history, physical exams, counseling, and vaccinations. Individualized recommendations for screening tests are necessary based on a patient's medical history and evaluation. Well-woman visits are crucial for preventive care, including screening tests and vaccinations. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in American women, with disparities in diagnosis and treatment compared to men. Women are also more likely to forgo needed healthcare due to cost. Between 2002 and 2010, screening mammography rates among women aged 50 to 64 in the US declined from 79% to 73%. In 2009, only 53% of 18 to 64-year-olds reported ever having an HIV test. The proportion of women aged 22 to 30 who never had a Pap test increased from 6.6% in 2000 to 9.0% in 2010. In 2007, 29.3% of US women delivering a live birth did not receive prenatal care in the first trimester. Among sexually active females aged 16 to 20 in the US, only 52.7% on Medicaid and 40.1% with commercial health insurance were screened for genital Chlamydia infections in 2008. Chlamydia cases diagnosed in 2008 alone incurred $516.7 million in direct medical costs. Nearly half of pregnancies in the US are unintended, with improved access to birth control shown to benefit women's health. Improved access to birth control significantly improves women's and their families' health by enhancing maternal and infant health outcomes. Planning pregnancies leads to better prenatal care, benefiting both the mother and child. Additionally, investing in family planning saves money, with every $1.00 spent resulting in nearly $4.00 in Medicaid-related savings. Despite this, a significant number of pregnant women did not receive recommended influenza vaccinations during the 2011-2012 flu season. SEC. 399V-6. WOMEN'S PREVENTIVE HEALTH AWARENESS CAMPAIGN.
