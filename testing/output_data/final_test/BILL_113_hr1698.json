    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Stabilize Medicaid and CHIP Coverage Act\". It includes findings related to the Act. Congress finds that millions of people enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP lose coverage due to paperwork inefficiencies. Data shows enrollees typically have coverage for about three-quarters of a year, with lower periods for non-elderly, non-disabled adults. Those with coverage disruptions are more likely to be hospitalized for manageable illnesses and less likely to receive necessary screenings. Children enrolled in CHIP may also be enrolled in Medicaid, causing disruptions in health coverage and care. These transitions can lead to interruptions in receiving effective primary care, resulting in costly hospitalizations or emergency room visits. Unnecessary enrollment changes in these programs increase administrative expenses and leave more people uninsured. Stable coverage under Medicaid and CHIP is crucial for better health outcomes. Stable coverage under Medicaid and CHIP reduces medical costs, improves prevention and disease management, and ensures children receive necessary preventive care for better health outcomes. SEC. 3. 12-MONTH CONTINUOUS ENROLLMENT. The text chunk discusses the requirement of 12-month continuous enrollment under both Medicaid and CHIP, ensuring that eligible individuals remain enrolled for benefits for a full year. The amendment requires states to ensure 12-month continuous enrollment for individuals eligible for child health assistance under the State child health plan. The amendment mandates states to guarantee 12-month continuous enrollment for eligible individuals under the State child health plan, with specific requirements for compliance and effective dates. The Secretary of Health and Human Services requires State legislation for state plans to meet additional requirements imposed by the amendment. Plans will not be considered non-compliant solely for failing to meet these requirements before the first day of the first calendar quarter after the state legislature's session. If a state has a 2-year legislative session, each year is considered a separate regular session. A State may elect to implement 12-month continuous eligibility prior to the effective date through a State plan amendment under the Social Security Act. The amendment must be applied on any date before the 18-month specified period, but not before the enactment of the Act."
