    "content": "The study involved healthcare providers and chronic patients to explore attitudes towards reviewing patient-generated data. Four factors shaping patient-generated data were identified: data & context, patient's motivation, time commitment, and support circle. Designing patient-generated visualizations for individuals was discussed based on the study results. Designing patient-generated visualizations for individuals is crucial in chronic disease management. Patients use tracking tools to collect health data, which can help make smarter decisions for improving quality of life. Technological tools for tracking health data exist, but they are not fully designed to meet individual needs. Patients and healthcare providers have expressed dissatisfaction with current tracking tools for health data. There is a need for effective visualization designs to support chronic patients in presenting their data during clinical visits. To address this, a focus group with healthcare providers was conducted to understand their requirements for reviewing patient-generated data. Additionally, patient stories were gathered through interviews to explore their approaches to tracking and presenting health data. Our study focused on patient-generated data visualization designs for chronic patients. Factors shaping the data included items collected, time commitment, motivation, and support circle. Tailored visualizations were created for each patient, leading to a proposed design space. Healthcare providers were then interviewed using these visualizations as elicitation artifacts. The healthcare providers interviewed for the project highlighted four use cases for patient-generated data visualizations. The importance of designing personalized visualizations for each patient and provider was emphasized, with the suggestion of providing a set of starting visualization designs for customization based on individual needs and preferences. In this paper, the authors discuss factors shaping patient-generated data, present a design space for visualizations, and provide guidelines for future designs. They explore patients' and healthcare providers' perspectives on using patient-generated data. The increasing number of patients with chronic conditions necessitates close monitoring and self-management. Patients with chronic conditions need close monitoring and self-managing care. A survey in 2013 found that many adults in the U.S. track health indicators for themselves or others. The availability of wearable sensors and mobile health apps has made it easier for patients to track personal health data. Patients track data in various forms, depending on their health goals, such as preventing complications, having more control over their health, setting personal goals, and improving their conditions. Patients with chronic conditions track health data using wearable sensors and mobile apps to improve their conditions and share data with healthcare providers. Sharing patient-generated data can enhance communication, empower patients, and help providers offer tailored care during clinical visits. Providers value patient-collected data for gaining insights into patient goals and providing personalized care. Patient-generated data is considered more reliable than clinic measurements due to more frequent collection intervals and less recall bias. Electronic medical record systems in hospitals may have misinformation, and clinic measurements like blood pressure can be affected by the clinical environment. Patient-generated data can help reconcile inaccuracies and contain less false-positive data. Healthcare providers see patient-generated data as complementary to clinical measurements but not a replacement. Patients may be hesitant to record data with abnormal readings. Patients may be reluctant to record their data with abnormal readings due to fear of consequences and concerns about their data becoming part of their permanent clinical record. Providers may find it challenging to understand and analyze the heavily personal and complex patient-generated data, especially during short clinical visits that typically last 10 to 20 minutes. Providers may struggle to find value in reviewing patient-generated data during short clinical visits, as storing and securing this data can be challenging and add to their workload. There is a lack of clarity on the most useful patient-generated data to review and discuss during visits, but standardized data collection processes could help. Technology has the potential to support providers and patients in communicating patient data effectively. The work explores designing technology to assist patients and healthcare providers in reviewing patient-generated data during clinical visits. Tailored visualizations may be more effective than a general solution, offering individualized experiences for each patient and provider. Healthcare providers from a local hospital approached the researchers to enhance the process of presenting and reviewing patient-generated data during visits. The study involved an iterative design approach with patients and healthcare providers to improve the process of reviewing patient-generated data during clinical visits. Initial focus group discussions with healthcare providers led to interviews with patients who actively collect health data. The goal was to propose visualization designs representing patient-generated data to enhance the review process during visits. During the study, healthcare providers were interviewed to gather their reflections on proposed visualization designs for patient-generated data review during clinical visits. A formal focus group was conducted with a mixed group of providers, including an endocrinologist, an internal medicine specialist, and a healthcare provider supporting patients who monitor their data. The focus group aimed to gain a deeper understanding of providers' perspectives on the data review process. During the study, healthcare providers were interviewed to gather their reflections on proposed visualization designs for patient-generated data review during clinical visits. In a focus group, providers discussed their experiences analyzing patient data and giving advice. The group lasted 60 minutes and was video-recorded. Patient perspectives on tracking health data were also gathered through interviews with eight patients with chronic conditions. Various recruitment methods were used, including emails, newsletter ads, and snowball sampling. The provider participated in a focus group and snowball sampling. Hour-long interviews were conducted with each patient based on discussions with healthcare providers. Patients brought data samples for detailed review, which were video-recorded and transcribed. Grounded theory method was used to analyze interviews individually to understand each patient's story deeply. Visualizations were sketched based on individual patient requirements for their data collections. Group discussions were held on the visualizations and their alignment with patient needs. After discussing visualizations that met patient needs, alternative designs were selected. The designs were presented to healthcare providers for feedback, including an internal medicine physician (C1), a clinical endocrinologist (C2), and a chronic specialist physician (C3). Interviews lasted 40-60 minutes, with providers reacting to the designs and discussing patient conditions and data collection processes. From our analysis of focus group transcripts, healthcare providers expressed four key requirements for reviewing patient-generated data during clinical visits. R1 focuses on integrating data context, emphasizing the need for tools that can incorporate context with data to make it more meaningful. R2 highlights the importance of summarizing data for quick presentation during visits, as patients often bring a large amount of data expecting healthcare providers to review it efficiently. Healthcare providers want tools to summarize and filter patient data to see trends, patterns, and anomalies. They need a platform that forces explicit communication between stakeholders to accommodate different goals. Providers seek tools that can provide both an overview and detailed view of patient data to support conversations effectively. Healthcare providers and patients need support to discuss concerns and open up communications. Tools that represent patient data in different views can help facilitate conversations. Patient-generated data is valuable when collected with context. Providers are concerned about patients spending excessive time on data collection. In response to concerns about patients spending excessive time on data collection, patient perspectives were gathered on their time commitment. Healthcare providers discussed the impact of patient goals and motivation on data collection. Patients were asked about their goals, motivation, and if they were advised to track data. Providers valued having patients present during clinical conversations and patients were asked about sharing data with providers or caregivers. Patient-generated visualization designs were based on focus group requirements and design guidelines. In response to concerns about patients spending excessive time on data collection, patient perspectives were gathered on their time commitment. Healthcare providers discussed the impact of patient goals and motivation on data collection. Patients were asked about their goals, motivation, and if they were advised to track data. Providers valued having patients present during clinical conversations and patients were asked about sharing data with providers or caregivers. Patient-generated visualization designs were based on focus group requirements and design guidelines. The visualization designs included \"Tooltip\" for data context integration, basic information seeking principles, \"overview and details-on-demand\" interactions, and multiple visualization designs for each patient-generated data collection. Pseudonyms were allocated for patient anonymity, and each patient's profile, data, context, time commitment, motivation, and support circle were presented before ideating and designing visualizations. The team generated 20 preliminary visualization designs for eight patients, considering providers' and patients' requirements. Each column in the design space board corresponds to one patient, showing design variations for that patient. In the design space board, variations for each patient were discussed and the selected designs were highlighted. These designs are not the only options, and other researchers may propose different variations. The case of Maria, a 67-year-old with hypertension, was used as an example to track blood pressure and heart rate regularly. Maria, a 67-year-old with hypertension, tracks her blood pressure and heart rate using a cuff machine and notebook. A visualization displays her readings with bars representing blood pressure and heart rate shown on demand. Each bar is color-coded to indicate normal, abnormal, or dangerous readings. Maria checks her readings three to four times per day, with each bar showing the time of recording. Maria tracks her blood pressure and heart rate using a cuff machine and notebook. She changed her lifestyle after diagnosis to reach her goal of lowering her blood pressure. Maria keeps a record of relevant events for discussions with her healthcare providers. She presents her notebook to her family physician to facilitate communication and adjustments to her treatment plans.

Andrew, living a healthy lifestyle, recently experienced diabetes complications and plans to start an exercise routine. Andrew, experiencing diabetes complications, tracks his exercise and glucose levels. He struggles to analyze trends and expects healthcare providers to guide him. Jen, diagnosed with hypertension at 18, is included in the support circle with weekly and monthly glucose recordings for overview. Jen was diagnosed with hypertension at 18 and had high blood pressure readings at the clinic. However, her home readings were closer to normal. She tracks her blood pressure and heart rate, focusing mainly on blood pressure data. Two visualizations were designed to display her blood pressure data. Jen color codes her blood pressure readings to quickly interpret the data. Visualization design follows this concept, with colors indicating normal, high, and low readings. Bars in the design show average daily readings, allowing Jen to easily spot trends. Selecting a time period reveals detailed data in a table view. Time commitment: Jen diligently monitors her blood pressure. Jen monitors her blood pressure regularly, believing it to be under control with normal readings. She checks it once a week to prevent complications and avoid medication. She does light exercises and color codes her readings for easy interpretation. Jen monitors her blood pressure regularly, does light exercises, and plans meals to stay healthy. She gets anxious at clinical visits, so she tracks her readings at home to show her healthcare providers. Lucas, 43, has hypertension, diabetes, and depression, with hospitalizations for high blood glucose and suicidal thoughts. Lucas, 43, has been hospitalized for suicidal thoughts and high blood glucose. He tracks his glucose, blood pressure, and heart rate in notebooks, using visualizations to monitor all three at once. His readings are color-coded based on his conditions, with red indicating out-of-range values. Despite being advised to record data five times a day, Lucas struggles with the pressure of managing his conditions. Lucas, 43, tracks his glucose, blood pressure, and heart rate in notebooks, using visualizations to monitor all three at once. He struggles with pressure due to his conditions and personal problems, only managing to track his data once a day. Lucas feels frustrated and upset for not having his conditions under control. He hopes for support to motivate him to track his data and wants to exercise regularly to stabilize his blood pressure and glucose levels, but his busy schedule hinders him. He goes for short walks to lower his blood pressure when it's high.

A clock visualization displays all the data points with timestamps, color-coded based on predefined glucose level ranges. Sarah's insulin pump automatically monitors her glucose levels at different intervals to adjust her insulin dosage. She occasionally records her food intake and activities when feeling unwell to track potential effects on her glucose levels. Sarah, 49, manages her gastroparesis and diabetes by actively monitoring her glucose levels. She keeps detailed notes on her phone about her diet and activities that may impact her glucose. Sarah relies on her diabetes nurse for support, who remotely monitors her pump results and provides advice on managing her glucose levels. She is motivated to stay healthy despite the lack of a cure for gastroparesis. Tim, 56, has type 2 diabetes and hypertension. He also has a genetic disorder affecting blood vessel formation. Tim uses a glucose meter and blood pressure cuff to track his readings on his phone. He prefers using apps over a booklet provided by his nurse for recording data. Tim tracks his blood glucose and blood pressure readings using apps on his phone. He notes events and special occasions, with an option to track and display notes. Multiple data readings per day are shown on the chart. Skipping tracking during vacations caused abnormalities in his data. The effect of not tracking data is visually displayed with missing dates shown as dashed lines. Tim has stable blood pressure after changing medication and is motivated to track it. He aims for his glucose level to go below 6.5, down from 8.1 six months ago. His diabetes nurse and family physician receive his A1C test results, but he doesn't share self-collected data with them. Katy, 52, has hypertension, asthma, arthritis, chronic pain, and depression. Her asthma is mostly controlled with medication. Katy, 52, has a history of asthma, depression, and weight gain due to severe depression. She experienced dismissive treatment from her physician regarding her upper body pain, leading her to track her pain levels in an Excel sheet. Katy, 52, tracks her upper body pain using a visualization tool that represents pain intensity and type. She records pain data with side notes to investigate any relationships between time of day, activities, and pain levels. She shares this pain diary with her specialist for further analysis. Katy, 52, shares her self-collected health data with her healthcare providers to receive more tailored care. Providers react positively to patient-generated data visualizations, finding value in tracking her pain data for possible patterns or trigger factors. Providers varied in their preferences for using patient-generated data visualizations in their practices. They identified different use cases, such as patient self-experimentation, collaborative data review during clinical visits, supporting medical judgment, and understanding data through different lenses. The complex chronic care specialist, C3, believes visualization views can encourage patients to self-experiment for chronic symptom management. Patients can track and manage symptoms by experimenting to find trigger factors, making everyday life easier. C3 emphasizes the importance of visualization designs that support goal setting and tracking interventions to control symptoms. Sharing data collections with providers is also encouraged by C3. C3 believes visualization views can help patients self-experiment for chronic symptom management. Providers can assist patients in understanding correlations between variables and body mechanisms. C1 is cautious about displaying all patient data together, preferring to couple certain data points for collaborative interpretation. Providers found it useful to overlay patient data collected across different situations or days to identify patterns. For example, C3 wanted to overlap glucose data over a few days to study the impact of biking on glucose levels. C2, an endocrinologist clinician, valued a holistic visualization view of all patient data items for planning complex chronic patient care. She found displaying blood pressure and glucose levels together very helpful. C2, an endocrinologist clinician, emphasized the importance of displaying blood pressure and glucose levels together for a holistic view of patient data. She also expressed interest in seeing patients' physical activities overlaid with their health data to understand the effects of exercise. C2 encouraged patients to take notes on their emotional states and meals to provide context for the recorded data, enabling providers to make more informed medical judgments. Providers were receptive to new visualization designs, showing promise for adoption in their practice. Providers are open to alternative views of data, such as visualizations, to enhance patient understanding and support. They recognize the potential of different visualization designs for representing various health measurements. For example, one provider initially skeptical of a blood pressure tree design later suggested using it to display 24-hour blood pressure cuff machine data. Providers are exploring the use of visualizations to enhance patient understanding and support. They are considering different platforms like data booklets, websites, phone apps, and patient portals for displaying patient-generated data. The challenge lies in aligning these visualizations with current provider practices. Providers are considering various platforms like data booklets, websites, and phone apps to display patient-generated data. C3 prefers tabular booklet formats for easier trend identification, while C2 sees websites as a potential interactive platform. However, healthcare services often have restrictions on website use in clinical settings. Patients may be hesitant to share all data with one provider, opting to share only relevant information. C1 and C2 discuss sharing patient-generated data with healthcare providers. C2 suggests using personal phones for data recording, but notes limitations in visualizing all data at once. C1 proposes linking self-collected data to patient portals for easy access during clinical visits. The focus of the study was on designing visualizations to support patients in presenting their self-collected data during clinical visits. Patient interview studies revealed the complexities of individual patient data collections due to unique bodies, lifestyles, goals, and patient-provider relationships. Designing effective patient-generated data visualizations requires considering the highly individualized lifestyle, goals, and patient-provider relationships of patients. Providers also have different goals for using patient-generated data, impacting visualization design. The challenge lies in creating a solution that caters to these differences, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. The necessity to design individualized tailored visualizations for patient-provider communication is emphasized, drawing inspiration from the one-to-one interaction model in healthcare services. This approach considers the unique characteristics of each patient and their healthcare provider, moving away from a 'one-size-fits-all' mentality. Designing individualized tailored visualizations for patient-provider communication is crucial. Various attempts have been made in the literature to create visualizations for chronic conditions, such as bipolar disorder and irritable bowel syndrome. However, designing visualizations for chronic patients with self-collected data remains a challenging, wicked problem with no definitive solutions. The design study in this paper addresses a wicked problem with no definitive solutions. It includes multiple perspectives from patients and healthcare providers to shape the design problem and explore solutions. Patient-generated data during clinical visits and patients' approaches to tracking their health data were examined. The study also looked into patients' methods of recording their data and their reasoning. The solutions proposed are one of many possible. The study addresses a wicked problem with no definitive solutions, proposing multiple alternative visualizations for patient-generated data. The design process is transparent, offering insights for other researchers and designers to tackle similar challenges. Design guidelines for patient-generated data visualizations include incorporating data context in the design to allow for the inclusion of contextual information such as events, circumstances, or emotions associated with data points. This contextual data is valuable for both patients and healthcare providers in making medical decisions. Design guidelines for patient-generated data visualizations should consider patients' time commitments, allowing for customization of displayed information and input fields. Patients should be able to freely explore their data, with motivation playing a key role in tracking and presenting data to healthcare providers. Patients' motivations for data collection should be considered when designing visualizations to represent patient-generated data. Support should be provided for patients to share their data in various ways, including sharing overviews, selective views, and protected views. Visualization designs should include annotation capability and multiple views to support sharing between patients and healthcare providers. Providers need interactive functionalities to cope with messy, inconsistent, and complicated patient data collections. This includes at-a-glance data comprehension, filtering, focusing on details, and overlaying data for comparison. Patients with chronic conditions are increasingly interested in tracking and analyzing their data, but sharing it with healthcare providers is challenging due to limited time in clinical visits. The study focused on designing technological solutions to help healthcare providers present, review, and analyze patient-generated data. They gathered perspectives from healthcare providers and chronically ill patients to create tailored visualizations for patient data. This approach aims to support both patients and healthcare providers during clinical visits. The study aimed to improve patient-generated data review during clinical visits by proposing visualizations for patients and healthcare providers. The perspectives of a small number of individuals were considered, with a call for more inclusive design technologies in healthcare. The goal is to empower individuals with tailored visualizations and accumulate diverse perspectives for accessible design variations.
