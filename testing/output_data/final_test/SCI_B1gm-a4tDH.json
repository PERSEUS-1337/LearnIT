    "content": "In this study, a machine learning framework named Coordinatewise-Soft-Impute (CSI) is developed to analyze disease progression from sparse observations in the presence of confounding events. The framework leverages similarities between patients to estimate individual trajectories of disease progression and find a latent representation of progression. CSI is designed to account for events in-between observations and is guaranteed to converge to the global minimum of the optimization problem. In medical practice, accurately modeling disease progressions is crucial for prevention and treatment. Existing methods often rely on fitting curves to sparse observations, limiting solutions to low-rank structures. CSI, a machine learning framework, effectively analyzes disease progression from sparse data by leveraging patient similarities and converging to the global minimum of the optimization problem. One approach to modeling disease progression is through low-rank structures in functions, such as mixed effect models and functional principal components. Another method formulates the problem as an optimization task, like the framework proposed by Kidzi\u0144ski & Hastie (2018) using matrix completion and factorization techniques. These approaches focus on natural disease progression using targeted variables only. Existing literature on disease progression modeling often overlooks the impact of human interventions like medications and surgeries. Predictions can be inaccurate without considering the effects of different treatments chosen by patients. Kidzi\u0144ski & Hastie (2018) proposed a model that incorporates auxiliary variables to estimate disease progression, but treatments involving human decisions need to be modeled differently. This work introduces a model for tracking disease progression considering the impact of various treatments on the disease trajectory. In this work, a model called Coordinatewise-Soft-Impute (CSI) is proposed for tracking disease progression with treatment effects. The CSI algorithm is introduced for fitting the model and its theoretical and practical properties are investigated. The contribution of the work includes proposing a flexible, distribution-free model and algorithm, proving CSI's convergence to the global solution, and demonstrating its superior performance compared to existing methods on simulated and real patient data. The paper outlines the organization of the sections, including problem statement, model description, algorithm details, theoretical properties, and empirical results of CSI on simulated and real datasets. It focuses on estimating disease progression trajectories using a finite-dimensional space of functions and a fixed basis. The problem of estimating disease progression trajectories using a fixed basis in a finite-dimensional space can lead to overfitting when the number of observations per patient is less than the number of basis functions. This approach ignores similarities between curves of different patients. Two main research lines improving on this are the mixed-effect model and the matrix completion model. The linear mixed-effect model (LMM) estimates disease progression trajectories using a fixed basis with individual coefficients for each patient. Model parameters can be estimated using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, while individual coefficients can be estimated using the best unbiased linear predictor (BLUP). To address complexity with sparse observations, a low-rank structure of the covariance matrix \u03a3 can be assumed by introducing a contraction mapping A to a low-dimensional latent space. Methods based on low-rank approximations in the LMM model have been widely adopted, with different fitting algorithms proposed. One specific implementation, functional-Principle-Component-Analysis (fPCA), uses the EM algorithm for estimating model parameters and latent variables. However, the probabilistic approach of mixed-effect models, while offering theoretical advantages, can be sensitive to distributional assumptions that are hard to verify in practice. To address this bias, Kidzinski and Hastie formulated an alternative approach. In mixed-effect models, Kidzinski and Hastie approach the problem as sparse matrix completion by discretizing continuous-time trajectories into matrices. The trajectory prediction problem is then reduced to fitting a matrix W such that W B \u2248 Y. The prediction problem in mixed-effect models involves fitting a matrix W to approximate Y, with additional constraints to prevent overfitting. A common approach is to use a nuclear norm penalty in the optimization problem, with a regularization parameter \u03bb. The Soft-Longitudinal-Impute (SLI) algorithm proposed by Kidzi\u0144ski & Hastie (2018) efficiently solves this problem. In this section, the model on the effect of treatments in disease progression is introduced. The study simplifies the approach by considering treatment as a non-recurring event with an additive effect on the targeted variable. The model is based on a matrix completion framework, encoding treatment information as a zero-one matrix. Time of treatment for each patient is rounded to the closest value, and the optimization problem is formulated for building the model. The treatment information is encoded in a zero-one matrix. The goal is to estimate the treatment effect and individual coefficients based on sparse observation and surgery matrices. An optimization problem is formulated with a penalty term to avoid overfitting and exploit similarities between individuals. The problem does not have an explicit analytical solution but can be solved for either the treatment effect or individual coefficients given the other. The problem involves optimizing with a penalty term to estimate treatment effects and individual coefficients. The algorithm used iteratively is Coordinatewise-Soft-Impute (CSI), which reduces the loss function at each iteration. The Coordinatewise-Soft-Impute (CSI) algorithm is proven to reduce the loss function at each iteration and converge to the global minimizer. The proof relies on five technique Lemmas, with detailed proofs provided in Appendix A. Lemmas 1 and 2 discuss properties of the nuclear norm shrinkage operator S \u03bb. Lemma 3 shows the sequence of loss functions decreases monotonically at each iteration. The Coordinatewise-Soft-Impute (CSI) algorithm is proven to decrease the loss function monotonically at each iteration. Simulation studies illustrate its properties, comparing it with other algorithms like SLI and fPCA. The CSI algorithm, SLI, and fPCA are trained on the same basis functions with tuning parameters chosen through cross-validation. Performance is evaluated by comparing the relative squared error for different treatment effects and observation densities, as well as the mean square error between observations and estimations on a test set. The algorithms CSI, SLI, and fPCA are trained with various parameters and evaluated for performance. CSI consistently outperforms SLI and fPCA, especially as treatment effect increases. Results are shown in Table 1 and Figure 1. The performances of CSI, SLI, and fPCA were evaluated with different parameters. CSI outperforms SLI and fPCA significantly for large values of \u00b5. All three algorithms show higher MSE with smaller observation rates, with SLI suffering the most decay. fPCA and CSI remain stable with observation rate changes, indicating CSI's tolerance to low observation rates. RSE(\u03bc) using CSI is always smaller than 1%, regardless of \u03c1 and \u00b5 values. In a study comparing CSI, SLI, and fPCA algorithms, CSI consistently outperformed the others, with RSE(\u03bc) always below 1%. The study applied these methods to a dataset on motor impairment in children with Cerebral Palsy, focusing on the effects of orthopaedic surgeries. The goal was to differentiate the impact of surgeries from the natural progression of the disease. The study analyzed data from Gillette Children's Hospital patients with Cerebral Palsy, focusing on the impact of orthopaedic surgeries on gait functionality. Gait Deviation Index (GDI) values were measured at clinic visits to model individual disease progression. Surgeries were modeled as an additive effect on GDI measurements due to data insufficiency. The study tested three methods (CSI, SLI, fPCA) and compared them to benchmarks (pMean, rMean) using spline basis of K=9 dimensions and grid of T=51 points. Models were trained on patients with at least 4 visits, cross-validated, and tested with 5% validation sets. Mean square error of GDI estimations was used to compare results, running all methods 40 times on the same training set. The study compared different methods (CSI, SLI, fPCA) to benchmarks (pMean, rMean) using spline basis of K=9 dimensions and grid of T=51 points. Results showed that CSI, SLI, and rowMean provided better predictions than the null model, with CSI improving SLI by 7%. The low-rank decomposition of disease progression curves by CSI revealed 6 non-zero singular value vectors, illustrated in Figure 3a. An example of a predicted curve from patient ID 5416 is shown in Figure 3b. The study introduced a new framework, CSI, for modeling the effect of treatment events in disease progression. The framework incorporates the additive treatment effect to better predict sharp differences between observations. It is the first comprehensive model to explicitly consider treatment events and can be applied to various disciplines with sparse observations and external effects. The framework has potential extensions for further development. The study introduced a new framework, CSI, for modeling the effect of treatment events in disease progression. The framework can be extended to more complicated settings, such as different types of surgeries and correlations with disease type. It can also be used to evaluate the true effect of surgery and design statistical hypothesis testing procedures. The authors hope their work will inspire further research in estimating disease progression. The text discusses the optimization problem and proofs of Lemmas 1-4 related to the problem. Lemmas are referenced to previous studies for further details. The sequence behavior of \u00b5 is analyzed, showing convergence to a non-negative value. The sequence {W (k) \u03bb } is analyzed, yielding differences as desired. Direct calculations lead to a result derived from pairing terms. The proof involves showing convergence of the difference sequence {W } to zero. Lemmas 5 and 2 are used in the analysis, with a reference to a previous study. The loss function f \u03bb (W, \u00b5) is convex, and the limit point (\u0174 \u03bb ,\u03bc) minimizes it. The observation matrix Y is simulated with three parts: W B, \u00b5I S, and E. The procedure for generating W is described, involving sampling orthogonal matrices and diagonal matrices. The curr_chunk describes the generation of a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements s, sampling parameters, generating matrices I S and I \u2126, and setting up the observation matrix Y. The parameters \u00b5 and \u03c1 are varied in simulations."
