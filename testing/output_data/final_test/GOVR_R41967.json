    "content": "Education tax benefits have become increasingly important in federal higher education policy since 1997. For the 2017 tax year, 14 tax benefits were available for college students and their parents to help pay for higher education. In 2018, the number of benefits falls to 11 due to temporary suspensions and expirations. The benefits include credits, deductions, exclusions, and incentives, categorized into incentives for current year expenses, preferential tax treatment of student loans, and incentives for saving for college. The cost to the federal government for these benefits is estimated to be $168.5 billion by the Joint Committee on Taxation. The government estimates the cost of education tax benefits to be $168.5 billion over the 2016-2020 period. This report provides an overview of higher education tax benefits available to students and families, contrasting them with traditional student aid. It includes a history of higher education tax policy, recent legislative proposals, key features of tax benefits, and JCT estimates of revenue losses from individual tax provisions. The federal government provides financial assistance for higher education expenses through tax benefits and traditional student aid. To qualify for traditional financial aid, students submit a FAFSA to determine their federal financial aid award. Financial aid is used to pay for higher education expenses. The federal government provides financial assistance for higher education expenses through tax benefits and traditional student aid. Financial aid is used to pay for higher education expenses when they are due. Tax-based higher education assistance is typically available after expenses have been incurred, with taxpayers needing to wait until they file their federal income tax returns to claim any federal higher education benefits. Tax benefits for higher education were introduced nearly 60 years ago, initially as deductions and exclusions but now include tax credits. Eight tax benefits for education were enacted between 1954 and 1996, including scholarships, parental exemptions, business expense deductions, and employer-provided education assistance. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 eliminated the deduction for student loan interest, while the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 introduced new education tax benefits including the Hope Tax Credit, Lifetime Learning Credit, and reinstatement of the student loan interest deduction. Other exclusions and benefits were also enacted during this period. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) temporarily modified education tax benefits, including scholarships, student loan interest deduction, Coverdell education savings accounts, and penalty for early IRA withdrawals. It also extended the exclusion for employer-provided educational assistance and introduced a temporary deduction for higher education expenses. The tuition and fees deduction was extended through 2017. The Hope Credit was modified into the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) under the ARRA. The AOTC was initially in effect for 2009 and 2010, but was extended for 2011 and 2012 by the Tax Relief Act of 2010. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 made various education tax benefits permanent, extended the AOTC until 2017, and extended the tuition and fees deduction for 2012 and 2013. Subsequent acts extended the tuition and fees deduction through 2016. The PATH Act (P.L. 114-113) extended education tax benefits for 2015 and 2016, made the AOTC permanent, and changed 529 plans, student loan debt treatment, exemptions for college-age dependents, and business deductions for education expenses. It allowed tax-free withdrawals of up to $10,000 per beneficiary per year from 529 plans for tuition expenses and expanded nontaxable discharged student loan debt categories. Personal exemptions and itemized deductions were temporarily suspended. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended education tax benefits, including the tuition and fees deduction for 2017. Taxpayers cannot claim personal exemptions or itemized deductions for work-related education expenses from 2018 to 2025. The impact on tax bills will vary based on individual circumstances. Tax benefits for higher education expenses are divided into three groups: incentives for current year expenses, preferential treatment of student loan expenses, and incentives for college savings. Tax benefits for education expenses can take the form of tax credits, deductions, exemptions, or exclusions. Tax credits directly reduce taxes owed on a dollar-for-dollar basis and can be refundable or nonrefundable. Education tax credits include the Lifetime Learning Credit (nonrefundable) and the American Opportunity Tax Credit (refundable). The Opportunity Tax Credit is refundable but limited to 40% of the total credit. Tax deductions reduce taxable income by the amount of the deduction, with above-the-line deductions being more advantageous than itemized deductions. Itemized deductions are only for those who itemize all deductions, while the standard deduction is an alternative. Education tax deductions include the business deduction for work-related education expenses. Tax exemptions reduce taxable income by a fixed amount per exemption claimed, including deductions for tuition and fees, student loan interest, and work-related expenses. Each taxpayer can claim exemptions for themselves, a spouse, and dependents, similar to deductions but based on a fixed amount per person. Parents of students aged 19-23 can claim a personal tax exemption. Tax exemptions, including for students aged 19-23, are suspended from 2018 through 2025 under P.L. 115-97. Education tax exclusions cover scholarships, grants, tuition reductions, employer-provided educational assistance, cancelled student loans, and direct transfers to educational institutions. Some tax benefits have limitations, such as annual caps and qualifying expense restrictions. For example, the maximum annual American Opportunity Tax Credit claim is $2,500. Limited by qualifying expenses, some tax benefits cover tuition and required fees, while others can be used for course-related materials and travel expenses. Higher education tax benefits may have income limitations in the form of a phaseout range. Taxpayers with incomes below the range can claim the maximum benefit, with the amount decreasing for those within the range and being zero for those above it. The expiration date for temporary provisions is also provided. The JCT cost estimates for tax benefits are provided in Table 2. These estimates cannot be simply summed due to interaction effects. Summing individual tax expenditures may lead to different revenue loss estimates, making aggregate tax expenditure estimates unreliable for reflecting actual changes in federal receipts."
