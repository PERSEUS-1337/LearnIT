This includes $525.4 billion for \"base\" defense budget costs and $88.5 billion for \"Overseas Contingency Operations\" (OCO). Additionally, the request includes funding for Department of Energy defense-related programs, FBI national security programs, and other activities. The proposed FY2013 DOD budget includes $647.4 billion for national defense programs, with $613.9 billion for discretionary DOD budget authority. This budget request includes funding for Department of Energy defense-related programs, FBI national security programs, and other activities. The budget reflects a third consecutive year of decline in total defense spending, with a 23% drop in funding for war costs compared to FY2012. This reduction is due to the drawdown of U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and efforts to reduce federal budget deficits. The FY2013 DOD budget request is $5.2 billion lower than the FY2012 appropriation, marking the first decrease in Pentagon spending since 1998. The base budget request is $45.3 billion lower than projected, reflecting mandatory caps on discretionary spending. The National Defense Budget Function amounts to $639.1 billion including war costs and $550.6 billion excluding war costs, subject to limits established by the BCA. The DOD's base budget request for FY2013 reflects a significant decrease compared to previous years, with reductions totaling $259.4 billion from FY2012 through FY2017 and $486.9 billion for the period covered by the BCA (FY2012-21). This reduction is part of the Administration's plan to cut federal spending as required by the BCA, with further cuts expected over the next 10 years. The Budget Control Act (BCA) requires additional deficit reduction measures totaling at least $1.2 trillion through 2021, resulting in a total spending reduction of $2.1 trillion by FY2021. If Congress and the President do not enact legislation to reduce deficits by $1.2 trillion, automatic cuts will be triggered, including reductions to the DOD base budget. The Obama Administration's FY2013 DOD base budget plan aimed to address spending limits set by the Budget Control Act (BCA) and adjust defense planning due to the decrease in U.S. troop deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. The new strategic guidance included a decision to reduce the size of the active-duty Army and Marine Corps to align with future defense needs, particularly focusing on counter-insurgency campaigns. The Obama Administration's plan aims to reduce the active-duty force by 102,400 personnel by 2017, with a focus on counter-insurgency campaigns. Options are being preserved to reverse decisions if needed, including mobilizing reserve units and expanding the active component forces. The Obama Administration plans to reduce the active-duty force by 102,400 personnel by 2017, focusing on counter-insurgency campaigns. They aim to retain mid-rank officers and key industrial capabilities for potential future force expansion. The FY2013 budget request includes $9.6 billion in savings through efficiency initiatives like reducing printing and travel costs. The Obama Administration plans to reduce the active-duty force by 102,400 personnel by 2017, with most reductions coming from the Army and Marine Corps. This reflects a decision to forego lower priority expenditures and streamline operations. The FY2013 budget request includes $9.6 billion in savings through efficiency initiatives. The Administration's new strategic guidance aims to reduce active-duty forces for large-scale stability operations. This plan would remove 92,000 personnel added to the Army and Marine Corps since 2007. The National Guard and reserve component units would also see reductions. The plan for FY2017 includes eliminating or retiring units and major weapons systems such as Army brigade combat teams, Marine Corps battalion landing teams, Navy cruisers and amphibious landing ships, Air Force fighter squadrons, and C-5A cargo planes. The Administration aims to maintain high readiness levels for the remaining forces. Compared to the February 2011 plan, the Operation and Maintenance request for FY2013 was reduced by 3%. The new strategic guidance for the Department of Defense prioritizes deploying U.S. forces in the Pacific and Asia, reducing deployments in Europe. Plans include withdrawing two Army brigade combat teams from Germany, stationing Marines in Australia, and deploying ships in Singapore and Bahrain. Operations in the Asia-Pacific region will rely heavily on air and naval forces, leading to a potential shift of resources towards the Navy and Air Force. Some question the Administration's \"pivot\" towards Asia due to planned retirements of older cargo planes and budget cuts for shipbuilding. The Administration's refocused commitment on the Pacific region is evident in Navy procurement programs, with plans to maintain the carrier fleet at 11 ships despite budget constraints. Delay in construction of an amphibious landing transport ship (LSDX) allows for the construction of a planned helicopter carrier (LHA) to be delayed by one year to meet budget limits. The Navy's long-range shipbuilding plan includes adding an Afloat Forward Staging Base (AFSB) for minesweeping and counter-piracy missions, funded in FY2014. The FY2013 budget request for procurement and R&D is 12.5% lower than projected in 2011. Compared to FY2001, DOD's combined procurement and R&D budget in FY2010 was 60% higher. Some argue that DOD can reduce spending on acquisition due to the increased budget since FY2001, but others point out that much of the procurement was for war-related items or equipment replacements. The Administration is prioritizing weapons programs for cuts in planned spending. The Department of Defense is setting priorities among weapons programs to make cuts in planned spending, while sustaining funding for high-priority programs like the development of a new long-range bomber. The program announced in February 2012 would save $24 billion in FY2013 and a total of $94 billion over the five-year period FY2013-17 by terminating procurement of certain items and restructuring programs. The Department of Defense is making cuts in planned spending for procurement by restructuring programs and slowing production rates. The largest reduction would take $15.1 billion from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The FY2013 request also proposes cancelling certain acquisitions. The FY2013 request proposes canceling certain acquisitions and restructuring programs to reduce spending on procurement. This includes canceling a program to update electronics on C-130 cargo planes, buying fewer MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aircraft, and placing more emphasis on using proven technologies for a new long-range bomber. The FY2013 plan includes reducing funding for a new mid-air refueling tanker and slowing production of V-22 Osprey troop carriers. It also allocates $99.9 million for developing a new hull module for Virginia-class attack submarines to increase the number of land-attack cruise missiles they can carry. Additionally, the plan involves continuing construction of an $11.4 billion aircraft carrier but at a slower pace, delaying the purchase of a Virginia-class attack submarine, and postponing the design of a new ballistic missile-launching submarine. The FY2013 plan includes delaying the design of a new ballistic missile-launching submarine (SSBN(X)) to replace the Ohio-class subs retiring in 2027. The Army is requesting $640 million for a new Ground Combat Vehicle, $1.3 billion less than projected in 2011. Development of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) continues to replace the HMMWV, while a program to refurbish HMMWVs is ending earlier than planned. Budgetary limits require some reduction in military compensation to avoid excessive cuts in force size or modernization pace. The FY2013 budget plan includes proposed reductions in military compensation to avoid excessive cuts in force size or modernization pace. Service members would not face pay freezes or cuts, and reductions in annual pay raises would start in FY2015. Despite military compensation accounting for one-third of the DOD budget, the savings from these changes would only make up less than 10% of the total budget cuts projected for FY2012-2021. The plan also includes a 1.7% increase in service members' basic pay for FY2013, based on the Labor Department's Employment Cost Index. The Administration's plan for military compensation includes basic pay raises below the anticipated ECI increase for FY2015-2017, projecting a $16.5 billion saving over five years. Additionally, a commission is proposed for changes in the retirement system, and fee increases for TRICARE beneficiaries are suggested. DOD's FY2013 budget request assumes a doubling of the Military Health Program cost to $48.7 billion. The FY2013 budget request for the Military Health Program has more than doubled to $48.7 billion, with proposed fee increases for working-age retirees. The package includes pharmacy co-pays to encourage the use of generic drugs. The Administration's request for war costs is $26.6 billion less than the previous year. The FY2013 budget request for war costs is $26.6 billion less than the previous year, reflecting the end of combat operations in Iraq and reduction of troops in Afghanistan. Congress may focus on longer-term budget issues to reduce federal deficits. The Budget Control Act of 2011 required $2.1 trillion in deficit savings over 10 years. Half of the savings are on track through enforceable caps on discretionary spending, while $1.2 trillion in additional savings has not been agreed upon. Automatic spending cuts will be enforced in January 2013 if Congress does not agree on an alternative. Defense spending cuts proposed by the Administration include $487 billion over 10 years. The Administration has proposed budget cuts over 10 years, including a $45 billion cut in FY2013, potential sequester of defense funds, reduced defense spending caps from FY2014-21, setting limits on overseas operations funding, cuts to Army and Marine Corps end-strength, and other defense strategy adjustments. Congress may discuss more extensive measures. The President and Speaker of the House John A. Boehner discussed a \"Go Big\" approach for deficit reduction, but could not agree on the parameters. Independent proposals recommend savings of $4 trillion over 10 years to address long-term deficit trends. Further defense cuts may be necessary to achieve this goal, with recommendations for a $1 trillion cut in defense spending over 10 years by the Simpson-Bowles Commission. The Simpson-Bowles Commission recommended a $1 trillion cut in defense spending over 10 years, along with revenue increases to achieve $4 trillion in deficit savings. Pressure for further cuts in discretionary spending, including defense and nondefense budgets, will depend on agreements to limit mandatory spending and raise revenues. Without a \"Go Big\" budget agreement, Congress may follow past deficit reduction efforts from the late-1980s to the mid-1990s. The BBEDCA was amended multiple times in the late 1980s and 1990s, but without much success until the economy grew in the late 1990s. Congress mainly addressed the deficit through annual budget debates, leading to spending limits and occasional tax increases. Defense spending decreased for 13 years, falling by 35% compared to its peak in FY1985. A long-term budget agreement earlier on could have mitigated this decline. If an agreement to cut deficits by $1.2 trillion through FY2021 was not reached by January 2013, further cuts would be necessary. The Budget Control Act of 2011 requires an additional $1.2 trillion in deficit cuts through FY2021, with automatic spending cuts if Congress fails to reach the target. Half of the cuts must come from national defense. If no agreement is reached by January 2013, further cuts will be necessary. If no agreement on deficit savings is reached by the beginning of next year, $600 billion in net savings would be required from defense cuts over the next 9 years. The Budget Control Act assumes that reduced outlays will lower borrowing costs, with 18% of savings attributed to reduced interest costs. This would result in automatic cuts of up to $492 billion in defense spending over 9 years, or $54.7 billion annually. The total reduction in planned DOD spending could be even greater if the automatic process is implemented. The $600 billion in additional defense cuts would stem from revised annual caps on defense spending to achieve the required deficit reduction. If Congress approves the Administration's FY2013 defense budget request but does not agree on additional reductions through FY2021, automatic cuts would amount to $60 billion for FY2013. This includes $5 billion to meet the revised discretionary cap and $55 billion for deficit savings. In addition to the $45 billion already cut to meet initial targets, the total reduction compared to the planned DOD budget in 2011 would be $105 billion, representing an 18% cut from the base budget and 16% from the total. The potential $105 billion cut to the DOD budget would result in an 18% reduction from the base budget and 16% from the total budget, including war funding. Senior defense officials have warned that such a sequestration could have devastating effects on critical defense capabilities. Secretary Panetta's letter to Senators Graham and McCain in November 2011 outlined the Defense Department's concerns about sequestration, which could result in a $1.2 trillion reduction in funding. The letter overstated the potential percentage cuts, assuming a 23% reduction in each program, but this figure included cuts already planned in the Administration's FY2013 request. The sequester cuts would not only affect the base defense budget but also overseas contingency operations, defense emergency appropriations, and unobligated balances from prior years. The total amount subject to cuts would be $721 billion, with a potential 8.3% reduction if military personnel accounts are not exempted. The potential cuts under sequestration would total 8.3% if military personnel accounts are not exempted. If the President exempts the requested $149 billion for personnel accounts, the reduction applied to the rest of the budget would be 10.5%. The Department of Defense argues that equal percentage reductions in each line item would be irrational, but there is a provision for reallocating cuts among programs, projects, or activities (PPAs) under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act. The Budget Control Act allows for reallocation of cuts among programs, projects, or activities. The Office of Management and Budget has not made a final determination on whether this provision applies to targets set by the Act. Any reallocation of funds would need approval from Congress and could face objections on parliamentary grounds. A sequester of up to $60 billion in FY2013 could have consequences on readiness-related Operation and Maintenance accounts. Budget authority in readiness-related Operation and Maintenance (O&M) accounts leads to large outlays in the first year, while procurement accounts have smaller first-year outlay rates. To offset a small increase in O&M funding, significant cuts in procurement budget authority would be necessary. A sequester starting in the second quarter of the fiscal year would require reductions in unobligated funds, with larger cuts needed in the last three quarters for activities with constant spending rates. In case of a sequester, DOD may need to transfer funds among appropriations accounts to restore funds sequestered from medical programs if Congress does not approve a reallocation of cuts. Managing a reduction in funding for procurement programs could be challenging if all annual funding has been obligated before a sequester takes effect. Legal obligations made for procurement programs may pose difficulties in implementing funding reductions. If a sequester occurs, transferring funds between accounts to restore sequestered funds for medical programs may be necessary. Implementing funding reductions for procurement programs could be challenging due to legal obligations made for these programs. Transferring significant amounts out of military personnel funding to offset sequestration impacts on other budget areas could be difficult. Enlistment contracts are binding unless personnel are dismissed from service. If civilian DOD employees are furloughed due to a sequester, force readiness could be affected, leading to deep cuts in readiness-related activities. This might result in a policy of tiered readiness, with early-deploying units maintained at high readiness levels while later-deploying units face eroding training and maintenance, increasing strategic risk. Congress and DOD could take measures to address these challenges. To mitigate the impact of sequestration on force readiness, Congress and DOD could implement measures such as reducing military end-strength, increasing transfer authority for DOD, and allocating additional funding for readiness in the FY2013 appropriations bill. These actions would provide flexibility in managing cuts and preparing for potential reductions in the event of a sequester. Appropriators may consider providing higher funding levels for certain activities in case of sequestration. Acting promptly to mitigate the impact of automatic reductions is seen as crucial. However, opposition to sequestration in Congress has been the main focus, potentially hindering efforts to lessen its effects."
