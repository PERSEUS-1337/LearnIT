    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nuclear Waste Transportation Protection Amendments Act of 2002\". The Congress finds that transporting nuclear waste to a Yucca Mountain repository would involve a massive undertaking, with more waste being shipped in the first year of operations than in the entire history of nuclear waste shipments in the US. This transportation would require over 96,000 truck shipments over four decades, impacting 44 states, major metropolitan areas, and at least 109 cities with populations exceeding 100,000. The transportation of nuclear waste to a Yucca Mountain repository would impact at least 109 cities with populations exceeding 100,000 and 703 counties with a combined population of 123,000,000 people. This effort poses economic risks, property value losses, and increased security risks for vulnerable metropolitan areas. The Federal Government must ensure safety and security before any shipments occur. The Act requires the Secretary of Energy to develop a comprehensive safety program for nuclear waste shipments, exceeding current minimal protection levels. SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is amended to include a comprehensive safety program for transporting high-level radioactive waste, protecting populated communities, and prioritizing the transportation of the oldest spent nuclear fuel. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is amended to prioritize the transportation of the oldest spent nuclear fuel. Full-scale cask testing is required for transportation, with stakeholder involvement in the testing program. State, local, and tribal governments must be consulted on route selection, and private carriers are prohibited from transporting spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 prioritizes transportation of the oldest spent nuclear fuel. Transportation must involve full-scale cask testing with stakeholder involvement. Private carriers are prohibited from transporting nuclear waste. Security precautions include advance notification, armed escorts, and avoiding regular transportation patterns. Transportation of nuclear waste must be planned to minimize storage times and occur when the receiver is present to accept shipment."
