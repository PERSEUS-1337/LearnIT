    "content": "Senate Rule XXVI, known as the \"two-hour rule,\" limits the times Senate committees can meet during full Senate sessions to balance committee and floor work. Committees, except Appropriations and Budget, cannot meet after two hours of session or past 2:00 p.m. without leaders' agreement or unanimous consent. The Senate can grant permission for committees to meet by unanimous consent or leaders' agreement. Committees are often given permission to meet outside the two-hour rule after agreements are announced on the Senate floor. Staff coordinate meeting details with floor staff to ensure inclusion in unanimous consent agreements or leadership announcements. The two-hour rule's restrictions on committee meetings can be invoked as a form of protest or to delay actions. Senators can object to unanimous consent agreements for committees to meet, requiring informal communication with leadership. Senate practice involves receiving committee requests, clearing them with the minority leader, and obtaining permission from the majority leader. The majority leader (or a designee) would announce unanimous consent requests for committees to meet during the Senate session, with approval from both majority and minority leaders. If no objections were raised, the requests would be printed in the Congressional Record, indicating the need for unanimous consent for committees to convene after two hours or past 2:00 p.m. Currently, Senate committees are granted permission to sit during restricted hours by joint leadership agreement instead of unanimous consent, a departure from prior practice. Joint leadership permission has been used over 130 times since November 30, 2016, to authorize committees to meet during restricted hours. The preferred way to provide a waiver of the two-hour rule for Senate committees is through joint leadership agreement, which has been used over 130 times since November 30, 2016. Violating the rule can result in actions taken by the committee being null and void. Committees can cancel or reschedule meetings to comply with the rule. The Senate can comply with the two-hour rule by adjusting meeting times, recessing, or adjourning. Committees have held unofficial briefings or listening sessions to continue interactions with witnesses outside of official hearings. These informal gatherings lack the same powers and protections as formal hearings. Senate rules on committee meeting times have been in place for over 70 years and have evolved over time. Committee meeting times have existed for over 70 years and have evolved over time. A rule limiting committees from sitting while the Senate is in session was first enacted in 1946 to reduce scheduling conflicts between committee and floor work. All Senate committees had to cease sitting when the Senate went into session unless unanimous consent was obtained. The 1946 LRA rule limiting committee meetings while the Senate is in session was replaced in 1964 by S.Res. 111, allowing committees to meet after the morning hour or when the Senate is considering business. This amendment aimed to provide more meeting opportunities for Senate committees. Many Senators felt the 1946 LRA rule was too restrictive, hindering committees' work. Senators noted the chronic issue of committees unable to meet while the Senate is in session, leading to delays in considering important measures. The problem worsens as Congress sessions progress, with limited time for committee work due to extended Senate sessions. The 1964 amendment allowed Senate committees to meet during the first two hours of a new legislative day and immediately thereafter for routine business. The 1970 Legislative Reorganization Act further supplemented this rule. The 1970 Legislative Reorganization Act allowed Senate committees to meet during the first two hours of a new legislative day and immediately thereafter for routine business, as stated in Senate Rule XXV. Standing committees can sit for any purpose with consent from the majority and minority leaders, or a designated Senator in their absence. The 1970 Legislative Reorganization Act allowed Senate committees to meet during the first two hours of a new legislative day and immediately thereafter for routine business. The Senate Rule XXV exempted the Appropriations Committee from meeting restrictions and allowed committees to sit with authorization from the majority and minority leaders. In 1977, the Senate adopted the current two-hour rule via S.Res. 4, which included an exception for the Committee on the Budget. The Senate relocated the two-hour rule to Rule XXVI, with examples of its enforcement between 1985 and 2017 provided by CRS. The table includes dates, affected committees, proceedings summaries, and sources. Instances where the rule was intended but not enforced are not included. The CRS cannot guarantee comprehensive records of the two-hour rule being enforced due to various factors such as public action not always being necessary, variations in news reporting, and new practices affecting results. The CRS identified trends in the use of the two-hour rule, showing an increase in restrictions on committee meetings in recent years. Since 2005, there have been 47 instances of meetings being restricted, with 8 occurrences in 2017 being the highest in any year. Since 1985, the two-hour rule restrictions on committee meetings have been used mostly as a form of protest or to delay committee action, especially for judicial nominations."
