The Congress finds that the Battle of the Washita in 1868 was a significant engagement between Plains tribes and the US Army, led by Lt. Colonel Custer, resulting in over 150 Indian casualties. The battle symbolizes the tribes' struggle to maintain their traditional lifeways and the site remains culturally intact. The Cheyenne village site at the Battle of the Washita has not been significantly altered except by periodic flooding of the Washita River. The purposes of the Act are to recognize the battle as a nationally significant event in frontier military history and to establish the site as a national historic site, involving American Indian groups in planning and educational programs. The establishment of the site at the Battle of the Washita as a national historic site is the main purpose of the Act. The Washita Battlefield National Historic Site is established in Oklahoma to preserve and interpret the Battle of the Washita. It consists of approximately 326 acres and private lands under conservation easements. A map of the site is on file with the National Park Service.
