Despite progress in areas like civil society and elections, government abuses, human rights violations, political violence, and corruption remain significant challenges. The return to political stability in 2006 has led to deeper U.S.-Cambodia ties driven by mutual interests. The evolving U.S. policy towards Cambodia includes efforts to improve relations while promoting human rights. Despite challenges like government abuses and corruption, deeper ties have been driven by mutual interests, including counterterrorism and countering China's influence in the region. Areas for greater U.S. involvement in Cambodia include trade, infrastructure development, and environmental protection. Some lawmakers argue for restrictions on economic support until political freedoms and corruption are addressed. Greater U.S. engagement with Cambodia through foreign aid, trade, and diplomacy is seen as a way to counter China's influence. Cambodia is a major recipient of U.S. aid in Southeast Asia and relies on the U.S. as its largest overseas market for goods. The Cambodian government seeks preferential treatment for its garment exports and wants to use a portion of its debt payments to fund development programs. The Kingdom of Cambodia gained independence from France in 1953 under King Norodom Sihanouk's leadership. Sihanouk abdicated in 1955, becoming Prime Minister and later Prince. In 1965, he severed ties with the U.S. due to military incursions. The U.S. conducted a bombing campaign in Cambodia from 1969-1973, aiding Cambodian communists. In March 1970, General Lon Nol overthrew Prince Sihanouk's government in a coup, leading to a civil war. The Khmer Rouge defeated Lon Nol in April 1975, causing widespread devastation in Cambodia. Nearly two million Cambodians died during the Khmer Rouge's brutal reign, marked by forced depopulation and rural communes. Vietnamese forces invaded in January 1979, driving the Khmer Rouge from power. In 1979, Vietnamese forces drove the Khmer Rouge from Phnom Penh. A 13-year civil war followed, involving Khmer Rouge, Cambodian nationalist, and royalist insurgents. A U.N.-brokered peace settlement in 1991 led to elections in 1993, with Prince Sihanouk returning as king. FUNCINPEC Party won a plurality but formed a coalition government with the CPP. In 1997, tensions between Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen led to an armed takeover by Hun Sen, resulting in the death of many FUNCINPEC leaders. International pressure forced Hun Sen to allow Ranariddh to return, leading to new elections in 1998, narrowly won by the CPP. Despite election irregularities, a coalition government was formed with Hun Sen as Prime Minister and Ranariddh as President. The 105th Congress terminated bilateral assistance to Cambodia in 1997, which was not fully restored until 2007. Resolutions were passed condemning a grenade attack on opposition leader Sam Rainsy and calling for free and fair elections. Despite progress in voting institutions and civil society, issues with political, civil, and property rights persist, including extrajudicial killings, government interference in the judiciary, defamation laws restricting freedom of speech, and corruption in society and government. The Corruption Perceptions Index 2008 ranked Cambodia 166 out of 180 countries due to high levels of corruption. The ruling Cambodian People's Party, led by Hun Sen, has solidified its power through various means, while former rival FUNCINPEC has lost influence. New opposition parties, including the Norodom Ranariddh Party and the Human Rights Party, emerged in 2007. The 2008 elections were relatively peaceful, but issues like government interference in the judiciary and corruption persist in Cambodian society. In the July 2008 elections, the ruling CPP strengthened its power by winning 90 out of 123 seats in the Lower House. Opposition parties accused the CPP of vote buying and taking credit for economic projects funded by international donors.FUNCINPEC suffered a significant loss, while the SRP gained seats and formed an alliance with the HRP. The NRP only won two seats. Many analysts believe the ruling CPP in Cambodia has gained genuine popularity due to economic development and political stability. A survey showed high levels of confidence in the country's direction, but 52% reported being offered gifts by political parties during elections. Despite some improvements in the 2003 elections, experts claim the process still needs work to address issues like pre-election violence and intimidation. The 2003 election process in Cambodia needed improvement, including reducing violence, intimidation, and vote buying. The ruling CPP won 73 out of 123 seats in the National Assembly, falling short of a majority. An \"Alliance of Democrats\" was formed by FUNCINPEC and the SRP, refusing to work with the CPP unless Hun Sen stepped down. A coalition government was eventually formed in July 2004, with Hun Sen as Prime Minister and Prince Ranariddh as President of the National Assembly. Opposition MPs criticized the process. In February 2005, the National Assembly voted to revoke the parliamentary immunity of opposition leader Sam Rainsy and two SRP Members. Sam Rainsy and Chea Poch fled the country, while Cheam Channy was arrested for \"recruiting soldiers for a shadow government.\" Hun Sen also arrested civil society leaders for criticizing government policies, leading to strong condemnation from the US and international observers. The US and international observers condemned Cambodia's suspension of parliamentary immunity for opposition MPs and arrests of social and political leaders. The US Senate passed a resolution calling for the release of political prisoners. In response, the government pardoned some individuals and dropped defamation complaints against critics. However, a new law allowed MPs to be prosecuted for certain offenses despite parliamentary immunity. In the local elections of April 2007, the CPP dominated with 1,591 out of 1,621 commune governments and 70% of council seats. Despite reported election abuses, analysts saw it as a sign of CPP's strength, FUNCINPEC's decline, and SRP's rise. Cambodia's economy has shown steady growth, with improved government budget performance and foreign investment opportunities. Cambodia faces obstacles to development such as limited human resources, weak institutions, and corruption. It joined the WTO in 2004 and is part of ASEAN. Major export markets include the US, Germany, and the UK, while imports come from Thailand, Singapore, and China. Malaysia, China, and Taiwan have significant investments in Cambodia. GDP growth was 4.5% in 2008 but projected to decrease to 2.5% in 2009. Textile manufacturing, tourism, and construction are key sectors driving growth. In 2008, Cambodia saw a slowdown in garment exports and tourism due to the global economic recession. Chevron discovered oil and gas reserves in the Gulf of Thailand, sparking hopes for oil revenues to lift the country out of poverty. Potential revenues could reach $1.7 billion annually after ten years of drilling. Petroleum companies from various countries are involved in the exploration. Several countries, including the United States, Japan, China, Thailand, and South Korea, have started exploration and drilling for oil in Cambodia, with Chevron leading the development of the first oil field. However, official corruption and territorial disputes with Thailand in the Gulf of Thailand pose obstacles to Cambodia's economic development through oil. The garment industry, a significant contributor to Cambodia's economy, faces competition from more efficient manufacturers in developed countries since the end of textile export quotas in 2005. In 2007-2008, the garment industry employed nearly 350,000 workers, contributed 80% of export earnings, and represented 16% of GDP. The garment industry in Cambodia, which employed 350,000 workers and contributed 80% of export earnings, faced challenges due to the expiration of safeguard measures by the EU and the US in 2008. The global economic recession led to the closure of over 20 apparel factories and the loss of jobs for between 20,000 to 40,000 Cambodian garment workers. Clothing exports dropped by nearly 40% as a result. Clothing exports in Cambodia dropped nearly 40% in January 2009 compared to the previous year, leading to the loss of jobs for garment workers. The garment industry faced challenges due to the expiration of safeguard measures by the EU and the US in 2008. Despite efforts to promote good labor practices, the future of the industry remains uncertain. The United States has a significant economic impact on Cambodia through trade, with the US being the largest overseas market for Cambodian products. Over 98% of Cambodian goods exported to the US are textile and apparel items. Despite fluctuations, the kingdom's total exports to the US have shown growth over the years. Cambodian imports from the US are relatively limited, including road vehicles, machinery, and textile fibers. In July 2006, a bilateral trade agreement was signed between the United States and Cambodia. In July 2006, the United States and Cambodia signed a bilateral trade and investment framework agreement (TIFA) to promote economic relations. TIFAs provide forums for the discussion and resolution of bilateral trade issues as well as foundations for potential FTA negotiations. Cambodia, designated a Least Developed Country (LDC) under the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) in 1997, is pressing for trade preferences on garment exports. Foreign aid from various sources equals over half of Cambodia's government budget. Cambodia receives significant foreign aid, with major bilateral providers including Japan, the United States, Germany, France, and Australia. The Consultative Group for Cambodia, overseen by the World Bank, sets economic and political reform guidelines and provides aid packages. Despite criticism for lack of progress in fighting corruption, international donors pledged $950 million in aid for 2009. China's foreign assistance focuses on concessional loans, infrastructure projects, and natural resource investments in developing countries. China's foreign aid to Cambodia focuses on infrastructure projects and natural resource investments, with aid being mostly unconditional. China has become a significant aid provider to Cambodia, pledging the largest amount in 2009 compared to other major ODA providers like the EU and Japan. Some analysts suggest that the United States should cooperate with China to assist Cambodia with infrastructure development. The United States should cooperate with China to assist Cambodia with infrastructure and energy development, focusing on balanced and widespread development while protecting human rights and the environment. Cambodia is a significant recipient of U.S. foreign aid, with assistance channeled through NGOs for various programs including health care, HIV/AIDS treatment, civil society, and economic competitiveness. Other areas of aid include political transparency, combating transnational crime, and improving the Cambodian military's capabilities. In January 2007, the Peace Corps launched programs in Cambodia to teach English and develop sustainable community activities. Cambodia has reduced its landmine casualty rate with international assistance. U.S. aid includes support for removing unexploded ordnance and services for mine victims. Cambodia has also reduced its HIV/AIDS infection rate through educational efforts. The United States government has provided assistance in various areas to Cambodia. In February 2007, the United States lifted a ten-year prohibition on direct aid to Cambodia, following political reforms. U.S. assistance was restricted due to concerns about Prime Minister Hun Sen's actions in 1997. Aid was allowed to NGOs and local governments, but not to the central government. In August 2005, the Bush Administration allowed Foreign Military Financing for border surveillance and counterterrorism efforts in Cambodia. The country's foreign debt is $2.25 billion, with a third owed to Russia and the United States. The USDA provided $276 million in agricultural commodities on credit terms during the Lon Nol period, which was never serviced. Hun Sen's government disputes the debt amount, claiming some shipments never reached Cambodia. The United States government has waived interest and charges on some food aid shipments to Cambodia, reducing the total debt owed by $93 million. Cambodia's total debt to the U.S. government is $339 million, with the Cambodian government seeking additional concessions on Lon Nol loans. There are calls for the U.S. government to forgive or \"recycle\" Cambodia's debt through a debt-swap program. The U.S. government has waived interest on food aid to Cambodia, reducing debt by $93 million. Cambodia seeks further debt concessions, but the U.S. argues against additional relief due to Cambodia's financial stability. Cambodia's foreign policy involves major regional actors, and its human rights record is a point of contention with ODA donors. The Prime Minister of Cambodia visited New Delhi in 2007 to sign agreements with India on a $35 million loan and cooperation in various areas. Despite historical animosities, Cambodia maintains active diplomatic contacts with neighboring countries. Tensions with Thailand have arisen over border disputes, including the sovereignty of the Khmer Preah Vihear temple. The Thai-Cambodia border conflict escalated after UNESCO granted World Heritage status to a site, leading to clashes between troops in 2008 and 2009. Talks have been held to ease tensions. In 2003, Cambodian protesters attacked the Thai embassy in response to a Thai actress's comments about Angkor Wat. Hun Sen has close ties with Vietnam and China, causing internal divisions within the CPP. Many Cambodians are wary of Vietnam due to historical control over parts of their country. China has become a significant economic force in Southeast Asia, providing foreign assistance to Cambodia in various forms such as infrastructure projects, economic investments, public health support, and military assistance. Hun Sen has cultivated ties with China, which has led to internal divisions within the CPP. China's economic assistance to Cambodia includes infrastructure projects, military support, and investments. Phnom Penh backs the \"one-China\" principle in exchange for Beijing's aid. China has become a major investor in Cambodia, with over 3,000 companies operating in the country. Bilateral trade between China and Cambodia reached $1.1 billion in 2008, although Cambodian exports to China dropped by 24%. Cambodia runs a significant trade deficit with China, with about 60% of products in Cambodian markets coming from China. Chinese assistance in Cambodia has been beneficial for development, but some experts argue that it exacerbates corruption and environmental issues. China's involvement in Cambodia does not hinder its relations with other nations like the United States. The ethnic Chinese community in Cambodia has regained economic influence and facilitated Chinese investment. Roughly 3%-5% of the population are ethnic Chinese, many descendants of settlers from southern China. Before 1975, they dominated commerce in Cambodia, but faced discrimination and persecution. Some U.S. officials are concerned that increasing Chinese economic support may weaken Western countries' leverage in promoting democratic practices in Cambodia. The Chinese community in Cambodia has regained economic influence under Hun Sen. Some Cambodian Chinese are wary of growing Chinese influence and immigration. Chinese language is becoming popular, especially for business courses. Cambodia has made commendable counterterrorism efforts, but experts warn of potential problems due to economic openness and corruption. Cambodia has made significant strides in counterterrorism efforts, including arresting individuals linked to terrorist groups like Jemaah Islamiyah. The government cooperated with the United States to destroy Soviet missiles to prevent them from falling into the hands of terrorists. In 2006, a new counterterrorism law was enacted to further enhance security measures. In 2006, Cambodia enacted a new counterterrorism law with the help of Australian and British experts. A joint National Counterterrorism Committee was established in 2007. FBI Director Robert Mueller opened a Legal Attache Office for Cambodia and Vietnam in January 2008. Cambodia's Muslim population, mainly ethnic Cham people, practice a tolerant form of Islam influenced by Buddhism. Assistance from the Middle East, Malaysia, and Indonesia has helped build new mosques and religious schools in Cambodia since the early 1990s."
