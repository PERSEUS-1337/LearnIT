    "content": "SECTION 1. CREDIT FOR RECYCLING OR REMANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT. The amendment introduces a new reclamation credit under Section 46 of the Internal Revenue Code, providing a 20% credit for qualified reclamation property placed in service during the taxable year. Qualified reclamation property is defined as specific property for reclamation purposes. The term 'qualified reclamation property' refers to tangible property with a useful life of at least 5 years, eligible for depreciation, and acquired by purchase by the taxpayer for reclamation purposes. The basis of qualified reclamation property for a taxpayer is limited to $10,000,000 per year. Controlled group members are treated as one taxpayer for this limitation. The Secretary will distribute the dollar limitation among controlled group members as per regulations. Partnerships and S corporations are subject to the limitation individually. Controlled group is defined for this purpose. For the purposes of this subsection, the term 'controlled group' is defined as per section 1563(a), with 'more than 50 percent' substituted for 'at least 80 percent'. Rules similar to those in section 46 apply, and 'qualified recycling property' refers to equipment used exclusively for recycling purposes. The term 'qualified remanufacturing property' refers to equipment primarily used in rebuilding or remanufacturing used products or parts with 50% or less virgin material. The equipment must not be used primarily in a process occurring after the product or part is rebuilt or remanufactured. Coordination with rehabilitation and energy credits is required, with a special basis adjustment rule in place. The special basis adjustment rule in section 50(c) of the Code is amended to include \"reclamation credit\" along with \"energy credit\". Additionally, the section heading for section 48 of the Code is amended. The amendment to section 48 of the Code includes \"energy credit\" and \"reclamation credit\" effective for property placed in service on or after January 1, 2006. Additionally, a study on the effectiveness of recycled automobile airbags is mandated. The Secretary of Transportation will conduct a study on the safety and performance of recycled automobile airbags compared to new ones, with a report due to Congress within a year."
