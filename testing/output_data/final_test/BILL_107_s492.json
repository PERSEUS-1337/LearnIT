    "content": "Repeal of alternative minimum tax on individuals. The alternative minimum tax imposed on individuals is repealed for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2001. Conforming amendments are made to related sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Section 5(a) of the Internal Revenue Code is amended by removing paragraph (4). Subsection (c) of section 26 is amended to treat the amount as zero for non-corporate taxpayers. Paragraph (6) of section 29(b) is modified to limit the credit based on the regular tax and other credits. Paragraph (3) of section 30(b) is also amended. (6) Section 30(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to limit the credit allowed for any taxable year by the regular tax reduced by other credits. For corporations, the limitation is further reduced by the tentative minimum tax. (7) Section 32 is amended by removing subsection (h). (8) Section 53(d) is amended to define \"net minimum tax\" as the tax imposed by section 55 plus additional amounts. The tax imposed by section 55 increases by the credit not allowed under section 29 or 30 due to specific provisions. The term \"tentative minimum tax\" is defined in relation to section 55(b) as zero for non-corporate taxpayers. Section 55(b) is amended to specify the amount of tentative minimum tax for the taxable year. The alternative minimum tax for the taxable year is 20 percent of the excess of alternative minimum taxable income over the exemption amount, minus the foreign tax credit. Alternative minimum taxable income is the taxpayer's taxable income adjusted with specific provisions and increased by tax preference items. If subject to regular tax, the taxpayer is also subject to this tax. The exemption amount for the alternative minimum tax is $40,000 and will be reduced by 25 percent for taxpayers with alternative minimum taxable income over $150,000. Adjusted basis of property is also addressed in the amendments. The adjusted basis of property under the amendments is determined based on specific treatments prescribed in the code, with corresponding changes made to sections 56 and subsections within it. Section 56 of the Code is amended by redesignating subsections, section 58 is repealed, and changes are made to sections 56, 57, and 59. Section 55(b)(1)(A) is amended, section 59(a)(3) is revised, subsections (c) and (j) of section 59 are removed, section 382(l)(7) is updated, and section 641(c)(2) is modified. Sections 847, 848(i), 871(b)(1), and 877(b) of the Code are amended by striking certain references and making insertions. Additionally, subsection (a) of section 897 is revised regarding gain or loss from the disposition of a US real property interest for nonresident aliens or foreign corporations. The disposition of a United States real property interest for nonresident aliens or foreign corporations is treated as if the taxpayer were engaged in a trade or business within the United States. Various sections of the Code are amended to reflect this treatment. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2001, specifically changing sections 55(d)(3) to 55(d)(2) and section 6015(d)(2)(B) by removing \"or 55\"."
