The X-ray film must be taken by a qualified technician and interpreted by a licensed physician. Employees who test negative for tuberculosis or have no risk factors must undergo a tuberculosis risk assessment every four years. If risk factors are present, more frequent examinations may be required. Once an employee tests positive, further assessments are no longer needed, and referral for follow-up care is necessary within 30 days.
