    "content": "President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) into law on March 23, 2010. The ACA mandates most U.S. residents to obtain health insurance and establishes insurance exchanges for federal subsidies. It expands Medicaid eligibility, amends Medicare to reduce spending, imposes an excise tax on high-premium insurance plans, and makes changes to the federal tax code. Additionally, the ACA reenacts and amends the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) reenacted and amended the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA). It authorized specific Indian Health Service (IHS) activities, set national health service policies for Indians, and established health condition goals. Another report summarized major ACA changes to IHCIA and discussed provisions affecting IHS, American Indian, and Alaska Native health care access. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) sets health condition goals for the IHS service population to reduce preventable illnesses and premature deaths among American Indians/Alaska Natives. IHS, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, provides healthcare for approximately 2.2 million eligible individuals through programs and facilities on or near Indian reservations. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) authorizes specific IHS activities and sets national health service policies for American Indians/Alaska Natives. IHS operates in 35 states through 12 geographic Areas, each with an Area Office overseeing service units and facilities. Services can be provided directly by IHS or by Indian tribes/organizations through self-determination contracts. Urban Indian health projects are also funded by IHS. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) aims to raise the health status of American Indians by authorizing specific IHS activities and policies. It allows direct collections from Medicare, Medicaid, and insurers, grants funding to UIOs, expands the healthcare workforce, and addresses health concerns. The IHCIA Reauthorization and Extension Act under the ACA includes two titles amending IHCIA provisions. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) includes two titles. Title I amends the eight IHCIA titles, while Title II reauthorizes the Native Hawaiian Health Care Act for Native Hawaiians.

It exempts ITs and TOs using dental health aides from certain instructional requirements in states allowing midlevel health providers. The Secretary, through IHS, is tasked with facilitating dental health aide programs and is prohibited from replacing certified dentists with aides. This section also introduces a new IHCIA section for Health Professional Chronic Shortage Demonstration Programs. The Demonstration Programs under 25 U.S.C. \u00a71616p fund IHPs to address health professional shortages, with an advisory board requirement. A new IHCIA Section 124 exempts THP or UIO employees from certain fees. Subtitle B amends IHCIA Title II for specific health programs and activities. The ACA amends various health programs and authorizes a report on contract health services funding. It allows the use of funds from the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund to address health deficiencies and backlogs in care provision for tribes. The ACA authorizes the use of funds from the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund to address health deficiencies, eliminate backlogs in care provision, and meet health needs efficiently for tribes. It also aims to eliminate inequities in funding, augment IHS capabilities, and allocate funds among service units and Tribal Health Programs. The section establishes the Catastrophic Health Emergency Fund (CHEF) to address extraordinary medical costs for victims of disasters or catastrophic illnesses. Administered by the Secretary through IHS headquarters, CHEF replaces IHCIA Section 202 and specifies its uses, administration, and regulations. The Catastrophic Health Emergency Fund (CHEF) is established to address extraordinary medical costs for victims of disasters or catastrophic illnesses. It consists of appropriations and third-party reimbursements for treatments paid for by CHEF.

The section prohibits interference from state or local laws, insurance policies, or health care plans in preventing the right of recovery for damages. It allows the United States, ITs, and TOs to enforce recovery rights through civil actions or separate proceedings. The Federal Medical Care Recovery Act allows the United States, Indian Tribes, and Urban Indian Organizations to recover the reasonable value of health services provided from tortfeasors or their insurers. Recovery is prohibited from self-insurance plans but allowed from tribes with specific authorization. Prevailing plaintiffs are awarded attorney fees and costs, and health insurance entities cannot deny reimbursement based on claim format. Urban Indian Organizations have the same recovery rights as Indian Tribes. The Federal Medical Care Recovery Act grants UIOs the same rights of recovery as ITs and TOs for the populations they serve. Reimbursements for health services provided by IHS, ITs, TOs, or UIOs must be credited to the respective entity and used as specified under IHCIA Section 401.

It authorizes the Secretary to consult with ITs on funding formulas, negotiate regulations, and fund construction and maintenance of healthcare facilities, water supply, sewage, and solid waste disposal systems. The ACA sets new requirements for building and renovating health care facilities for American Indians and Alaska Natives, including demonstration projects for mobile and modular health facilities. IHS maintains a priority system for facility construction, but funding constraints may lead to projects being completed in phases, causing delays and increased costs. The ACA mandates the Secretary, through IHS, to maintain a health care facility priority system for tribal needs, with a methodology for prioritization and the ability to nominate new projects every three years. The system includes the top 10 priority facilities for specified types and integrates planning, design, and construction of facilities under ISDEAA. Projects meeting criteria in the FY2008 IHS budget justification are not affected by a new facility priority system. The FY2008 IHS budget justification ranks top 10 facilities for specified types, establishes advisory boards, and requires annual reports on facility needs and costs.

Subtitle D amends IHCIA's Title IV to authorize IHS health care facilities to receive reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid programs. These reimbursements, totaling approximately $1.1 billion in FY2014, are crucial for funding services at IHS facilities. Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements are excluded from annual Indian health appropriations, providing additional support for IHS-funded facilities. The ACA makes changes to IHS-funded facilities' billing abilities for SSA programs, CHIP, Medicare, and Medicaid. It also includes provisions to increase American Indian and Alaska Native enrollment in these programs. Additionally, there are sections related to private insurance and coordination between IHS, VA, and DOD. The ACA includes provisions related to IHS-funded facilities' billing for SSA programs, CHIP, Medicare, and Medicaid. It prohibits the Secretary from favoring Indians with Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP coverage over those without. Medicare and Medicaid payments to IHS facilities must be placed in a special fund held by the Secretary, with 100% of reimbursed amounts going to each IHS service unit. The special fund is to be used for facility improvements to meet Medicare or Medicaid requirements. The ACA mandates that IHS facilities use excess reimbursed amounts to address health resource deficiencies of Indian tribes and improve facility conditions. THPs can elect to directly bill Medicare, Medicaid, or other payors, with payments used for facility improvements or additional healthcare services. The section requires THPs to comply with auditing requirements for direct payments and IHP, share provider enrollment numbers with IHS, and implement administrative changes for direct billing and reimbursement.
