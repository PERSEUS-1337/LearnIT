    "content": "PETITIONS CLAIMING UNREASONABLY HIGH AIR FARES OR INADEQUATE AIR CARRIER COMPETITION AT AIRPORTS. Section 41712 of title 49, United States Code is amended to include provisions for investigating petitions claiming unreasonably high air fares or inadequate air carrier competition at airports. If the Secretary receives such a petition, a public hearing must be held within 90 days of receiving the petition. The amended Section 41712 of title 49, United States Code includes provisions for investigating petitions regarding high air fares or lack of competition at airports. A public hearing must be held in the community served by the airport if requested in the petition. Air carriers must provide necessary fare information to the Secretary. Sponsors of airports and air carriers have the opportunity to testify at the public hearing. The Secretary will issue written findings within 60 days of a public hearing on a petition regarding high air fares or lack of competition at airports. Findings will include whether fares and air carrier costs at the airport are higher than at comparable airports in the Nation. The Secretary will issue findings within 60 days of a public hearing on high air fares or lack of competition at airports. Findings will address barriers to entry for air carriers, marketing practices affecting costs and fares, and potential programs to assist airports in attracting carriers and reducing fares. The Secretary may decide not to conduct subsequent investigations and public hearings at airports if a petition has been previously reviewed. Reports on investigation results must be transmitted to Congress every 180 days. The Secretary shall review marketing practices of air carriers that may hinder quality, affordable air transportation services to airports, including marketing arrangements, code-sharing partnerships, and frequent flyer programs. Nothing in this subsection allows the Secretary to set or invalidate air transportation fares. The Secretary will review marketing practices of air carriers that could impact air transportation services at airports, including frequent flyer programs, computer reservation displays, gate arrangements, exclusive dealing, and other similar practices. If hindrances are found, regulations will be issued to address these practices."
