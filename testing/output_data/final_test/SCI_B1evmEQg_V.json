On Twitter, sentiment towards climate change was analyzed in response to five natural disasters in the U.S. in 2018. Results showed tweets could be classified with over 75% accuracy, and hurricanes in 2018 led to a significant increase in tweets affirming climate change. Twitter sentiment towards climate change was analyzed in response to natural disasters in 2018, showing that tweets could be classified with over 75% accuracy. Hurricanes in 2018 led to a significant increase in tweets affirming climate change, but this effect did not hold for the 2018 blizzard and wildfires studied. Previous work has focused on tracking climate change sentiment over time, finding correlations with seasonal effects, and clustering Twitter users based on climate mentalities. However, these studies lack scalability with training data, do not use recent sentiment analysis tools like neural nets, and do not consider unbiased comparisons pre- and post-climate events for a more concrete evaluation. This paper introduces a novel method using machine learning to predict tweet sentiment accurately. It quantifies unbiased outcomes by comparing sentiments within the same cohort of Twitter users before and after natural disasters. Tweets affirming climate change are labeled as \"positive\" samples, while tweets denying climate change are labeled as \"negative\" samples. Data were collected from Twitter for analysis. The data for the study was collected from Twitter in two batches using the \"twint\" scraping tool. The first batch consisted of \"influential\" tweets related to blizzards, hurricanes, and wildfires, while the second batch included \"event-related\" tweets. Influential tweeters were defined as individuals with a classifiable sentiment on the topic, such as Al Gore for positive samples and @ClimateHiJinx for negative samples. The study collected data from Twitter in two batches using the \"twint\" scraping tool. The first batch included influential tweets related to blizzards, hurricanes, and wildfires. The second batch consisted of event-related tweets for five natural disasters in the U.S. in 2018. The influential tweeters were used to label tweets, resulting in a total of 16,360 influential tweets. Tweets for each disaster were scraped starting two weeks before the event and ending two weeks after. The study collected data from Twitter in two batches using the \"twint\" scraping tool. The first batch included influential tweets related to blizzards, hurricanes, and wildfires. The second batch consisted of event-related tweets for five natural disasters in the U.S. in 2018. Summary statistics on the downloaded event-specific tweets are provided. The number of tweets prior to the California fires was small due to their unpredictable nature. Geographic analysis was performed on event-related tweets, including 840 pre-event and 5,984 post-event tweets. A model for predicting sentiments of event-related tweets was created using influential tweets divided into training and validation datasets. The study collected event-related tweets from Twitter for five natural disasters in the U.S. A test set was formed by manually labeling a subset of 500 tweets, with the RNN pre-trained using GloVe word embeddings achieving the highest test accuracy. A one-layer LSTM model with dropout and ReLU activation surpassed traditional machine learning methods, with a 13-point difference between validation and test accuracies noted. The study focused on analyzing event-related tweets from Twitter for natural disasters in the U.S. Influential Twitter users who believe in climate change were primarily politicians or news sources. This skewed the model towards false negatives, and finding more representative users could improve accuracy. The study also aimed to compare users' sentiments before and after each disaster. The breakdown of positive tweets for specific events was provided. The study analyzed event-related tweets from Twitter for natural disasters in the U.S. Influential Twitter users skewed the model towards false negatives. Comparing users' sentiments before and after each disaster was a goal. Positive tweets breakdown for specific events included Bomb Cyclone (34.7%), Mendocino Wildfire (80.4%), Hurricane Florence (57.2%), Hurricane Michael (57.6%), and Camp Fire (70.1%). Geographic user information was used for a subset analysis. Clustering results on sentiments, latitude, and longitude showed four major U.S. regions. Average sentiments confirmed prior knowledge, with the Southeast and Midwest having lower average sentiments than the West Coast and Northeast. Positive tweets mainly came from liberal hubs.

Average sentiments confirmed prior knowledge, with the Southeast and Midwest having lower average sentiments than the West Coast and Northeast. Positive tweets mainly came from liberal hubs. The majority of positive tweets came from traditionally liberal hubs like San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin, while negative tweets were more prevalent in the Philadelphia metropolitan area. Rural areas tended to have more negative sentiment post-event, while urban regions had more positive sentiment. Coastal cities were more aware of climate change. The mapping exercises supported the labeling of influential tweets as reasonable. The final method compared average Twitter sentiment pre-event to post-event.

The average tweet sentiment for users who tweeted before and after the event showed minimal movement post-event, with Hurricane Florence and Hurricane Michael having significant differences in sentiment averages pre-and post-event within the same group of users. The study analyzed event-related tweets from Twitter for natural disasters in the U.S. Positive sentiment increased within cohorts for Hurricane Florence and Hurricane Michael, while Mendocino wildfires saw a decrease in overall sentiment but an increase within cohorts. Overall averages are not robust for sentiment analyses. Bomb Cyclone tweets mostly had negative sentiment, with a slight increase post-event. The study found that Cyclone tweets had negative sentiment, but sentiment increased slightly post-event. In contrast, California Camp Fires resulted in a significant decline in sentiment, attributed to low pre-event tweets and the quick link to PG&E. The study acknowledges limitations in using Twitter data for sentiment analysis. The study acknowledges limitations in using Twitter data for sentiment analysis, such as the negativity of Twitter users and the lack of consideration for aggregate effects of natural disasters over time. There is a need to explore whether social networks can predict environmental metrics in a \"nowcasting\" fashion as climate change intensifies. The predictive power of the current model regarding climate change sentiments and natural disasters remains uncertain."
