    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Recreational Fishing and Hunting Heritage and Opportunities Act\". It includes findings related to recreational activities. Congress finds that recreational fishing and hunting are important traditional activities with millions of participants who support wildlife conservation. These activities are environmentally beneficial and can be provided on Federal lands without adverse effects. Anglers, hunters, and sporting organizations contribute volunteer time and effort to conservation efforts. Recreational anglers, hunters, and industries contribute billions of dollars for fish and wildlife conservation through purchases of licenses, permits, and equipment. Recreational shooting is a valid activity on Federal lands and helps recruit and retain hunters. Recreational shooting on Federal lands helps recruit and retain hunters, contributes to wildlife conservation, and supports fishing and hunting opportunities as recognized by Executive Orders. Declining participation in these activities negatively impacts conservation efforts and funding. The curr_chunk is a section titled \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" In this Act, \"Federal public land\" refers to land or water managed by the Bureau of Land Management or the Forest Service. \"Federal public land management officials\" include the Secretary of the Interior, Director of the Bureau of Land Management, Secretary of Agriculture, and Chief of the Forest Service. \"Hunting\" is defined as the lawful pursuit, shooting, capture, or collection using a firearm, bow, or other authorized means. The Act defines \"hunting\" as the pursuit, shooting, capture, or killing of wildlife, excluding the use of skilled volunteers to cull excess animals. \"Recreational fishing\" is defined as the pursuit, capture, collection, or killing of fish, while \"recreational shooting\" encompasses various forms of sport, training, and competition. Recreational shooting involves sport, training, competition, and the use of firearms or a bow and arrow. SEC. 4. RECREATIONAL FISHING, HUNTING, AND SHOOTING. Federal public land management officials must facilitate access to Federal public lands for fishing, sport hunting, and recreational shooting, except where limited by national security, public safety, or resource conservation reasons, or by specific Federal statutes prohibiting such activities on certain lands. The head of each Federal public land management agency must support recreational fishing, hunting, and shooting opportunities in accordance with applicable laws and state regulations. Planning documents must evaluate the effects on these activities. Land planning documents must evaluate the effects on recreational fishing, hunting, and shooting opportunities. No action taken under this Act or the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act shall be considered a major Federal action affecting the environment. Federal public land management officials are not required to consider the existence or availability of recreational fishing, hunting, or shooting opportunities on adjacent or nearby public or private lands in the planning for or determination of which Federal public lands are open for these activities. This applies to lands under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service, including Wilderness Areas and Wilderness Study Areas. Areas designated as wilderness or suitable for wilderness activities are generally open to recreational fishing, hunting, and shooting unless closed by the managing Federal agency for reasons such as resource conservation, public safety, or national security. Shooting ranges may also be established in these areas. The head of each Federal agency shall lease or permit lands for shooting ranges and designate specific lands for recreational shooting activities, with limitations on liability for the United States. In designated Federal wilderness areas, opportunities for hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting are allowed to meet minimum administration requirements, but without permitting commodity development, motorized access, or permanent road construction. In designated Federal wilderness areas, hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting are permitted for minimum administration needs, without allowing commodity development, motorized access, or permanent road construction. The Wilderness Act reaffirms that wilderness purposes are supplemental to the underlying Federal land unit purposes. Federal agencies must implement fish and wildlife conservation programs in a way that enhances these purposes without impeding the underlying land purposes. In designated wilderness areas, hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting are allowed without enabling commodity development, road construction, or permanent use. Federal agencies must report closures of public land for these activities biennially to the House and Senate committees. Closures or Significant Restrictions of 640 or More Acres require publication of notice by the head of the Federal agency before taking effect. Withdrawals or changes must demonstrate coordination with a State fish and wildlife agency and submit written notice to the appropriate committees. Aggregate effects closing or restricting 1,280 acres are treated as a single withdrawal. Emergency closures by Federal land management agencies are not prohibited. The Act prohibits federal land management agencies from establishing emergency closures or restrictions unless necessary for public safety, conservation, or national security. It does not affect National Park Service units and does not prioritize recreational activities over other land uses. Federal agencies must consult with councils when fulfilling their duties. The Act allows Federal agencies to consult with advisory councils established in Executive Orders. It also clarifies that States have authority over fish and wildlife management on their land, including Federal public land. Federal agencies cannot require licenses for fishing, hunting, or trapping on State or Federal public land. The Migratory Bird Stamp requirement under the Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp Act does not affect States' authority over fish and wildlife management on their land."
