    "content": "President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) on March 23, 2010, which was later amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. ACA established new federal requirements for private health insurance, including selling and renewing policies to all individuals, coverage for preexisting conditions, and preventive services. Premiums can vary based on age, family size, geographic area, and tobacco use. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires most U.S. citizens and legal residents to have health insurance that meets minimum essential coverage standards. It also establishes private health insurance marketplaces where individuals and small employers can shop for qualified health plans that cover essential health benefits like emergency services, hospital care, preventive care, and prescription drugs. Young adults up to age 26 can stay on their parents' health plans. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides refundable tax credits for individuals and families with incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level to help offset the cost of purchasing insurance coverage. Concerns have been raised by veterans and Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs) about how the ACA would affect TRICARE beneficiaries and veterans receiving care through the VA health care system. The ACA's impact on TRICARE and VA health care beneficiaries has raised concerns among veterans groups. Congress has introduced legislation to address these concerns. TRICARE serves over 9 million eligible beneficiaries, including active duty personnel and their dependents. TRICARE provides health care services to eligible beneficiaries, including active duty personnel, Reserve Component members, retirees, and their dependents. It offers three options for non-Medicare eligible individuals: TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Standard, and TRICARE Extra. TRICARE is administered regionally and utilizes civilian providers for care. Eligible individuals can also enroll in Medicare Part B for additional coverage. The TRICARE for Life Program provides \"wrap-around\" coverage for Medicare Part B enrollees, covering costs not paid by Medicare. Other options include TRICARE Reserve Select and TRICARE Retired Reserve. The Continued Health Care Benefit Program offers coverage when regular TRICARE ends. The VA operates the largest integrated health care system in the nation. Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP are publicly funded programs with services delivered by private providers, while the VA system is different. The VA health care system is a veteran-specific national system where the federal government owns facilities and employs providers. Eligibility is based on veteran status, service-connected disabilities, income, and other factors. Care can also be provided by private-sector providers. All enrolled veterans receive a standard medical benefits package without paying premiums or enrollment fees. Most veterans do not pay premiums or enrollment fees for VA health care. However, copayments are required for nonservice-connected conditions, except for those rated 50% or more service-connected disabled. VA may collect charges from third-party insurers for medical care. VA health care covers only a select group of dependents through CHAMPVA. CHAMPVA is a program that provides health care services to dependents and survivors of certain veterans who are permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected condition. Eligibility includes being the spouse or child of a disabled veteran, or the surviving spouse or child of a veteran who died from a service-connected disability. The ACA does not impact TRICARE administration, benefits, eligibility, or costs. It does allow certain individuals to enroll in Medicare Part B through TRICARE for Life. TRICARE for Life was established by the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act of 2001 to provide supplemental coverage to Medicare-eligible military retirees, spouses, children, and widow/widowers. TRICARE for Life (TFL) is a program that acts as a secondary payer to Medicare, providing supplemental coverage to TRICARE-eligible beneficiaries entitled to Medicare Part A. To participate in TFL, beneficiaries must enroll in and pay premiums for Medicare Part B. Those who decline Part B lose TRICARE benefits, but can enroll later with a penalty. The ACA waives the Part B late enrollment penalty for military retirees, spouses, and dependent children eligible for TRICARE. The ACA waives the Part B late enrollment penalty for military retirees, spouses, and dependent children eligible for TRICARE. The Secretary of Defense is required to identify and notify individuals of their eligibility for the Special Enrollment Period (SEP) for Medicare Part B. The only provision in ACA affecting beneficiary eligibility under TRICARE. DOD expects minimal costs to implement ACA provisions. ACA does not impact current VA health care benefits, eligibility, or cost. The ACA does not affect current VA health care benefits, eligibility, or cost. However, the VA anticipates an increase in enrollment due to the individual shared responsibility provision in the ACA. This increase is expected to come from eligible non-enrolled veterans enrolling in the VA health care system to avoid the shared responsibility payment. Additionally, the ACA includes provisions related to the VA, such as reporting requirements on the effect of certain fees and taxes imposed by the ACA on the VA health care system. The ACA includes provisions related to the VA, such as exemptions from certain fees and taxes, access to the National Practitioner Data Bank, and participation in the Interagency Working Group on Health Care Quality. TRICARE is generally considered minimum essential coverage under the ACA, but there are exceptions for premium tax credits. Enrollment in the VA health care system also meets the minimum essential coverage standard. The ACA requires individuals to have minimum essential health coverage starting January 1, 2014, with defined coverage options including VA Health Care, Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, TRICARE, Peace Corps, employer-sponsored plans, and more. TRICARE is considered minimum essential coverage, but there are exceptions for premium tax credits. The TRICARE Affirmation Act amended the Internal Revenue Code to confirm TRICARE coverage as meeting the minimum essential coverage requirements under the ACA. Additionally, the Spina Bifida Health Care Program and the Children of Women Vietnam Veterans Health Care Program were clarified to meet the minimum essential coverage requirement. The VA administers the Spina Bifida Health Care Program (SBHCP) for children diagnosed with spina bifida of veterans who served in Vietnam or Korea. The program provides comprehensive medical care except for conditions associated with spina bifida occulta. Similarly, the VA administers the Children of Women Vietnam Veterans Health Care Program (CWVV) for certain birth defects resulting in permanent disability of the biological child of a woman veteran who served in Vietnam. Veterans and certain beneficiaries eligible for VA health care may qualify for premium tax credits if not enrolled in the VA system. TRICARE beneficiaries not enrolled in specific programs may also be eligible. IRS regulations state that individuals are only considered eligible for VA coverage if they are actually enrolled. This includes veterans in the VA system and certain beneficiaries in CHAMPVA and Spina Bifida programs. Certain beneficiaries enrolled in CHAMPVA and Spina Bifida programs may not be eligible for premium tax credits. Veterans eligible for VA health care but not enrolled can receive tax credits for a health insurance plan. TRICARE beneficiaries not enrolled in specific programs may also qualify for tax credits. The ACA provision extending coverage to dependent children until age 26 does not apply to TRICARE beneficiaries. The TRICARE Young Adult Program allows children up to age 26 to purchase TRICARE coverage if they lose coverage under a parent's policy. Eligibility for TRICARE is lost when a dependent child turns 23 or 21. The ACA extends coverage for dependent children until age 26, but this provision does not apply to TRICARE beneficiaries. The TRICARE Young Adult Program allows children up to age 26 to purchase TRICARE coverage if they lose coverage under a parent's policy. TRICARE coverage is governed by Chapter 55 of Title 10, United States Code, and only includes dependents under 21 or up to 23 if enrolled in full-time higher education. The Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act extended coverage to children up to age 26 who are not eligible for employer-sponsored plans. Premiums are determined by the Secretary of Defense on an actuarial basis, and the program is effective retroactively. The TRICARE Young Adult Program allows children up to age 26 to purchase coverage if they lose it under a parent's policy. Premiums are determined by the Secretary of Defense on an actuarial basis, effective retroactively from January 1, 2011. Monthly premiums for 2014 are $180 for TYA Prime and $156 for TYA Standard. As of June 2012, there were around 11,171 beneficiaries in TYA Standard and 6,407 in TYA Prime. The program differs from ACA coverage, which extends dependent coverage for adult children up to age 26. The ACA provision extends health insurance coverage to dependent children until age 26, but this does not apply to CHAMPVA beneficiaries. CHAMPVA eligibility is typically lost when a child turns 18, unless they are a full-time student, or under other specific circumstances. The ACA also specifies that group health plans must continue to offer coverage for adult children. The ACA extends coverage for dependent children until age 26, but this does not apply to CHAMPVA beneficiaries. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to extend CHAMPVA coverage for eligible dependent children up to age 26. The proposed legislation, S. 325, aims to extend CHAMPVA coverage for eligible dependent children up to age 26, aligning it with provisions in the Affordable Care Act. VA supports this change contingent on additional funding from Congress. The bill, S. 325, aims to extend CHAMPVA coverage for eligible dependent children up to age 26, aligning it with provisions in the Affordable Care Act. The bill would ensure that CHAMPVA eligibility is not limited for individuals who became permanently incapable of self-support before age 18. It would not extend eligibility for children eligible for employer-sponsored health plans before January 1, 2014. This provision aligns with the discretion provided to grandfathered health plans under the Affordable Care Act. The bill S. 325 aims to extend CHAMPVA coverage for eligible dependent children up to age 26, aligning it with provisions in the Affordable Care Act. VHA estimates that this provision would cost $51 million in FY 2014; $301 million over 5 years; and $750 million over 10 years. ACA imposes an annual fee on certain manufacturers and importers of branded prescription drugs and a new excise tax of 2.3% on the sale of medical devices. The Affordable Care Act imposes a tax on the sale of medical devices by manufacturers, exempting certain items like eyeglasses and hearing aids. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs conducted a study on the impact of ACA provisions on veterans' access to medical devices and prescription drugs. TRICARE and VA health care are not subject to the high-value plan excise tax under ACA. TRICARE and VA health care are exempt from the high-value plan excise tax imposed by the Affordable Care Act on government plans primarily for civilian employees. This exemption is due to the specific language in the Internal Revenue Code provision that limits the tax to government plans established for civilian employees. The excise tax on high-value health plans, as per the Affordable Care Act, exempts TRICARE and VA health care. The tax, effective from 2018, imposes a 40% tax on health insurance benefits exceeding certain thresholds."
