    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Eating Healthy at School Act of 2010\". Congress finds that information about school meal quality is crucial for maximizing the national investment in school meal programs and assessing compliance with Federal standards. This assessment will improve child health, nutritional quality of meals, contribute to research, and enhance oversight of the programs. The School Nutrition Dietary Assessment Study-III revealed insights into the meals served in the 2004-2005 school year. In the school year 2004-2005, school meals met nutrient standards but were high in fat, saturated fat, and sodium. Reviews only assessed lunches in 1 school per authority every 5 years, excluding breakfasts and non-program foods. The Institute of Medicine recommends changes to school meals to align with Dietary Guidelines for Americans, requiring new approaches to menu planning and quality monitoring. Simplified and more effective methods are needed for reviewing school meals under the healthy children initiative. The quality of food sold in schools can impact national investment in school meals. Gaps in Federal requirements for program integrity reviews hinder the identification and correction of meal counting errors. Program integrity reviews are not mandatory for the school breakfast program, leading to higher errors compared to the school lunch program. SEC. 3. COMPLIANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY STUDY. The Secretary of Agriculture will conduct a study to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of administrative review systems for local educational agencies participating in school lunch and breakfast programs to ensure compliance with nutrition, eligibility, meal counts, and reimbursement provisions. The Secretary of Agriculture will conduct a study to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of administrative review systems for local educational agencies participating in school lunch and breakfast programs. This includes provisions related to nutrition, eligibility, meal counts, and reimbursement. Local educational agencies are accountable for compliance. Additionally, alternative processes and procedures will be designed and tested to improve effectiveness and efficiency, with the goal of establishing a more effective administrative review system based on the results of these tests. The Secretary of Agriculture will conduct a study to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of administrative review systems for local educational agencies participating in school lunch and breakfast programs. Alternative processes and procedures will be considered, taking into account practicality and implementation costs. A report will be submitted to relevant committees three years after the enactment of the Act, detailing the study results and recommendations. The Secretary of Agriculture may prescribe necessary regulations for implementation. The Secretary of Agriculture will receive $3,500,000 from the Treasury to establish an efficient administrative review system for school lunch and breakfast programs. The funds will be used without further appropriation and will remain available until expended."
