    "content": "The Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS, is a well-funded terrorist organization that finances military operations in Iraq and Syria. It controls territory and uses internal funding sources, making it difficult to combat its financial strength. The Islamic State controls various public resources and infrastructure in Iraq and Syria, allowing it to have a diverse financial portfolio. These resources include oil, antiquities, agriculture, energy, and water utilities. The group also engages in activities like kidnapping for ransom and looting state banks for profit. Targeting the Islamic State's finances is a key strategy to degrade and defeat the organization. The U.S. strategy to counter Islamic State's finances focuses on disrupting funding sources, restricting access to financial systems, and imposing sanctions on leaders. Collaboration with international partners is also emphasized for financial intelligence. Military airstrikes have impacted IS's financial profile. Counterterrorist financing policy responses are still in early stages despite changes in the organization's financial profile. Policymakers are struggling to develop effective strategies to combat IS financing, balancing tactics with potential economic harm to civilian populations in IS-controlled areas. International efforts, led by the United States, Italy, and Saudi Arabia, are focused on gathering information and understanding IS's financial capabilities through the Counter-ISIL Finance Group. The Counter-ISIL Finance Group, co-led by the United States and Saudi Arabia, met for the first time in March 2015. International efforts, authorized by United Nations Security Council Resolutions, are focused on combating IS financing, with a report by the Financial Action Task Force detailing IS financing typologies. U.S. officials emphasize that efforts to counter IS financing are ongoing and require further refinement, with no immediate success expected. The Obama Administration has not requested new authorities from Congress specifically for this purpose. The U.S. House Committee on Financial Services has been evaluating U.S. efforts to target IS financing and combat terrorist financing. In March 2015, a bipartisan Task Force was established to investigate terrorism financing issues. The Islamic State organization succeeded Al Qaeda in Iraq and supported the establishment of Al Nusrah Front in Syria. The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) was formed through a merger of ISI and ANF, despite opposition from Al Qaeda. After conflicts with ANF and other Syrian opposition forces, ISIL declared an Islamic caliphate in 2014. The Islamic State, headquartered in Raqqah, Syria, operates in northeastern Syria and northwestern Iraq. With an estimated 20-32,000 fighters, the group has gained control over a large area along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. They have carried out brutal attacks, including beheading Americans and encouraging lone-wolf attacks in Europe and the United States. The Islamic State's financing system is likely influenced by its predecessor organizations, relying on foreign fighters, local donations, conflict loot, oil revenue, agricultural production, ransom payments, and external donors for funding. The RAND study analyzed the finances of AQI in Anbar province during its peak power in 2005 and 2006. Regional financial managers had autonomy in budget decisions due to locally sourced revenue streams like theft and resale of goods. The group did not primarily profit from oil smuggling or wealthy foreign donors. Funds were transferred through cash couriers, and profits were redistributed to other provinces and possibly to senior Al Qaeda leadership. The study found that AQI lacked substantial cash reserves and relied on consistent cash flows for daily operations, including salaries. A captured battlefield document highlighted the importance of effective financial management for AQI's operations, criticizing Al Qaeda's failure to distribute funding among local cells and lack of a regular funding source. Limited internal Islamic State documents have been captured by U.S. and Iraqi forces, with a trove of documents recovered by Iraqi special forces in June 2014. In June 2014, Iraqi special forces recovered documents during a raid that killed the Islamic State's military chief of staff. The material included details of the group's leadership structure and financial activities. The Islamic State's revenue generation increased significantly, from $1 million per month in 2008-2009 to the same amount or more per day in 2014. Before the Syrian government protests in 2011, the oil sector was vital to the economy, providing 25% of government revenues and 45% of exports. Syria produced 400,000 barrels per day, exporting 150,000 barrels mainly to Europe. However, combat since 2011 has damaged the sector due to sanctions and decreased demand for exports. Since 2011, sanctions have severely impacted Syria's oil production, reducing it to 20,000 barrels per day, with official exports now at zero. The country has become a net importer of petroleum products, as oil facilities have been damaged by fighting. International oil companies have suspended operations, leading to a shortage of trained personnel and equipment. Oil export facilities are under government control, while producing areas are under rebel control, making a political settlement necessary for exports to resume. The Syrian oil sector suffered damage between March 2011 and June 2014 due to IS forces expanding control in northeast Syria. IS uses oil for various purposes, including fueling vehicles and civilian use. They sell crude oil to finance their operations, transporting it by truck to the Turkish border for sale to oil brokers. Due to sanctions and limited market access, IS oil is sold at a discounted price. The Islamic State sells crude oil at a discounted price, with reports of prices as low as $18 per barrel at the Turkish border. The fall in world oil prices has further reduced their net earnings. Control of oil fields in northern Iraq is contested by the Iraqi army, Islamic State, and Kurdish forces. The Islamic State controls small oil fields in northern Iraq and sells oil through Turkey. They captured the Bayji refinery in June 2014 but Iraqi forces retook it five months later. The Turkish border is used for the sale of illicit Iraqi oil by various groups. Turkey could potentially reduce this activity by closing the border. The Islamic State controls small oil fields in northern Iraq and sells oil through Turkey, facing challenges in closing the porous border due to the risk of retaliation. IS refines oil in small mobile refineries, producing gasoline and diesel fuel for military use. Natural gas has transportation limitations compared to crude oil. The natural gas system in Syria and northern Iraq is limited to existing pipelines, with most gas used for power generation. Syrian natural gas production declined by 32% from 2011 to 2013. US airstrikes targeted oil facilities in Syria due to their importance to IS financing, destroying 50% of refining capacity. Turkey may be limiting IS oil sales, potentially reducing sales by 80%. The United States has targeted refineries to limit IS oil sales, avoiding strikes on oil wells to preserve infrastructure. Revenue from oil sales dropped from $1 million a day to several million dollars a week. Coalition strikes destroyed nearly 200 oil and gas facilities used by the Islamic State, restricting their operations and ability to pay salaries. Illicit oil sales are no longer a significant revenue source for the Islamic State. The Pentagon spokesperson mentioned that illicit oil sales are no longer the Islamic State's main revenue source, but did not specify the new source. It is challenging to determine the largest revenue stream for the Islamic State due to limited financial information and various factors. Some analysts suggest that the sale of looted antiquities is the group's second-largest revenue source, including items taken from museums, storage depots, and archaeological sites. A third of Iraq's archaeological sites are under IS control, with artifacts being sold or smuggled out. Nearly a hundred Syrian artifacts, including Byzantine coins and Roman pottery, were smuggled into Britain for sale. The Islamic State collects a tax on excavated antiquities and grants licenses to excavation crews in some areas. They have established offices and markets for looted antiquities, with transactions completed in U.S. dollars. The Islamic State generates revenue by taxing excavation teams and selling antiquities, with estimates suggesting over $100 million in illicit trade annually. Various groups, including the Syrian government and criminal networks, are involved in smuggling or trading antiquities. The Islamic State finances itself through extortion rackets, taxation, and bank looting, generating up to $360 million per year. In 2014, they gained access to at least half a billion dollars by seizing control of state-owned banks in Iraq. The Islamic State finances itself through extortion, taxation, and bank looting, generating up to $360 million per year. They levy a 5% tax on cash withdrawals from private Iraqi banks and collect passage fees at border checkpoints for goods and persons. Drivers pay fees and bribes ranging from $200 to $1,000 to move goods into IS-held territory. The Islamic State finances itself through extortion, taxation, and bank looting, generating up to $360 million per year. They levy taxes on various businesses and individuals in their territory, including pharmacies, mobile phone companies, farmers, shopkeepers, and students in Mosul and other cities under their control. The Islamic State imposes taxes on businesses and individuals in areas under its control, including students who are charged different rates based on their level of education. They also collect payments for utility services and impose a protection tax on some Christian communities. The Islamic State in Iraq demands that Christians pay jizyah tax, threatening death if they refuse. Reports vary on the amount, with some stating half an ounce of gold while others mention a few dollars per month. The group does not offer this option to all religious minorities, especially considering some as polytheists like the Yazidis. The Islamic State justifies enslaving Yazidis by claiming they do not qualify for jizyah payment. They also make money through ransom kidnappings, with estimates of $35-$45 million collected by the United Nations. The Islamic State collected $35-$45 million in ransom fees in 2014 alone, higher than Al Qaeda groups. Victims include local residents, foreign aid workers, and journalists. Reported ransoms varied, with demands as high as $132.5 million USD. France may have paid $18 million for ransom. The Islamic State collected $35-$45 million in ransom fees in 2014, with victims ranging from local residents to foreign aid workers and journalists. While the U.S. and British governments do not pay ransom, other European countries have reportedly paid for the release of their citizens. The Islamic State receives financial support from individuals in Gulf and European countries, but analysts estimate that the group generates up to $40 million internally. The United States has worked with Gulf states to curb the flow of funds to the Islamic State, but implementation remains irregular. The Islamic State gains funding from ransom fees, foreign fighters, and control over agricultural areas in Syria and Iraq. Despite efforts to curb funding, implementation remains irregular. The Islamic State profits from the sale of agricultural goods, estimated at $200 million annually. They \"launder\" crops to obscure their origin and rent seized machinery back to farmers. The group subsidizes bread for propaganda and recruitment purposes. The Islamic State profits from agricultural goods sales, estimated at $200 million annually, by \"laundering\" crops and renting seized machinery to farmers. They subsidize bread for propaganda and recruitment. Syria's breadbasket region, controlled by IS, affects the state's food distribution system. The war in Syria has disrupted the centralized food distribution system, hindering the transport of wheat from the northeast to urban centers in the west. Only 31 collection centers remain operational, leading to a food shortage affecting 6.8 million Syrians. IS control over flour mills in Aleppo has further limited bread production. The Islamic State controls key wheat-growing areas in Iraq, acquiring a significant amount of wheat from government silos. IS has established ministries to govern its territory and is seeking skilled individuals to join their administration. The Islamic State sought individuals with administrative expertise in various domains to join their administration. They announced plans to recruit staff with PhDs in Islamic law and economics, as well as those with high school diplomas. The group also planned to mint its own currency but had not done so by early 2015. Additionally, they established a bank in Mosul that granted loans and accepted deposits, and approved a $2 billion budget for 2015 to cover operations in Iraq and Syria. The Islamic State faces financial challenges as it struggles to cover expenses despite its budget. Salaries for fighters are a significant expenditure, with each fighter receiving $400-$600 monthly. Married fighters get extra stipends for wives and children. The Islamic State relies on taxing state employee salaries in IS-held areas to generate revenue, estimated to be hundreds of millions of dollars annually. The group also needs to maintain key infrastructure like electricity and water in the areas it controls in Syria and Iraq. In Syria, power plants and substations have been targeted by both the government and opposition groups since 2011, leading to a significant decrease in electricity production. The Islamic State issued tenders for aerial cables installation in eastern Syria in 2014. While the Islamic State may control some water infrastructure, it lacks the technical expertise to maintain key facilities. For example, when they seized the Euphrates dam, they demanded it operate at full capacity despite its limitations. The Euphrates dam in Syria, seized by the Islamic State, saw a significant drop in water levels, leading to water shortages for 5 million people. This resulted in residents resorting to untreated water sources, causing the spread of waterborne diseases. The World Health Organization warned of a potential cholera outbreak due to poor sanitation. The Islamic State provides services to civilians, including covering monthly expenses for the needy and families of those killed in airstrikes. They also run schools and an Islamic court within their territory. The Islamic State runs social projects within its territory, including schools, an Islamic court system, and a Consumer Protection Authority. They also distribute produce to families, operate a food kitchen in Raqqah, and maintain an Office for Orphans. The group's recruitment strategy involves portraying life in IS-held areas favorably. The U.S. Department of the Treasury leads efforts to undermine the group's finances through financial measures and targeted sanctions. In October 2014, David Cohen outlined the U.S. government's strategy to combat IS financing, focusing on disrupting funding sources, restricting access to the financial system, and blocking assets of senior leaders. Collaboration with international partners is prioritized for financial intelligence collection and analysis to understand how IS raises and uses funds. U.S. policy efforts target key funding sources like oil sales and kidnapping. Efforts to combat IS financing target key sources such as oil sales, kidnapping for ransom, criminal activities, and foreign donors. US policy aims to block IS funds through financial facilitators and local financial institutions. Military operations against IS oil infrastructure contribute to counter-financing efforts. Collaboration with Turkey and the Kurdistan Regional Government helps prevent oil products from IS-held territory from crossing borders. Turkish and Kurdish authorities are seizing oil shipments suspected to have links to the Islamic State. The Treasury Department is identifying brokers in the oil supply chain involved in purchasing IS oil. Coalition airstrikes target mobile refineries in the region, reducing the availability of refined oil products and increasing prices. The removal of mobile refining capabilities in IS-controlled areas has led to a decrease in refined oil products availability and an increase in fuel prices. Analysts believe that this has forced the group to sell crude oil elsewhere, affecting their ability to generate funds through the black market. Airstrikes may pressure the Islamic State financially, but alone are unlikely to decisively defeat them. The U.S. government is working to prevent the group from making money through kidnapping for ransom operations by developing an international consensus against ransom payments to terrorist groups. The Treasury Department is applying sanctions to brokers involved in purchasing IS oil. The Treasury Department is committed to applying sanctions against those involved in demanding ransoms for the Islamic State. The U.S. government aims to prevent kidnappings of U.S. citizens and utilize various capabilities to secure their release. International efforts are being made to discourage ransom payments to terrorist groups, despite reports of some governments paying ransoms to the Islamic State. Public concerns have been raised over the U.S. government's stance on paying ransoms. The U.S. government's policy against paying ransoms for U.S. hostages has sparked public concerns. Despite successful rescue operations elsewhere, the Obama Administration's attempt to rescue hostages from the Islamic State in 2014 failed. Families of IS victims criticize the no-concessions policy. The Treasury Department faces challenges in disrupting IS revenue from criminal activities. The ongoing use of transport vehicles in the region is suspected of smuggling supplies, cash, and contraband goods into and out of IS-held territory. The Islamic State benefits from local criminal activities to control territory, and efforts to combat IS finances are seen as complementary to military actions. Local law enforcement is responsible for addressing criminal activity, while U.S. government efforts to sanction IS members overseeing criminal rackets may have minimal impact as long as the Islamic State controls territory. The U.S. government is focusing on preventing the Islamic State from accessing external funding sources, particularly from wealthy Gulf State donors. Efforts include increasing cooperation with Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates to combat terrorist financing. The U.S. government is working to prevent the Islamic State from accessing external funding sources, including wealthy Gulf State donors like Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Efforts are being made to disrupt ISIL's current sources of income and prepare for the possibility of wealthy extremists funding the group. Foreign fighters may also contribute financially to ISIL, presenting a challenge for analysts to track and stem funding streams from nearly 100 countries worldwide. According to a Financial Action Task Force report, foreign fighters can financially support the Islamic State by self-funding travel, carrying cash overseas, and contributing funds to IS operations. The U.S. Department of Justice is urged to prosecute IS supporters using existing terrorist financing statutes. The Obama Administration sees economic sanctions as effective in dismantling criminal and terrorist networks. The United States designates the Islamic State as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO) and targets individuals associated with terrorism through sanctions imposed by the Treasury Department. More individuals linked to Al Nusrah Front (ANF) have been sanctioned than those linked to the Islamic State since May 2014. The Treasury Department has targeted more individuals associated with ANF for sanctions than the Islamic State. The U.N. Security Council updated its Al Qaeda sanctions list to include the Islamic State and ANF as aliases for AQI, allowing for sanctions on Islamic State-affiliated individuals. The U.N. Security Council adopted resolution 2199 to reaffirm sanctions on IS-related individuals providing financial support. The Treasury Department is working with Iraqi authorities to limit IS's international financial transactions through local bank branches in IS territory. Iraqi bank branches in IS-controlled or contested territory are being monitored by the government to prevent wire transfers and currency transactions with the Islamic State. The Mosul Development Bank has relocated its operations to Baghdad. Private sector reports on suspicious activity and compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act are key in identifying IS financing. The Treasury Department shares financial intelligence with relevant authorities in cases of suspected IS funding. The Treasury Department is working with foreign counterparts to monitor financial activity in IS-controlled territory, limiting the Islamic State's access to the international financial system. Financial activity in areas where the Islamic State operates has declined, and banks under IS influence are losing access to the international financial system. Banks under IS influence are losing access to the international financial system, posing a challenge for regulators to prevent the Islamic State from exploiting them. Efforts to restrict local banks may not hinder IS's ability to leverage them. Identifying and preventing unregulated money services businesses from supporting IS is another policy challenge. The role of financial institutions in IS-occupied territory remains sensitive, according to a recent report by the Financial Action Task Force. The Islamic State's diverse sources of funding pose a challenge to containment efforts. Despite hopes that lower oil prices would disrupt their finances, the group has found alternative fundraising methods like extortion and donations. Control of territory is crucial for their financial operations. The Islamic State's financial strength relies on seizing territory and utilizing illicit trafficking networks for financial gain. Dismantling these long-standing smuggling routes poses a challenge, requiring a diverse counter-finance response. The success in stemming IS resources could impact the long-term threat posed by the Al Qaeda movement. The financial strength of the Islamic State relies on seizing territory and utilizing illicit trafficking networks for financial gain. Efforts to combat its financing will take time, and there is no quick solution to empty ISIL's coffers overnight. The potential for funding Al-Qaeda core or other parts of the Al-Qaeda movement could lead to a well-funded transnational terrorist architecture. Efforts to combat the Islamic State's financing will be a sustained fight, even if external funding sources are eliminated. Local donations and extortion schemes will still benefit the group. Developing local and regional partners' capacity to target IS financial facilitators and revenue sources is crucial. However, these efforts may harm local populations, and counter-finance tactics should consider the potential suffering caused. The Islamic State may use propaganda to blame the international community for any economic distress in the areas it operates. Some observers believe international pressure on Islamic State's revenue streams, especially oil-related income, has led to financial decline. The group may struggle to replenish battlefield resources and maintain financial stability in the long term. Treasury officials suggest that the Islamic State's financial profile is already on a downward trajectory due to disrupted revenue sources. The Islamic State's financial strength is expected to diminish as their revenue sources dwindle. Critics argue that the Treasury Department's response to ISIL's finances mirrors past campaigns, despite the unique financial challenges posed by the group. U.S. officials recognize the urgent need to adapt counter-terrorist financing tools to combat ISIL's financial capabilities. The Treasury Department's efforts to combat IS financing are being evaluated by policymakers to determine if current resources are sufficient. Concerns focus on whether U.S. counterterrorist financing tools can diminish IS funds and if new legislative authorities are needed. Congress is actively evaluating policy responses to address the Islamic State, including military options and authorization for the use of force. Despite limited legislative proposals, efforts to stem Islamic State financing have been discussed in Congress. Two bills introduced in the 113th Congress addressed this issue. The House Committee on Financial Services held a hearing specifically on \"Terrorist Financing and the Islamic State.\" In FY2015, $112.5 million was appropriated to the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. In FY2015, $112.5 million was appropriated to the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence to combat IS finances. Senators urged the Obama Administration to designate the Islamic State as a \"Transnational Criminal Organization\" to establish targeted financial sanctions. The letter to Secretary Kerry urged the establishment of a targeted financial sanctions regime against TCOs, similar to those in place against SDGTs. The 114th Congress may address IS financing policy through a bipartisan task force established to investigate terrorism financing. The curr_chunk discusses investigations into U.S. responses to terrorist financing issues, including possible reports detailing findings and policy recommendations."
