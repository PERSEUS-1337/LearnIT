The Secretary will make direct awards to local educational agencies from the Children's Classroom Trust Fund to support programs for K-12 students. The award amount is determined based on the total appropriation divided by the average daily attendance of students. The amount provided to each local educational agency is calculated by multiplying the per child amount determined for the year by the average daily attendance of K-12 students served by the agency. Each agency must conduct a census to determine student attendance and submit the numbers to the Secretary by March 1 each year. The Secretary may fine a local educational agency double the difference between the incorrect amount received and the correct amount if false information is knowingly submitted to gain additional funds. The Secretary must disburse the awarded amount to the agency by July 1 each year. SEC. 6. REQUIREMENTS FOR FAILING LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. Failing local educational agencies must use funds to improve academic performance of students. Title I funding must be used in accordance with specific guidelines, excluding certain provisions of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Failing local educational agencies must submit a plan to the Secretary describing activities to be funded and may request exemptions from fund usage restrictions for schools meeting performance standards. The Secretary approves plans meeting requirements. Each failing local educational agency with an approved plan must disseminate it widely and post it publicly. The agency can use funds for activities like recruiting high-quality teachers, focusing on basic skills, and providing remedial instruction in core academic subjects. The State or local educational agency sets standards for subjects. Funding is allocated for mentoring programs in reading, writing, and arithmetic. Proven instructional methods like phonics are used. Extended day learning is provided. Parents are encouraged to be involved in their child's education. Other activities related to improving academic performance may be approved. A failing local educational agency must submit an annual report to the Secretary detailing the use of funds and the performance of all children served, following state standards.

A failing local educational agency must submit an annual report to the Secretary detailing the use of funds and children's performance. If the agency meets state standards for two consecutive years, the provisions of this section no longer apply, and they may receive a bonus award. The local educational agency can use bonus awards to reward teachers and principals for improving student performance and for professional development opportunities. The agency receiving the award decides how to distribute it to individual schools, and the schools decide how to spend the award. Up to 5 percent of the funds transferred to the Trust must be set aside for bonus awards. The local educational agency can allocate up to 5 percent of funds for bonus awards. If funds are misused, the Secretary will reduce the agency's funding for the following year by the amount spent improperly. The Secretary may conduct audits of local educational agencies' expenditures to ensure compliance with the Act. If funds are misused, enforcement provisions under the General Education Provisions Act may be used."
