    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"District of Columbia-Maryland Reunion Act\". Residents of Washington, DC pay Federal income tax but lack voting members in Congress. The Founding Fathers did not consider DC a State under the Constitution, as shown by Alexander Hamilton's failed amendment for full congressional representation in 1788. Thomas Tredwell criticized the plan for DC as departing from principles of freedom. Washington, DC lacks full representation in Congress, as Chief Justice Marshall ruled in 1805 that it is not included in the term \"states\" for representation purposes. This decision was affirmed by seven Supreme Court Justices in 1949. In 1978, a Democrat-controlled Congress attempted to amend the Constitution to grant DC full congressional representation. The need for a constitutional amendment to grant Washington, DC congressional representation was highlighted due to potential legal challenges. Amending the Constitution requires approval from two-thirds of Congress and ratification by three-fourths of the States. In 1978, there was progress towards granting DC full congressional representation but fell short of the required ratification. An alternative to a lengthy constitutional amendment process is ceding Washington, DC back to Maryland to ensure Senate and House representation, similar to how Virginia regained land in 1847 for proper congressional representation. In 1847, Congress ceded non-Federal land back to Virginia from Washington, DC, avoiding the need for a constitutional amendment. By ceding Washington, DC to Maryland, it could have 2 Senators and a Representative with full voting rights while maintaining Congress's control over the National Capital Service Area. Upon the President's proclamation under section 8, the District of Columbia will be retroceded to Maryland, except for the National Capital Service Area which will remain under federal control. Congress will retain legislative authority over the Area. This will not affect judicial proceedings in the District of Columbia. SEC. 4.
