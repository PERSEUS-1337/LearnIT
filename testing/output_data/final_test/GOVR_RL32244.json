    "content": "The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) implemented revised grazing regulations on August 11, 2006, which have been partially enjoined. Previous changes in 1995 were the result of a lengthy evaluation process amidst disputes over federal rangeland management. Ranching interests criticized the 1995 rules for weakening grazing privileges, while environmental groups felt they didn't do enough to protect public lands. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) implemented revised grazing regulations in 2006, partially enjoined. Changes in 1995 separated grazing preference from permitted use, allowed nonuse of permits for up to three years, and authorized permit suspension or cancellation for violating environmental laws. The Bureau of Land Management made significant changes to grazing regulations in 2006, including removing the requirement for permittees to be in the livestock business, allowing conservation use for grazing permits, and imposing surcharges for non-permittee livestock grazing. Grazing Advisory Boards were replaced with Resource Advisory Councils, and rangeland management standards called Fundamentals of Rangeland Health were adopted. The most contentious proposal to increase grazing was dropped by the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary of the Interior dropped the proposal to increase the grazing fee due to controversy. Dissatisfaction with 1995 changes led to a lawsuit, upheld by the Supreme Court except for a rule on conservation use. BLM took a two-pronged approach to grazing reform in 2003-2006, focusing on creating economically sustainable working landscapes. BLM announced in March 2003 plans to create economically productive and environmentally healthy working landscapes. Changes to grazing regulations could impact over 18,000 permits on 162 million acres of BLM land. Critics of the reform effort argued that the 1995 regulations were not given enough time to assess effectiveness and that the changes remove important environmental protections. Environmentalists were concerned that the changes would require excessive monitoring. Environmentalists were concerned that the regulatory changes would require excessive monitoring and prevent changes in grazing practices. Some disappointment was expressed that the reform effort did not address important issues such as altering grazing fees and controlling noxious weeds. Livestock organizations and range professionals supported the regulatory changes for improving rangeland management and flexibility for grazing managers and permittees. The BLM proposed changes to its grazing regulations in 2003 to improve rangeland management, promote conservation, and comply with court decisions. The final rule recognizes the benefits of grazing, including economic and social benefits to rural communities. The agency reviewed over 8,000 public comments before proposing the changes. The BLM received over 18,000 public comments on proposed changes to grazing regulations in response to a notice in 2003. After considering the feedback, a final environmental impact statement was issued in 2005, with mixed reactions to the proposed revisions. The preferred alternative was found to have minimal adverse effects on the environment. The final environmental impact statement in 2005 stated that proposed regulatory changes may have short-term adverse effects on the environment, leading to concerns about public land protections and grazing practices. The BLM could curtail grazing if immediate protection is needed, with the goal of making more sustainable grazing decisions for rangeland health. A controversy arose over claims by two retired BLM scientists that their findings on potential harm to water quality and wildlife from new rules were reversed by BLM. The agency defended the changes as part of the standard review process, stating that the scientists' work was lacking in quality and based on personal opinion. The work submitted by two former BLM employees was rewritten, delaying the publication of a final grazing rule to address public comments, particularly from the Fish and Wildlife Service. The FWS expressed concerns that the proposed changes could have profound impacts on wildlife resources and prioritize grazing over other land uses. The BLM disagreed with the FWS concerns that proposed revisions would prioritize grazing over other land uses, potentially harming fish and wildlife habitats. BLM argued that the changes are administrative and do not restrict specialists from recommending management changes. The FWS supports some proposed grazing changes but has concerns about administrative inconsistencies between BLM and the Forest Service, diminished public consultation, gradual livestock use changes, forage quantity in grazing preference definition, and shared title to range improvements potentially hindering land use reallocation. BLM stated that consistency in grazing regulations with the Forest Service is not necessary, citing different statutory requirements. They also mentioned that public consultation is included in allotment management planning for range improvements and that reduced livestock use may impact special status species. Reduced livestock use may impact special status species outside of federally listed ones, with any adverse effects expected to be limited to a few grazing allotments. Changes can be implemented quickly to protect sensitive species or resources, and permittee preferences do not always take precedence in evaluating vegetation use. Shared title to range improvements does not hinder BLM's ability to redirect land use. Water rights will benefit multiple uses, with wildlife rights typically held by the United States. Monitoring capacity is not expected to be overwhelmed, as only 15% of allotments evaluated were not meeting land health standards, largely due to livestock grazing. The final grazing regulations, effective from August 11, 2006, have been subject to litigation. There is uncertainty over the extent of changes in public lands grazing and disagreement on the environmental impact of the regulatory changes. The final grazing regulations, effective from August 11, 2006, have been subject to litigation. Uncertainty exists over the impact of changes in public lands grazing, particularly regarding ownership of range improvements and water rights, public input and appeals, permit terms and conditions, and rangeland health. Key changes include shared ownership of structural range improvements and documentation of permittee contributions. Some advocated for ranchers to receive direct compensation for improvements and be able to include them as assets for securing loans. Opponents argued that shared title could create private rights on public land and hinder efforts to address grazing abuses. They believed the government should hold title to improvements for other uses like recreation and wildlife habitat. Permittees can now acquire water rights in accordance with state law. Before 1995, federal rules required the government to follow state laws on livestock watering rights, with title held by the United States. Some supported private individuals holding water rights to incentivize development and protect permittees. Others opposed private ownership, preferring federal control to facilitate multiple uses and prevent private claims for compensation. Concerns were raised about giving away public resources. BLM reduced public involvement in water rights decisions. The BLM reduced public involvement in its decisions, no longer requiring input on grazing allotment boundaries, permits, or modifications. The definition of \"interested public\" was narrowed to those directly involved in decision-making. Supporters believe these changes will prevent delays and streamline decision-making processes. The agency sees additional consultation as redundant, as the public already has opportunities to participate in planning processes under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The BLM made changes to reduce public input during planning processes under NEPA, leading to criticism for limiting public participation. The agency also modified the appeals process for grazing decisions, allowing grazing to continue during appeals involving permit renewals or modifications. The BLM made changes to grazing rules to provide continuity for permittees during appeals, broadening the definition of grazing preference to include quantitative measures tied to base property. This was opposed for limiting public input and potentially continuing damaging grazing practices. The new grazing rules aim to link forage allocations to base property, provide certainty for ranchers, and clarify the meaning of preference. Preference includes active and suspended use, with opposition to the new definition for potentially infringing on land managers' discretion. Assessments and monitoring of resource conditions are now required to support agency determinations on grazing practices and levels. The rules also amend the timeframe and procedures for changing grazing management to achieve rangeland health standards. The new grazing rules aim to provide certainty for ranchers and clarify preference. Changes include extending the deadline for developing remedial changes in grazing practices to 24 months and phasing in grazing increases or decreases over a five-year period. These changes aim to give the agency more flexibility in working with permittees who are not meeting standards and minimize adverse economic impacts. The final rule on grazing changes allows permittees to apply for nonuse of a permit for up to one year at a time, for as many years as needed, to minimize adverse economic impacts. Critics argue that the underlying problem of grazing exceeding allotment capacity is not addressed, and there are concerns about conservationists obtaining permits for extended nonuse. The final rule on grazing changes allows permittees to apply for nonuse of a permit for up to one year at a time, with restrictions on long-term conservation use permits. BLM can only take action against permittees for violations on their allotment. NEPA reviews will now consider social, economic, and cultural impacts of grazing preference changes. Administrative fees for livestock crossing permits will increase. The final rule on grazing changes includes increasing administrative fees for livestock crossing permits, preference transfers, and billings. It also specifies that BLM will cooperate with various boards in reviewing range improvements and allotment management plans on public lands. Lawsuits were filed to stop implementation of portions of the grazing regulations. On August 11, 2006, the U.S. District Court ruled in favor of plaintiffs in lawsuits regarding public comment disputes on grazing regulations. The court rejected claims related to inadequate review under NEPA. One plaintiff filed a motion on NEPA claims, leading to a stay on other regulations concerning rangeland health. As a result, BLM cannot use the 2006 regulations and must revert to the 1995 regulations in these areas. BLM issued an Instruction Memorandum to its field offices explaining BLM procedure as a result of the injunctions. Changes were made to the final regulations due to the injunctions, including considerations for new grazing unit types and forage reserves. Permit holders were also considered for temporary gate locking on public lands. BLM considered allowing permit holders to lock gates on public lands to protect private property and minimize disturbances during certain seasons. This idea faced opposition for potentially limiting access to other land users and giving special privileges to permittees. The agency also maintained the existing grazing fee surcharge provision to address concerns about profit from subleasing grazing privileges. BLM did not plan to address fee-related issues as part of the reform effort. The BLM initially planned to address final grazing policy changes as part of a reform effort, but it is no longer actively considering them due to competing priorities and resources. The agency had announced possible policy changes in 2003 to promote citizen stewardship, provide flexibility to livestock managers, and increase partnerships. Proposed policy changes included conservation partnerships, voluntary allotment restructuring, conservation easement acquisition, endangered species mitigation, and reserve improvements. The BLM considered policy options such as conservation partnerships, voluntary allotment restructuring, easement acquisition, endangered species mitigation, and reserve improvements. Public feedback was solicited through workshops, with concerns raised about the adequacy of information to assess the proposed changes. BLM extended the timeframe for developing policy changes in response to concerns about inadequate information. Conservation easements were no longer a major policy tool, and endangered species mitigation evolved to landscape habitat improvement. Key policy changes considered included creating RCAs to provide livestock forage to permittees. BLM considered creating RCAs to provide livestock forage to permittees during emergencies or improvements, supported by some for encouraging land improvements and preventing herd reduction. However, conservationists were concerned that RCAs would not address overstocking issues and could benefit mismanaged ranchers. Livestock groups feared reduced grazing, loss of water rights, coercion, and misuse of RCAs for conservation purposes. Key issues for both sides included the amount of land and which areas would be designated for RCAs. The goal of conservation partnerships between permit holders and the BLM is to improve environmental health through projects like restoring streambanks, wetlands, and riparian areas, enhancing water quantity and quality, and supporting wildlife habitat. Permittees could receive management flexibility, increased grazing, and stewardship grants in exchange for conservation efforts. Advocates believe these arrangements would give credit to permittees for their improvements. Opponents raised concerns about potential impairment of private property rights, unclear funding availability, uncertain extent of resource improvement, and possible benefits for little to no actual improvement. Differences of opinion existed regarding the role of third parties, rewards for permittees, and management of intermingled private land. Voluntary allotment restructuring was proposed to merge grazing allotments, allowing for lighter grazing to improve range conditions while maintaining economic viability. The restructuring of grazing allotments was proposed to improve range conditions and economic viability for permittees. Concerns were raised about potential impacts on grazing, compensation for ranchers, and the use of conservation easements to preserve open space. However, the use of conservation easements was not seen as a major policy option by the BLM due to limitations. Easements have been opposed for reducing land values and limiting landowners' discretion. BLM considered policy options to mitigate grazing effects on ESA species, including mitigation banks. Concerns arose about grazing being subordinated to conservation and compensating permittees for BLM obligations. Later, the concept evolved into Landscape Habitat Improvement to promote species conservation and ESA consultations. BLM pursued grazing reform for over three years under the Sustaining Working Landscapes initiative, aiming to promote species conservation and habitat management on a landscape scale. Grazing permittees could collaborate to maintain habitat while grazing public lands. Regulatory changes took effect in 2006, but no policy changes resulted from the effort. There is no current initiative to review and revise grazing policies. The final rule revises grazing policies, including changes such as shared title to range improvements, private acquisition of water rights, reduced public involvement requirements, modified appeals process, broadened grazing preference definition, and more. Livestock organizations and some range professionals support the changes, while environmental organizations and other experts oppose them. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) finalized grazing regulations on July 12, 2006, after receiving public comments and addressing concerns from the Fish and Wildlife Service. Some regulations, such as public participation and rangeland health, are facing legal challenges and are not being implemented as expected. The BLM planned to focus on final policy changes after completing the rulemaking process. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) finalized grazing regulations in 2006, but policy changes are no longer under consideration. Public feedback shaped proposals related to RCAs, conservation partnerships, allotment restructuring, easement acquisition, and habitat improvement."
