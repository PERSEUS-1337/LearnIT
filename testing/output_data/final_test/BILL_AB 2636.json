    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 103526 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to allow for the issuance of certified copies of birth, death, or marriage records with proper verification of identity. A faxed or digitized image of the notary acknowledgment for a certified copy of a birth, death, or marriage record must be legible and include the notary's information. In-person requests require a sworn statement under penalty of perjury before a certified copy can be provided. When requesting a certified copy of a birth, death, or marriage record electronically, an official may accept electronic verification of the applicant's identity through a multilayered remote proofing process. This process must meet NIST guidelines and verify information provided by the applicant through record checks with state or local agencies or credit reporting agencies. The electronic verification process for requesting certified copies of vital records must meet NIST guidelines and comply with state and federal laws to protect personal information and prevent identity theft. If electronic verification fails, the applicant must submit a notarized statement of identity. If the requester is not authorized or unable to meet requirements, they will receive an informational certified copy of a birth, death, or nonconfidential marriage record with a disclaimer. For confidential marriage records, a certified copy will not be released without proper authorization. An \"authorized person\" for requests of certified copies of confidential marriage records is limited to a party to the confidential marriage. For birth, death, or nonconfidential marriage records, an authorized person includes the registrant, parent, legal guardian, court-ordered party, attorney, licensed adoption agency, law enforcement or governmental agency member, or certain family members of the registrant. An authorized person for requesting certified copies of a death certificate includes family members, attorneys, funeral establishment employees, and individuals appointed by the court or statute to act on behalf of the registrant or their estate. Those who ask a funeral establishment employee to request a death certificate on their behalf are personally liable for the accuracy of their relationship to the deceased. Members of law enforcement or government agencies ordering records for official business do not need to provide a notarized statement. Employees of funeral establishments ordering death certificates on behalf of specified individuals also do not need to provide a notarized statement. Informational certified copies of birth and death certificates must be printed from the statewide database prepared by the State Registrar, with signatures electronically redacted. Local registrars and county recorders are prohibited from issuing copies from any other source. This rule will be effective on July 1, 2007, after the statewide database is operational and contains the full calendar year of birth and death indices. The State Registrar will notify local registrars and county recorders when a year is available for issuance. Local registrars and county recorders will be notified when a year is available for issuance from the statewide database. The department can implement changes to this section without regulatory action until January 1, 2021, when it will be repealed unless extended by a later statute. Section 103526 is added to the Health and Safety Code. If a request for a certified copy of a birth, death, or marriage record is accompanied by a notarized statement sworn under penalty of perjury, the official may provide the certified copy. The notary acknowledgment must be legible and contain specific information if received via fax. When requesting a certified copy of a birth, death, or marriage record in person, the official must verify the requester's identity through a sworn statement under penalty of perjury. The notary acknowledgment should include specific details like the notary's registration number and commission expiration date near their signature. If the requester is not authorized or unable to meet requirements, an informational certified copy of a birth, death, or nonconfidential marriage record will be provided with a legend stating it is not a valid document for identity. For confidential marriage records, a certified copy will not be released unless authorized by law.

Those requesting a death certificate through a funeral establishment must truthfully warrant their relationship to the deceased and are personally liable for any damages resulting from a breach of that warranty. A member of a law enforcement agency or a representative of a state or local government agency conducting official business is not required to provide a notarized statement when ordering a copy of a record. Similarly, an agent or employee of a funeral establishment ordering death certificates on behalf of specified individuals does not need to provide a notarized statement.

The State Registrar will notify local registrars and county recorders when a year is available for issuance. Local registrars and county recorders will be notified when a year is available for issuance from the statewide database. Section 103527.5 of the Health and Safety Code will become effective on January 1, 2021. It requires the State Registrar and local entities to report information on requests for certified copies of vital records without a notarized statement from authorized persons to specified committees and the Attorney General.

Victims of identity theft can temporarily limit electronic access to vital records, with data on the number of consumers utilizing this mechanism and requests made without a notarized statement. The multilayered remote identity proofing process may deny requests due to insufficient information or failed authentication.
