    "content": "The Aviation Industry Stabilization Act of 2003 is cited as the short title. Amendments to Title 49, United States Code are specified in the Act. Aviation insurance is addressed in Section 3. Section 3 of the Aviation Industry Stabilization Act of 2003 amends provisions related to aviation insurance, including changing \"may\" to \"shall\" in Section 44302(a)(1) and extending policies until December 31, 2007. It also adjusts coverage in Section 44303 by updating dates and repeals the termination date in Section 44310. Applications for Federal credit instruments authorized by the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act may be filed for 30 days after the President authorizes military force against Iraq in 2003, upon an extraordinary increase in jet fuel prices. The Air Transportation Stabilization Board will announce the application period in the Federal Register. The Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act allows for Federal credit instruments to be issued by the Board to help air carriers secure financial obligations for aviation fuel purchases during a period of high jet fuel prices. The instrument covers increased fuel costs incurred by the carrier or a reasonable estimate of such costs. The Board can issue up to $3 billion in Federal credit instruments to air carriers based on their aviation fuel consumption in 2002. Special rules apply from the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act. The System Stabilization Act does not apply to Federal credit instruments issued under this section. Federal credit instruments may include lines of credit and guarantees from third parties. The 2-year period for applications under this section is treated as the 2-year period from the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act. The term \"major air carrier\" is defined in this section according to section 41720(a) of title 49, United States Code. This section does not affect applications filed before the enactment of this Act for Federal credit instruments authorized by the Air Transportation Safety and Stabilization Act. SEC. 5.

The Secretary of Energy must drawdown and distribute petroleum from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a rate of 500,000 barrels per day if the President authorizes military force against Iraq in 2003 to address jet fuel market dislocation or price increases. A dislocation in the jet fuel market is defined as a decrease of over 25% in US domestic jet fuel inventories compared to the previous 3-year average. The Secretary of Energy may cease drawdown if there is no longer a jet fuel market dislocation or if an extraordinary increase in jet fuel prices stabilizes. The calculation for an extraordinary increase is based on a 50% increase from the 2002 average jet fuel price. The Secretary of Energy may stop drawdown if there is no longer a jet fuel market dislocation or if there is a significant increase in jet fuel prices. This increase is determined by a 50% rise from the 2002 average jet fuel price.
