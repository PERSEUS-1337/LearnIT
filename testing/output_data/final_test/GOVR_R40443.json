There are concerns about whether the current food safety system is equipped to protect consumers and if federal food safety laws have kept up with changes in the industry. The Government Accountability Office has identified food safety as a high-risk area in 2007 and 2009. The Government Accountability Office has placed food safety on its list of high-risk areas, with 15 federal agencies collectively administering laws related to food safety. The majority of funding and staffing is with the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FSIS's annual budget in FY2010 was $1.1 billion, while FDA's budget was $784 million for its human foods program. This report discusses recent food safety incidents and systemic problems in food safety. This report provides an overview of the food safety legal landscape and efforts by the 111th Congress to revise federal food safety authorities. It details the provisions of the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) and compares them with existing laws. The report also highlights how food safety incidents increase public scrutiny of the U.S. food safety system. Large recalls of FSIS-regulated meat and poultry products due to E. coli O157:H7, Listeria, and other issues happen annually. Recent multi-state outbreaks linked to FDA-regulated foods include incidents like the 2006 spinach contamination with E. coli O157:H7 and the 2008 Salmonella Saintpaul outbreak. These events have raised concerns about food safety and led to initiatives to prevent future incidents. In 2008, melamine contamination of ingredients from China sickened pets and raised concerns about infant formula safety. FDA's oversight of imports was questioned due to the difficulty in tracing contaminated food pathways. A Salmonella outbreak in 2008-2009 linked to peanut butter sickened over 700 people in 46 states, leading to multiple recalls by FDA. In early 2009, FDA recalled thousands of peanut products from over 200 companies due to contamination. In July 2010, a Salmonella outbreak linked to shell eggs led to a nationwide recall of over 500 million eggs. Despite FDA's new egg safety regulation, concerns remain about coordination between USDA and FDA inspection activities. The lack of coordination between USDA's egg quality inspection and FDA's food safety activities is due to their shared regulatory responsibility for egg products. FDA oversees most food safety, while USDA's FSIS regulates meat, poultry, and some egg products. State and local authorities also play a role in food safety inspections. The division of food safety responsibilities between FDA and USDA dates back to early U.S. food regulation laws enacted in 1906. The Pure Food and Drugs Act and the Meat Inspection Act were enacted in 1906 to address adulterated foods and unsafe conditions in meatpacking plants. Implementation was assigned to USDA's Bureau of Chemistry and Bureau of Animal Industry. Over time, additional food safety activities were split among various agencies. In 1940, responsibilities for safe foods and drugs, excluding meat and poultry, were moved from USDA to the precursor of HHS. Meat inspection remained under USDA. In 1940, responsibilities for safe foods and drugs, excluding meat and poultry, were moved from USDA to the precursor of HHS. Meat inspection remained in USDA. There has been discussion over time regarding whether this dispersal of food safety responsibilities has been problematic, or whether a reorganization would divert time and attention from other fundamental problems in the system. In the 111 th Congress, major food safety legislation was passed, focusing on changes related to FDA, not USDA. Key provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) are discussed, including \"adulteration\" and \"misbranding\" of FDA-regulated foods. The George W. Bush Administration issued reports and studies calling for changes in the food safety system, including the FDA's Food Protection Plan and the Interagency Working Group on Import Safety's Action Plan. Violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) can result in criminal and civil penalties for introducing adulterated or misbranded products into interstate commerce. The Obama Administration established the Food Safety Working Group to upgrade food safety laws and improve government safeguards for imported foods. President Obama called the food safety system a hazard to public health and announced measures to enforce laws for public safety. The Obama Administration took steps to improve government safeguards for food safety, including reducing E. coli prevalence, implementing new standards for Campylobacter, and issuing a rule for Salmonella contamination. They also conducted a pilot study on a tracing system and updated the www.foodsafety.gov site. The Administration supported the primary food safety bill in the House of Representatives and urged the Senate to complete its work on food safety legislation. In 2009 and 2010, the Obama Administration supported food safety legislation in both the House and Senate. FDA officials testified on key provisions of the bills, with Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg calling the Senate bill a \"major step in the right direction\" for refocusing on prevention and providing FDA with necessary legal tools. The FDA Commissioner highlighted the need for adequate legal tools and resources to implement new food safety requirements. Additional provisions like effective enforcement mechanisms were suggested, along with registration fees and flexibility in inspection frequencies. Despite amendments made by the 110th Congress, comprehensive food safety legislation was not enacted. Perceived gaps in federal safeguards have been discussed in congressional hearings since 2007. In the 111th Congress, multiple food safety bills were introduced, including H.R. 2749 and S. 510. H.R. 2749 was approved by the House Energy and Commerce Committee and passed the House with a recorded vote of 283 to 142. S. 510 was amended and reported by the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Amendments to the bill were debated throughout 2010. In the 111th Congress, substitute amendments were offered and debated for a food safety bill. A substitute version of the bill passed the Senate with a recorded vote of 73-25. The bill was signed into law as the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA, P.L. 111-353) in January 2011. FSMA expands FDA authorities, increases inspections at food facilities, tightens record-keeping requirements, extends oversight to farms, and mandates product recalls. FDA has identified five key elements to the new law, including Preventive Controls. The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) mandates preventive controls across the food supply, requiring facilities to analyze hazards and implement risk-based controls. The law establishes science-based performance standards for food contaminants and aims to improve foodborne illness surveillance. Provisions extend safeguards to the farm level. The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) mandates preventive controls across the food supply, requiring facilities to analyze hazards and implement risk-based controls. The law establishes science-based performance standards for food contaminants and aims to improve foodborne illness surveillance. FSMA extends safeguards to the farm level by calling for new, science-based \"performance standards\" for safe production of fruits, vegetables, and related products, and expanding enforcement and record-keeping authorities. Inspection and Compliance under FSMA seek to increase the frequency of plant inspections to hold the industry accountable for producing safe food. The new law under the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) aims to strengthen record-keeping requirements and food traceability systems to prevent outbreaks and contamination. Regulated facilities must analyze safety hazards, implement risk-based controls, and maintain records as prescribed by the FDA. Adequate records have proven crucial in recent food safety incidents, particularly in outbreaks linked to fresh produce. The Bioterrorism Act of 2002 requires more frequent re-registration and additional information submission for regulated facilities. The FSMA increases scrutiny of food imports, requiring documentation of safety standards equivalent to U.S. standards. Importers must verify foreign suppliers' preventive controls, and FDA can accredit laboratories for sampling and testing. The FSMA grants FDA mandatory recall authority for all food products, enhances partnerships for improved training of food safety officials, and strengthens collaboration among various food safety agencies. Certain food processing operations and farms are exempt from proposed HACCP requirements. Some farms and food facilities are exempt from new produce standards and HACCP requirements under FSMA. Businesses with an \"average annual monetary value\" of less than $500,000 for all food sold in the previous three years are eligible for exemptions if they sell directly to qualified end users within certain distances. Retail food establishments like roadside stands, farmers' markets, and foods sold through CSA programs are also exempt. FSMA maintains separate jurisdictions between FDA and USDA. The FSMA law increases federal spending by $1.4 billion over five years. FDA lacks funding for new food safety activities, relying on discretionary appropriations. FDA's deputy commissioner acknowledges the need for new resources to build a preventive system. The FSMA law requires new resources and investment to build a preventive system. Appendix tables provide a comprehensive listing of all sections and topics covered in the new law. The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) includes key provisions and requires registration of food facilities with the FDA. The FSMA law requires domestic and foreign food facilities to register every two years with the FDA, providing updated contact information. It also outlines procedures for suspending registration if there is a risk of serious health consequences from the food produced. The FSMA law requires food facilities to register every two years with the FDA and outlines procedures for suspending registration in case of health risks. Importing or introducing such food into commerce is prohibited, with possible penalties. Exemptions from registration exist for farms, restaurants, retailers, and certain nonprofit food establishments. FSMA clarifies the definition of \"retail food establishment\" to include direct sales to consumers at roadside stands, farmers' markets, and other platforms determined by the HHS Secretary. Prior to the passage of FSMA, the FFDCA authorized the HHS Secretary to impose record-keeping requirements on food facilities, except farms and restaurants, to prevent unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets. The Secretary required facilities to maintain records identifying sources and recipients of food to strengthen compliance with the law. FSMA (\u00a7 101) expands the Secretary's authority to inspect and copy relevant records of food facilities to ensure compliance with the law and facilitate outbreak investigations and product recalls. Concerns include the format, detail, retention period, and access to these records, with worries about government intrusion, privacy, and protection of trade secrets. Under FSMA, the HHS Secretary can access food facility records without needing a reasonable belief of adulteration if there is a risk of serious health consequences. Farms and restaurants remain exempt from this provision. Under FSMA, the HHS Secretary can access food facility records without needing a reasonable belief of adulteration if there is a risk of harm. Farms and restaurants are fully exempt from this provision. Written notification is required for other facilities to gain access. Industry players were expected to abide by food safety rules, with officials stepping in only when a problem was detected. The discussions emphasized the importance of prevention in food safety, with stakeholders agreeing on the need to understand and prevent hazards. The Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system was highlighted as a key approach, mandated by FSIS for meat and poultry establishments in the 1990s. Variations of HACCP were also required by the FDA for seafood, juices, and low-acid canned foods. The National Academy of Sciences' National Research Council recommended the HACCP approach for food safety, which was also supported by the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods. The committee emphasized the need for standardized HACCP principles while allowing flexibility for individual food establishments. FSMA provisions require food facilities to evaluate hazards, implement preventive controls, and monitor food safety. FSMA requires written HACCP-type and/or broader food safety plans with specific hazard evaluation and control measures. Facilities must conduct re-analysis at intervals, maintain records, and follow FDA guidance. Some exemptions apply, detailed in the section \"Mitigating Effects on Small Business and Farming Operations.\" Performance standards are also included. Performance standards are specific measurements used as benchmarks to determine food safety. Regulators like FDA, USDA, and EPA employ these standards for various reasons. FFDCA authorizes FDA to establish standards for certain hazards. FSMA (\u00a7 104) amends FFDCA to require the HHS Secretary to review and evaluate data to identify significant hazards and issue science-based performance standards to minimize risks of illness or death in food products. The FSMA requires the HHS Secretary to review and evaluate data to identify hazards and issue performance standards to minimize risks in food products. There is a debate on whether farmers should be subject to mandatory safety standards or continue with voluntary strategies for producing safe foods. The FSMA mandates the HHS Secretary to assess hazards and set standards to reduce risks in food products. There is a discussion on whether farmers should adhere to mandatory safety standards or maintain voluntary approaches for ensuring food safety. Numerous laws and regulations already impose restrictions on food producers, including requirements on animal drugs, feed additives, and pesticides. FDA's CGMP requirements apply to human food manufacturing, packing, or holding, with exemptions for farms and establishments solely engaged in harvesting, storing, or distributing raw agricultural commodities. Farms are also exempt from FDA registration and record-keeping requirements under the Bioterrorism Act and FFDCA. The FDA historically relied on farmers adopting good agricultural practices to reduce hazards in food production. However, in July 2010, a final rule required shell egg producers to implement on-farm safety measures to prevent contamination by Salmonella. This rule aimed to address serious health threats and allow officials access to records in case of adulteration suspicions. The FDA requires egg producers to implement on-farm safety measures to prevent Salmonella contamination. FSMA provisions create new requirements for farms and food processors, including standards for produce safety. Coordination with USDA and state agricultural agencies is encouraged for enforcement. FSMA introduces new requirements for farms and food processors, including standards for produce safety. It also allows for variances based on local growing conditions and exempts some farms under certain conditions. Concerns have been raised by small farms and processors about the potential effects of these new food safety requirements. FSMA introduces new requirements for farms and food processors, including standards for produce safety. Concerns have been raised by small farms and processors about the potential effects of these new food safety requirements, especially regarding the cost and burden on small businesses. Options considered include waiving requirements, providing compliance assistance, and exempting certain businesses from meeting the requirements. Some businesses are already exempt from certain food safety requirements under FFDCA. FSMA provisions directly affect farms and food processors, including facility registration, records access, food traceability, and inspection resources. The law exempts certain food processors and farms from new requirements, providing consideration for small businesses and coordination with USDA and state authorities. The HACCP requirements under \u00a7 103 exempt \"very small businesses\" or those with annual food sales under $500,000 to qualified end users within a certain distance. These facilities must identify and control potential hazards or comply with applicable food safety laws. Exempt farms must also provide their information on food packaging labels. The exemption for facilities and farms under FSMA is based on annual food sales under $500,000 to qualified end users. Exemption may be revoked in case of a foodborne illness outbreak or HHS Secretary's determination. Retail food establishments like roadside stands, farmers' markets, and CSA programs are also exempt from the requirements. It is challenging to estimate the percentage of food processing operations exempt from HACCP requirements. The exemption for facilities and farms under FSMA is based on annual food sales under $500,000 to qualified end users. Exemption may be revoked in case of a foodborne illness outbreak or HHS Secretary's determination. Retail food establishments like roadside stands, farmers' markets, and CSA programs are also exempt from the requirements. The share of farms engaged in food processing that might be affected by the new law is uncertain, as data on this is not available. Additionally, FSMA stipulates that foods sold from exempted facilities and farms must be sold locally and to certain qualified end-users, but the percentage of grower-processors that qualify for this is unknown. Reform advocates argue that more frequent inspections in plants could prevent illness outbreaks and recalls. FSIS inspectors are present in meat and poultry plants daily, examining every live animal and carcass for defects. Prior to FSMA, FDA was authorized but not required to inspect food facilities, with no stipulated inspection frequencies. The FDA lacked resources for sufficient food facility inspections leading up to the passage of FSMA. Despite an increase in registered facilities, the number of food inspectors decreased by 15% from FY2004 to FY2008. Appropriations for field activities and full-time equivalents rose from FY2007 to FY2010, but inspections remained below FY2004 levels. The 111th Congress debated how FDA could target inspection resources to protect public health. Different facilities may require varying inspection frequencies based on contamination risks. FSMA mandates increased inspection rates for registered food facilities and prioritizes high-risk facilities for inspections. Countries with rigorous food standards pose lower health risks. The new law mandates increased inspection rates for food facilities based on contamination risks. High-risk facilities must be inspected at least once every three years, while non-high-risk facilities must be inspected at least once every five years. The Secretary is also required to inspect a specific number of foreign facilities annually and double that number in subsequent years. Inspections can be conducted by other federal, state, or local agencies to meet requirements. FSMA allows the Secretary to rely on inspections by other agencies for food facilities. Foreign facilities must be inspected, and entry of foreign foods can be refused if inspectors are denied access. Resources must be allocated to inspect imported foods at ports of entry based on safety risks. The FSMA requires the Secretary to submit an annual report on food safety risks, including information on food facilities, imports, and FDA foreign offices. Specific provisions for seafood safety include interagency agreements, regulations for raw oysters, and inspections of imported seafood production. Interagency agreements involve examining and testing seafood, coordinating inspections, standardizing data, and joint training. Section 114 mandates reports by the Secretary of HHS and the GAO. Section 114 requires reports to be submitted to Congress and published when the Secretary issues guidance on post-harvest processing of oysters. The Secretary's report requirement is waived if a consensus agreement is reached. Section 306 allows the Secretary of Commerce to send inspectors to assess seafood practices in exporting countries. Inspectors can provide technical assistance and must deliver a report to the subject of the inspection. The Secretary of HHS must provide a report to the subject of the inspection, who can then offer a rebuttal. Before FSMA, FDA lacked authority to regulate private laboratories testing imported foods or accredit them. FDA can conduct on-site assessments of private accredited labs, and industry participation in third-party certification programs is voluntary but may be beneficial. The FDA encourages participation in third-party certification programs for compliance with international criteria. Private laboratory accreditation could provide FDA with greater assurance of imported product safety. FDA issued draft guidance on accreditation standards for private labs testing FDA-regulated products. Importers are encouraged to notify FDA before submitting samples to accredited labs. The FDA promotes third-party certification programs for compliance with international criteria and issued guidance on accreditation standards for private labs testing FDA-regulated products. Concerns have been raised about the autonomy given to importers and private laboratories in testing and certification by third parties. FSMA provisions aim to address concerns about third-party certification programs by implementing laboratory accreditation and certification programs to ensure the accuracy of test results and prevent conflicts of interest. Critics argue that third-party certification may not guarantee safety, as evidenced by recent foodborne illness outbreaks where companies passed inspections despite knowing about positive test results for pathogens like Salmonella in their products. FSMA establishes a system for accrediting third-party auditors who certify that importers meet FDA requirements. Accredited auditors must issue certifications for each food shipment to the US and report any health risks discovered during audits. The law also addresses revocation of accreditation and conflicts of interest. FSMA includes provisions for accrediting third-party auditors, establishing a program for testing food by accredited laboratories, and recognizing accreditation bodies. It also mandates the development of model accreditation standards and re-evaluation of accreditation bodies every five years. FDA now has the authority to mandate food recalls and impose penalties for violations. The FSMA (\u00a7 206) grants the HHS Secretary authority to order food recalls if there is a risk of serious health consequences from consuming adulterated or misbranded food, if the responsible party fails to act within the specified time frame. Major food industry groups now support giving FDA mandatory recall authority for food. The Secretary has authority to require a person to cease food distribution or notify all involved parties in case of a recall. Notifications to the public and establishing an incident command for coordinated communications during recalls are mandated. Civil and criminal penalties can be imposed for non-compliance with recall orders, with civil penalties potentially excluding criminal penalties. Improved notification and traceability are seen as enhancing recall effectiveness. Traceability capabilities are crucial for quickly determining a product's source to prevent foodborne outbreaks. The 110th Congress responded to concerns by requiring food facilities to notify the Secretary of any food with a reasonable probability of causing harm. The 2008 farm bill amended meat and poultry laws to require notification to USDA if adulterated products enter commerce. FSMA allows the Secretary to require additional information on reportable foods and mandates grocery stores to post information sheets developed by FDA. FSMA mandates grocery stores to post one-page information sheets about reportable foods developed by FDA. Enhanced food tracing system requires enhanced record-keeping for higher-risk foods, with exemptions for low-risk foods. Record-keeping requirements effective dates are delayed for small businesses. Pilot studies and assessments of food tracing systems are required. States conduct foodborne illness surveillance with CDC assistance and investigate outbreaks in coordination with FDA or CDC. The FDA, in coordination with CDC, investigates foodborne disease outbreaks involving two or more cases of illness from a common food. Outbreak investigations are rarely launched for less serious hazards with only two affected individuals, except for serious illnesses like botulism. The nation's public health capacity for foodborne illness surveillance has strengths and gaps, with genetic \"fingerprinting\" revolutionizing the identification of multistate outbreaks. The epidemiological approaches used to identify food outbreaks can be labor-intensive and time-consuming. Limited information on common contaminants in FDA-regulated foods hinders attribution of foodborne illnesses. Data from FoodNet shows a plateau in the incidence of foodborne diseases, raising concerns about meeting national health targets for pathogens like Campylobacter, Listeria, and Salmonella. FSMA provisions aim to improve surveillance of foodborne illnesses. FSMA (\u00a7 205) provisions define a foodborne illness outbreak as two or more cases of a similar illness from food ingestion. It requires enhancing surveillance systems, coordinating federal, state, and local efforts, improving epidemiological tools, and establishing a working group. $24 million is authorized annually for FY2011-FY2015 to enhance foodborne illness surveillance. The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) defines adulteration and misbranding as key components. Foods can be deemed adulterated for various reasons, such as containing harmful substances or being prepared under unsanitary conditions. Violations of FFDCA, like introducing adulterated products into interstate commerce, result in criminal and civil penalties. Penalties vary depending on the offense, with provisions outlined in FFDCA \u00a7 303. Injunctions and seizures may also be imposed. Liability provisions under FFDCA \u00a7 303 include penalties for adulterated or misbranded products, with the possibility of injunctions and seizures. Calls for stronger criminal penalties have arisen due to deaths linked to contaminated food, like tainted peanut butter products. Misdemeanor violations can result in fines and up to three years' imprisonment, with maximum penalties of $100,000 or $250,000 for individuals, and $200,000 or $500,000 for organizations, depending on the severity of the offense. The maximum criminal penalty for individuals convicted of a felony violation of FFDCA is imprisonment for not more than three years or a fine of not more than $250,000, or both. Organizations may face a fine of up to $500,000 for felony violations. Exceptions exist for misdemeanor penalties under FFDCA, including the good faith exception and receiving a guaranty from the manufacturer. The criminal penalties for violating FFDCA include imprisonment for individuals and fines for organizations, with the maximum fine being $500,000. Prosecution may be more likely for cases involving intentional violations, fraud, or danger to health. FSMA provisions do not change these penalties. The Food Safety Accountability Act of 2010, S. 3767, aimed to increase penalties for FFDCA violations, including fines and a maximum prison sentence of 10 years for knowing violations. However, these provisions were not included in the final enacted law. FSMA also prohibits food businesses from retaliating against employees who report FFDCA violations. The new law includes provisions for protecting whistleblowers and regulations for dietary supplements under the FFDCA and DSHEA. Concerns exist about defining new dietary ingredients and ensuring their safety. FSMA includes provisions focused on supplements, requiring FDA to notify DEA of potential anabolic steroids in new dietary ingredients and publish guidelines for evaluating their safety. Globalization has led to an increase in food imports. The increase in food imports due to globalization has raised concerns about the safety of these imports. FDA import alerts in 2007 and 2008 targeted adulterated pet food ingredients, farmed seafood, and dairy products from China, sparking a debate on improving import safeguards without hindering free trade. Before FSMA, FDA had the authority to refuse entry to any food import that appeared to be adulterated or misbranded. The FDA relied on prior notifications and document reviews for imported food under the Bioterrorism Act. Importers needed an entry bond and had to file a notification for each shipment. Import inspections were infrequent due to limited resources, with only about 1% of imported food lines physically examined or tested. Limited resources and increasing import volumes were cited as reasons for the low inspection rate. The agency did not have explicit authorization for import verification before FSMA. FSMA provisions tighten controls over food imports, requiring certification or verification by third parties. The HHS Secretary can mandate certifications for imported food based on public health risks. Certifying entities include agencies from the originating country or accredited persons elsewhere. FSMA requires importers to use third parties for verification of foreign suppliers' compliance with FFDCA provisions. Importers must ensure suppliers have preventive controls in place, conduct monitoring and inspections, and test shipments. FSMA requires importers to maintain import verification program records for at least two years and make them available to the Secretary upon request. It also includes provisions for the Secretary to review the equivalence of foreign countries' safety standards, conduct audits, and establish a program for expedited imports under the Voluntary Qualified Importer Program. Some have questioned whether FSMA will provide FDA with equivalence authority similar to that of USDA's FSIS jurisdiction for meat and poultry products. \"Equivalency\" in meat and poultry imports requires foreign products to meet US safety standards. FSIS ensures foreign countries have equivalent safety programs before allowing imports. FSIS conducts visits and operates reinspection programs at border entry points. FDA lacks a similar program. The FDA lacks a program similar to FSIS for regulating food imports at border entry points. Critics argue that FDA's lack of funding and staff hinders its ability to ensure a safe food supply. Congressional appropriators have been urged to increase funding for FDA to address these deficiencies. Congressional appropriators increased funding for FDA food activities each year from FY2005 to FY2010. Proposed increases in program spending raise policy issues as requests for higher appropriations compete with other federal priorities. User fees on the regulated industry have been proposed as an alternative to direct appropriations to fill perceived shortfalls. The President's FY2011 budget request included fees for reinspection, export certification, and inspection and registration. Before FSMA, FDA had the authority to collect user fees for prescription drugs, medical devices, biologics, and tobacco products. These fees fund approval-related activities and cannot be used for enforcement or inspection of products on the market. User fee programs are typically authorized in five-year increments. Since before the FSMA, FDA has been authorized to collect export certification fees for drugs, animal drugs, medical devices, and biological products. These fees, which can be up to $175, have added to the agency's budget and allowed for the hiring of reviewers and support personnel to expedite the application review process. The introduction of user fees for drugs, biological products, and medical devices has raised concerns about conflicts of interest and the potential for fees to replace rather than supplement agency funding. Clear conflict-of-interest guidelines and restrictions on fund usage have been established to address these issues. Certain fees require direct appropriations to meet a threshold before user fees can be collected. Funding from periodic fees can be unpredictable, leading to budgetary shortfalls. To address this, annual fees like registration fees were enacted for more consistent funding. Small businesses have raised concerns about the impact of user fees. Small businesses in the drugs and devices sector claim that user fees have a disproportionate impact on their work. To address this, reductions are offered for small businesses. FSMA provisions include annual and periodic fees for FDA food safety activities, with details on fee amounts, payment restrictions, and fund usage. The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) includes provisions for annual and periodic fees for FDA food safety activities, with details on fee amounts, payment restrictions, and fund usage. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that over five years, the new requirements would collect $241 million, with additional outlays of $1.1 billion needed to cover the costs of new requirements, including more frequent inspections."
