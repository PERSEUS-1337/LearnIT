    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Mississippi Interstate Cooperative Resource Agreement Act of 1996\". The Congress recognizes the need for cooperation between Federal and State authorities, as well as citizen groups, to address fishery management issues in rivers that cross multiple state boundaries. Problems such as pollution and habitat loss have been caused by federally regulated activities and projects. The construction of waterway developments is degrading large river ecosystems nationwide, leading to the loss of diverse habitats and endangering native fish populations. Without positive management actions, native species will continue to decline, causing conflicts among water users. The public will face reduced opportunities for recreational, commercial, subsistence, and aesthetic uses of river systems without changes in management strategies. Several programs are proposed or underway to address these issues. Several programs are proposed or underway to resolve conflicts in management strategies. In the Mississippi River drainage basin, Federal, State, and local fishery resource managers have entered into the Mississippi Interstate Cooperative Resource Agreement to share information, resources, and funding for long-range strategic plans. This agreement serves as a model for managing interjurisdictional rivers' fishery resources. To improve coordination and conservation of fishery resources in interjurisdictional rivers, strategies are needed for better cooperation, research, and information sharing among programs. SEC. 3. MISSISSIPPI INTERSTATE COOPERATIVE RESOURCE AGREEMENT. The Secretary, in cooperation with the Mississippi Interstate Cooperative Resource Association, will conduct a pilot test of the Mississippi Interstate Cooperative Resource Agreement. The pilot test may include identifying and describing river ecosystems, fishery resources, fish habitats, and the impacts of various projects on the Mississippi River drainage basin. The curr_chunk discusses the impacts of various factors on fish stocks, including pollution, dredging, water management, and vessel traffic. It also mentions techniques for mitigating these impacts, analyzing fish stock depletion, identifying information gaps, and studying the status and restoration needs of fish stocks. The curr_chunk focuses on the management, research, and restoration needs of the interjurisdictional fishery resources of the Mississippi River drainage system. It includes developing recommendations for cooperative management and research projects, restoration plans for depleted fish stocks and habitats, and evaluating the feasibility and success of the program under the Mississippi Interstate Cooperative Resource Agreement. The curr_chunk discusses the evaluation of a pilot test under the Mississippi Interstate Cooperative Resource Agreement, including estimates of funds required for implementation. A report to Congress is required within 36 months of the Act's enactment. The Secretary may use funds to pay assistance to the Mississippi Interstate Cooperative Resource Association for participating in the pilot test under the Act. The Act defines interjurisdictional fishery resources as those dependent on rivers managed by multiple entities, interjurisdictional rivers as those shared by multiple states, the Secretary as the head of the US Fish and Wildlife Service, and State Fish and Wildlife Agency as state departments empowered by law. The term \"Mississippi Interstate Cooperative Resource Association\" refers to the association of states and entities signatories to the Mississippi Interstate Cooperative Resource Agreement."
