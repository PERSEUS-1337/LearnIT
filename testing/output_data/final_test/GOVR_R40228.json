    "content": "A bid protest is a written objection by an \"interested party\" to a federal agency's conduct in acquiring supplies or services. This can include solicitation requests, cancellations, awards, terminations, or conversions to private sector performance. Bid protests were introduced in the federal procurement system in the early 20th century. Bid protests were introduced in the federal procurement system in the early 20th century. Congress authorizes bid protests in three separate forums - the procuring agency, GAO, and the Court of Federal Claims. GAO began hearing bid protests in the early 20th century based on its statutory authority. Federal courts did not hear protests at that time. The federal government initially lacked standing to challenge violations of federal procurement laws by government agencies, as these laws were seen as for the government's benefit. However, the courts later granted bid protest jurisdiction to GAO through the Administrative Procedure Act and the Competition in Contracting Act. GAO has a long history of handling bid protests, including unique aspects like the stay of contract award or performance. The GAO bid-protest process is a key venue for federal bid protests, allowing disappointed bidders to challenge contract awards. Congress has authorized various forums for bid protests to ensure accountability in government contracting and maintain competition for contracts. Bid protests enhance accountability in government procurement by highlighting and correcting mistakes and misconduct, ensuring the integrity of the system. However, protests can delay the acquisition of goods and services needed by the government and require officials to spend time explaining their conduct. Protests in government procurement require officials to explain their conduct to disappointed bidders and defend their decisions. Congress charged GAO with resolving bid protests quickly and affordably under CICA. Time frames and procedures are established to meet these goals. Disappointed bidders can protest alleged violations by federal agencies. The GAO can hear alleged violations of procurement statutes or regulations by federal agencies in soliciting offers, awarding contracts, or converting functions to private sector performance. This includes protests before and after contract award, with additional jurisdiction granted by Congress since FY2008. The GAO can hear alleged violations of procurement statutes or regulations by federal agencies, including protests before and after contract award. GAO regulations bar consideration of certain issues related to government contracts. The GAO can hear protests related to the 8(a) Program, contractor responsibility determinations, procurement integrity violations, non-federal agency procurements, subcontract awards, debarment and suspension of contractors, competitive range inclusion, and agency tender officials' protest decisions. The GAO can hear protests related to various aspects of federal procurement, including the 8(a) Program, contractor responsibility determinations, procurement integrity violations, subcontract awards, and competitive range inclusion. Interested parties with a direct economic interest can file pre-award protests, allowing a larger number of contractors to participate compared to post-award protests. Only contractors who bid on the contract or submitted offers may generally qualify as interested parties for GAO bid protests. Concerned citizens and subcontractors typically lack standing unless requested by the contracting agency. Other parties involved in GAO bid protests include the agency responsible for violations and potential intervenors protecting their status as awardees. Intervenors in GAO bid protests protect their status as awardees or potential awardees. GAO regulations allow bidders with a substantial chance of winning to intervene before the contract is awarded. After the contract is awarded, only the winning bidder can generally intervene. GAO aims to resolve protests inexpensively by simplifying the process for interested parties to file protests without legal representation. Protestors need to identify the contracting agency, provide a detailed statement of legal and factual grounds, and include relevant documents. The GAO allows protesters to submit protests based on documents, avoiding the need for in-person hearings in Washington, DC. Hearings are rare, with only 3% to 8% of cases annually involving them. When held, hearings are less formal than in federal court, with procedures and issues determined at a pre-hearing conference. This streamlined process, along with strict time frames for resolution, makes GAO protests less burdensome. The GAO's streamlined process and strict time frames for resolving protests make it a less expensive venue for bid protests compared to the Court of Federal Claims. However, concerns have been raised about the potential for erroneous decisions and whether GAO is the best forum for complex awards worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Federal statutes mandate expedited resolution of protests, with GAO required to resolve them within 65 to 100 days. The GAO must adhere to strict time frames for resolving bid protests within 65 to 100 days to ensure prompt resolution and prevent delays in procurement by federal agencies. In contrast, protests filed with the Court of Federal Claims could take over 100 days to be heard, with no guarantee of a contract stay during the protest. Interested parties must file bid protests with GAO depending on the circumstances prompting the protest. Protests must be filed before bid opening or receipt of initial proposals, with other alleged violations protested within 10 days of becoming known. Late protests may be considered by GAO with good cause or significant issues. Missed GAO deadlines can lead to bid protests with the Court of Federal Claims. Upon filing a protest with GAO, the agency must be notified within one working day. This triggers an automatic stay on contract award or performance. The agency then has 30 days to respond to the protest by filing a report with GAO. Upon filing a protest with GAO, the agency must be notified within one working day, triggering an automatic stay on contract award or performance. The agency then has 30 days to respond by filing a report with GAO, including relevant facts, contract value estimate, legal memorandum, and necessary documents. The protester can submit written comments within 10 days after the agency's report is filed. Protesters have 10 calendar days to submit written comments on the agency's report to GAO. GAO must issue a final decision on a bid protest within 100 calendar days, which can be shortened to 65 days under the \"express option.\" GAO can dismiss frivolous protests at any time and is required to report to Congress on any delays in issuing final decisions. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) must report to Congress if it fails to issue a final decision on a protest within 100 calendar days. In FY2014, due to a 16-day government shutdown, GAO extended bid protest deadlines. 280 protests were affected, with 241 resolved within 100 days and 39 within 100 calendar days plus the shutdown period. Protesters have 5 days to request expedited review under GAO's \"express option.\" Under CICA, filing a bid protest with GAO can trigger an automatic stay of contract award or performance. Pre-award protests prevent contract award until resolved, while post-award protests require withholding performance authorization. If authorization is not withheld, the agency must instruct the contractor to stop work until the protest is resolved. The GAO bid-protest process includes bid-protest stays, known as \"CICA stays,\" which delay contract award or performance until the protest is resolved. Unlike GAO protests, protests filed with the Court of Federal Claims do not automatically trigger stays, leading to concerns that contractors may abuse the system by filing meritless protests to delay awards. The GAO bid-protest process includes bid-protest stays, known as \"CICA stays,\" which delay contract award or performance until the protest is resolved. Agencies can override CICA stays in cases of urgent and compelling circumstances or when the contract performance is in the best interests of the United States. When GAO bid protests are filed, agencies can assert \"urgent and compelling circumstances\" before or after contract award, or assert the \"best interests of the United States\" after award. Courts and commentators suggest that \"urgent and compelling circumstances\" may carry more weight and require a written finding for any agency override. Any agency override in the United States requires a written finding of grounds, with notification to GAO. GAO cannot reverse the agency's override determination and lacks authority to stop the contract award. Only a federal court, like the Court of Federal Claims, can reverse an agency override and reinstate the delay triggered by a GAO bid protest. The Court of Federal Claims can grant a protester's motion to restrain the government from awarding a contract. Agency determinations are no longer exempt from judicial review, and the court now scrutinizes override determinations. GAO decides bid protests but does not substitute its judgment for the agency's. When GAO reviews a protest, it considers if the agency followed procurement laws and had valid reasons for its decisions. If no violation is found, the protest is denied, allowing the agency to proceed with the contract. If a violation is found, GAO may recommend actions such as re-competing the contract or awarding it in compliance with regulations. In recommending actions for procurement protests, GAO considers various factors such as seriousness of deficiencies, prejudice to parties, costs, urgency, and impact on agency mission. GAO may also recommend that the agency cover the protester's costs, including legal fees and expenses. When GAO recommends that an agency pay costs for a procurement protest, the agency must either pay promptly or provide reasons for not paying. The agency must try to agree with the protester on costs, but if no agreement is reached, the protester can request GAO to recommend an amount. However, the agency is not legally required to implement GAO's recommendations due to the separation of powers doctrine. Agencies usually adopt GAO recommendations, as shown in Table 3. According to GAO's annual reports to Congress, agencies mostly adopt GAO's recommendations, with only a few cases of non-adoption between FY2001 and FY2015. The number of non-adoption cases increased in FY2012 and FY2013 due to a disagreement on statutory interpretation, which was later taken up by the Supreme Court. However, the number decreased to one case each in FY2014 and FY2015. Agencies have 60 days to adopt GAO recommendations, and failure to do so requires notification to GAO and congressional committees. Since 2007, agencies must promptly notify GAO of non-adoption of recommendations, allowing Congress to oversee or enforce compliance. Following GAO recommendations doesn't guarantee immunity from legal challenges, as shown in Court of Federal Claims cases like Geo-Seis Helicopters, Inc. v. United States. In recent cases like Grunley Walsh International, LLC v. United States, courts have found that following GAO recommendations blindly can lead to arbitrary decisions and violations of the APA. This contrasts with the \"late is late\" rule in Federal Acquisition Regulation Section 52.215-1(c)(3)(ii)(A). Prior courts had not explicitly linked GAO recommendations with APA violations, highlighting the need for agencies to carefully consider and evaluate such recommendations. The cases of Geo-Seis Helicopters, Grunley Walsh, and related cases illustrate the challenges agencies face in complying with CICA and GAO recommendations. Failure to implement GAO recommendations can lead to reporting to Congress and possible oversight, while blindly following recommendations that are later deemed irrational can result in accusations of acting arbitrarily. Protesters dissatisfied with GAO decisions can request reconsideration or file a bid protest with the Court of Federal Claims. Agencies, intervenors, and disappointed parties can also seek reconsideration from GAO. Filing a request for reconsideration with GAO does not stay contract award or performance like filing a bid protest with GAO does. GAO receives far fewer requests for reconsideration than bid protests each year. GAO receives fewer requests for reconsideration than bid protests each year. Disappointed protesters can appeal GAO's decisions to the Court of Federal Claims by alleging procurement activities were not in accordance with the law. The Court reviews the agency's actions and historically defers to GAO decisions on factual questions. The Court of Federal Claims reviews agency procurement decisions to determine if they lacked a rational basis or violated laws or procedures. Factors considered include whether the agency relied on unauthorized factors, failed to consider important aspects, or provided implausible explanations. A protest in the Court of Federal Claims does not automatically stop the agency's contract award or performance authorization. Bid protesters must file and succeed in their claims. In the Court of Federal Claims, a bid protester must file and win a motion for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction to delay the agency's procurement actions, unlike a GAO protest which automatically causes a delay."
