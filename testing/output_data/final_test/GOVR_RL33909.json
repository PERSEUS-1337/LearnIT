    "content": "Title IV of the Higher Education Act authorizes student financial aid programs for various institutions of higher education, including public, private non-profit, and for-profit institutions. In the 2005-2006 academic year, 39.9% of Title IV institutions were for-profit, with the rest divided between public and private non-profit. Over $80 billion in federal student aid was available that year. Schools must be licensed, accredited, and meet other requirements for students to receive Title IV assistance. The federal government relies on accrediting agencies and state licensing to determine program quality and institutional eligibility for Title IV programs. Federal involvement focuses on protecting administrative capacity and fiscal integrity through certification by the U.S. Department of Education. The 1992 Higher Education Amendments aimed to strengthen program integrity by reforming the triad structure for approving institutions for Title IV student aid programs, addressing fraud and abuse concerns. The amendments included changes to eligible institution definitions and the process for program participation. The 1992 Higher Education Amendments reformed institutional eligibility rules for postsecondary institutions, with a focus on proprietary schools. The 1998 Higher Education Act Amendments further modified eligibility requirements for proprietary institutions, including revenue sources and refund policies. The Higher Education Reconciliation Act of 2006 (HERA) made changes to institutional eligibility under the Higher Education Act (HEA), including refunds for Title IV recipients who withdraw early, a distance learning program, and restrictions on teacher preparation programs. President George W. Bush signed HERA into law on February 8, 2006. This report discusses changes to institutional eligibility under the Higher Education Act, including refunds for Title IV recipients, distance learning programs, and restrictions on teacher preparation programs. It provides an overview of HEA provisions affecting eligibility for Title IV student aid programs and specific issues that may arise during the reauthorization process. The report also covers the program integrity triad and additional issues related to institutional eligibility. The report discusses institutional eligibility under the Higher Education Act, including Program Participation Agreements, return of Title IV funds policy, and distance education. Institutions must meet specific criteria for federal student aid programs, including program offerings, student enrollment, operations, and program length. The report also addresses the definition of eligible IHEs for Title IV purposes, academic year requirements, eligible program requirements, and reauthorization issues. The HEA includes two definitions of IHEs to screen out institutions with characteristics associated with fraud and abuse. The Higher Education Act defines eligible institutions as those meeting specific criteria for federal student aid programs, including accreditation, nonprofit status, and enrollment of qualified students. It also includes institutions offering training programs for employment and admitting students beyond compulsory school age. The Higher Education Act expands the definition of eligible institutions to include proprietary institutions, postsecondary vocational institutions, and foreign institutions. Proprietary institutions must meet specific criteria, including accreditation, legal authorization, and admitting students beyond compulsory school age. Postsecondary vocational institutions must be nonprofit and meet specific criteria, including offering courses by correspondence or telecommunications. They are exempt from the 90/10 rule for revenue sources. The student takes a correspondent examination provided by the IHE and returns it for grading. Institutions offering over 50% of courses by correspondence are not Title IV eligible. Enrollment rules also apply, with no more than 25% of students being incarcerated. Foreign institutions can participate in the Federal Family Education Loan program if they meet the same requirements as domestic institutions and are approved by the Department of Education. Foreign medical and veterinary schools have additional criteria to meet for participation. Foreign medical schools located outside of the United States must meet specific criteria to participate in the Federal Family Education Loan program. This includes having a certain percentage of non-U.S. citizens or permanent residents among students and graduates, as well as ensuring a passing score for students taking exams administered by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates. Additionally, foreign for-profit veterinary institutions must have their students complete clinical training at an approved veterinary school in the United States to be eligible. Institutions must meet additional requirements for Title IV eligibility, including preventing drug and alcohol abuse, management criteria, campus security policies, and reporting obligations. Failure to comply results in ineligibility for federal financial assistance. The curr_chunk discusses compliance requirements for institutions regarding reporting and dissemination of information, academic year requirements, and the Secretary's authority to adjust requirements. These requirements are reiterated in the Program Participation Agreement. The HERA modified the minimum weeks of instructional time for programs measuring program length in clock hours, reducing it to 26 weeks. The provision allowing the Secretary to waive the requirement of a minimum of 30 weeks of instructional time for programs leading to associate's or bachelor's degrees was retained. The Higher Education Amendments of 1992 defined the academic year for eligible institutions to include a minimum of 30 weeks of instructional time, which can be met through standard terms, non-standard terms, or non-term programs. The implementation of this requirement was addressed by the Department of Education through regulatory action. The Department of Education defined a \"week of instructional time\" for programs using standard terms or clock hours as any week with at least one day of instruction. For programs measured in credit hours without standard terms, a week of instructional time was defined as any week with at least five days of instruction. The regulations were modified in November 1994 to provide more flexibility for programs without standard terms. The Department of Education implemented the \"12-hour rule\" to ensure programs without standard terms provide adequate instruction. However, this rule had unintended consequences for programs with rolling starting times and overlapping terms, impacting student flexibility and access to higher education. The Department of Education revised its regulatory guidance to address difficulties with the 12-hour rule, ensuring Title IV program eligibility is determined using the one-day rule for all institutions, regardless of standard or non-standard terms. This change took effect on July 1, 2003, aiming to improve access to higher education. The new regulation effective from July 1, 2003, requires schools to offer at least one eligible program to qualify for Title IV. Institutions must ensure program eligibility before awarding Title IV funds to students. Criteria for program eligibility classify schools as IHEs, proprietary institutions, or vocational institutions based on the programs they offer. Proprietary institutions or postsecondary vocational education institutions offer programs that prepare students for gainful employment in recognized occupations. Eligible programs must provide a minimum number of hours of instruction and admit students accordingly. Eligible programs at proprietary or postsecondary vocational education institutions must meet specific criteria, including providing a minimum number of hours of instruction and admitting students who have completed an associate's degree or equivalent. Short-term programs must also meet additional criteria such as verified student completion and job placement rates of at least 70%. The HERA expanded eligibility criteria for programs at proprietary or postsecondary vocational education institutions, including the use of direct assessment of student learning. The Secretary of Education determines if a program using direct assessment qualifies. Eligible programs must have been in existence for at least one year and meet specific criteria for instruction hours and student admissions. Congress may consider issues related to institutional eligibility, such as the definition of an institution of higher education and the admission criteria for regular students. One debate is whether proprietary institutions should be allowed to participate in titles other than Title IV of the Higher Education Act. Additionally, Congress may discuss expanding the definition of a regular student to include those dually enrolled in high school and college courses. Congress may consider changes to the 90/10 rule, potentially applying it to all institutions of higher education. They may also look into requiring IHEs to provide more cost and price information to help students choose a school. Additionally, incentives or penalties could be considered for institutions that adjust their costs and prices accordingly. The federal government may penalize or publicly identify institutions of higher education with rising prices. Part H of Title IV outlines the roles of state authorization, accreditation, and eligibility certification. The triad aims to ensure institution eligibility for Title IV, with states focusing on consumer protection and accrediting agencies on quality assurance. The federal government oversees compliance to avoid interference in educational decision-making. The state's role in the triad is to provide legal authorization for postsecondary institutions to operate within the state. Institutions must show evidence of this authorization to the Department of Education when applying for federal student aid programs. State agencies also have additional responsibilities, including providing information to the Secretary upon request. Accreditation by an agency recognized by ED is essential for institutional eligibility. Accrediting agencies review member institutions based on quality guidelines. Accreditation is voluntary and serves as a quality control mechanism. Accreditation is a voluntary process that started in the late 1800s to distinguish institutions of higher education. The federal government began recognizing accrediting agencies in 1952, linking accreditation to institutional eligibility for Title IV aid. There are three types of accrediting organizations, including regional accrediting organizations that accredit 2,986 colleges and universities. Accreditation status is granted to the whole institution, not individual programs or students. Regional accrediting organizations accredit degree-granting, nonprofit institutions. They may also accredit proprietary institutions. National accrediting organizations operate across the U.S. and accredit whole institutions. There are two types of national accrediting organizations\u2014faith-based and private career. Faith-based accreditors review religiously-affiliated institutions, while private career accreditors accredit a larger number of institutions, with most being non-degree-granting and proprietary. Accrediting organizations review various types of institutions, with many being non-degree-granting and proprietary. Specialized accrediting organizations focus on specific programs like engineering and technology. Accreditation involves self-assessment, peer review, and site visits to ensure quality. The accreditation commission determines accreditation status based on self-assessment, peer review, and site visits. Accreditation must be renewed every few years to every 10 years for Title IV eligibility. Accrediting organizations must meet criteria for ED recognition and reapproval every five years. The accrediting agency must be a state, regional, or national agency with the ability to serve as an accrediting agency. It must meet specific criteria to participate in Title IV programs, including having a voluntary membership of IHEs and accrediting these institutions as a primary purpose. Alternatively, it can be a state agency approved by the Secretary as an accrediting agency before October 1, 1991. Accrediting agencies for Title IV programs must be separate from trade organizations or membership groups and must meet specific criteria set by the Secretary. The accreditation process must ensure the quality of education programs offered by an institution, assessing student achievement, faculty, facilities, and more. Existing relationships with trade organizations must not compromise independence. Accrediting agencies and associations must evaluate various aspects of institutions, including services, admissions practices, program length, credentials offered, student complaints, compliance with Title IV requirements, student loan default rates, financial audits, and on-site inspections to ensure educational quality. Operating procedures, branch campus reviews, and public disclosure of accreditation status are also key requirements for accrediting bodies. Accrediting agencies must conduct on-site inspections focusing on educational quality and program effectiveness. Section 496 outlines procedures for ED's recognition of accrediting agencies, including independent evaluations, third-party information solicitation, decision process documentation, and reasons for denial of recognition. The Secretary is advised by the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity (NACIQI) regarding accreditation issues. The National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity (NACIQI) advises the Secretary on accreditation issues. NACIQI appoints representatives knowledgeable about postsecondary education and includes members from all types of institutions. The committee assesses eligibility and certification processes for Title IV, advises on accrediting standards, and oversees accreditation changes. Institutions seeking to change accrediting agencies must submit documentation to the Department of Education. Institutions must provide documentation to the Department of Education for accreditation changes. Dual accreditation requires justification and choosing one accrediting agency for Title IV eligibility. Institutions with recent accreditation issues may not be eligible for Title IV funds. The Department of Education (ED) is responsible for verifying an institution's legal authority to operate, accreditation status, administrative capability, and financial responsibility for Title IV eligibility. A special rule allows continued eligibility for religious institutions losing accreditation related to their religious mission. All institutions must complete an Application for Approval to Participate in Federal Student Financial Aid Programs (E-App) for Title IV program participation. Institutions must complete an application for Title IV program participation, providing information on educational programs, ownership changes, third-party servicers, administrative capability, and financial responsibility. Eligibility is authorized for up to six years, with ED assessing the institution's ability to meet financial obligations and comply with requirements. Failure to meet financial ratios may lead to additional criteria for evaluation. The Department of Education (ED) may use various criteria to determine an institution's financial responsibility, including third-party guarantees, state backing of liabilities, and audited financial statements. Institutions must maintain cash reserves specified by ED to ensure repayment of Title IV funds. Waivers for specific ratio requirements may be granted to IHEs with no solvency doubts, up-to-date liability payments, and substantial equity in facilities. The Department of Education (ED) specifies required reserves for Title IV funds and may require financial guarantees to protect the US interests. ED can establish procedures for administrative capacity of institutions, focusing on electronic processes, financial aid office requirements, academic progress, and more. Institutions must demonstrate administrative capability through various requirements. Institutions must meet requirements for demonstrating administrative capability in handling federal student aid programs. This includes having staff to administer Title IV programs, resolving discrepancies in aid information, reporting fraud, providing financial aid counseling, and ensuring satisfactory academic progress for recipients. The institution must ensure satisfactory academic progress and establish a maximum timeframe for program completion. Financial aid history is considered in award decisions. Institutions seeking Title IV participation must have a low undergraduate withdrawal rate. They must certify no debarment or suspension by a federal agency. Fiduciary responsibility is required to safeguard Title IV funds for intended students. Administrative capability may be assessed based on cohort default rates for specific programs. Administrative capability is assessed based on cohort default rates for specific Title IV programs, including FFEL, Direct Loans (DL), and Perkins loans. Default rates exceeding certain thresholds may result in an institution being found not administratively capable. ED may grant provisional certification in certain cases. Provisional certification may be granted to institutions with high cohort default rates for up to three years. It can be awarded for one year for initial certification or up to three years for assessing administrative capacity and financial responsibility. Provisional certification may also be given in cases of ownership change or if an accrediting agency's recognition is withdrawn by ED. Institutions with Title IV eligibility may continue for up to 18 months after recognition withdrawal. If not accredited by another recognized organization, Title IV eligibility is lost. ED can conduct site visits and program reviews at participating institutions, prioritizing those with high default rates. Institutions with Title IV eligibility may face sanctions if they violate federal student aid program regulations or agreements. Sanctions can include emergency actions, fines, limitations, suspensions, and terminations. Financially irresponsible or deficient institutions may be placed on provisional certification or corrective actions. Institutions with Title IV eligibility may face sanctions for violating federal student aid program regulations or agreements. Sanctions can include emergency actions, fines, limitations, suspensions, and terminations. If violations occur, the Department of Education may take formal or informal actions, including withholding federal student aid funds in emergency situations. Emergency actions can suspend an institution's participation in federal student aid programs, disbursement of funds, and certification of FFEL applications. These actions are taken if misuse of federal funds is detected and immediate intervention is necessary. They last for 30 days but can be extended if limitation, suspension, or termination proceedings are initiated. The institution can contest the emergency action. The Department of Education (ED) has formal procedures for addressing violations, including fines and limitations. Fines can be up to $27,500 per violation, based on the seriousness of the violation. Institutions may also be placed under limitations, agreeing to certain conditions for at least 12 months. If a violation occurs, ED may temporarily suspend an institution's participation in federal student aid programs. The Department of Education (ED) has formal procedures for addressing violations, including fines and limitations of up to $27,500 per violation. Institutions may be temporarily suspended from federal student aid programs if a violation occurs. If the violation is not corrected, ED may revoke an institution's participation for up to 60 days, require corrective action such as repaying funds, or terminate participation for 18 months. Reasons for losing eligibility include school closure, expired participation, voluntary withdrawal, or failure to meet requirements. Institutions must apply for reinstatement and show correction of violations, including fund repayment. ED may approve, approve with limitations, or deny reinstatement requests. During 2000-2005, 530 institutions lost Title IV eligibility, mainly due to closure (31%) and loss of accreditation (20%). Issues like credit transfer and accreditation type influence student transfers between institutions. The study highlighted issues with credit transfer between institutions, especially regarding the acceptance of credits earned at nationally accredited institutions. Congress may consider legislation to address this, such as creating articulation agreements and requiring transparency in transfer credit policies. Additionally, there is a call for accrediting organizations to ensure compliance with transfer credit policies. Congress may require accrediting organizations to focus more on student outcomes like learning, job placement, and graduation rates rather than inputs like faculty and curricula. Institutional eligibility for Title IV federal student aid programs is affected by Program Participation Agreements, return of Title IV funds, and distance education. Failure to meet requirements in these areas may lead to loss of Title IV eligibility. Institutions must sign a Program Participation Agreement with the Department of Education to participate in Title IV programs, agreeing to comply with regulations. The agreement includes important details such as approval dates, expiration dates, eligible programs, and general participation terms. The Program Participation Agreement (PPA) outlines regulations that institutions must comply with to participate in Title IV programs. This includes requirements such as having a drug and alcohol abuse program, campus security program, reporting institutional information, providing data on student athletes, offering a GED preparatory program, and ensuring civil rights and privacy compliance. Additionally, institutions must make a good faith effort to register students to vote, unless the state has implemented motor vehicle-voter registration. The Program Participation Agreement (PPA) outlines regulations for institutions participating in Title IV programs, including civil rights and privacy compliance. The PPA prohibits incentive payments based on student enrollment success. ED created safe harbors for institutions to avoid this prohibition, effective July 1, 2003. The Program Participation Agreement (PPA) prohibits compensation arrangements related to student admissions to postsecondary institutions, including common business practices. Safe harbors were created by ED to allow certain compensation payments without being considered incentives, effective July 1, 2003. The 1992 reauthorization added a federal requirement for program participation regarding the return of Title IV funds to prevent institutions from enrolling students and receiving funds without consequences for dropouts. The return of funds policy applies to all students receiving Title IV funds who withdraw from school. The return of funds policy applies to students receiving Title IV funds who withdraw from school. The policy requires a pro-rata calculation of aid earned up to the 60% point in each payment period. Institutions use a specific process to determine the amount of aid earned and any funds that need to be returned or disbursed to the student. The percentage of Title IV aid earned by a student is calculated based on their withdrawal date, which is determined differently depending on the institution's attendance policy. The withdrawal date is used to calculate the percentage of enrollment or payment period completed, with different procedures for credit-hour and clock-hour programs. If a student withdraws from a credit-hour program, the percentage of Title IV aid earned is based on the percentage of the enrollment or payment period completed. If over 60% is completed, 100% of aid is earned, otherwise, it is pro-rated. For clock-hour programs, the percentage earned is based on the scheduled hours completed. The percentage of Title IV aid earned by a student who withdraws from a clock-hour program is calculated based on the percentage of scheduled hours completed. This calculation determines the amount of Title IV aid earned, which may result in a post-withdrawal disbursement if the student received less aid than earned. If a student withdraws from a clock-hour program, the institution may make a post-withdrawal disbursement of Title IV aid. If the student received more aid than earned, the school or student must return the unearned funds. The school calculates the amount to be returned based on the lesser of unearned funds or institutional charges multiplied by the percentage of unearned funds. The institution has 45 days to return its portion of unearned funds, and the student is responsible for any remaining unearned funds. The student is responsible for all unearned Title IV funds not returned by the school. The initial amount due is the balance of unearned funds after the school's return. The student repays 50% of the initial Title IV grant overpayment. There was controversy over the interpretation of the 50% reduction in grant funds. The HERA clarified the interpretation of the provision regarding grant overpayments. The amount to be repaid by a student is limited to the original overpayment exceeding 50% of the total Title IV grant funds received. This means that the student may not have to repay any of the grant if the reduction in grant aid exceeds the amount owed. The HERA clarified the interpretation of grant overpayments, stating that if the reduction in grant aid exceeds the amount owed, the student may not have to repay any of the grant. Additionally, the HERA added requirements for making post-withdrawal disbursements of loan funds, including contacting the student to confirm the need for the funds. The issue of handling federal aid for student reservists called to active duty during the war in Iraq has become prominent. If these students withdraw, the institution must calculate a return of Title IV funds. Students should not be notified if they owe funds, but if they take a leave of absence for military duty, it is capped at 180 days. The student must be able to resume studies where they left off without obligation to pay. Distance education, including correspondence and telecommunications courses, allows for instruction without the need for physical presence. Institutions are encouraged to refund or credit students affected by military mobilization, ensuring they can resume studies without additional charges. Courses have expanded to increase student access to postsecondary education through online instruction. Title IV program requirements may pose challenges for funding distance education programs. The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 introduced the Distance Education Demonstration Program to address some of these issues. Regulations define correspondence and telecommunications courses for Title IV programs. A correspondence course is a home study course where the institution provides instructional materials and exams for grading. A telecommunications course is offered through technology like television, audio, or the Internet. The 50% rules were established in 1992 to prevent fraud in print-based instruction institutions. The 50% rules established by Congress in 1992 affected institutional and student eligibility for Title IV aid. If more than 50% of an institution's courses are correspondence courses or if 50% or more of its students are enrolled in correspondence courses, it loses Title IV eligibility. These rules aimed to prevent fraud in print-based instruction institutions. The Higher Education Reauthorization Act (HERA) eliminated the requirement that telecommunications courses be considered correspondence courses. Institutions offering more than 50% of courses by correspondence would lose Title IV eligibility, but telecommunications courses were excluded from this rule. Additionally, if 50% or more of an institution's students were enrolled in correspondence courses, it would lose Title IV eligibility. The HERA eliminated the rule that considered telecommunications courses as correspondence courses, impacting student eligibility for Title IV funds. Students in telecommunications courses were previously eligible for funds if in a degree or certificate program of at least one year. Programs less than a year were considered correspondence courses and ineligible for Title IV funds. The HERA eliminated the rule that required telecommunications courses to be considered correspondence courses, impacting student eligibility for Title IV aid. Students in distance education courses can now receive aid if enrolled in degree or certificate programs of any length that meet program eligibility requirements. Correspondence course students are only eligible if enrolled in a degree program. The HERA changed rules for student eligibility for Title IV aid, allowing students in distance education courses to receive aid in eligible programs offered through telecommunications by accredited institutions. The Secretary recognizes 19 accrediting agencies for evaluating distance education programs. Congress established a demonstration program to expand distance education, increase student access, and determine effective delivery methods. Program requirements for Title IV institutions were waived. Program requirements for institutions participating in Title IV programs were waived for the demonstration program, including the 50% rules for correspondence courses and full-time student definitions. A total of 24 participants, including proprietary institutions and private non-profit organizations, are currently involved in the program. In the program, 24 participants are involved, including proprietary institutions, private non-profit organizations, public universities, consortia, and a public system. Institutions eligible for the program were located in the United States and offered associate's or bachelor's degree programs. Enrollment in distance education programs increased significantly from 1998-1999 to 2003-2004, showing a nearly 700% increase. Enrollment in distance education programs grew significantly from 1998-1999 to 2003-2004, with a 700% increase. Institutions participating in the program saw a 400% growth in enrollment, especially among those serving adult students. Students in the program are typically female, part-time, and older than traditional college age. The Department of Education found that waivers granted to participants did not increase fraud and abuse, but rather, the institution's administrative capability and financial viability posed a greater risk to federal aid program integrity. Distance education allows for innovation in student access and flexibility, but administrative requirements may hinder this innovation. Distance education programs have seen significant growth in enrollment, especially among institutions serving adult students. While waivers granted to participants did not increase fraud and abuse, administrative requirements of Title IV student financial aid programs may hinder innovation in student access and flexibility. Congress may need to address additional issues related to distance education during HEA reauthorization, such as accrediting agencies having specific standards for evaluating distance education programs. The Congress may need to consider adding safeguards for distance education courses to ensure student identity verification and define telecommunications courses more specifically. Institutions are offering more flexible course structures, which complicates student aid calculations and disbursements. The Congress may need to consider switching to an alternative model for aid calculation and disbursement based on an individual student's program of instruction to simplify the process."
