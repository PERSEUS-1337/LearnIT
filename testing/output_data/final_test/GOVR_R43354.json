    "content": "The Buy American Act establishes a price preference for domestic products in federal acquisitions, giving priority to goods made in the United States. The act requires agencies to prioritize domestic end products and construction materials, even if they are not the lowest offer. The Buy American Act establishes a price preference for domestic products in federal acquisitions, giving priority to goods made in the United States. Agencies must add a certain percentage of the low offer's price to determine the lowest priced offer, with percentages ranging from 6% to 50%. If the domestic offer is still the lowest after this adjustment, the agency must award the contract to the domestic offeror. If the foreign offer remains the lowest, the agency may award the contract to the foreign offeror under provisions of the Buy American Act. The Buy American Act establishes a price preference for domestic products in federal acquisitions, giving priority to goods made in the United States. Agencies must add a certain percentage of the low offer's price to determine the lowest priced offer, with percentages ranging from 6% to 50%. If the domestic offer is still the lowest after this adjustment, the agency must award the contract to the domestic offeror. If the foreign offer remains the lowest, the agency may award the contract to the foreign offeror under provisions of the Buy American Act. The Act also includes exceptions for the purchase of foreign end products and construction materials when the costs of domestic ones are deemed \"unreasonable.\" The application of the Buy American Act has been waived in certain procurements under the Trade Agreements Act. The Buy American Act defines \"domestic\" products as either unmanufactured products mined or produced in the US, or manufactured products with over 50% of their components made in the US, or commercially available off-the-shelf items. The definition of \"manufacture\" is not clearly defined, leading to complexities in determining if a product is manufactured in the US. The Buy American Act defines \"domestic\" products as those with over 50% of their components made in the US. Judicial tribunals have considered factors like changes in physical character and separate manufacturing stages to determine if an item is manufactured in the US. The cost of components includes acquisition costs and any applicable duty for purchased components, and all costs for components manufactured by the contractor. Operations like packaging and testing after completion are not considered manufacturing. The Buy American Act requires that at least 50% of the costs of all components be mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States, or the end product is a COTS item. Domestic materials must be used in federal agencies' construction projects, prohibiting the acquisition of foreign construction materials by contractors. The Buy American Act requires that at least 50% of the costs of all components be mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States for construction materials. Domestic construction material includes items brought to the site preassembled and materials purchased directly by the government are treated as supplies. Exceptions to the Act are listed in the FAR. The FAR lists exceptions to the Buy American Act, allowing agencies to purchase foreign products under certain circumstances such as impracticability, unavailability of domestic goods, unreasonable cost, goods for commissary resale, or procurement of information technology. Some commentators also include procurements below the micro-purchase threshold. The Buy American Act has exceptions for procurements below the micro-purchase threshold and for use outside the United States. The act's applicability is limited by waivers under the Trade Agreements Act. The Trade Agreements Act (TAA) allows the President to waive laws like the Buy American Act for acquisitions from designated countries to comply with international trade agreements. The Trade Agreements Act (TAA) requires equal consideration for foreign offers in acquisitions exceeding certain monetary thresholds. It prohibits procurement from nondesignated countries in acquisitions covered by the WTO GPA to promote reciprocal competitive opportunities for U.S. products. The FAR mandates federal agencies to acquire only U.S.-made or designated country products/services, with exceptions, using a \"substantial transformation\" test to determine origin. The Trade Agreements Act (TAA) requires equal consideration for foreign offers in acquisitions exceeding certain monetary thresholds to promote reciprocal competitive opportunities for U.S. products. The WTO GPA mandates national treatment for covered products, services, and suppliers, and includes a most-favored-nation (MFN) treatment provision. The United States must treat a party's products, services, and suppliers no less favorably than those of any other party in free trade agreements. These agreements also include nondiscrimination obligations for government procurement, with monetary thresholds determining when the obligations apply. If a U.S. government procurement measure is deemed to violate the agreement, a dispute settlement proceeding could be initiated. The United States must comply with trade agreements by removing offending measures or facing compensation or trade retaliation. The USTR has waived the Buy American Act for eligible products from designated countries to align with the Trade Agreements Act. The FAR lists countries designated by the USTR, including parties to the WTO GPA and U.S. free trade agreements. The Trade Agreements Act (TAA) specifies that only products and services covered for procurement by specified U.S. agencies under certain trade agreements are eligible. Annexes to the WTO GPA and U.S. free trade agreements determine which products and services are covered for procurement by the United States. Products and services acquired by entities not listed in the relevant annexes to free trade agreements would not be eligible under the TAA. The Trade Agreements Act (TAA) specifies that only products and services covered for procurement by specified U.S. agencies under certain trade agreements are eligible. The USTR revises monetary thresholds every two years for supply contracts under the WTO GPA. The FAR lists thresholds for each trade agreement and provides instructions for calculating acquisition value. The TAA sets criteria for determining the origin of products in a country. The Trade Agreements Act (TAA) requires products to be wholly made in a designated country or substantially transformed into a new article with a distinct name, character, or use. The TAA aims to promote competitive government procurement opportunities for U.S. products by prohibiting procurement from nondesignated countries under the WTO GPA. The Trade Agreements Act (TAA) mandates that federal agencies must acquire only U.S.-made or designated country end products in acquisitions covered by the WTO GPA, unless offers for such products are not received or are insufficient. U.S.-made products are those mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States or substantially transformed there, while designated country end products are those grown, produced, or substantially transformed in a designated country. The Trade Agreements Act (TAA) requires federal agencies to procure products from countries that are part of the WTO GPA, U.S. free trade agreements, certain least developed countries, or certain Caribbean Basin countries. However, the TAA does not apply to certain acquisitions, such as those set aside for small businesses, acquisitions of arms or national security items, products for resale, acquisitions from specific entities like Federal Prison Industries, Inc., or acquisitions not using full and open competition. The Berry Amendment, established during World War II and made permanent law in 1993, safeguards U.S. national security interests by restricting the use of appropriated funds for purchasing covered items. This law, codified at 10 U.S.C. \u00a72533a in 2002, aims to protect the U.S. industrial base to meet defense requirements during emergencies. The Berry Amendment prohibits the use of funds to purchase covered items unless they are entirely made in the United States. It requires a higher level of domestic content than the Buy American Act. Covered items include food, clothing, tents, textiles, and tools. There are exceptions to this rule. Exceptions within the Berry Amendment allow the DOD to acquire items not entirely made in the US under certain conditions, such as when items of satisfactory quality cannot be acquired at US market prices, when the purchase value is below $150,000, in support of combat or contingency operations, in cases of urgent need, when vessels procure items in foreign waters, or for emergency procurements. Exceptions within the Berry Amendment allow the DOD to acquire items not entirely made in the US under certain conditions, such as emergency procurements for perishable foods, commissary resale items, food products processed in the US, waste for propellants, and chemical warfare protective clothing from foreign sources to comply with US agreements. If the Berry Amendment applies to an acquisition, the Buy American Act does not. The specialty metals restriction under the TAA prohibits DOD from purchasing certain items containing specialty metals not produced in the US. This restriction was moved from the Berry Amendment to a separate section of the US Code in 2006. The specialty metals restriction prohibits DOD from purchasing specialty metals not melted or produced in the US, with exceptions similar to the Berry Amendment. Unique exceptions allow DOD to buy specialty metals not produced in the US for specific purposes. Exceptions to the specialty metals restriction for DOD purchases include items necessary for national security interests, electronic components deemed critical by the Secretary of Defense, certain commercial off-the-shelf items, items with less than 2% noncompliant specialty metals, acquisitions to comply with agreements with foreign governments, and decisions made by the Secretary of Defense. Exceptions to the specialty metals restriction for DOD purchases include items necessary for national security interests, critical electronic components, certain commercial off-the-shelf items, items with less than 2% noncompliant specialty metals, acquisitions to comply with agreements with foreign governments, and items produced before October 17, 2006 that contain noncompliant specialty metals under specific conditions. The Buy American Act does not apply to funds administered by the Department of Transportation and certain federal agencies for grants to nonfederal entities. The Buy America requirements have not been waived under the TAA or U.S. trade agreements. The Buy America requirements under U.S. trade agreements exclude government assistance like grants. Domestic content restrictions apply to projects funded by DOT, with Section 313 of Title 23 requiring steel, iron, and manufactured products to be produced in the U.S. States using FHWA funds must adhere to Buy America requirements by using American steel. The FHWA funds can meet Buy America requirements by using U.S.-produced steel or iron, or by including contract provisions for domestic materials. Alternate bid provisions may be used, with the contract awarded to the bidder with the lowest bid on domestic materials unless it exceeds the lowest bid on foreign materials by more than 25%. Limited use of foreign steel and iron materials is allowed, not exceeding .1% of the total contract cost or $2,500. States can impose stricter Buy America requirements on projects funded with Title 23 funds. The FHWA may grant waivers to Buy America requirements for certain steel and iron materials used in projects funded with Title 23 funds if they are not produced in the United States in sufficient quantities. Waivers are prohibited for foreign products from countries that have violated agreements with the United States regarding Buy America requirements. Section 50101 of Title 49 of the U.S. Code prohibits the obligation of funds appropriated for projects carried out with Title 23 funds. Section 50101 of Title 49 of the U.S. Code prohibits the obligation of funds for FAA projects unless steel and manufactured goods are produced in the U.S. Waivers can be granted if using domestic materials increases project cost by more than 25% or if components produced in the U.S. make up more than 60% of the total cost. The FAA has issued nationwide waivers for certain products from specific manufacturers that often qualify under the 60% domestic content provision. These waivers allow products to be used in projects without needing separate project waivers. Section 50101 does not prohibit waivers for foreign products from countries violating trade agreements with the U.S. Funding under Chapter 53 of Title 49 may only be used for public transportation projects if steel, iron, and manufactured goods are produced in the U.S. This requirement applies to construction materials primarily made of steel or iron used in infrastructure. The Buy America requirements apply to construction materials primarily made of steel or iron used in infrastructure projects. To meet the \"produced in the United States\" requirement, all manufacturing processes must occur in the U.S. The FTA can waive these requirements if it is in the public interest and the materials needed are not produced domestically. Funding limitations cannot restrict states from imposing stricter Buy America requirements. The Buy America requirements can be waived if it is in the public interest and materials are not produced domestically in sufficient amounts or of satisfactory quality. Waivers can also be granted for rolling stock if certain cost thresholds for domestically produced components are met. Congress has increased the cost requirement thresholds for future fiscal years, with the requirement increasing to 70% for FY2020 and beyond. The FTA is prohibited from issuing waivers for foreign materials. The Buy America requirement increases to 70% for projects funded under the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008. Waivers for foreign goods are prohibited if the foreign country has violated a trade agreement with the United States. Goods must be produced in the U.S. for funds to be obligated under Chapter 244. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) may not impose funding limitations on states for Buy America requirements under PRIIA. Waivers can be granted if restrictions are against public interest or if domestic materials are not available. Waivers are prohibited for goods from countries with waived Buy America requirements that have violated agreements with the U.S. The Buy America requirements have been waived under certain agreements, but violations have occurred. Grant funding for water-related projects also has domestic content restrictions, requiring the use of U.S.-produced iron and steel products. The Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) and Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) provide low-interest financing for water quality projects, subject to these restrictions. EPA administers these funds at the federal level. The Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) and Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) provide financing for water projects with Buy America requirements, mandating the use of U.S.-produced iron and steel products. Manufacturing processes must occur in the U.S. for products to be considered domestically produced. EPA administers these funds at the federal level. The EPA mandates the use of U.S.-produced iron and steel products for water projects funded by the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) and Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF). Products must be primarily made of iron or steel, with domestic content restrictions waived under certain conditions. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 mandates the use of U.S.-produced iron and steel products for water projects funded by the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) and Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF). The restriction has been extended through appropriations legislation in FY2015 and FY2016. Table 1 summarizes key aspects of major domestic content regimes in federal law. The U.S. Code contains domestic content restrictions that apply to federal grants and funds, encouraging the procurement of domestic components. These provisions mandate that components mined, produced, or manufactured in the U.S. exceed 50% of the total cost, or the items are COTS items. The Buy America Act applies to federal agencies, while other entities are encouraged to prioritize domestic content without strict mandates. The U.S. Code includes provisions such as 3 U.S.C. \u00a7110 and 6 U.S.C. \u00a7453b, which require domestic manufacture for furniture in the Executive Residence and prohibit the Department of Homeland Security from procuring certain items unless they are made in the U.S. The U.S. Code mandates domestic manufacture for various products, including silk, synthetic fabric, wool, and canvas items.
