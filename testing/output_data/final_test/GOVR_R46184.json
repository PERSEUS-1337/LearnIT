    "content": "The ESA aims to conserve endangered species by listing them, with the Secretary reviewing species' statuses based on petitions. Any person can petition to list, reclassify, or delist a species, with specific requirements for the Secretary's response. The ESA allows for the listing of species as endangered or threatened based on specific criteria, with the Secretary determining the status of a species. The process involves reviewing the species' eligibility for listing and assessing whether it meets the criteria for being endangered or threatened under the Act. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows for the listing of species as endangered or threatened based on specific criteria determined by the Secretary. The determination is made solely based on the best scientific and commercial data available. The Secretary may list a species as endangered or threatened, deny listing if the species is ineligible, or defer listing due to limited resources. Listing determinations are published in the Federal Register and the Code of Federal Regulations. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) directs federal agencies to conserve listed species and their ecosystems through prohibitions on certain acts and consultation requirements. The Act provides mechanisms to protect endangered and threatened species, including Section 7 consultations and tools for recovery. The ESA provides tools for species recovery, including the development of recovery plans with specific management actions, criteria for delisting, and cost estimates. Congress amended the ESA in 1982 to allow for the reintroduction of experimental populations of listed species, which must be geographically separate from natural populations. The Secretary must review the status of listed species every five years. The Endangered Species Act requires a review of listed species every five years to determine if they still qualify as endangered or threatened. Once delisted, states resume control over management, with monitoring for at least five years. If significant risk is identified post-delisting, emergency protections can be reinstated for 240 days. The Secretary can then begin rulemaking to relist the species if necessary. The Endangered Species Act requires a review of listed species every five years to determine their status. If delisted, states take over management with monitoring for five years. Emergency protections can be reinstated if significant risk is identified post-delisting. The agency follows administrative law and statutory interpretation principles to list, reclassify, and delist species through the rulemaking process. The Administrative Procedure Act governs agency rulemaking by prescribing procedural requirements and providing an opportunity for judicial review. Agencies publish proposed and final rules to explain their actions and address significant comments. The agency follows administrative law and statutory interpretation principles in the rulemaking process. Changes in the final rule must be a \"logical outgrowth\" of the proposed rule. Judicial review can be sought by parties affected by an agency rule. The court evaluates the agency's interpretation under the Chevron doctrine when relying on a provision in a statute it administers. The court defers to agency interpretation of ambiguous statutory provisions if it is reasonable. If a rule is found to be arbitrary, capricious, or not in accordance with the law, the court may set it aside. This can happen if the agency's interpretation of a term is not permissible, or if the rule is illogically reasoned or unsupported by the administrative record. When a rule is overturned, it is typically vacated and remanded to the agency. The gray wolf has a long history under the ESA, with various legal frameworks regulating its listing and delisting. Tables provide a timeline of actions, while FWS analyzes threats and recovery pathways. Gray wolves are the largest Canidae family member. Gray wolves, the largest member of the Canidae family, are effective predators that historically ranged throughout North America, Europe, and Asia. They hunt large prey like moose, elk, and bison, but also eat smaller animals. European settlers led to widespread persecution of wolves due to conflicts with humans and livestock. The gray wolf population faced conflicts with humans and livestock, leading to widespread persecution by settlers. Federal agencies listed various gray wolf subspecies as endangered under different acts, with the ESA allowing for species to be identified as endangered or threatened in specific regions. The Mexican wolf and Texas wolf were listed as endangered in 1976. The gray wolf species was listed as endangered in the lower 48 states except Minnesota, where it was listed as threatened. Recovery plans were created for different wolf subspecies between 1978 and 1982. Gray wolves were reintroduced into central Idaho and the greater Yellowstone area in the 1990s as nonessential experimental populations to protect them from human-caused mortality, identified as the greatest threat to the species. Gray wolf populations in the western Great Lakes region, the northern Rocky Mountains, and the Southwest increased and expanded their ranges due to human-caused mortality being identified as the greatest threat to the species. The term DPS, distinct to the ESA, has been relevant to gray wolf listing and delisting rules. The Services issued a DPS policy in 1996 to interpret and apply the term, evaluating population discreteness and significance to determine if it qualifies as a listable species under the Act. In 2000, FWS proposed to designate four DPSs of gray wolves. The FWS proposed to delist the gray wolf in non-DPS states outside the current range, citing unlikelihood of repopulation and unnecessary recovery efforts. They also suggested reclassifying gray wolves in Western Great Lakes, Western, and Northeastern DPSs from endangered to threatened due to sufficient population viability. In 2003, FWS reclassified gray wolves in the Eastern DPS and Western DPS from endangered to threatened. They extended the DPSs to include 12 states and delisted the gray wolf in 14 states in the southeastern US, Oklahoma, and Texas. The 2003 final rule reclassifying gray wolves in the Eastern and Western DPS was vacated by district courts in Oregon and Vermont. The courts found that FWS misinterpreted the terms \"all\" and \"a significant portion\" in assessing the endangered status of DPSs. They also ruled that FWS violated the ESA and DPS Policy by designating DPSs based on geography rather than biology. The Oregon and Vermont district courts found that the FWS reclassification of gray wolves outside core recovery populations was arbitrary and violated the ESA. The courts determined that combining DPSs and extending their ranges was not based on biological criteria, leading to the vacating of the 2003 final rule. The FWS adjusted its approach by individually designating and delisting the Western Great Lakes DPS in 2007 and the Northern Rocky Mountain DPS in 2008. They assessed whether each DPS met the DPS Policy's criteria for discreteness and significance, determining that gray wolf populations were discrete by comparing dispersal data and finding suitable habitat. In the new final rules, FWS found the populations to be significant under the DPS Policy. The FWS determined that the gray wolf populations in the Western Great Lakes and Northern Rocky Mountain regions were significant under the DPS Policy due to their unique ecological settings and the potential gap in the gray wolf's range if these populations were lost. They also found that both populations had met the recovery criteria and had adequate wolf management plans in place. In the proposed rule for the Northern Rocky Mountain DPS, FWS found Wyoming's wolf management plan inadequate for species recovery. Wyoming made revisions in 2007 to meet FWS requirements, and in 2008, FWS approved the plan. However, courts later vacated these final rules. In the 2007 Western Great Lakes DPS final rule, a federal court found the ESA ambiguous regarding FWS's authority to delist a DPS from a listed full species. FWS argued for its authority based on the plain language of the ESA, but the court vacated the rule and remanded it for interpretation. In the 2008 Northern Rocky Mountain DPS final rule, a federal court in Montana granted a motion to enjoin the rule, finding issues with FWS's decision-making process. The court granted an injunction based on the plaintiffs' likelihood of success in the case. They argued that FWS was arbitrary and capricious in ignoring genetic exchange criteria for gray wolf recovery. The court also found fault with FWS's decision-making process. The court found FWS arbitrary and capricious in approving Wyoming's wolf management plan, leading to the vacating of the rule and remanding it. FWS did not delist the gray wolf in Wyoming due to an inadequate state management plan. The final Western Great Lakes DPS rule addressed concerns from a previous court ruling without issuing a new proposed rule. The court vacated the latest Western Great Lakes DPS rule for violating notice and comment requirements. FWS withdrew the rule after a settlement agreement. The Montana district court vacated the 2009 Northern Rocky Mountain DPS rule, stating that the ESA does not allow listing a partial DPS. The court rejected FWS's interpretation of listing a species for only a portion of its range and held that the ESA precluded listing a smaller classification than a DPS. In 2011, Congress directed FWS to reinstate the 2009 rule for the Northern Rocky Mountain DPS without Wyoming and delist the Western Great Lakes DPS. FWS also proposed recognizing the eastern timber wolf as a full species and delisting the gray wolf in certain areas. In 2011, FWS proposed delisting the gray wolf in 29 states where the eastern timber wolf or red wolf historically ranged. The scientific community did not agree on the eastern timber wolf's species status, so FWS continued to recognize it as a subspecies of the gray wolf. The 2011 Western Great Lakes DPS rule was vacated by a district court in 2014. In 2014, the court reviewed FWS's interpretation of its authority under the ESA to designate and delist a DPS from a listed full species. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held in 2017 that FWS could designate and delist DPSs but had failed to do so properly in the 2011 rule. The court found the 2011 Western Great Lakes DPS rule arbitrary and capricious due to FWS's failure to consider the impact of delisting on the species and the loss of the gray wolf's historical range. After vacating the delisting rule for gray wolves in Wyoming, the federal district court was reversed by the D.C. Circuit, which reinstated the rule. In 2013 and 2019, FWS proposed delisting gray wolves, except for the Mexican wolf subspecies listed as endangered in 2015. The 2013 proposed rule was published after delisting gray wolves in certain DPSs. The FWS evaluated the gray wolf's taxonomy and identified the eastern wolf as a full species and three gray wolf subspecies. No listable DPSs were found within these species and subspecies. The FWS evaluated gray wolf taxonomy, identifying the eastern wolf as a full species and three gray wolf subspecies. No listable DPSs were found. FWS proposed listing the Mexican wolf as endangered and delisting other gray wolf entities. In 2015, FWS finalized listing the Mexican wolf separately. Federal courts vacated a rule delisting Western Great Lakes DPS and Wyoming gray wolves. In 2019, FWS proposed delisting gray wolves, except the Mexican wolf, due to recovery criteria being met. The FWS has not finalized the 2019 proposal regarding the gray wolf's status. The gray wolf is listed as endangered in most of the lower 48 states, with exceptions for certain populations. Legal challenges have been faced by FWS when listing the gray wolf. The FWS has faced legal challenges when listing or delisting the gray wolf, providing insight into issues encountered with species listing. To identify a species as endangered or threatened, the Services must define what qualifies as a \"species\" under the Act. The Services consult experts to identify listable species and subspecies based on scientific data. A DPS is a statutory creation, not a biological concept. The DPS Policy outlines how to evaluate DPSs, which must be discrete, significant, and endangered or threatened. FWS has faced challenges with the gray wolf's taxonomy and regulating population segments. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) faces challenges in identifying listable entities like species and subspecies, especially with the gray wolf's taxonomy. There are disagreements over the classification of wolf species and subspecies, leading to revisions in FWS's analyses. These determinations impact how FWS assesses the status of the species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The entity identified for analysis determines the population, range, and threats considered by the Services. The lack of scientific consensus on gray wolf taxonomy has prompted FWS to update its analyses during rulemakings. The Services must base their decisions on the \"best scientific and commercial data.\" Taxonomists may disagree on how to classify species based on various criteria such as physical traits, behavior, genetics, and interbreeding capabilities. Methodological differences and datasets can also lead to disagreements on the taxonomic level to assign to a particular entity. For example, the eastern timber wolf has been classified as a full species, a subspecies of gray wolf, a hybrid of different wolf species, a wolf-coyote hybrid, or a distinct gray wolf population. Different methodological approaches can impact the number of entities within a species that taxonomists recognize as distinct. Taxonomists may disagree on how to classify species based on various criteria such as physical traits, behavior, genetics, and interbreeding capabilities. Methodological differences and datasets can lead to disagreements on the taxonomic level to assign to a particular entity. For example, the eastern timber wolf has been classified as a full species, a subspecies of gray wolf, a hybrid of different wolf species, a wolf-coyote hybrid, or a distinct gray wolf population. The Services must determine the classification for an entity based on the \"best scientific and commercial data available\" and may find no scientific consensus on its taxonomic status. This has led to instances where the eastern timber wolf was proposed as a full species but later reverted to its original classification as a subspecies of gray wolf. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) must base taxonomic classifications on the best available scientific data. In 2013, FWS recognized three gray wolf subspecies: coastal wolf, interior and mountain wolf, and Mexican wolf. The taxonomic status of the eastern timber wolf is still being evaluated as scientific research evolves. Changing classifications and scientific disagreements may impact a species' listing under the Endangered Species Act. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) must base taxonomic classifications on the best available scientific data. Changes and disagreements in taxonomic classifications can impact a species' listing under the Endangered Species Act. For example, the recognition of the eastern timber wolf as a separate species can affect the gray wolf's current and historical range determination by FWS. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) uses a species' current and historical range to determine its status under the Endangered Species Act. Changes in taxonomic classifications can impact a species' listing. FWS has faced legal challenges in designating and delisting gray wolf Distinct Population Segments (DPSs) based on the DPS Policy criteria of being discrete and significant to the species. The Fish and Wildlife Service uses criteria to determine the significance of a population for the Endangered Species Act. They evaluate if a population is biologically and ecologically significant based on various factors. The criteria are imposed to ensure the DPS designation authority is used sparingly. If a population meets the criteria, its status as endangered or threatened is evaluated. For the gray wolf, FWS evaluates discreteness by determining the distance between areas. The Fish and Wildlife Service determines the significance of gray wolf populations based on factors like distance between areas and distinct morphological traits. They use criteria to evaluate if a population is biologically and ecologically significant for the Endangered Species Act. The Fish and Wildlife Service evaluates gray wolf populations based on distinct morphological traits and geographic factors to determine their significance for the Endangered Species Act. Legal challenges have focused on the delineation of DPS boundaries rather than the criteria for discreteness and significance. The court ruled that the Fish and Wildlife Service must carefully delineate Distinct Population Segments (DPSs) for gray wolves, including only discrete, significant populations and their occupied ranges. Challenges have arisen when DPSs are designated from listed full species for delisting purposes. Plaintiffs argue that FWS can only designate a DPS to increase protections, while FWS contends it can delist a DPS from a listed species based on statutory authority and the flexibility of the DPS category. Courts have found ambiguity in the ESA regarding FWS's ability to designate and delist a DPS from a listed species. The D.C. Circuit ruled that FWS can designate and delist a DPS from a listed species, but must consider the impact on the species. The ESA allows the Secretary to release specimens of listed species into the wild as \"experimental populations\" that are geographically separate. Experimental populations can be essential or nonessential for species conservation, with limited protections. Federal agencies do not need to consult on actions affecting nonessential experimental populations, reducing regulatory burden on local communities. The ESA allows the release of listed species as experimental populations to reduce regulatory burden on local communities. FWS established experimental populations of gray wolves in Yellowstone and central Idaho, ensuring geographic separation from existing populations. Individual wolves in the experimental area are considered part of that population. The federal district court in Wyoming vacated FWS's rules on three grounds related to the use of populations rather than individuals to evaluate geographic separation for gray wolves in the experimental area. The court found that this approach potentially lessened protections for individual wolves venturing from protected populations, conflicted with FWS regulations, and effectively delisted naturally occurring wolves in the experimental population. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit disagreed with the federal district court's decision to vacate FWS's rules on evaluating geographic separation for gray wolves. The Tenth Circuit found FWS's interpretation of the term \"population\" as reasonable and consistent with the Endangered Species Act, emphasizing the conservation of groups of organisms rather than individual specimens. The Tenth Circuit disagreed with the district court's decision on evaluating geographic separation for gray wolves, finding FWS's approach reasonable. They emphasized conserving populations over individual specimens, allowing flexibility in managing experimental populations to aid species conservation. The Tenth Circuit reversed the district court's decision, allowing experimental populations in central Idaho and greater Yellowstone to remain. The Services can now consider areas occupied by populations to determine geographic separation. Endangered species status requires examination of extinction risk in range due to specific threats. FWS's threat analyses have not been a major focus in gray wolf litigation. FWS has faced challenges in interpreting \"significant portion of its range\" in gray wolf rulemakings. Following a court decision, FWS now considers it as an independent basis for listing a species. They defend their interpretation of \"range\" as current rather than historical but courts have rejected their definition of \"significant\" portions. Courts have recently rejected FWS's interpretation of what constitutes a \"significant portion of its range.\" FWS has not issued a revised policy on the meaning of \"significant\" in light of these decisions. In a 2003 rule, FWS used the gray wolf's current range to reclassify certain populations as threatened. However, a court found that FWS failed to justify why only certain areas were considered \"significant,\" leading to the rule being vacated and remanded. The court vacated the rule and remanded it to FWS for revisiting the interpretation of the terms \"range\" and \"significant\" in the 2007 Western Great Lakes DPS rule. FWS interpreted \"range\" to refer to the species' current range based on the ESA definition of endangered species. The D.C. Circuit upheld FWS's interpretation of range as reasonable, clarifying that the evaluation is based on the current range rather than historical range. The 2007 rule by FWS considers the species' current range for listing decisions, determining what constitutes a \"significant\" part of the range based on biological needs. Factors include habitat quality, historical and current use, breeding or migration uses, and genetic diversity maintenance. The rule was vacated by a federal district court in the District of Columbia, but not on the interpretation of \"significant.\" The Solicitor's Office affirmed FWS's interpretation of \"significant portion of its range\" and provided a more detailed explanation. FWS adjusted its explanation to include conservation biology principles, defining the phrase as an area important for species conservation. Loss of the area would negatively impact species conservation efforts. In 2014, the Services issued a joint policy on their interpretation of \"significant portion of its range\" under the ESA. The policy defined \"significant\" as a portion of a species' range crucial for its viability, leading to court invalidation due to the belief that no species could be listed based on this interpretation. The courts invalidated a policy defining \"significant portion of its range\" under the ESA, stating that no species could be listed as endangered or threatened based on this interpretation. In 2019, FWS proposed to delist gray wolf entities, acknowledging the invalidated policy and reviewing the gray wolf's range for any significant portions. The Services have yet to issue a revised policy on the matter. Plaintiffs challenged FWS's interpretation of \"significant portion of its range\" in listing species, leading to a court vacating a rule that allowed listing only in endangered or threatened areas. The court found this interpretation inconsistent with the ESA and its legislative history, emphasizing that the phrase was added to broaden listing criteria. The court vacated a rule that limited species listing to only endangered or threatened areas, finding it inconsistent with the ESA. The phrase \"significant portion of its range\" was added to broaden listing criteria, allowing species to be listed throughout their range. FWS now interprets this phrase as an independent basis for listing a species. To determine if a species is threatened, the Services must assess if it is in danger of extinction in the foreseeable future. The FWS interprets the phrase \"in danger of extinction in the foreseeable future\" to assess if a species is threatened. The term has evolved over time, with a specific definition applied to the gray wolf in 2007. Initially, FWS did not interpret the term in general or for the gray wolf specifically. They determined 30 years as the foreseeable future for the gray wolf, representing 10 generations to predict threats' effects on the species. However, in 2009, FWS changed its approach in rules for delisting wolf populations. The FWS interprets the phrase \"in danger of extinction in the foreseeable future\" to assess if a species is threatened. In 2009, FWS changed its approach in rules for delisting wolf populations, using different timeframes to determine the foreseeable future for each threat considered. The recent revisions to ESA regulations codify this interpretation. The Services interpret \"foreseeable future\" to extend only as far as they can reasonably determine future threats and species responses. They evaluate species for delisting based on the definition of \"endangered species\" or \"threatened species\" using scientific and commercial data. When delisting a species, the Services evaluate the species' recovery based on recovery criteria and state management plans. FWS may delist a species even if it doesn't meet all recovery criteria, but must provide an explanation if rejecting criteria. State management plans are important in delisting rules despite being considered \"inadequate regulatory mechanisms\" in the analysis. The Services focus on recovery criteria and state management plans when delisting a species under the ESA. Plaintiffs challenge how FWS uses recovery plan criteria for the gray wolf's delisting. Recovery plans must include measurable criteria for delisting, but FWS must determine if a species should be reclassified or removed from the list. The Services determine species reclassification based on Section 4 criteria without mentioning recovery plan criteria. Challenges have arisen regarding delisting species when not meeting all recovery criteria, such as the Northern Rocky Mountain DPS. The 1994 EIS set a recovery criterion for the northern Rocky Mountain wolf population. A court ruled that actual DNA exchange, not just potential, was required to meet this criterion. FWS addressed this in its 2009 rule by challenging the conclusion that genetic exchange had not occurred. The FWS challenged the conclusion that genetic exchange had not occurred, stating that recovery did not require confirmed genetic exchange and could be human-assisted. They argued that genetic exchange was not a concern due to preexisting genetic diversity. The agency also mentioned that recovery could be achieved without all criteria being fully met. Parties have challenged the recovery criteria in comments on proposed rules as either excessive or inadequate to determine whether the species had recovered. FWS generally has concluded that its recovery criteria are adequate, and, to date, courts generally have not addressed FWS's technical expertise in selecting the criteria. State plans for managing a species post-delisting can enter into the Services' delisting determinations in two ways: (1) the Services examine any state management plans under \"Factor D: The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms,\" and (2) the Services may. The Services may require state management plans approved for delisting species. Plans must be approved by FWS and implemented by the state to meet recovery criteria. Failure to complete these steps has delayed delisting of gray wolf populations. FWS delisting gray wolf populations requires states to craft adequate management plans for species recovery. Wyoming's plan was rejected in 2003, leading to a legal challenge. In 2009, FWS delisted the Northern Rocky Mountain DPS without Wyoming due to an inadequate plan. A Montana court ruled that Wyoming must have an approved plan for the entire DPS to be delisted. Wyoming must have an approved state management plan for the entire DPS to be delisted. Congress directed FWS to reinstate the delisting rule for the DPS except for Wyoming in 2011. FWS approved Wyoming's revised plan in 2008, leading to the delisting of the Northern Rocky Mountain DPS. However, a Montana district court found FWS's approval of Wyoming's plan to be arbitrary and capricious, issuing a preliminary injunction against the delisting rule. The court found FWS's approval of Wyoming's plan to be arbitrary and capricious, issuing a preliminary injunction against the delisting rule. FWS failed to adequately explain why the plan was now sufficient and the court vacated and remanded the rule at FWS's request. The state must implement the approved management plan to ensure the protections needed for delisting the species are in place. FWS proposed to designate the DPS but not delist it due to unmet recovery criteria without an approved Minnesota management plan. After Minnesota enacted its plan, FWS delisted the DPS. Wyoming's inadequate management plan led to a court injunction against delisting. States must have management plans for delisting, which do not need to be legally binding as long as adequate protections are assured. The federal court vacated FWS's 2012 rule delisting the gray wolf in Wyoming due to nonbinding promises from the state. However, the D.C. Circuit later reversed the decision, stating that regulatory mechanisms do not need to be legally binding for FWS to determine they are adequate. State management plans play a crucial role in finalizing delisting rules and surviving judicial review. The challenges faced by FWS in conserving the gray wolf under the ESA include disagreements over interpreting terms, uncertain scientific data, and conflicting views on conservation. These issues complicate efforts to delist species, frustrating stakeholders like state wildlife agencies and private entities in the species' habitat. The challenges faced by FWS in conserving the gray wolf under the ESA include disagreements over interpreting terms, uncertain scientific data, and conflicting views on conservation. Stakeholders such as conservation groups and animal rights activists may question the effectiveness of the Act in promoting species recovery. Congress could consider amending the Act to address these issues and ensure it aligns with congressional intent, including reinstating rules for the Northern Rocky Mountain DPS. Legislative proposals in the 116th Congress aim to tackle these issues. Legislative proposals in the 116th Congress aim to amend the Endangered Species Act regarding the gray wolf, either by amending the Act generally or directing FWS to issue new rules."
