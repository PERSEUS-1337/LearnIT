    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Community STEM Learning Act of 2015\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purpose section. The Congress finds a 17% growth in STEM fields over the next decade, with 92% of STEM occupations requiring post-secondary education. Despite an increase in STEM degrees awarded since the 1960s, the overall share of STEM degrees has decreased compared to all degrees. Internationally, a higher proportion of degrees are in STEM fields, with minorities being underrepresented. Minorities, particularly Blacks and Hispanics, are significantly underrepresented in the science and engineering workforce in the United States. Despite 21% of Black college students starting with STEM majors, only 16% graduate with a STEM degree. Over half of Black students at 4-year universities are interested in STEM but struggle with math proficiency. Math scores have improved since 1990, but White students still outperform Black and Hispanic students by 27 points. After school programs are crucial in addressing the achievement gap in underserved communities. The purpose of this Act is to address the achievement gap in underserved communities by preparing middle and secondary school students for STEM opportunities through after school, summer, and weekend programs. Studies show that STEM learning during the school day is important but not enough for lifelong STEM literacy. Minority children, especially Black and Hispanic students, are more likely to participate in after school programs, with 24% of Black students and 21% of Hispanic students enrolled compared to 15% of all students. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1964 is amended to include STEM grants, specifically focusing on Math and Science Partnerships and Informal STEM Learning Programs. This aims to address the achievement gap in underserved communities by providing opportunities for middle and secondary school students in STEM education outside of regular school hours. The Secretary is authorized to award grants for informal STEM learning programs to national and regional intermediaries. Applicants must submit a detailed proposal including the amount requested and how the funds will be used. Community-based affiliates must provide program descriptions for the informal STEM learning programs. The program description for informal STEM learning programs should include project-based learning, academic instruction, research model, and service-learning opportunities. It should also focus on serving underrepresented students and include plans for student recruitment, retention, and parental engagement. The Informal STEM learning program grants require a description of professional development, collaboration with higher education institutions, and enabling students to achieve program goals. The grants aim to increase awareness and exposure to STEM fields for underrepresented students, connect STEM learning to essential workforce skills, improve grade promotion and high school graduation rates, encourage enrollment in STEM coursework, and highlight post-graduation opportunities in STEM fields. The curr_chunk focuses on allocating funds for technical assistance, data collection, and subgrants to community-based affiliates to expand STEM programs for underrepresented students. The curr_chunk discusses the allocation of funds for subgrants to community-based affiliates seeking to develop new STEM programs for underrepresented students. Community-based affiliates must submit an application to their national or regional intermediary to receive a subgrant and use the funds to operate informal STEM programs. Community-based affiliates receiving a subgrant for an informal STEM program must focus on serving underrepresented students. The program should include educational services, project-based learning, individualized instruction, and student progress tracking aligned with in-school curriculum. Community-based affiliates receiving subgrants for informal STEM programs collaborate with higher education institutions to provide services aligned with in-school performance. Reports are required from the Secretary to Congress and from national or regional intermediaries to the Secretary on progress towards program goals. Community-based affiliates receiving subgrants for informal STEM programs must submit annual reports to their national or regional intermediary detailing progress towards program goals. The intermediary, in turn, must submit a report to the Secretary containing the same information. In this section, definitions for terms like community-based affiliate, informal STEM learning education, and national intermediary are provided. A community-based affiliate is defined as an organization affiliated with a national or regional intermediary. Informal STEM learning education refers to science education outside of traditional school settings. A national intermediary is a private nonprofit organization with a network of community-based affiliates in at least 50 regional communities. A regional intermediary is a private nonprofit organization with affiliates in at least 50 regional communities, demonstrating expertise in overseeing programs for middle and high school students to become college and career-ready, operating in at least 25 states for 20 years. Project-based learning involves students completing a project to achieve a concrete goal. The regional intermediary is a private nonprofit organization with affiliates in multiple communities, specializing in outreach and education for middle and high school students. Authorization of appropriations is set at $20 million for 2016, $30 million for 2017, $40 million for 2018, and $50 million for 2019."
