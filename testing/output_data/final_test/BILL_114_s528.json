Parents of students to be assessed using alternate assessments must be involved in the decision-making process. Parents must provide informed consent for their child's academic achievement to be measured against alternate standards as per the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. They should also be informed of any potential effects on their child's academic performance due to participation in such assessments.
