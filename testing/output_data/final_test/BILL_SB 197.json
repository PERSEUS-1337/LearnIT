    "title": "SB 197",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 22602 of the Financial Code allows a finance lender to compensate an unlicensed person for referring prospective borrowers, under certain conditions. The referral must result in a commercial loan with an APR not exceeding 36 percent, and the licensee must follow specific approval procedures before granting the loan. Before approving the loan, the licensee obtains documentation from the prospective borrower verifying their commercial status, such as a seller's permit, business license, articles of incorporation, income tax returns, or bank account statements showing business income. The licensee performs underwriting to ensure the borrower can repay the loan based on monthly revenue and expenses. Acceptable documentation includes tax returns, bank statements, and business plans. If the loan is secured by a personal guarantee, a credit report is required. When securing a loan with a personal guarantee, the owner of the corporation must provide a credit report from a consumer credit reporting agency. The licensee must keep records of compensation paid to unlicensed persons for borrower referrals for at least four years. They also need to submit annual information to the commissioner. Any misrepresentation to a borrower in connection with a commercial loan referral can make the licensee liable. Unlicensed persons are not authorized to participate in loan negotiations, advise borrowers, prepare loan documents, or contact the licensee for anything other than a referral. Unlicensed persons are prohibited from participating in loan negotiations, advising borrowers, preparing loan documents, or contacting the licensee for anything other than a referral. Exceptions apply for those exempt from licensure, federal income taxes, recognized by the Small Business Administration, or involved in limited commercial loan activities. The commissioner can impose conditions on referral activity and classify persons, loans, and methods. Referral fees for residential mortgage loans are restricted to licensed individuals. \"Referral\" is defined as introducing a borrower to a finance lender or providing the lender with the borrower's contact information. Section 22603 of the Financial Code requires finance lenders to provide a written statement to prospective borrowers referred by unlicensed persons when applying for a commercial loan. The statement must be in 10-point font or larger and the borrower must acknowledge receipt in writing. \"You have been referred to us by [Name of Unlicensed Person]. If approved for the loan, a fee may be paid to [Name of Unlicensed Person]. [Licensee] is the only authorized party to offer the loan. Understand the loan offer before agreeing to terms. To report a complaint, contact the Department of Business Oversight at 1-866-ASK-CORP (1-866-275-2677) or file online at www.dbo.ca.gov.\" Section 22604 of the Financial Code prohibits any person receiving compensation for a referral leading to a commercial loan from making false statements, engaging in deceptive advertising, violating business codes, committing fraud, or failing to protect borrower's personal information. Failure to protect a prospective borrower's personally identifiable information is prohibited under Section 22604 of the Financial Code. The commissioner may order individuals soliciting borrowers for loans to cease business if they are not compliant with relevant provisions. No reimbursement required by this act under California Constitution. Costs incurred by local agency or school district due to new crime, infraction, penalty changes, or crime definition changes."
