The bills also proposed regular reporting to Congress on progress in preventing seafood fraud and improving traceability. During the 113th Congress, bills aimed to combat seafood fraud by enhancing safety measures, increasing penalties, and improving agency cooperation. The bills proposed tracking information for imported seafood, but no action was taken. In the 112th Congress, a bill aimed to combat seafood fraud by directing federal agencies to coordinate efforts, but no further action was taken. During the 112th Congress, a bill aimed to combat seafood fraud by coordinating FDA and NMFS inspections, but no further action was taken. Concerns exist about FDA's resources to enforce laws on seafood fraud, with calls for additional funding and new authorities for traceability and compliance. In the 114th Congress, bills addressing food safety and seafood were introduced. Two food safety bills (H.R. 609 and S. 287) and two seafood bills (S. 190 and H.R. 3282) have been introduced in the 114th Congress. H.R. 609 and S. 287 focus on modifying the federal food safety system, while S. 190 aims to improve seafood safety standards in exporting countries and increase inspections of seafood imports. H.R. 3282 seeks to prevent seafood fraud by coordinating inspection activities and implementing new traceability requirements. No action has been taken on these bills yet. Seafood fraud-related issues in the 114th Congress include collaboration effectiveness of federal agencies, traceability improvement in the supply chain, deterrent penalties for fraud offenses, and sufficient resources for detection and enforcement. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 (FFDCA) addresses mislabeling and food safety, giving FDA authority over most food regulation and enforcement remedies when needed. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) prohibits introducing adulterated or misbranded food into commerce, and species substitution violates FDA's prohibition against adulteration. The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA) requires accurate information on packaged commodities. The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA) mandates accurate labeling of packaged commodities, including identifying the commodity, manufacturer, and net quantity. FPLA aims to provide consumers with precise information for value comparisons and prohibits the distribution of non-compliant packages. Violations of FPLA regulations render food products misbranded under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). FDA has established regulations for common or usual names of food products. The FDA has regulations for common or usual names of food, ensuring accurate identification and description of food products. Names must be distinct, uniform, and not confusingly similar to other foods. Common or usual names can be established through common usage or regulation. For example, FDA established Pacific whiting as the common name for the fish Merluccius productus. The FDA is responsible for ensuring the safety and proper labeling of food sold in interstate commerce, including seafood. They have a regulatory program for fish products that involves research, inspection, compliance, enforcement, and regulation development. The processor or importer is responsible for the safety and integrity of the food product, complying with FDA regulations under FFDCA and FPLA. FDA has the authority to take administrative and judicial enforcement actions, such as inspections, warning letters, recalls, and detention of imported food. The FDA has the authority to detain imported food to determine if it is misbranded or adulterated. Legal actions may involve seizures, injunctions, criminal prosecutions, and civil penalties. Customs and Border Protection enforces labeling requirements at ports of entry. The Tariff Act mandates marking imported articles with the country of origin for the ultimate purchaser. The Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is responsible for assessing and collecting final customs duties on imports, including seafood. They review import documentation to detect transshipping practices to avoid duties. Transshipping seafood is illegal if it circumvents trade laws. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) operates a voluntary seafood inspection program to ensure product quality and compliance with regulations. The NOAA operates a seafood inspection program to ensure product quality and compliance with regulations, including services for sanitation inspection, product grading, laboratory analysis, and export certification. NOAA, FDA, and CBP enforce provisions of the Lacey Act, which prohibits falsely labeling fish in interstate or foreign commerce. The NOAA's Office of Law Enforcement investigates seafood fraud cases involving mislabeling fish sold in interstate or foreign commerce. The 2002 farm bill made country-of-origin labeling mandatory for seafood products, enforced by the Agriculture Marketing Service of the USDA. COOL rules require retailers to disclose the origin of wild and farm-raised fish, excluding processed seafood imports. The 2008 farm bill designated catfish as an amenable species, moving inspection responsibility to USDA. Catfish and catfish products are subject to continuous inspection by USDA's FSIS. The bill also required the Secretary to define the species of catfish to be inspected, either narrowly or broadly. The 2014 farm bill defined catfish as all fish in the order Siluriformes and required USDA to finalize regulations for food safety inspections within 60 days. However, as of August 15, 2015, the catfish rule had not been published in the Federal Register. The bill also mandated USDA and FDA to improve interagency cooperation on food safety and fraud. The 2014 farm bill mandated USDA and FDA to improve interagency cooperation on food safety and fraud prevention, leading to the finalization of an MOU in April 2014. States also regulate seafood labeling under their versions of FFDCA, with examples from Alaska and California. Federal and state agencies work together to enforce seafood safety and fraud standards, such as through the National Shellfish Sanitation Program (NSSP). The National Shellfish Sanitation Program (NSSP) ensures shellfish are safe for consumption by controlling shellfish production and sales. Foreign governments also participate in NSSP through agreements with FDA. NSSP guidelines include state growing area classification and dealer certification programs to prevent harvesting from polluted waters. Identifying mislabeled species in fillet form can be challenging due to subtle taste and texture differences, making it easy to substitute lower-value species for higher-value ones. Seafood fraud varies by species, product form, and region. Independent reports show significant levels of fraud, with examples like mislabeling in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health found high rates of misbranding in seafood products. Instances of mislabeling include falsely labeled farmed salmon as wild Alaska salmon and frozen seafood sold as fresh. The FDA found that 15% of seafood samples were incorrectly labeled, leading to confusion over fresh and organic seafood marketing. Fraud can occur at various levels in the supply chain, making it difficult to pinpoint responsibility, especially in cases of intentional mislabeling for financial gain. The mislabeling of seafood is more common when cheaper species are sold as more expensive ones. A study found that 77% of fish sold as red snapper in the U.S. were actually different species. The FDA has issued an import alert on species substitution to address the problem, which can originate from foreign suppliers. One case involved a seafood wholesaler in Alabama selling Asian catfish and Lake Victoria perch as groupers, and farm-raised shrimp as wild-caught shrimp. The mislabeling of seafood is a common issue, with cheaper species often being sold as more expensive ones. In one case, a California seafood corporation was fined $1 million for selling Asian catfish as grouper. Species substitution can be intentional or unintentional due to mistaken identities. The FDA has regulations in place to address misbranded food, such as Section 403 of FFDCA and Title 21, Section 102.5 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The FDA regulations, specifically Title 21, Section 102.5 of the Code of Federal Regulations, establish guidelines for common or usual names for non-standardized food, including seafood products. The acceptable market name is recognized as the appropriate label for seafood in interstate commerce, representing the identity to consumers. The use of vernacular names is discouraged due to regional variations and potential confusion. Common or usual names are prevalent and meaningful identifiers for consumers. In cases where common names are not misleading, they are generally regarded as appropriate seafood names. The FDA and NOAA developed the Seafood List in 1988 as a guide for acceptable market and common names for seafood species. The list, updated in 1993 to include invertebrate species, serves as a reference to reduce consumer confusion and provide guidance to processors and retailers. It includes 1,827 seafood species with details such as type, acceptable market name, common name, and scientific name. The Seafood List is not legally enforceable but is updated every six months. The Seafood List, developed by the FDA and NOAA in 1988, includes 1,827 seafood species with market names, common names, and scientific names. Market names may be more general than common names, with some species having the same market name. Compliance policy guides are issued for certain species to ensure accurate labeling. For example, less desirable fish like West Coast rockfishes have been labeled as red snapper, with a specific CPG identifying red snapper as Lutjanus campechanus. The FDA and NOAA developed the Seafood List in 1988, which includes market names, common names, and scientific names for 1,827 seafood species. Compliance policy guides are issued to ensure accurate labeling, such as identifying red snapper as Lutjanus campechanus. Regulations may be necessary to address inconsistencies in guidelines or resolve differences in food identification. California passed a bill in 2014 to combat seafood fraud by requiring labeling of fish and shellfish with their common names and whether they are wild-caught or farm-raised, but faced opposition from the seafood industry. Governor Jerry Brown vetoed a bill aimed at species-specific labeling of seafood due to concerns about complexities and uncertainties. Seafood businesses may engage in mislabeling practices like short-weighting to increase profits. FDA standards require breaded shrimp products to contain at least 50% shrimp. The FDA warns against over-glazing frozen seafood to increase apparent weight and value. Short-weighting of seafood products is a concern in the industry. The seafood industry uses sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) to retain moisture in products and prevent freezer burn. However, misuse of STPP can lead to excess water retention in seafood products, misrepresenting their weight and value. Proper labeling of seafood treated with water-retaining chemicals is necessary, as FDA no longer requires moisture-percentage requirements but only additives to be listed on labels. The seafood industry uses additives like sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) to retain moisture in products. Proper labeling of seafood treated with water-retaining chemicals is necessary, as FDA no longer requires moisture-percentage requirements but only additives to be listed on labels. Some critics suggest prohibiting the use of water-retention chemicals in fish and shellfish. Fish fillets can be treated with carbon monoxide (CO) to give them a fresher appearance, but this practice has raised concerns among consumer advocates. FDA has not questioned the industry's determination that CO is generally recognized as safe. Consumer advocates have urged FDA to evaluate the impact of carbon monoxide (CO) treatment on seafood safety, as it may mask signs of decomposition in tuna. FDA considers CO-treated tuna to be misbranded if not labeled properly. Some aquaculture operations use color additives in feed to enhance the appearance of fish flesh. Some farmed fish may have paler flesh due to additives in their feed. Transshipment is legal unless used to avoid duties, as seen with shrimp from China being routed through other countries. Mislabeling seafood to avoid duties is considered fraud. Some businesses commit fraud by mislabeling seafood to avoid duties, falsely claiming it is domestic when it is actually imported. Questions arise about the true country of origin for seafood products, leading to increased interest in tracing seafood throughout the supply chain. International seafood trade has grown in recent decades, making it more challenging to determine the true origin of seafood products. The Bioterrorism Act of 2002 requires seafood industry to trace products from source to consumer to prevent adulterated food threats. Seafood traceability helps identify and withdraw harmful products, as well as combat fraud in the supply chain. Seafood traceability is crucial for identifying fraud and ensuring product quality. Consumers are increasingly interested in knowing where and how their seafood was caught. Certified sustainable fisheries provide this information to consumers. Some in the fishing industry believe that tracing products from \"capture to plate\" can boost profits by tagging fish at capture with details like date, species, weight, and location. Seafood traceability involves tracking details like date, species, weight, and location of capture to improve efficiency and reduce waste in the supply chain. It can also enhance customer service by quickly addressing issues. The need for universal standards and information sharing across businesses remains a question. While more information could combat seafood fraud and boost efficiency, the costs of implementing and maintaining traceability systems need to be considered. Economic losses from seafood fraud are currently unknown. The economic losses associated with seafood fraud are substantial, with potential annual losses to consumers reaching $1.6 billion if only 2% of seafood is short-weighted. Consumers may incur direct losses when products are short-weighted or contain excess filler. Losses can also occur when purchasing lower-valued substitutes for higher-valued products. Consumers may experience losses when buying lower-valued substitutes for higher-valued products, leading to decreased utility. Fraud and deception in seafood sales may deter consumers from purchasing seafood, impacting consumer tastes and preferences. Media attention to seafood fraud has raised public awareness, potentially decreasing demand for seafood products. Respondents familiar with reports of restaurants substituting lower-valued species for grouper were less likely to purchase grouper, impacting both restaurant and home consumption. Participants were willing to pay more for grouper entrees with an integrity label. The seafood industry faces losses due to decreased consumer perception and demand, leading to lower prices and revenue losses for law-abiding businesses competing with fraudulent sellers. In 1986, the Southeastern Fisheries Association introduced a Seafood Product Quality Code program to combat fraudulent products and inform buyers about recommended quality measures for specific seafood products. The code listed characteristics like production method, quality attributes, and packaging to increase awareness and improve communication between buyers and sellers. In October 2006, the National Fisheries Institute (NFI) launched the Better Seafood Bureau to address concerns of seafood fraud. The initiative focused on transshipment, mislabeling, and fraudulent weights in the seafood industry. NFI obtained commitments from CEOs to comply with economic integrity principles and report fraudulent suppliers. Despite sending letters to the FDA documenting fraudulent weights, NFI has not advocated for new seafood fraud laws. NFI has not advocated for new seafood fraud laws but believes FDA should enforce existing laws. NFI's members actively combat fraudulent activities and collaborated with the National Restaurant Association in 2013. President Obama issued a memorandum in 2014 to combat illegal fishing and seafood fraud. The memorandum established a task force to combat IUU fishing and seafood fraud, releasing 15 recommendations including international cooperation, enforcement tools, partnerships, and traceability programs. A risk-based traceability program is being implemented to track seafood from harvest to entry into U.S. commerce to prevent illegal products from entering the supply chain. The National Ocean Council has established an IUU Fishing and Seafood Fraud Committee to coordinate the task force's recommendations. IUU fishing is a global issue, with a significant amount of seafood entering the U.S. obtained from illegal fishing activities. There is a debate on whether IUU fishing and seafood fraud should be addressed together, as seafood fraud can occur regardless of the legality of the harvest. Some suggest addressing IUU fishing at the source before the product enters the market. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report in February 2009 on seafood fraud, highlighting the lack of collaboration among federal agencies in addressing the issue. The report emphasized the need for better coordination and information sharing to detect and prevent seafood fraud effectively. The lack of collaboration among federal agencies like Customs and Border Protection, National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA), and FDA has led to overlapping actions and inefficient resource use. FDA initially considered seafood fraud a low priority and allocated minimal resources to it. However, since the 2009 GAO report, FDA has dedicated resources to improve DNA testing for seafood fraud and collect data on its occurrence. The FDA has taken steps to address seafood fraud, including launching an online training module. Questions have been raised about whether seafood safety regulations should include measures to combat fraud. FDA's Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulations require processors to analyze safety hazards and control points, but do not currently address economic fraud. The FDA adopted HACCP regulations for seafood safety, focusing on food safety before addressing other matters. GAO recommended changes to include economic fraud risk mitigation. An MOU between NOAA and FDA in 2009 aimed to improve cooperation and information sharing in seafood inspection, without creating binding obligations."
