    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Internet Freedom and Broadband Deployment Act of 1999\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings section. Congress finds that Internet access services are inherently interstate and international, not subject to state regulation. Regulations by the FCC and states have hindered the rapid delivery of high-speed Internet, reducing consumer choice. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 aimed to balance competition in local and interLATA voice telecommunications services. Congress prohibited Bell operating companies from providing interLATA services, recognizing the unique characteristics of certain telecommunications services. Certain high-speed data services and Internet access services are exempt from the prohibition on Bell operating companies providing interLATA services. The FCC's interpretation of this prohibition has hindered the development of advanced telecommunications services, limiting consumer choice. Internet users should have the option to choose among competing Internet service providers. Internet service providers should have the right to interconnect with high-speed data networks to provide service to users. The Act aims to incentivize the rapid delivery of advanced telecommunications services by deregulating high-speed data and Internet access services, clarifying Bell operating companies' provision of such services, ensuring consumer choice among competing providers, and facilitating interconnection with competitive networks for Internet access.

The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to define \"high speed data service\" as a capability to transmit information at a rate of at least 384 kilobits per second. The term \"Internet\" collectively refers to computer and telecommunications facilities. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to define \"high speed data service\" as a capability to transmit information at a rate of at least 384 kilobits per second. The term \"Internet\" collectively refers to the interconnected world-wide network of networks that employ the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol to communicate information by wire or radio. Internet access service is defined as a service that enables users to access Internet content and services. Section 230(f) of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended by redesignating paragraphs and Section 223(h)(2) is also amended accordingly. SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON AUTHORITY TO REGULATE HIGH SPEED DATA SERVICES. An amendment is made to Part I of title II of the Communications Act of 1934 to add a new section regarding the provision of high-speed data services. The Act limits the authority of the Commission and States to regulate rates, terms, and conditions for high-speed data and Internet access services. It does not affect State regulation of voice telephone services or cable franchise requirements. The Commission can still enforce exemptions and universal service rules. The Act limits regulatory authority over high-speed data services, exempting certain network elements from unbundled access requirements for incumbent local exchange carriers. The Act limits regulatory authority over high-speed data services, exempting certain network elements from unbundled access requirements for incumbent local exchange carriers. The Commission has the authority to modify regulations to reduce the number of network elements subject to the unbundling requirement. SEC. 233. INTERNET CONSUMERS FREEDOM OF CHOICE. This section amends Part I of title II of the Communications Act of 1934 to address internet consumers' freedom of choice. The purpose of this section is to ensure internet users have freedom of choice of Internet service provider. Incumbent local exchange carriers must provide Internet users with access to any Internet service provider that interconnects with their high-speed data service, allow providers to acquire necessary facilities for interconnection, and enable collocation of equipment to achieve these objectives. The section defines \"Internet service provider\" as any provider of Internet access service and \"incumbent local exchange carrier\" as having the same meaning as provided in section 251(h). SEC. 6. INCIDENTAL INTERLATA PROVISION OF HIGH SPEED DATA AND INTERNET ACCESS SERVICES. Section 271 of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to allow Bell operating companies to offer high-speed data service or Internet access service. Additionally, a prohibition on marketing voice telephone services is introduced until Bell operating companies are authorized to offer interLATA services. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to allow Bell operating companies to offer high-speed data or Internet access service. Amendments also include restrictions on billing for interLATA voice telecommunications services obtained through these services. Conforming amendments are made to sections 272(a)(2)(B)(i) and 272(a)(2)(C) of the Act."
