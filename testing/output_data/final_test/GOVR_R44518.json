    "content": "The House passed a bill to extend TANF funding and establish a demonstration project for social impact partnership projects, but it was not considered in the Senate. Additional bills altering TANF policies were reported by the House Ways and Means Committee, but none were enacted. The TANF block grant funds grants to states, tribes, and territories for providing benefits, services, and activities to address childhood economic and social disadvantage. Created in the 1996 welfare reform law, TANF has been extended multiple times since FY2002. Bills altering TANF policies were reported by the House Ways and Means Committee but were not enacted. TANF has been extended on an annual basis since the long-term extension expired in FY2010. Policy changes to TANF have been minimal, with most policies dating back to the 1996 welfare law. In July 2015, the House Ways and Means Committee proposed a five-year reauthorization with significant policy changes, including work standards adjustments. The President's FY2017 budget also suggested changes, such as increased block grant funding. H.R. 5170, the Social Impact Partnerships to Pay for Results Act, introduced by Representative Todd Young and Representative John Delaney, aimed to establish social impact partnerships or bonds. The bill was ordered reported by the House Ways and Means Committee in May 2016. The version passed by the House included a provision requiring at least 50% of funds for social impact projects to benefit children. The House passed H.R. 5170, the Social Impact Partnerships to Pay for Results Act, which included provisions for a one-year extension of TANF funding and revisions to TANF's research provisions. The bill aimed to establish social impact partnerships or bonds, with a focus on initiatives benefiting children. The Obama Administration supported similar efforts, characterizing social impact partnerships as a new form of grant-making. The House passed H.R. 5170, the Social Impact Partnerships to Pay for Results Act, which aimed to establish social impact partnerships for funding social programs. The bill included provisions for a one-year extension of TANF funding and revisions to TANF's research provisions. It allowed state and local governments to apply for \"social impact demonstration projects\" to improve the lives of families and individuals in need. The legislation for the Social Impact Partnerships to Pay for Results Act outlined a model involving the federal government, state or local government, service providers, investors, and potentially an intermediary. Payments would be made based on meeting specified outcomes, evaluated independently. H.R. 5170 directed the Secretary to reserve $100 million for the Contingency Fund for State Welfare Programs for FY2017. The Social Impact Partnerships to Pay for Results Act allocated $100 million for the Contingency Fund for State Welfare Programs for FY2017. The Secretary would publish a notice seeking proposals for social impact partnership projects, with state or local governments required to submit applications describing their proposals. Projects must produce measurable outcomes that benefit society and save federal funds in various categories. The application for the social impact partnership project required detailed plans for intervention delivery, outcome goals, evidence of expected outcomes, cost projections, experience in raising funds, service provider experience, intermediary information, evaluation design, metrics, and terms. The application for funding for a social impact partnership project would have required detailed plans for intervention delivery, outcome goals, cost projections, and consultation with relevant agencies before a determination is made. The project application for a social impact partnership project would have required consideration of various factors before entering into an agreement, including recommendations from the Commission on Social Impact Partnerships, expected outcomes, likelihood of achieving outcomes, projected savings, and evaluation quality. The Secretary could enter into an agreement if certain requirements were met. The Secretary would have been required to consult with the Council and federal agency heads to determine funding for feasibility studies for social impact partnership projects. The decision would be based on recommendations from the Commission on Social Impact Partnerships and the likelihood of achieving desired outcomes. The feasibility study for social impact partnership projects would determine project outcomes, potential savings, and federal funding availability. Federal funds could cover up to 50% of the study cost, with the option to apply for project funding afterwards. State or local governments would need to agree to achieve specified outcomes within a 10-year project duration. The Secretary could transfer authority to another federal agency for project administration, and payments would be made based on independent evaluator assessments. The bill passed by the House required that 50% of funds for social impact partnership projects benefit children. State or local governments could receive payments based on project outcomes evaluated using experimental designs. Progress reports were due every two years after project approval. Various potential issues of design and implementation may be associated with provisions in H.R. 5170 for social impact partnership projects. These issues include federal-state relations in grant administration, comparison of costs and benefits, and the capacity of governments and grant recipients to engage in complex contracting and evaluation. The curr_chunk discusses the advocacy for using experimental design, random assignment, or randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for impact evaluation. It also mentions the debate around the narrow focus on RCTs for evidence-based policy. Additionally, it touches on TANF funding provided through P.L. 114-113. H.R. 5170 would have provided FY2017 funds for the TANF basic block grant, mandatory child care block grants, grants to Indian tribes for work programs, and healthy marriage and responsibility grants. FY2017 funding for TANF grants and mandatory child care block grants would have been at the same level as FY2016, with a 0.33% reduction in TANF basic block grants for research purposes. The House-passed bill, H.R. 5170, would have reduced spending required by states under the TANF maintenance of effort requirement. It did not provide additional funding for the TANF contingency fund, leading to reduced grants to states in FY2017. The bill also allocated $100 million from the contingency fund for the social impact partnership demonstration. HHS is mandated to conduct research on various aspects of state programs under the TANF block grant, including welfare dependency and child well-being. The 1996 welfare law provided funding for the Census Bureau to follow families from the mid-1990s sample in the Survey of Income and Program Participation. HHS allocated $15 million per year for welfare-related research, including evaluations of pre-welfare reform programs and experiments on Employment Retention and Advancement. Funding also supports multi-site experiments on Career Pathways programs for low-income individuals and other employment-related research. The House-passed bill would have continued funding for Census Bureau research on welfare-related programs, requiring research on the effects of TANF programs, healthy marriage grants, and responsible fatherhood grants. States would be eligible for funds to evaluate their TANF programs, with research using experimental designs when feasible. The House-passed bill would have required HHS and states to use experimental designs for research on welfare programs. A database named \"What Works Clearinghouse of Proven and Promising Projects to Move Welfare Recipients into Work\" would have been developed. It would categorize projects as proven, promising, ineffective, or developmental based on rigorous evaluation. The House-passed bill would have required the Census Bureau, HHS, and BLS to enhance household surveys to assess the effects of welfare reform on low-income families' economic and child well-being. This research would aim to address underreporting of benefits, understand poverty dimensions, effects of benefits on earnings, and improve poverty measurement methods. The House Ways and Means Committee proposed funding welfare-related research activities through a set-aside from the TANF block grant, totaling $54.7 million. Additional bills were introduced to make changes to TANF, including a subsidized employment project, revised spending rules, reducing child poverty as a goal, and new employment outcome measures. These bills were not passed by the full House. H.R. 2990, the Accelerating Individuals into the Workforce Act, proposed a subsidized employment demonstration program. States have the authority to operate subsidized employment programs under current TANF law. Subsidized employment has been a small part of TANF, except during a brief period with extra funding in response to the 2007-2009 recession. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 created an Emergency Contingency Fund within TANF that provided additional funding for subsidized employment. TANF expenditures for employment subsidies peaked at $1.050 billion in FY2010 with ECF funding but receded after its expiration. In FY2015, TANF expenditures on wage subsidies totaled $186 million. In FY2015, an average of 12,960 TANF recipients participated in subsidized employment, representing 1.1% of work-eligible individuals. HHS is evaluating subsidized employment programs, with past initiatives showing positive impacts on employment rates and earnings. The House Ways and Means Committee proposed a one-year subsidized employment demonstration program for TANF recipients in Philadelphia. The program aimed to provide wage subsidies to help low-income individuals secure and maintain employment, with federal funds covering up to 50% of a participant's wage for a maximum of 12 months. The proposed subsidized employment program aimed to assist low-income individuals in securing and maintaining employment by providing wage subsidies of up to 50% for a maximum of 12 months. Participants had to meet specific criteria, including being unemployed, having income below 200% of the federal poverty guidelines, and being recipients of certain types of assistance. The program would have prohibited displacing regular employees with subsidized job participants and required an evaluation using experimental design or other reliable research methodologies. HHS would report recommendations to Congress on increasing employment. HHS would report recommendations to Congress on increasing employment, retention, and advancement of individuals receiving TANF assistance. $100 million from the FY2017 contingency fund would fund a demonstration, with $15 million reserved for career pathways training programs. H.R. 2959, the TANF Accountability and Integrity Improvement Act, was introduced by Representative Noem. The TANF block grant, created in 1996, includes a \"maintenance of effort\" (MOE) requirement for states to spend a minimum amount from their own funds based on historical state expenditures in predecessor programs. If states fail to meet work participation standards, the spending requirement increases. The TANF block grant includes a \"maintenance of effort\" (MOE) requirement for states to spend a minimum amount based on historical state expenditures. HHS interprets the MOE as a cost-sharing requirement, allowing states to count cash donations and in-kind contributions. States have incentives to spend above the minimum, as it reduces work participation standards and results in a reduced TANF block grant for noncompliance. The TANF block grant includes a \"maintenance of effort\" (MOE) requirement for states to spend a minimum amount based on historical state expenditures. States must spend more than the minimum under the MOE to access extra federal funding from the TANF contingency fund. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that some states counted third-party contributions as state expenditures towards the requirement. Federal law prohibits states from using federal TANF funds for medical services, but states can count medical services towards their TANF MOE requirement if they meet certain criteria. H.R. 2959 would freeze third-party contributions towards the MOE requirement starting in FY2017 and exclude any excess contributions from counting towards the MOE. It would also prohibit states from counting medical expenses towards their MOE. H.R. 2966 aims to reduce child poverty by adding it as a statutory goal of TANF. The grant aims to increase state flexibility in achieving four statutory goals of TANF, including assisting needy families, promoting job readiness, preventing out-of-wedlock pregnancies, and encouraging two-parent households. States can use federal TANF funds for activities that align with these goals. H.R. 2966 proposed adding child poverty reduction as a statutory goal of TANF. H.R. 2966 proposed adding child poverty reduction as a statutory goal of TANF through employment, retention, and advancement. H.R. 2952 aimed to establish a new system for measuring employment outcomes for TANF recipients. States have flexibility in designing cash assistance programs for needy families with children under TANF. States are accountable for meeting TANF's statutory goals related to moving families from welfare-to-work through performance measures like the Work Participation Rate (WPR) and employment outcome measures. The WPR determines compliance with federal work standards by calculating the percentage of families engaged in work. States failing to meet the numerical goal face financial penalties. Before 2006, TANF rewarded states with high performance towards achieving statutory goals. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 eliminated the performance bonus for state welfare-to-work outcomes, but HHS still ranks states based on employment measures. A committee bill proposed new indicators for measuring state performance levels starting in FY2018, including the employment percentage. The retention percentage, advancement measure, and employment outcome performance measures are key indicators used to evaluate state welfare-to-work programs. The committee bill proposed using employment outcome performance measures similar to those in the Workforce Investment and Opportunity Act for evaluating state welfare-to-work programs. Performance goals would be set for SNAP employment and training programs, with states required to establish performance levels for FY2019 and FY2020 based on FY2018 data. Comparisons with other states' performance levels would also be considered. The committee bill proposed using employment outcome performance measures similar to those in the Workforce Investment and Opportunity Act for evaluating state welfare-to-work programs. Performance goals would be set for SNAP employment and training programs, with states required to establish performance levels for FY2019 and FY2020 based on FY2018 data. Comparisons with other states' performance levels would also be considered. Additionally, the bill required the Secretary to develop a template for states to report on program operations and publish annual reports after September 2020. H.R. 5170 and H.R. 2990 proposed demonstration projects funded at $100 million each from the FY2017 TANF contingency fund. P.L. 114-113 allocated appropriations to the fund for FY2016 and FY2017, with the FY2017 amount at $608 million. H.R. 5170 and H.R. 2990 would have reduced FY2017 grants to states by $100 million each from the contingency fund, originally created in the 1996 welfare reform law with an initial funding of $2 billion for economic downturns. The TANF contingency fund was initially funded at $2 billion for economic downturns. Congress has provided annual appropriations for the fund since FY2010. States must meet criteria of economic need to access the fund, including high unemployment rates and increased SNAP caseloads. Additionally, states must spend more from their own funds on TANF-related programs than in FY1994 to access the fund. In FY2016, 19 states qualified as economically needy for the TANF contingency fund, spending sufficient state funds and drawing down grants. The fund is expected to be depleted annually for the next 10 years, regardless of economic growth forecasts, and will not serve a countercyclical function. However, it does provide extra grants to qualifying states. The TANF contingency fund provides extra grants to economically needy states, expected to be depleted annually for the next 10 years."
