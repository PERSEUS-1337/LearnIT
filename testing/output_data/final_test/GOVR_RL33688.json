    "content": "The U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Rasul v. Bush clarified that federal courts have jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus petitions from Guantanamo Bay detainees. Congress later passed the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, limiting federal court jurisdiction over these claims. The Supreme Court overturned a decision upholding military commissions in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, stating that commissions must follow rules similar to courts-martial. Congress then passed the Military Commissions Act of 2006 to establish procedural rules for military commissions. One detainee was convicted of material support to terrorism, while trials for other defendants were halted due to lack of jurisdiction. The military judges dismissed charges due to lack of jurisdiction, but the Court of Military Commissions Review reversed the dismissal in one case. The government's argument that a Combatant Status Review Tribunal's determination was sufficient for jurisdiction was rejected. Military commissions are courts set up by military commanders to try certain offenses during war. Military commissions are courts established by military commanders to try specific offenses during war, applying international law without relying on domestic criminal statutes. The use of military tribunals to try offenders designated by statute or the law of war has been a subject of debate, especially regarding the President's Military Order to try suspected terrorists. Critics have raised concerns about potential violations of the accused's rights. The Administration established rules for military tribunals in response to concerns about violating accused rights. Critics called for more checks and balances, including an independent appellate process. The rules did not address indefinite detention without charge. The Pentagon's Inspector General investigated allegations of rigged military commission proceedings at Guantanamo Bay, but found no evidence to support the claims. President Bush approved trials for 20 detainees under the Military Order, with 10 charged before military commissions. Salim Ahmed Hamdan, captured in Afghanistan, challenged the lawfulness of his military commission trial under the UCMJ and Geneva Conventions. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the district court's decision regarding Hamdan's military commission trial, stating that the Geneva Conventions are not enforceable in court. The appellate court found authority for military commissions in the Authorization to Use Military Force (AUMF) and UCMJ arts. 21 and 36. The Supreme Court later reversed this decision. The Court rejected the government's argument that the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 stripped its jurisdiction to review habeas corpus challenges by Guantanamo detainees. It found that the Geneva Conventions, incorporated into UCMJ art. 21, provide minimum protections even to members of al Qaeda. The Court ruled that the military commissions under M.C.O. No. 1 did not meet the requirements of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. Justice Scalia, along with Justices Thomas and Alito, dissented, arguing that the Detainee Treatment Act should preclude the Court's review. Congress responded to the Hamdan decision by enacting the Military Commissions Act of 2006 to grant the President authority to convene military commissions for prosecution. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 grants the President authority to convene military commissions to prosecute \"alien unlawful enemy combatants,\" exempting them from certain requirements of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 grants the President authority to convene military commissions to prosecute \"alien unlawful enemy combatants,\" exempting them from certain requirements of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, including speedy trial, self-incrimination warnings, and pretrial investigations. The Act also allows for detention and possible trial by military tribunal for violations of the law of war and \"other applicable law.\" The Military Commissions Act of 2006 grants the President authority to convene commissions to try aliens for violations of the law of war and other offenses triable by military commissions. The Act validates the President's jurisdictional scheme for military commissions, allowing for detention and possible trial by military tribunal for unlawful enemy combatants. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 grants the President authority to convene commissions to try aliens for violations of the law of war and other offenses triable by military commissions. The Department of Defense asserted its authority to detain enemy combatants based on the law of war, allowing for the capture and detention of individuals supporting Taliban or al Qaeda forces engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners. The Act defines \"unlawful enemy combatant\" broadly to include individuals who have engaged in hostilities against the US or its co-belligerents. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 defines \"unlawful enemy combatant\" broadly to include individuals who support Taliban, al Qaeda, or associated forces. Those who purposefully and materially support hostilities can be treated as unlawful enemy combatants and subject to detention. The Act does not clarify what constitutes \"supporting hostilities,\" potentially leading to issues with jurisdiction. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 defines \"unlawful enemy combatant\" broadly to include individuals who support Taliban, al Qaeda, or associated forces. It is unclear whether this principle would apply to aliens captured and detained overseas, but the MCA does not appear to exempt from military jurisdiction permanent resident aliens captured in the United States who might otherwise meet the definition of \"unlawful enemy combatant.\" Aliens within the United States are entitled to the same protections in criminal trials as U.S. citizens, raising significant constitutional questions if subjected to trial by military commission. The MCA did not specifically identify who makes the determination. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 defines \"unlawful enemy combatant\" broadly to include individuals who support Taliban, al Qaeda, or associated forces. The government sought to establish jurisdiction based on Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) determinations, but two military commission judges found CSRT determinations inadequate for jurisdiction. One judge determined the military commission itself is not competent to make the determination, while the other judge found the government's allegations insufficient to conclude the defendant was an unlawful enemy. The Court of Military Commission Review (CMCR) reversed the dismissal in the first case, stating that CSRT determinations alone are insufficient to establish jurisdiction. The CMCR found that the military judge erred in declaring that a competent tribunal other than the military commission must make the status determination. The CMCR interpreted the Military Commissions Act (MCA) to require more than just proving membership in Al Qaeda or the Taliban to establish jurisdiction over the accused. The court found no support for the government's position on the definition of \"unlawful enemy combatants\" in relation to Taliban, al Qaeda, or associated forces. The parenthetical language in the Military Commissions Act does not automatically label members of these groups as such, but rather requires engagement in hostilities against the United States or its allies to qualify as an \"unlawful enemy combatant.\" The CMCR clarified that individuals captured during hostilities who engage in hostilities against the United States or its allies will be considered \"unlawful enemy combatants\" under the M.C.A. Congress carefully defined this status for the purpose of specifying jurisdiction for military commission trials and imposing criminal sanctions on those convicted. The use of CSRT reviews could subject detainees to military commission jurisdiction without their knowledge. The CMCR suggested that using CSRT determinations to establish jurisdiction for military commissions would undermine Congress's intent for fair trials. The Department of Defense won't need new status tribunals, but prosecution must prove jurisdiction over each person charged. Military commissions have jurisdiction over offenses punishable by the law of war committed by unlawful enemy combatants. Offenses include murder of protected persons and attacking. Offenses punishable under military commissions include murder of protected persons, attacking civilians or property, pillaging, torture, rape, terrorism, and more. Conspiracy, attempts, and solicitation to commit these acts are also punishable. Military commissions operate under specific regulations. The Military Commissions Act lists crimes punishable under military commissions, which are not exhaustive but illustrative of acts triable by military commissions. Some crimes may be considered new, such as conspiracy, which was not traditionally a war crime. The Military Commissions Act lists crimes punishable under military commissions, including new crimes like conspiracy. The Act also addresses the issue of punishing unprivileged belligerents for hostile acts resulting in death, especially in non-international armed conflicts where combatant immunity does not apply. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has found war crimes in non-international armed conflicts to include murder of civilians, but not killing of combatants. The definition of \"material support for terrorism\" as a war crime lacks historical precedent. Part IV of the Manual for Military Commissions outlines the elements of crimes defined by the MCA. The Manual for Military Commissions (M.M.C.) outlines crimes defined by the Military Commissions Act (MCA), with few differences from previous definitions. Changes include adding allegiance to the U.S. for \"Aiding the Enemy\" and removing custody requirement for \"mutilation or maiming\" and \"causing serious injury.\" Combat activities are clarified to be covered without combatant immunity. The definition of \"murder in violation of the law of war\" now includes deaths from acts or omissions of the accused. The law of war applies within armed conflicts between belligerents, not on neutral territory or outside armed conflicts. The \"Global War on Terrorism\" lacks clear boundaries in time and space. Criticism arose over the broad jurisdiction of military commissions under the Manual for Military Commissions. The Manual for Military Commissions (M.C.I. No. 2) exceeded customary law by providing jurisdiction to military commissions over offenses committed by alien unlawful enemy combatants. The definition of \"armed hostilities\" in the M.C.I. was broader than traditional definitions of war, allowing for prosecution without a declared war or ongoing mutual hostilities. The expansion of \"armed conflict\" by the Manual for Military Commissions (M.C.I. No. 2) allowed for prosecution without a declared war or ongoing mutual hostilities. Some argue this expanded jurisdiction improperly broadened the scope of military commissions. The Supreme Court has not clarified the scope of the \"Global War on Terrorism,\" but Congress provided statutory definitions of criminal offenses in the Military Commissions Act to address jurisdictional concerns. Questions may still arise regarding the necessity for conduct to occur in an armed conflict for it to be triable by military commission, despite overcoming previous objections on subject matter jurisdiction. The definition of \"Enemy\" in the Military Commissions Act includes entities engaged in armed conflicts or preparing to attack the United States, extending to organizations of terrorists with international reach. Some argue this exposes suspected international criminals to military commission jurisdiction. The Military Commissions Act defines \"enemy\" broadly to include entities engaged in armed conflicts or preparing to attack the United States, which may subject suspected international criminals to military commission jurisdiction. The distinction between a \"war crime\" and a common crime may be contentious during proceedings, with challenges in determining if conduct assisted an \"enemy of the United States.\" Military commissions consist of panels of military officers determined to be competent by the Secretary of Defense. The Military Commissions Act allows for the appointment of reserve, National Guard, and retired personnel to serve during a national emergency. The presiding officer must be a judge advocate, with procedures for assigning military judges left to the Secretary of Defense. Military judges may preside over panels of military officers, with a minimum of five members, or twelve in cases seeking the death penalty. The military judge in a military commission may decide on evidence admissibility and maintain decorum during proceedings. They cannot compel the government to produce classified information. The presiding officer has the authority to discipline individuals who violate commission rules. The military commissions, authorized by the MCA, have the power to punish contempt, including fines and confinement, for disruptive behavior during proceedings. It is unclear if this extends to non-enemy combatants or civilians, but the UCMJ allows for fines up to $100 and 30 days of confinement for contempt. Military commissions can compel witnesses to appear similar to general court-martials. The MCA authorizes military commissions to compel witnesses to appear in a manner similar to general court-martials. The M.M.C. provides the defense a \"reasonable opportunity\" to obtain witnesses and evidence, with the trial counsel responsible for producing requested witnesses unless deemed unnecessary. A duly subpoenaed witness who refuses to appear before a military commission may be prosecuted in federal court under article 47 of the UCMJ. The M.M.C. allows military commissions to issue subpoenas to compel witnesses or documents. It addresses concerns about command influence and impartiality by giving the President authority over charges, panel selection, and procedural rules. The President or his designees have authority over procedural rules, interpretation, enforcement, and amendments in military commissions. Justice Kennedy noted a concentration of authority in the Appointing Authority, deviating from Congress's structural safeguards in the military justice system. The MCA aims to address concerns of command influence by setting requirements for procedural rules. Rule 104 of the Rules for Military Commissions prohibits command influence similar to the Manual for Courts-Martial. The M.C.O. prohibits command influence broadly, with procedural safeguards similar to general courts-martial. It specified rules governing trials without recognizing accused persons' rights under the law. The MCA provides accused individuals with a minimum set of rights in trials, including the right to appeal adverse verdicts. Accused individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty, and are to be informed of charges promptly to prepare a defense. The M.C.O. rules ensure the accused's rights to presumption of innocence, right against self-incrimination, and the right not to testify at trial. Trials are to be conducted openly unless closed for specific reasons. The M.C.O. rules ensure the accused's rights to presumption of innocence, right against self-incrimination, and the right not to testify at trial. Open proceedings may not necessarily be open to the public and press at the discretion of the Appointing Authority. The extent of openness in military commission trials may be challenged by media representatives based on the First Amendment right of public access. The closure of trials must meet specific criteria, including demonstrating an overriding interest likely to be prejudiced, narrow tailoring of closure, consideration of alternatives, and adequate findings to support closure. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) allows the military judge to close parts of a trial to protect national security or individuals' safety. The exclusion of the press and public must consider constitutional requirements, potentially implicating First Amendment rights. The Manual for Military Commissions (M.M.C.) permits closure to safeguard designated information or individuals' safety, but must adhere to specific criteria. The Military Commissions Act allows the military judge to limit spectators and access to the courtroom for reasons such as maintaining dignity or national security. The First Amendment does not guarantee the press special access to information not available to the public, and reporters do not have an absolute right to access restricted areas. The issue of press access to military commission proceedings may need to be decided by the courts. The accused in military commissions may be excluded from trial proceedings only for disruptive or dangerous conduct, unlike in military courts-martial where detailed defense counsel must be present for all hearings. The accused's right to be present at all proceedings is protected under UCMJ art. 39, but the accused cannot be excluded from portions of the trial under the MCA. Classified information cannot be presented to panel members without being disclosed to the accused. The accused in military commissions has the right to have military counsel assigned free of charge and may also hire a civilian attorney who meets specific criteria. The accused's right to counsel attaches early in the military justice system, and at least one qualifying military defense counsel is to be detailed promptly after charges are sworn. If civilian counsel is hired, the detailed military counsel serves as associate counsel. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) allows the accused to represent themselves and request a replacement counsel from the Chief Defense Counsel if dissatisfied. If a civilian attorney is retained, military defense counsel acts as associate counsel. The accused's right to counsel is established early in the process, with at least one military defense counsel assigned promptly after charges are filed. The Military Commissions Act allows the accused to represent themselves, with detailed counsel serving as standby counsel. Civilian attorneys defending an accused must meet strict qualifications, including U.S. citizenship, a SECRET clearance, and compliance with court rules. The Chief Defense Counsel now has the authority to revoke an attorney's eligibility to appear before any commission. The Chief Defense Counsel has the authority to determine the eligibility of civilian defense counsel and may revoke or suspend their qualification based on certain criteria. The Military Commissions Act does not address attorney-client privilege but Rule 502 of the Military Commission Rules of Evidence provides for a lawyer-client privilege similar to courts-martial. The Military Commissions Act does not address attorney-client privilege, but Rule 502 of the Military Commission Rules of Evidence provides a lawyer-client privilege similar to courts-martial. Civilian attorneys must inform military counsel of information about pending crimes that could harm national security. The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to confront witnesses in criminal prosecutions. The Military Rules of Evidence allow for the admission of all relevant evidence, except when outweighed by probative value. At court-martial, the accused has the right to view prosecution documents related to the charges and evidence that could negate guilt or reduce punishment. Military commissions for trying suspected terrorists may have different evidentiary standards than federal or military courts. The Supreme Court found previous DOD rules inadequate under international law. The accused must be present for trial, privy to evidence against them, and allowed to present evidence in their defense at military commissions. It is unclear what evidence may be excluded, such as credibility of witnesses or document authenticity. Defense counsel must have a reasonable opportunity to obtain evidence. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) allows defense counsel a reasonable opportunity to obtain witnesses and evidence, including evidence in the possession of the United States. Unlike M.C.O. No. 1, the MCA does not require the prosecution to provide all evidence to the accused, but the accused is entitled to examine and respond to relevant evidence. Both M.C.O. No. 1 and the MCA ensure the accused receives exculpatory information known to the prosecution, with procedures for security concerns. The MCA also protects national security information during discovery, with the military judge authorizing redaction of classified information. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) allows the government to withhold properly classified information deemed necessary for national security protection. The accused has access to protected information for prosecution and exculpatory purposes, with defense counsel permitted to obtain witnesses and evidence. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) allows the government to withhold classified information for national security reasons. Defense counsel may not access classified information that serves as the basis for substitute evidence. The MCA mandates the production of exculpatory information for the accused, but does not allow access to classified information. The military judge can authorize substitute information when necessary to protect sensitive sources and methods. The Military Commissions Act allows the government to withhold classified information for national security reasons. Defense counsel may not access classified information that serves as the basis for substitute evidence. The military judge can authorize substitute information to protect sensitive sources and methods, with the defense entitled to an adequate substitute for the information. The Military Commissions Act allows the government to withhold classified information for national security reasons, with the military judge authorized to provide substitute information if necessary. If the government's proposed substitute is deemed inadequate, the judge can issue orders to ensure justice, including striking testimony, declaring a mistrial, or dismissing charges. The Military Commissions Act allows the defense to challenge charges based on evidence admissibility, with the standard being probative value to a reasonable person. Coerced evidence is excluded, and statements obtained through torture are prohibited as trial evidence. The Military Commissions Act prohibits the use of statements obtained through torture as trial evidence, except for proving torture against the accused. Coerced evidence is excluded, and different standards apply depending on when the statement was obtained in relation to the enactment of the DTA. The Military Commissions Act prohibits the use of statements obtained through torture as trial evidence. Coerced evidence is excluded, and different standards apply depending on when the statement was obtained in relation to the enactment of the DTA. Additionally, Mil. Comm. R. Evid. 304 outlines procedures for excluding statements elicited by torture, with the defense required to object before entering a plea to prevent waiver of objections. The government bears the burden of proof in establishing the admissibility of statements. The government has the burden of establishing the admissibility of evidence, including statements. The defense can present evidence on the voluntariness of the statement, and the military judge must instruct the members to consider this factor. Testimony denying a statement's validity can only be used in perjury or false statement prosecutions. Mil. Comm. R. Evid. 304 governs the admission of confessions and admissions in court-martial proceedings. In court-martial proceedings, a statement and its evidence are admissible if made voluntarily. Involuntary statements obtained through coercion are inadmissible. Confessions must be supported by independent evidence to be used against the accused. Hearsay evidence, out-of-court statements used to prove the truth of the matter asserted, is allowed under M.C.O. No. 1 if the adverse party is notified in advance with details of the evidence. The rules for admissibility of evidence in military commission proceedings differ from court-martial rules. Hearsay is admissible in military commissions unless prohibited by rules or an act of Congress. The rules do not restrict hearsay evidence. Mil. Comm. Evid. 803 allows hearsay evidence if admissible at courts-martial or with advance notice to the adverse party. The military judge determines fairness if no notice given. Opposing party can challenge hearsay reliability. Classified information is privileged in military commission proceedings for national security. In military commission proceedings, classified information is privileged for national security purposes. The military judge can authorize deletion or substitution of classified information to protect national security. The judge must review any supporting materials in camera and cannot disclose privileged information to the accused. In military commission proceedings, the military judge can allow trial counsel to introduce classified evidence without revealing its sources or methods if deemed reliable. The accused may not contest the admissibility of substitute evidence or examine it before presentation. If constitutional standards required by the Sixth Amendment apply to military commissions, the Military Commissions Act (MCA) may face challenges for not providing the accused with enough opportunity to contest evidence. The use of evidence from classified intelligence sources may be admissible if it is deemed reliable and trustworthy, even if the accused is not able to contest its reliability. Classified evidence may be admissible in military commissions if deemed reliable, even without the accused's ability to contest its reliability. The trial counsel can object to questions or motions that may disclose classified information, with the military judge taking appropriate action to protect the privilege. The defense must notify trial counsel and the judge before disclosing classified information at trial. The accused can present evidence and make a statement during sentencing proceedings, subject to cross-examination. The accused is entitled to access evidence for sentencing under M.C.O. No. 1. The accused can present evidence and make a statement during sentencing proceedings, subject to cross-examination. Possible penalties under M.C.O. No. 1 included execution, imprisonment, fines, or other lawful punishment. Detention as an \"enemy combatant\" does not count towards serving a sentence. Plea agreements are binding on the commission, and the death penalty requires a unanimous vote. Military commissions can impose punishments, including death, with a unanimous vote. Flogging, branding, and other cruel punishments are prohibited. Sentences up to 10 years require a two-thirds vote, longer sentences need three-fourths vote, and the death penalty requires unanimous approval. A panel of 12 members is needed for cases seeking the death penalty. The death penalty in military commissions requires unanimous approval, with the President having the authority to commute or adjust sentences. The death sentence can only be carried out after all legal proceedings and appeals are exhausted, and the President approves it. Chapter X of the Rules for Military Commissions covers sentencing, including \"aggravating factors\" that can be presented by the trial counsel. The accused can provide mitigating or extenuating circumstances in a sworn or unsworn statement. The death penalty can only be imposed if expressly authorized for the offense or under the law of war, with unanimous approval required from all twelve members of the commission. In Chapter X of the Rules for Military Commissions, sentencing includes \"aggravating factors\" for convicting the accused. These factors include committing a capital offense violating the law of war, resulting in death or endangering lives, committing the offense for monetary gain, involving torture, being guilty of another capital crime, victim being under fifteen, or a protected person. The death penalty requires unanimous agreement from all twelve commission members. The M.O. faced criticism for lacking appeal opportunities, habeas corpus relief, and double jeopardy protection. M.C.O. No.1 addressed concerns by allowing administrative and military officer reviews of trial records. The review panel could consider written submissions from prosecution and defense without the opposing party's rebuttal. The review panel, upon finding a material error of law, could send the case back for further proceedings. The Appointing Authority had to dismiss charges if recommended by the panel. Cases with errors were returned to the military commission, while others were forwarded to the Secretary of Defense for review and then to the President. The M.C.O. did not specify what \"further proceedings\" entailed. The M.C.O. did not specify what \"further proceedings\" might entail after a material error of law is found by the review panel. The Military Commissions Act establishes the Court of Military Commission Review (CMCR) for appeals, with the option to appeal to higher courts if necessary. The MCA and UCMJ both prohibit the invalidation of a verdict or sentence unless the error of law materially prejudices the accused's substantial rights. The M.C.I. No. 9 defined \"Material Error of Law\" to exclude variances from the M.O. or any military orders that would not affect the outcome of the military commission. Post-trial procedures for military commissions are outlined in Chapter XI of the Rules for Military Commissions, allowing for corrections without material prejudice to the accused. The accused can submit relevant matters to the convening authority within twenty days of the record being authenticated. The convening authority must consider written submissions and recommendations from the legal advisor. The convening authority cannot disapprove a finding of not guilty, except in cases of lack of mental responsibility. The accused may be released or detained under less stringent circumstances without posing a danger to others. Rehearings of guilty findings may be ordered at the discretion of the convening authority, except in cases of insufficient evidence. Rehearings are allowed if inadmissible evidence can be replaced. Any part of a sentence served counts towards any resentencing. The record is forwarded to the Court of Military Commission Review unless the accused waives review. The CMCR can only grant relief if an error of law prejudiced the accused's trial rights. The accused has the right to petition for review with the U.S. Court of Appeals after a CMCR decision. They can request a new trial within two years of a military commission conviction based on new evidence or fraud. Jeopardy does not attach until the final verdict is approved. In contrast to general courts-martial, where jeopardy attaches after the prosecution presents evidence. The accused's right to petition for review with the U.S. Court of Appeals after a CMCR decision allows for a new trial within two years of a military commission conviction based on new evidence or fraud. Jeopardy does not attach until the final verdict is approved, unlike general courts-martial where jeopardy attaches after the prosecution presents evidence. If a charge is dismissed or terminated by the convening authority after evidence is introduced but before a finding, or if there is a finding of not guilty, the trial is considered complete for jeopardy purposes. The accused cannot be retried for the same charge without consent. The MCA allows for the Secretary of Defense or the President to disapprove a not guilty finding and return the case for further proceedings, potentially raising double jeopardy concerns. The MCA prevents double jeopardy by prohibiting retrial without consent after a guilty finding becomes final. The severity of a sentence by a military commission cannot be increased on rehearing unless mandatory. These protections are outlined in Chapter XI of the Rules for Military Commission. Proceedings cannot reconsider a ruling of not guilty, except for specified circumstances. The MCA prohibits retrial without consent after a guilty finding becomes final and prevents increasing the severity of a sentence unless mandatory. M.C.O. No. 1 lacks specific forms for charges and does not require authentication by oath or signature, potentially raising double jeopardy concerns. Charges must be signed under oath by someone with personal knowledge and served in a language the accused understands. The Rules for Military Commissions require charges to be written in a language understood by the accused, with specifications alleging every element of the offense. Minor changes to charges can be made before findings are announced, but major changes require a new referral. The accused may be transferred to another governmental authority for trial at any time, potentially leading to double jeopardy implications if tried in federal court after a military commission trial. The Military Commissions Act does not explicitly prohibit trial in another forum, allowing the President to determine the accused's status under the Act. The Military Commissions Act allows for transfer of the accused to military authorities, potentially leading to double jeopardy if tried in federal court after a military commission trial. The Act does not explicitly address double jeopardy defense, but the accused can move to dismiss charges if previously tried in federal civilian court for the same offense. Bills in the 110th Congress aim to amend the MCA. H.R. 1585, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, requires a report on the transfer of Guantanamo Bay detainees classified as \"enemy combatants.\" It also mandates reports on detainees charged with crimes, those eligible for release, and actions needed for their release. The Military Commissions Revision Act of 2007 redefines \"unlawful enemy combatant\" and allows admission of coerced statements in military commissions under certain conditions. It also repeals a section related to CSRT determinations. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 would make Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) mandatory for all detainees and restore habeas corpus for individuals detained as 'enemy combatants' for over two years without charges. The Act would provide detainees with the right to an attorney, access to evidence and witnesses, and the opportunity for their counsel to view classified evidence. The detainee's counsel would have the opportunity to view classified evidence, including evidence to be used against the detainee and any potentially exculpatory evidence. The detainee would have access to unclassified evidence and a summary of classified evidence for a fair response. Information obtained through torture would not be admissible, while information from lesser coercion would be under military commission standards. The definition of \"unlawful enemy combatant\" would include active participants. The definition of \"unlawful enemy combatant\" would include active participants in organizations engaging in hostilities against the United States. Information obtained through coercion not amounting to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment would be admissible under certain conditions. Hearsay evidence rules would be amended to remove limitations related to classified information. The bills aim to make military judges responsible for determining the admissibility of evidence in military and intelligence operations during hostilities. H.R. 2710 would restore habeas corpus for detainees, eliminating CSRT review but retaining the DTA provision for appealing military commission decisions. H.R. 1416 and S. 185, the Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007, would remove habeas corpus restrictions on detainees. H.R. 1416 and other bills aim to restore habeas corpus for detainees, allowing challenges to military commission decisions and removing restrictions on the use of the Geneva Conventions in court actions against the United States. H.R. 2826 would allow habeas corpus actions and injunctive relief against transfer, with exceptions for detainees in active war zones. H.R. 267 seeks to eliminate restrictions on habeas corpus in certain sections of the law. The National Security with Justice Act of 2007 aims to redefine \"enemy combatant\" and extend a statutory right of habeas corpus to detainees, eliminating restrictions on habeas corpus in certain sections of the law. The National Security with Justice Act of 2007 aims to redefine \"unlawful enemy combatant\" and grant habeas corpus rights to detainees, allowing challenges to detention and military commission decisions in the D.C. Federal District Court. Habeas corpus challenges would not be allowed for detainees in foreign military zones where detainee regulations are being implemented. The National Security with Justice Act of 2007 aims to redefine \"unlawful enemy combatant\" and grant habeas corpus rights to detainees. It would limit the Secretary of Defense's authority in military commission procedures and rules of evidence. The bills would also repeal the authority for civilian attorneys to act as trial counsel in commission proceedings. The bills would modify the evidentiary requirements of the MCA in several ways, including restricting the use of evidence acquired without a warrant within the United States. The responsibility for determining the reliability of hearsay evidence would shift to the military judge, and statements obtained through coercion would be inadmissible except against the accused. The military judge could order trial counsel to disclose sources or methods of obtaining evidence if it could impact the weight given to the statement. The bills propose changes to the Military Commissions Act, including modifying evidentiary requirements and allowing habeas corpus for detainees. Appeals would go to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, and the Geneva Conventions would no longer be excluded as a \"source of rights.\" The Military Commissions Act is proposed to be amended to ensure consistency with the Geneva Conventions, with provisions for congressional oversight and judicial review of the President's authority. The Federal Death Penalty Abolition Act of 2007 aims to eliminate the death penalty for crimes tried by military commissions. Comparisons are provided for military tribunals under different regulations and authorities. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of military tribunals, jurisdiction over persons and offenses, and procedural safeguards in comparison to previous DOD regulations and the UCMJ. It aims to facilitate comparison with federal court procedures and international military tribunals."
