    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Child Nutrition Promotion and School Lunch Protection Act of 2006\". It includes findings related to child nutrition and school lunch programs. Congress finds that school food service programs must meet science-based nutritional standards for federal reimbursements under the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 and the National School Lunch Act. Foods sold outside of school meal programs are not required to meet the same standards. Congress has authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to establish nutritional standards in school lunchrooms during meal times to promote child nutrition and health. Since 1979, the Secretary has prohibited the sale of food of minimal nutritional value in areas where school meals are sold. However, the current definition of such food is outdated and inconsistent with current knowledge about nutrition and health. This undermines federally-reimbursed school meals and child nutrition programs. Experts in nutrition science have found that rates of obesity have doubled in children and tripled in adolescents since 1980. Only 2 percent of children eat a healthy diet consistent with Federal nutrition recommendations, and 3 out of 4 high school students do not consume the minimum recommended servings of fruits and vegetables. In 1996, children aged 2 to 18 consumed 118 more calories per day than in 1978, leading to potential weight gain of 12 pounds annually without increased physical activity. The Surgeon General estimates the annual cost of obesity in the US at $117 billion. SEC. 3. FOOD OF MINIMAL NUTRITIONAL VALUE. Section 10 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 is amended to focus on regulations. The Secretary must revise the definition of 'food of minimal nutritional value' within 180 days of enactment. This definition will apply to all foods sold outside the school meal programs and on the school campus. The Secretary must revise the definition of 'food of minimal nutritional value' within 180 days of enactment, applying to all foods sold outside the school meal programs on the school campus. The revision should consider the positive and negative contributions of nutrients, ingredients, and foods to children's diets, evidence on the relationship between certain nutrients and chronic illnesses, and recommendations from experts. The Secretary must revise the definition of 'food of minimal nutritional value' for foods sold outside of school meal programs on campus, considering recommendations from authoritative scientific organizations and allowing special exemptions for approved school-sponsored fundraisers. The proposed regulations will take effect at the beginning of the school year following finalization, with an exception for regulations finalized within 60 days of the school year. If final regulations are not promulgated within 1 year of enactment, the proposed regulations will be considered final."
