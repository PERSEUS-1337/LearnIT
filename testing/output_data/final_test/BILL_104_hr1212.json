The National Family Enterprise Preservation Act of 1995 increases unified estate and gift tax credits for family enterprises. The amendment includes an additional credit for family enterprise property in the decedent's gross estate, up to $121,800. Effective dates for the estate tax credit apply to decedents dying after December 31, 1995, and for the gift tax credit to gifts made after the same date. SEC. 3. INCREASE IN ANNUAL GIFT TAX EXCLUSION.\n\n    Section 2503 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to increase the exclusion for gifts of family enterprise property by up to $10,000 per calendar year. Effective for gifts made after December 31, 1995.\n\nSEC. 4. FAMILY ENTERPRISE INTERESTS.\n\n    A new section 2032B is added to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, defining family enterprise property. The value of family enterprise property in the gross estate of a US decedent is determined by subtracting 50% or $1,000,000, whichever is less. Family enterprise property includes interests in property used for farming or other businesses with at least 80% ownership held by 5 or fewer individuals. Family enterprise property is defined as property used for farming or businesses with 80% ownership by 5 or fewer individuals. Limited partnership interests are excluded from this definition. If family enterprise property is disposed of within 10 years after the decedent's death, additional estate tax may be imposed unless it is transferred to a family member. An additional estate tax is imposed if an individual or their family member stops actively managing family enterprise property. The amount of tax is determined based on the interest in the property and decreases by 5% for each year the individual or family member is involved in management after the decedent's death. The estate tax increases if an individual or family member ceases active management of family enterprise property. The tax amount decreases by 5% for each year the individual remains involved in management after the decedent's death. Rules similar to section 2032A(c) apply to this tax, defining \"active management\" as making management decisions excluding daily operations. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for part III of subchapter A of chapter 11 of the Code. The estate tax rules for family enterprise property are amended, with a higher valuation limit of $1,000,000 for certain farm real property. These changes apply to estates of decedents passing away after December 31, 1995."
