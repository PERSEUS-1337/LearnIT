Comcast's extensive cable systems and broadband network, along with NBC's cable networks, would make the combined entity a major player in the industry. The proposed combination of Comcast and NBC Universal would create a vertically integrated entity with significant negotiating power in the video content market. This would include national cable networks like NBC's USA, Bravo, CNBC, MSNBC, Oxygen, and Syfy, as well as Comcast's E!, Style, Golf Channel, and Versus networks. Additionally, there are interests in various other cable networks and sports networks, along with NBC's national broadcast television network and Telemundo, the second-largest Spanish language programming network in the United States. NBC Universal (NBCU) owns Spanish language programming network Telemundo in the US, along with NBC's local broadcast stations in major markets. NBCU also operates television production, syndication, and a large library of TV episodes. Additionally, NBCU owns Universal Pictures, Focus Features, and digital media properties like CNBC.com and Fandango. Comcast's potential acquisition of NBC Universal includes various digital media properties like CNBC.com, Fandango, and Hulu.com. The deal has raised concerns about its impact on the video market, public policy goals, and shareholder benefits due to the broad scope of the combined entity. The market structure and relationships in the communications sector may be impacted by potential mergers, leading to conflicting market incentives and challenges in crafting a consistent business strategy. The Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission are likely to approve mergers with conditions to protect competition, diversity of voices, and localism. The impact of the Comcast-NBCU combination on the video market and public policy goals will be influenced by dynamic forces at play, including significant technology-induced structural changes. These changes are fragmenting audiences, affecting revenue levels, and challenging traditional business models of content providers and distributors. In the early 1990s, structural changes in the market were driven by new competitors entering the market and existing firms expanding into new activities. Cable dominated the MVPD market with 59.5 million basic cable customers in 1994. Satellite television services were still in their infancy, with fewer than 2 million households subscribing to satellite TV. Telephone companies were not yet offering video services. Most cable subscribers no longer had rooftop antennas, relying on cable companies for local broadcast stations. Cable companies had strong negotiating power over broadcasters. Today, American households have access to satellite providers like DirecTV and Dish Network, with over 31 million subscribers. Verizon's FiOS TV was available to 10.3 million households, while AT&T's U-verse service was expanding. At the end of the third quarter of 2009, AT&T's U-verse service was available to approximately 20 million households and purchased by 1.8 million households. Most households have access to at least three MVPD providers, strengthening broadcasters' negotiating position. Consumer electronics now offer streaming video capabilities, allowing easy connection of TVs to the Internet through various devices. Consumer electronics, including gaming consoles and dedicated boxes like Roku, provide access to various video on demand services such as Netflix and Amazon Video. The Apple iPad offers another option for watching videos over the Internet with access to the iTunes Store for additional content. These devices, along with home computers and laptops, allow consumers to access a wide range of programming online. The availability of desirable programming on Internet-based VOD services remains uncertain. The emergence of Internet-enabled, HDTV-quality Internet service could disrupt MVPDs and broadcasters. Audience fragmentation has been ongoing for decades due to cable networks offering original programming. There are over 500 cable networks reaching millions of households. The majority of television households in the United States subscribe to MVPD service, with an average of 130 television channels. The major broadcast networks and their affiliates now command only about 25% of television usage, while advertising-supported cable networks have increased to approximately 48% of usage. Many successful cable networks are owned by companies that also own major broadcast stations. The majority of television households in the United States subscribe to MVPD service, with an average of 130 television channels. Successful cable networks are owned by companies that also own major broadcast stations. Audiences are not likely to be further fragmented by additional cable network entry, as consumer demand is shifting towards convenient viewing options like DVRs, VOD, video streaming, and mobile video. The future growth of these alternatives may impact traditional broadcast and cable networks. Nielsen Research has started quarterly reports on \"Three Screen\" video viewing - television, computer, and cell phone. In the United States, people spend 31 hours and 35 minutes weekly watching traditional TV, but only 32 minutes on time-shifted TV. They spend 4 hours and 6 minutes on the Internet, with just 22 minutes watching online videos and 3 minutes on mobile video. Alternative video viewing methods are growing faster than overall viewing, with a 26.9% increase in time-shifted viewers from 3Q08 to 3Q09. The number of people watching video on the Internet increased by 14.8% and on mobile phones by 53% from 3Q08 to 3Q09. 47% of the population (138 million people) watch videos on the Internet for an average of 3 hours and 24 minutes per month, while 5% (15.7 million people) watch mobile videos for an average of 3 hours and 15 minutes per month. Different platforms for viewing videos lead to fragmented audiences, impacting market reach and advertising valuation. The fragmentation of audiences across different viewing platforms impacts advertising valuation and market reach. Nielsen is measuring time-delayed and traditional television viewing, with some pushing for faster cross-platform ratings. Time-shifted programming audiences may view fewer ads, leading to potential revenue loss for programmers and distributors. The proliferation of Internet sites further complicates audience fragmentation. The proliferation of Internet sites has created a surplus of online advertising opportunities, leading to lower rates. Audience fragmentation from traditional to non-traditional viewing reduces profitability for network providers and MVPDs. However, offering video programming on multiple platforms can increase viewing minutes and partially offset revenue declines, challenging traditional business models in the video market. The current video market faces challenges due to structural changes, leading to contentious negotiations and new ways of content distribution. The broadcast television industry relies heavily on advertising revenue from national and local ads. The local station benefits from advertising revenues in the local programming schedule, especially when carried by an MVPD serving the station's market. The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 established new rights for broadcast stations by setting carriage and compensation requirements for cable systems. The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 established new rights for broadcast stations by setting carriage and compensation requirements for cable systems for the retransmission of local broadcast station signals. Every three years, local commercial broadcast stations must choose between negotiating a retransmission consent agreement with cable systems for compensation or requiring cable systems to carry their signal without compensation. Since 1992, local network affiliates have the option to choose \"retransmission consent\" or \"must carry\" for their programming on MVPDs. They typically choose retransmission consent and demand compensation from MVPDs. From 1992 to 2005, compensation for retransmission consent was often in the form of network negotiation rights rather than cash payments. Each major network (ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC) is a subsidiary of large producers. During this period, large programmers focused on expanding carriage of their cable networks by MVPDs and creating additional networks with different target audiences using their brand identity. Broadcast networks sought MVPD carriage of these cable networks instead of cash payments. Some local broadcast stations started seeking cash retransmission consent compensation from 2005 onwards. The shift in compensation for broadcast networks was driven by market developments, including the success of branded cable networks with high household penetration and the decline in advertising revenues due to economic cycles and market changes. Cash payments became more attractive as leverage from retransmission consent negotiations decreased. In the current economic downturn, broadcast revenues have fallen substantially due to declining advertising revenues and structural market changes. Broadcasters are now seeking non-advertising revenues to offset this decline, while also looking to emulate the successful business model of advertising-supported cable networks. The cable networks' two-revenue-source business model is facing challenges as broadcast network programming continues to attract larger audiences than cable network programming. Viewers value the programming of local broadcast stations and are willing to pay for it, leading to market evidence supporting this trend. When satellite carriers were first allowed to retransmit local broadcast stations' signals, they charged subscribers an extra $5 per month. Cable operators faced competition in the MVPD market from satellite providers, Verizon, and AT&T. Broadcasters with must-have programming, especially sports, had stronger negotiating positions. Verizon, AT&T, and satellite operators felt a strong need to carry this programming. Verizon, AT&T, and satellite operators were willing to pay cash for broadcast programming to attract subscribers for their triple play services. This led to broadcasters demanding per subscriber cash license fee payments from MVPDs. Negotiations between broadcasters and MVPDs, such as Nexstar and Cox, sometimes resulted in impasses, causing subscribers to lose access to certain programming for months. Recently, negotiations between various media companies like Nexstar and Cox, CBS and cable operators, DISH Network and Hearst-Argyle/Lifetime, Sinclair and Mediacom, and Sinclair and Suddenlink have been contentious. Members of Congress, the FCC, and state legislators have urged parties to reach agreements before contracts expire. In December 2009, major MVPDs submitted a study to the FCC on retransmission consent fees, with estimates provided by SNL Kagan. DBS providers were quicker to make cash payments compared to cable operators. Kagan projects a faster rise in future cash payments by cable operators compared to DBS providers. FOX was seeking $1 per month per Time Warner subscriber in recent negotiations, with industry observers believing they will initially receive around $0.50 per month. Assuming other major networks secure similar payments, this could generate retransmission consent fees of $2.00 per month. The retransmission consent fees could generate $2.4 billion per year at $2.00 per month per household, or $3.6 billion at $0.75 per month. Kagan estimates $0.50-$0.75 per broadcast network per month, which may be conservative. Focus on the trend rather than exact numbers. Retransmission consent agreements involve various variables, making it difficult to separate per subscriber cash payments. Negotiations result in a single overall payment to the broadcaster, covering rights to retransmit signals, offer broadcast programming on demand, MVPD advertising, channel placement, and carriage of multicast sub-channels. The changing business model of retransmission consent involves broadcasters and MVPDs reporting costs and revenues to the SEC, with incentives to attribute cash payments differently. This affects the flow of revenues to local broadcast stations seeking compensation from MVPDs. The changing business model of retransmission consent involves broadcasters and MVPDs reporting costs and revenues to the SEC. Local stations negotiate cash compensation increases from MVPDs, leading networks to seek a share. ABC was reported to be seeking half of its affiliates' retransmission consent revenues, putting pressure on local stations to push for higher payments. Broadcast networks and local station affiliates are expected to reach an agreement on revenue apportionment due to their symbiotic relationship and contribution to must-have programming. The relationship between MVPDs, broadcast networks, and local station affiliates may change with the deployment of digital technology. Local stations now broadcast multiple video streams, but most households rely on MVPDs for high-quality signals. Local stations must negotiate carriage of their non-primary signals with MVPDs, typically during retransmission consent negotiations for the primary video stream. Local stations must decide on programming for their non-primary video streams, which can impact retransmission negotiations with MVPDs. While some efforts have been made to create joint programming with broadcast networks, the focus has been on using national and local content on websites. Alternatively, local stations can carry programming from networks without a local affiliate, and several new broadcast networks are seeking opportunities in the market. Local stations are facing the decision of programming for their non-primary video streams, impacting retransmission negotiations with MVPDs. Some suggest focusing on unique local content to remain viable, but it is costly. Broadcasters are seeking per subscriber license fees to maintain their position as providers of mass-appeal programming, especially major sports. The demand for major sports programming is high, with broadcasters paying high rates for exclusive rights. However, the winning network may struggle to recover costs from advertising revenues. Broadcasters use sports events to market other programming, but declining advertising revenues may make it harder to compete against cable sports networks for rights. The business model for cable operators, satellite operators, and telephone companies in the MVPD market remains strong, with revenues per subscriber increasing even as total subscriptions plateau. Multi-system cable operators have seen significant revenue growth, projected to reach $128.6 billion in 2019. The growth is expected to come from video services, particularly high definition, DVR, and interactive services, which offer higher profit margins. Kagan projects a decrease in the proportion of residential cable revenues from high-speed data, home networking, and telephony. While optimistic about decreasing capital expenditures and rising free cash flow, investors are cautious due to competitive pressures and declining basic subscriptions. The MVPD business model faces challenges from competitive entry and changing consumer demands for video services. The MVPDs have traditionally offered large bundles of program networks to subscribers, as consumer demand for these bundles is relatively price inelastic. They resisted offering networks on an a la carte basis, except for specialty programming like foreign language networks and certain sports programming. This allowed for profitable sales on small specialty tiers. The demand for time shifting led MVPDs to increase video on demand offerings, available on pay per view or free basis, but only to households subscribing to large tiers. This shift may boost revenues or reduce disconnects, but some see it as a double-edged sword. The demand for time shifting led MVPDs to increase video on demand offerings, potentially undermining the traditional linear program schedules. Competition in the MVPD market has strengthened programmers' negotiating power, leading to increased per subscriber license fees. Contentious negotiations between cable networks and MVPDs have sometimes resulted in programming impasses. Negotiations between cable networks and MVPDs have led to programming impasses, such as the dispute between Scripps Networks Interactive Inc. and Cablevision Systems Corp. in 2010. Per subscriber license fee revenues for cable networks have increased significantly, with a projected growth to $45.4 billion in 2018. A large portion of these fees will go to sports networks like ESPN and FOX Sports. This increase in fees could prompt MVPDs to reconsider their programming tiers. The cable industry is considering offering smaller tiers or a la carte pricing due to rising program costs. Cable companies may shift to smaller packages to decrease payments to program networks, but negotiating for must-have programming may make it difficult to limit fee payments. The NFL Network sought carriage by cable companies on their largest tiers to maximize subscriber fee revenues. After negotiations and lawsuits, cable companies now carry the NFL Network on their largest tiers, likely at a lower fee than originally sought. Cable companies conceded due to the need for access to NFL Network games and concern over future access to must-have programming. The NFL Network pressured cable companies to carry it on their largest tiers for maximum revenue. Cable companies now carry the NFL Network on their largest tiers to avoid losing subscribers to competitors. Moving to smaller tiers may lead to dropping less popular networks or offering them as a la carte or VOD options. MVPDs and investors are concerned about the impact of these changes. The MVPDs and investors are concerned about the shift in demand from fixed, linear scheduled programming to on-demand programming. New technologies offering \"over the top\" television services may meet this demand more effectively than MVPDs. Major programmers are expected to respond to these changes, especially among younger viewers who are highly valued by advertisers. The programmers may not always align with the interests of MVPDs in response to these shifts. Major programmers are incentivized to maintain their current business model despite shifts in demand. Kagan's analysis shows high cash flow margins for cable networks, with projections indicating further increases. This trend is driven by rising per subscriber charges and reduced interest in expanding branded cable networks. Mature programming networks with high household penetration are expected to continue enjoying high cash flow. Programming networks with high household penetration are expected to maintain high cash flow margins. Independent programming networks face challenges in entering the market, leading to the likelihood of cash flow margins remaining high unless there is a significant industry shift. Programmers are adapting to changes in demand, particularly with the rise of over the top services. They are experimenting with various distribution channels and business models to capture new audiences while retaining existing MVPD subscribers. Hulu.com offers advertising-supported streaming video of television shows and movies from various programming companies. It has fewer commercials than cable networks and is available only in the United States. In November 2009, Hulu had 43.7 million users who streamed 923.8 million videos. In 2009, Hulu had 43.7 million users streaming 923.8 million videos. Netflix offers unlimited video streaming to subscribers with over 17,000 movies and TV shows available. They have about 10 million subscribers and offer playback on various devices. Netflix offers programming from various major studios, but not all content is available for streaming. Sezmi is a subscription service that provides local broadcast TV signals, cable networks, and on-demand movies. It aims to be a cost-effective alternative to traditional TV services and gained popularity quickly during its pilot in Los Angeles. Programmers do not make all their content available to Sezmi, and it does not have exclusive access to programming. TV Everywhere is an authentication system developed by Comcast and Time Warner that allows subscribers to access on-demand programming via the Internet. Program availability is determined by the programmer, and each MVPD offers its own TV Everywhere service. Comcast's service is called Fancast Xfinity. TV Everywhere, a controversial authentication system, expands programming availability for MVPD subscribers at no extra cost. It also offers piracy protection for programmers. Critics fear it could lead to exclusive contracts with MVPDs, potentially limiting access for independent video distributors. Critics are concerned that TV Everywhere could lead to exclusive contracts with MVPDs, denying access to independent video distributors and harming competition. They also worry that participating MVPDs, who are also ISPs, could prioritize their own video services over independent providers. Additionally, programmers are worried about accurately measuring viewership levels, especially for advertising-supported models. Nielsen has struggled to measure online viewership accurately. Critics are concerned about accurately measuring online viewership, especially for advertising-supported models. Nielsen's methodology is criticized for underestimating viewers of services like Hulu, impacting advertising flow to new distribution models. The Comcast-NBCU combination has sparked various predictions about market and public policy implications. The Comcast-NBCU combination has sparked predictions about market effects and public policy implications. Concerns include how Comcast might use its increased negotiating strength and vertically integrated structure. Rival distributors and new entrants are worried about potential restrictions from the combination. The Comcast-NBCU combination has raised concerns about restricting access to programming and increasing costs for rivals. The FCC has addressed issues of vertically integrated companies denying access to must-have programming or raising costs for competitors in the past. Exclusive distribution contracts can be profitable for programmers if the distributor pays a premium that exceeds potential losses from limited distribution. This strategy is more effective when it limits competition and is often seen in vertically integrated entities. The FCC has identified situations where vertically integrated cable companies benefit from exclusivity, harming competition and consumers. Cable companies, often clustered in small areas with high market shares, compete with satellite and telephone companies. If a local cable company owns a regional sports network (RSN) carrying local games, exclusivity can be detrimental. The FCC has rules to prevent cable companies from discriminating in pricing and access to programming for non-affiliated MVPDs. This applies to vertically integrated companies transmitting programming via satellite, including regional sports networks. The FCC has rules to prevent cable companies from discriminating in pricing and access to programming for non-affiliated MVPDs, including regional sports networks transmitted via satellite. Cable-owned programming, like RSNs, is often delivered terrestrially, exempting them from existing program access rules. The FCC has investigated cable ownership of RSNs and imposed non-exclusivity and non-discrimination requirements on license transfers, including terrestrially delivered RSNs. In a 2006 order involving Comcast, conditions were imposed for a six-year period but did not apply to Comcast's terrestrially delivered RSN in Philadelphia. Recently, generic program access rules were adopted for terrestrially delivered programming under section 628. The FCC has rules to prevent cable companies from discriminating in pricing and access to programming for non-affiliated MVPDs, including regional sports networks transmitted via satellite. Recently, generic program access rules were adopted for terrestrially delivered programming under section 628. The FCC order allowing action against cable companies may be challenged in court. Concerns exist about a combined Comcast-NBCU affecting Comcast's ability to retain exclusive distribution of its RSNs, especially in markets like Philadelphia where NBC owns a broadcast television station and Comcast owns the cable company and Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia. The FCC's program access rules prohibit discrimination in pricing and access to programming for non-affiliated MVPDs. Comcast, NBCU, and General Electric pledged to obey these rules in their merger application. Some MVPDs question the effectiveness of the formal complaint process outlined in the rules. Some MVPDs have questioned the effectiveness of the FCC's program access rules, which allow for different prices, terms, and conditions based on various factors. Non-vertically integrated programmers and distributors are not subject to non-discrimination requirements, leading to market-based negotiations for rates, terms, and conditions. Programmers and distributors negotiate rates, terms, and conditions based on market dynamics. Large MVPDs have an advantage in negotiations, leading to better rates and terms. Impasses with large MVPDs can result in revenue loss for programmers. Broadcasters with multiple stations in a market can negotiate higher payments. In the \"duopoly\" market, Comcast likely benefits from favorable programming terms due to its strong negotiating position. Negotiating \"most favored nation\" clauses allows parties to adjust contracts to match rivals' terms. Smaller MVPDs have struggled to secure similar advantages. Post-merger, NBCU may have to provide programming to all MVPDs on a nondiscriminatory basis, raising concerns about competitive impact and potential price increases. DOJ and FCC may need specific merger or license conditions to address these issues. Smaller MVPDs have not been able to secure favorable contract terms like Comcast. The challenge for new video distributors is to convince programmers that their business model will benefit them more than the traditional MVPD model. The appeal of new distributors lies in lower monthly charges, but they must offer enough must-have programming to attract viewers. The future demand is for over the top television services that can be monetized for mutual benefit. The new video distributors aim to attract a threshold audience by offering various business models. Sezmi focuses on local news, sports, and popular cable programs, while others focus on national programming. The key is to ensure access to must-have programming. Comcast and other MVPDs work to maintain the traditional business model by convincing major programmers to collaborate. The primary threat comes from new video distributors and the Internet. The MVPDs must convince programmers to meet the demand for time- and location-shifted programming without uncertain revenue streams. Revenue from subscriber license fees is expected to rise despite slowing advertising revenue. TV Everywhere is supported by MVPDs and programmers to reduce household disconnections. The MVPDs are looking for a business model to reduce household disconnections, even if it doesn't monetize Internet video viewing. Programmers participating in TV Everywhere have not made their programming exclusively available to MVPDs, but exclusive contracts may be pushed for. This raises questions about the viability of new video distributors and the impact of the Comcast-NBCU combination on programming availability. New video distributors may face challenges in participating in TV Everywhere without changing their business model. The affiliation of NBCU with Comcast raises questions about exclusive relationships with MVPDs and the impact on independent Internet and over the top video providers. This could potentially pressure other programmers to follow suit or create opportunities for new distribution services to reach consumers who reject the current MVPD model. Comcast has committed to adding two new independently owned and operated channels to its digital line-up each year for three years, in an effort to address concerns about independent programmers being precluded from the market. This move aims to help new distribution services reach consumers who reject the current MVPD model. The FCC has adopted rules to promote diversity in programming by requiring cable operators to set aside channels for unaffiliated commercial programmers. These rules implement sections 612 and 616 of the Communications Act, prohibiting MVPDs from engaging in anti-competitive behavior. The FCC has rules to promote programming diversity by requiring cable operators to reserve channels for unaffiliated programmers. The combination of Comcast and NBCU may lead to more NBCU programming on Comcast, but it does not violate any rules. Comcast aims to address concerns by linking NBCU programming to public interest goals in its FCC filing. Comcast aims to maintain NBC's broadcast network and expand local news and public interest programming on its platforms. They also plan to feature Telemundo programming and increase diversity by offering mun2 content. Additionally, Comcast intends to provide over-the-air programming to the Hispanic community through multicasting on available digital spectrum. Comcast plans to utilize digital spectrum for multicasting Telemundo programming to the Hispanic community. There are speculations about NBC possibly becoming a cable network, but Comcast has stated they have no intention of doing so. Comcast has no intention of turning NBC into a cable network due to the strong demand for local news and sports programming, as well as the branding associated with local broadcast stations. However, they may experiment with their acquired broadcast properties in different ways. If Comcast finds no strong video demands for extra spectrum after the digital transition, it may benefit shareholders by selling the unneeded spectrum to wireless broadband carriers. Additionally, Comcast may shift some sports properties from broadcast to cable to compete with ESPN on its Versus network. General Electric's decision before the NBC merger could also impact Comcast's course of action for the network and local stations. NBC has secured exclusive television rights for the Summer and Winter Olympic Games, but is expected to lose $200 million on the Winter Olympics in Vancouver. The bidding process for the 2016 Summer Olympics has been delayed due to the economy, with golf being introduced as a competitive sport. Comcast, which owns the Golf Channel, could boost NBC's bid for the Games. There is speculation that General Electric may bid for the Games at the urging of Comcast. The advertising industry struggles to generate revenue from new digital video distribution technologies. Experimenters need to understand both programmer and distributor perspectives, have financial stability, and be a market leader. Comcast-NBCU merger could meet these criteria. Comcast Senior VP argues for the merger in a license transfer application. Comcast Senior Vice President Robert Pick argues that the merger with NBCU would help alleviate negotiation challenges and facilitate content creation and delivery. He highlights the risks of new business models and the benefits of a single company handling both programming and distribution. Comcast's struggles with implementing video on demand, day and date release, and TV Everywhere are cited as examples of delays due to separate ownership of programming and distribution. Comcast's merger with NBCU aims to address challenges in negotiation and content delivery by combining programming and distribution. The goal is to have greater control over timing of programming availability and maximize returns. The merger also presents opportunities for cross-marketing programming, but it remains uncertain if it will eliminate inefficiencies between programmers and distributors. In a typical environment where executive salaries are tied to entity performance, conflicts may arise when decisions are imposed that are not beneficial to certain parts of the company. This internal conflict can be significant if entities are of similar size and contribute equally to the company's bottom line or if the company is subject to regulation. For example, Sprint in the late 1980s faced public policy issues regarding payments between local and long-distance companies. The merger between long distance and local companies faced internal conflicts over testimony positions. Some aspects of the programmer-distributor relationship are subject to public review, like retransmission consent. Observers question if the merger will benefit Comcast, with concerns about hindering their response to the evolving media landscape. Comcast's ability to make money from customers who switch off cable subscriptions is also discussed. Comcast faces challenges with the potential loss of customers switching from cable to online video. The merger with NBC Universal raises concerns about industry consolidation and the impact on smaller players. Comcast is working to address political opposition by emphasizing benefits to localism, diversity, and competition. Comcast has agreed to add cable networks owned by African Americans and an English-language channel for Asian Americans. The DOJ and FCC are expected to approve the Comcast-NBCU merger with conditions, including offering unbundled broadband Internet access for $9.95 to families in cable franchise areas participating in the National School Lunch program. Comcast will offer $9.95 per month broadband Internet access to families in its cable franchise areas participating in the National School Lunch program. They will also assist qualifying families in purchasing user-ready computers for about $150. Other requirements include not prioritizing programming from its cable networks or NBCU's networks, licensing some programming to online video distributors, extending broadband service to 400,000 additional homes, and providing service to six more rural communities."
