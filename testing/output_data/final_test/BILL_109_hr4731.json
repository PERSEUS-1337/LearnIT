    "content": "The Act titled \"Eliminate Warehousing of Consumer Internet Data Act of 2006\" is referred to as the short title. Congress acknowledges the growing use of communication networks for personal and commercial purposes, highlighting the ease of gathering personal information through digital technology. Consumers are recognized to have a stake in their personal data, especially considering the intimate details that can be revealed through online activities. Certain information about Internet searches or website visits conducted from a particular computer can be obtained and stored by websites or search engines, and can be traced back to individual computer users. Fair information practices include providing consumers with knowledge of data collection, consumer notice of data practices, consumer choice to provide consent, access to collected data, safeguards for data integrity, and contact information. Companies should cease storing personal information that can identify individual consumers to safeguard privacy interests. Individual consumers should stop storing personal information once it is no longer needed for service or legitimate business practices. Cable operators are required to destroy personal information gathered from subscribers when no longer necessary, and a similar obligation should apply to internet websites that collect detailed information about users. Internet websites collect detailed information about computer users, which is more personalized than what cable operators typically gather. Internet websites must destroy data containing personal information when it is no longer needed for its intended purpose or any legitimate business reason, or if there are no pending requests for access to the information. Violations will be enforced by the Federal Trade Commission as unfair or deceptive acts under the Federal Trade Commission Act. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.
