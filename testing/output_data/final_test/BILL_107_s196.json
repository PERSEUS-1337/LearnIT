    "content": "The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new section on energy conservation expenditures, providing tax credits for such expenses. Tax credits are allowed for energy conservation expenditures made by individuals, with a maximum credit of $2,000 per dwelling unit. Energy conservation expenditures refer to expenses for qualified energy property meeting specified standards. Tax credits are allowed for energy conservation expenditures on qualified energy property installed in a dwelling unit in the United States and used as a residence. This includes labor costs for onsite preparation, assembly, or installation of the property. Qualified energy property includes items such as swimming pool and hot tub covers, ceiling insulation, weatherstripping, and water heater insulation blankets. Energy conservation tax credits are available for various qualified energy property installations in residential dwelling units, including water heater insulation blankets, low-flow showerheads, caulking, insulation of plenums and ducts, storm windows, thermal doors and windows, duty cyclers, clock thermostats, evaporative coolers, whole house fans, external shading devices, thermal energy storage devices, and controls for lighting. The certification process for qualified energy property involves manufacturers certifying the products and sellers or installers certifying the installation. Certifications must be in a form prescribed by the Secretary of Energy. The certification process for qualified energy property requires the taxpayer identification number of the person making the certification. Special rules apply for joint occupancy of a dwelling unit for tax credit purposes. The tax credit for qualified energy property expenditures allows individuals to claim a credit based on the ratio of their expenses to the total expenses of all individuals in a calendar year. Tenant-stockholders in cooperative housing corporations are treated as having made their proportionate share of expenses. Individuals who are members of a condominium management association are treated as having made their proportionate share of any expenditures of the association. The association must meet specific requirements related to condominium projects. Joint ownership of energy items for multiple dwelling units is allowed for energy conservation expenditures. The credit allowable is computed separately for each unit if the expenditure is made for 2 or more units. If less than 80 percent of an item is used for nonbusiness residential purposes, allocation rules apply. Expenditures for items used for nonbusiness residential purposes are only partially deductible. The timing of when an expenditure is considered made depends on the completion of the item's installation or the beginning of use in building construction. The taxpayer can elect to have the credit not apply for any taxable year. Rules similar to those in section 48(a) apply for this section. No double benefit is allowed for any expenditure eligible for this credit. Basis adjustments are made if a credit is allowed for any expenditure on property. The section applies to property placed in service after December 31, 2000. Conforming amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code. SEC. 35 and 36 relate to energy conservation expenditures and overpayments of tax. The amendments apply to taxable years ending after December 31, 2000. SEC. 2 provides financial assistance to retrofit schools for increased energy efficiency and conservation. The Secretary of Energy will establish the \"Elementary and Secondary School Energy Efficiency and Conservation Program\" to provide grants to local educational agencies for retrofitting schools to increase energy efficiency. Eligible agencies must submit an application containing required information. Grant funds can be used for energy-efficient heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and equipment to enhance school energy efficiency. The Secretary of Energy will prioritize grants for retrofitting elementary and secondary schools in low-income districts to increase energy efficiency. The Federal share of project costs funded by grants will not exceed 50%, but in cases of financial hardship, it may exceed this limit. $20,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2006 for this program. Electric utilities must disclose consumers' peak and nonpeak hour energy use and rates on billing statements. They should also provide information on reducing energy consumption during peak hours."
