    "content": "The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported H.R. 5427, the Energy and Water Appropriations bill for FY2007, with an increase of $66.1 million for DOE Energy Efficiency programs. The Committee recommended an increase of $211.7 million for EERE R&D and deployment programs, supporting the Advanced Energy Initiative. Notable increases were seen in Buildings and Clean Cities programs, while cuts were made to Weatherization, Fuel Cells, FEMP, Program Management, and Industry programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $105.8 million for the Environmental Protection Agency's Climate Protection programs. Energy efficiency programs in the Department of Agriculture and Department of State are also funded. Energy efficiency provisions in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and other bills of the 109th Congress are discussed. Energy efficiency involves technical changes in appliances, engines, or turbines to provide the same service using less energy. Improvements can be made in buildings through materials, components, and design, as well as in communities through architectural and transportation design. Energy efficiency contrasts with curtailment, which involves reducing output or services to save energy. Energy efficiency involves reducing energy use without sacrificing services or comfort. It is seen as a resource option that can lower energy prices by reducing demand. Policymaking for energy efficiency considers benefits against investment costs and is driven by concerns like high energy prices and security. Energy efficiency is driven by the potential benefits of avoiding environmental costs from energy supply facilities. Barriers include threats to energy supply companies' profitability and the complexity of consumer decision-making. Measuring energy savings is challenging as it involves consumption falling below projected levels. The scientific approach to measuring the impact of energy efficiency programs is evaluation research, which involves surveys of individuals benefiting from such programs. Evaluating impacts from R&D programs is more challenging than grant programs. The National Academy of Sciences conducted a study on energy users' decision-making behavior over 20 years ago. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) conducted a study on energy users' decision-making behavior, finding that only a fraction of economically justified investments in energy efficiency are made due to market barriers. NAS identified technical, market, and information barriers hindering consumer investment in cost-effective energy efficiency. The report highlighted the non-rational \"folk\" model of consumer energy decision-making as a factor leading to fewer energy-saving investments. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) study found that consumers' folk model of energy decision-making leads to fewer energy-saving investments than recommended by experts. Non-technical and non-economic factors, like car performance and styling, also influence energy use decisions. The report also discusses the \"rebound effect\" impacting energy efficiency levels. The \"rebound effect\" in energy efficiency can reduce measured savings below expectations. It can occur through direct, indirect, or market effects, leading to increased resource use. Studies show rebounds for automobiles and home water heating range from 10% to 40%. Despite losses in energy savings, gains in equipment service or comfort are often observed. From 1985 to 2005, national energy use increased by 20 Q, reaching a peak of 99.9 Q in 2005. DOE's 1995 report on Energy Conservation Trends revealed that energy efficiency and conservation efforts from 1973 to 1991 reduced the annual primary energy use growth trend by 18 Q, equivalent to an 18% decrease. This resulted in approximately $150 billion in annual savings for the U.S. economy. The report used economic modeling to analyze past energy savings trends, differentiate program savings from price-induced savings, and assess energy savings across various sectors. In 1995, EIA issued a report addressing difficulties in measuring energy efficiency, essential for promoting energy efficiency to manage energy resources. Defensible energy efficiency measures are crucial to avoid equating consumption changes with energy efficiency changes due to structural or behavioral effects. EIA developed an approach based on energy intensity to measure energy efficiency, noting the challenge of defining and measuring it accurately due to various factors like efficiency, weather, behavioral, and structural effects. It is difficult to separate these factors completely to obtain a pure measurement of energy efficiency. Energy efficiency is closely tied to energy use and demand, needing to be separated from other factors like structural, weather, and behavioral influences. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) suggested using energy intensity as a measurement indicator of energy efficiency, which is obtained from an equation linking energy consumption to energy intensity and total service provided. EIA faces challenges in measuring energy efficiency due to factors like lack of consistent data and difficulties in separating effects unrelated to energy efficiency. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) faces challenges in measuring energy efficiency due to lack of consistent data, difficulties in establishing demand indicators, and identifying structural and behavioral influences. Further work is needed to define energy efficiency and develop precise, valid, and reproducible energy-intensity indicators. EIA's report serves as a starting point for discussion to improve energy efficiency measures, with data access and processing barriers hindering the development of international comparative indicators. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) faces challenges in measuring energy efficiency due to lack of consistent data and difficulties in establishing demand indicators. EIA suggests different energy intensity indicators based on policy contexts, such as focusing on climate change or economic productivity. Energy intensity may be the best indicator of energy efficiency, although it may not fully represent true efficiency improvements. Energy intensity is the ratio of energy consumption to a demand indicator for energy services, such as passenger miles or vehicle miles in the transportation sector. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) identifies four approaches to developing energy intensity indicators, each with strengths and weaknesses. The choice between primary energy and site energy as the indicator of energy use can also impact the measurement of energy efficiency. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) distinguishes between primary energy and site energy for measuring energy use. Primary energy is preferred for aggregate indicators and environmental impact analysis, while site energy is sufficient for comparing end-use efficiency, like residential air conditioning. EIA suggests using cost expenditures from an economist's viewpoint. Congress established energy-saving programs from 1974 to 1992 primarily at the Department of Energy (DOE). Energy efficiency and conservation programs were established in response to national oil import security and economic stability concerns. States and utilities promoted energy efficiency as a cost-saving tool to avoid expensive powerplant construction. These programs are also aimed at mitigating environmental issues like air pollution and climate change. Energy efficiency is now seen as crucial for sustainable development and economic growth, with various agencies including DOE, EPA, AID, and GEF implementing related initiatives. The DOE energy efficiency program includes R&D funding, grants to state and local governments, and regulatory standards for energy efficient design in buildings. DOE spent about $12.4 billion in 2005 constant dollars for energy efficiency R&D from FY1978 to FY2005. Funding for energy efficiency R&D declined from $692 million in FY1980 to $223 million in FY1988, then increased to $652 million in FY2001. In FY2005, a total of $467 million was appropriated for various energy efficiency programs. From FY1948 to FY2005, the federal government spent $140.0 billion on energy R&D in 2005 constant dollars. This included $76.3 billion for nuclear, $35.2 billion for fossil, $13.4 billion for renewables, and $12.4 billion for energy efficiency. In FY2005, DOE's energy efficiency R&D funding totaled $595.9 million, renewable energy R&D received $380.3 million, fossil energy received $539.6 million, and fission and fusion were appropriated $784.1 million. A NAPA study in 2004 found improvement in EERE after a reorganization. The DOE invested significantly more in energy efficiency programs compared to RD&D over a 22-year period. A report recommended that the DOE adopt NRC's framework for evaluating project benefits. Shortcomings in achieving expected benefits were attributed to a lack of incentives for private sector adoption. The EERE received multiple awards for its R&D efforts. A 2004 RFF report estimated energy savings and emission reductions from non-transportation programs. The President's Management Agenda outlined the Bush Administration's goals. The President's Management Agenda set out the Bush Administration's framework for performance management, including human capital, competitive sourcing, financial performance, electronic government, and integration of budget with performance. The Government Performance and Results Act requires federal agencies to produce strategic plans linked to annual performance plans. The DOE Budget Request for FY2007 addresses energy efficiency under the goal of protecting national and economic security, with a focus on improving energy security through energy supply measures and efficiency improvements. The DOE's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) programs aim to achieve cost and performance goals in various sectors such as cars, buildings, and industrial technologies. These programs aim to reduce petroleum use, greenhouse gas emissions, and improve energy efficiency. The Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) supports federal agencies in achieving energy savings goals. President Bush issued the Administration's FY2007 budget request to support these initiatives. The FY2007 budget request seeks increased funding for energy efficiency R&D, including the Advanced Energy Initiative to reduce America's dependence on imported energy sources. The Hydrogen Fuel Initiative, funded under DOE's EERE programs, aims to bring hydrogen technology. The Hydrogen Fuel Initiative, part of the DOE's EERE programs, aims to bring hydrogen and fuel cell technology to the market by 2015. The FY2007 budget request includes increased funding for this initiative, reflecting concerns about legislative earmarks for R&D programs. The House Appropriations Committee report directs EERE to report on implementing recommendations to improve program management. The General's recommendations aim to improve the management of cooperative agreements and strengthen recruiting from Historically Black Colleges and Universities. A DOE-wide directive involves funding for the Asia Pacific Partnership to support clean, energy-efficient technologies. The Senate Appropriations Committee report includes policy directives for EERE, such as studying the impacts of plug-in hybrid vehicles on electricity supply and distribution networks. The FY2007 request for EPA's Climate Protection Programs is $104.3 million, focusing on voluntary energy efficiency activities. The House approved $111.2 million, and the Senate Appropriations Committee approved $105.8 million for EPA's programs covering areas like buildings, industry, transportation, and international efforts. The Department of Energy (DOE) implements energy efficiency programs through public-private partnerships, setting standards for consumer and commercial products. These efforts, including Energy Star Buildings and Transportation Partners, aim to promote energy-efficient practices and overcome market barriers. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) estimates that these standards will result in significant energy savings. The final law includes a section requiring DOE to report regularly to Congress on delays in implementing energy efficiency standards. DOE released a report identifying 19 products for which deadlines were missed, and listed 11 products for new efficiency standards. The DOE has issued standards for various products, including commercial refrigerators and small industrial electric motors. Federal efficiency goals aim to save energy, reduce costs, and transform markets for new equipment. A goal for a 20% energy reduction in federal facilities from 2006 to 2015 has been set, with a requirement for DOE to review results and recommend further goals. P.L. 109-58 calls for energy efficiency goals in congressional buildings and tax incentives for fuel switching and alternative fuels to reduce oil import dependence. P.L. 109-58 introduces new tax credits for energy efficiency in various sectors, including commercial property, home construction, appliances, and fuel cells. It also includes provisions for energy efficiency in public housing, funding for energy assistance programs, and grant programs for weatherization and state energy initiatives. Energy efficiency measures aim to reduce oil import dependence and the risk of shortages, contributing to energy security. Energy efficiency contributes to energy security by reducing oil import dependence, energy price shocks, and the risk of shortages. It also helps lower natural gas prices, reduce the need for LNG imports, and mitigate electricity demand issues. Demand-side management programs have been effective in promoting energy efficiency as a cost-effective alternative to new supply, with significant energy savings achieved in the past. California's 1994 proposal for electric industry restructuring led to a decrease in utility DSM spending and energy savings. Despite a drop in savings to 49 billion kwh by 1998, energy efficiency in the electricity sector gradually increased to 55 billion kwh by 2004. The 2001 electricity problems in California raised questions about the need for a federal role in promoting demand-side energy efficiency. A 2002 report by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory highlighted the benefits of conservation and efficiency measures in reducing peak demand and avoiding potential losses. The 2003 electric power blackout reignited interest in energy management measures. The power blackout in 2003 reignited interest in energy efficiency, demand response, and distributed power. A National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency was issued in late July 2006, calling for a major effort to improve energy efficiency in the electric power industry. The National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency, issued in 2006, aims to defer the need for new power plants, reduce greenhouse gases, lower air pollution control costs, and decrease natural gas prices. It focuses on addressing barriers to energy efficiency investment in homes, buildings, and industries through five key recommendations. The National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency, issued in 2006, aims to promote energy efficiency by addressing barriers and promoting funding for cost-effective programs. One key recommendation is to align utility incentives with energy efficiency delivery and modify ratemaking practices to encourage investments. This recommendation is crucial as it addresses the economic barrier faced by energy efficiency initiatives in the past. The National Petroleum Council (NPC) report, \"Balancing Natural Gas Policy,\" predicts gas prices to remain high at $5 to $7 per thousand cubic feet. The report emphasizes energy conservation and efficiency as key solutions, recommending updates to building codes, promoting Energy Star equipment, using efficient power plants, and implementing smart controls. The Alliance to Save Energy and ACEEE support these recommendations but also advocate for additional measures like tax incentives, utility standards, federal building improvements, and regulations to make energy conservation profitable for utilities. The 2005 ACEEE report suggests that a significant energy efficiency effort could reduce gas use by 1% and lower prices by 37%. Energy efficiency measures could help address issues such as high gasoline prices, oil import dependence, and environmental concerns. The regulation of automobile fuel efficiency, specifically the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program, has been a controversial aspect of energy efficiency policy. Critics argue that recent CAFE increases for light trucks are insufficient in addressing concerns about high gasoline prices, air pollution, and CO2 emissions. Proponents, on the other hand, believe that larger CAFE increases could compromise safety and create hardships for manufacturers. The CAFE standard for new cars has remained at 27.5 mpg since 1986. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued new light truck standards for model years 2005 to 2010, gradually increasing fuel efficiency requirements. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires the EPA to revise adjustment factors for fuel efficiency. The overall fleet fuel economy has been gradually increasing, with cars peaking at 22.4 mpg in 2004 and light trucks experiencing variability. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-58, \u00a7774) mandates EPA to update fuel economy labels for accuracy. The Senate's H.R. 6 aimed to save 1 million barrels of oil daily by 2010 but didn't pass. A 2003 CBO report suggested a 46-cent gas tax increase could reduce fuel use by 10% at a lower cost than raising CAFE standards. Short-term measures like public transit, carpooling, and telecommuting can also cut oil use in transportation. Home improvement measures like insulation, energy-efficient windows, and weatherization can reduce home heating oil use. Energy efficiency is crucial for reducing carbon emissions and combating climate change. Federal efforts to increase energy efficiency may face challenges related to program funding, tax incentives, and equipment efficiency standards. DOE's 2000 report projected that advanced energy efficiency measures could limit U.S. carbon emissions growth by 2020. The report projects a baseline of 1,346 MMTC of carbon emissions in 1990, increasing to 1,922 MMTC in a 2020 \"business-as-usual\" scenario. By increasing federal R&D spending on energy efficiency and clean energy, emissions could be constrained to about 1,735 MMTC in a Moderate Scenario. An Advanced Scenario with doubled R&D spending, carbon trading, and sector-specific policies could yield 2020 emissions levels similar to 1990. Both scenarios show energy cost savings, reduced air pollution, and improved energy security. The report highlighted adverse impacts on the coal industry and estimated a GDP reduction ranging from $4 billion to $66 billion by 2010. The EIA's Annual Energy Outlook 2006 projects 2020 emissions to be 1,942 MMTC, 42% higher than in 1990. U.S. policy towards global climate change shifted from \"study only\" to \"study and action\" after ratifying the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992. The National Academy of Sciences recommended reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 10-40% of 1990 levels through energy conservation and efficiency measures. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT92) focused on increasing energy conservation and efficiency in response to the FCCC. It included provisions to extend energy efficiency standards, promote energy-saving information dissemination, expand research and development programs for energy efficiency technologies, and authorize the evaluation of cost-effective technologies by the Department of Energy (DOE). The George H.W. Bush Administration issued the first U.S. climate action plan in December 1992, calling for an inventory of emissions and identifying programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The George H.W. Bush Administration's strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions focused on research initiatives proposed in the 1991 National Energy Strategy and EPA's pollution prevention initiatives. This approach was in line with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's guidance and formed the core of the \"No Regrets\" policy, which prioritized actions like energy efficiency and conservation measures to meet CO2 emission reduction goals at little or no cost. The United States aimed to reduce CO2 emissions at little or no cost during the George H.W. Bush and Clinton Administrations through initiatives like the \"No Regrets\" policy and Climate Action Plans. The Bush Administration's Climate Action Report 2002 emphasized reducing greenhouse gas intensity without hindering economic growth, aligning with previous policies. The Bush Administration's Climate Action Report 2002 aimed to reduce greenhouse gas intensity by 18% over 10 years through voluntary and incentive-based measures, as an alternative to the Kyoto Protocol. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 included provisions to extend energy efficiency standards programs. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 included new standards for equipment, tax incentives, and R&D program reauthorizations. The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy estimates significant energy savings and emission reductions by 2020. The United States, as a member of the G8, supports energy efficiency to address greenhouse gas emissions. At the July 2006 Summit, G8 leaders agreed to accelerate the development and deployment of clean energy technologies to tackle climate change, air pollution, and energy security. The Saint Petersburg Plan of Action on Global Energy Security outlines goals such as enhancing energy efficiency and addressing climate change. It emphasizes reducing stress on energy infrastructure and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions through sharing best practices, financial incentives, and governmental leadership. The focus is on reducing losses in transportation and energy production. The Plan focuses on reducing losses in transportation and energy production sectors, promoting energy efficiency in vehicles, biofuels, fuel cells, and air transportation. The U.S. Climate Change Technology Program supports energy efficiency goals, with federal programs like DOE's contributing to over 80 technologies for advancing technology. The report outlines President Bush's initiatives for technology development and R&D goals, without estimating emissions saving potentials. Funding of $100 million was allocated for energy conservation and clean energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $180 million for energy efficiency and clean energy deployment activities in developing countries. In January 2006, the Bush Administration announced its commitment to support the Asia Pacific Partnership (APP) for Clean Development and Climate to accelerate deployment of clean, energy efficient technologies. The House and Senate appropriations committees declined to provide funding for APP in the FY2007 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill (H.R. 5427) due to lack of justification in the DOE budget request. However, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $26 million for APP in the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Bill, 2007. The California Air Resources Board approved rules in 2004 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cars by 22% by 2012, leading to a legal challenge by the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. In response to the California Air Resources Board's rules to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cars, a legal challenge was filed by the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. Various states and countries have also implemented regulations and agreements to reduce CO2 emissions and increase energy efficiency. Over 260 bills related to energy efficiency and renewable energy have been introduced in the 109th Congress. The curr_chunk discusses recent actions on bills related to agriculture, rural development, and environmental appropriations for the year 2007. H.R. 5384 focuses on funding for the USDA Renewable Energy Program, with differing amounts approved by the House and Senate. H.R. 5386 addresses funding for the EPA, with the House Committee recommending zero funding. The House Committee recommended zero funding for the EPA Asia Pacific Partnership and $109.4 million for the EPA Climate Protection Program. Amendments were made to add funding to the Energy Star Program and prohibit the use of appropriations in contravention of energy efficiency requirements. The Senate Committee recommended $105.8 million in funding for the EPA. H.R. 5427 provides funding for the DOE Energy Efficiency Program. House and Senate actions are detailed in Table 3. The Senate Committee on Appropriations ordered the reported H.R. 5522 (Kolbe) Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Bill, 2007 on May 24. The bill includes support for renewable energy in developing countries through various programs, such as Energy, Biodiversity, and the Environment, and the U.S. Agency for International Development partnership with DOE for the hydropower Clean Energy Technology Exports Initiative. The H.R. 5522 Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Bill, 2007 includes funding for Energy, Biodiversity, and Other Environment programs in various regions. This includes $160 million for Africa, East Asia/Pacific, Near East, South Asia, and Western Hemisphere. Additionally, $26 million is allocated for the Asia Pacific Partnership to promote clean energy export and market development initiatives. The bill also authorizes energy efficiency and conservation programs, as well as new efficiency standards for commercial and consumer products. The H.R. 2361 Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, 2006 sets new energy efficiency goals for federal facilities and fleets, expands Energy Star products program, and includes funding for EPA's Climate Protection Program. It does not include Senate-proposed provisions for oil conservation and broader equipment efficiency standards. Signed into law on August 8, 2005. Four other public laws make appropriations for energy efficiency programs, including grants and loans at the Department of Agriculture, climate change programs in developing countries, DOE energy efficiency programs, and telecommuting opportunities for federal agencies. Failure to certify telecommuting opportunities could result in agencies forfeiting $5 million. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 amended funding limits for renewable energy projects at USDA and terminated funding for the Value-Added Producer Program. The Transportation Equity Act included sections on energy efficiency and conservation measures. The nonmotorized transportation pilot program, congestion relief initiatives, bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure, metropolitan transportation planning, national research programs, fuel cell bus technology, intelligent transportation systems, high-speed rail study.
