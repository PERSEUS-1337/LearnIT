The Bureau of Prisons estimated that 27% of federal inmates were non-citizens at the end of FY1997. Despite increased funding, INS lacked detention capacity to comply with statutory mandates. Congress provided INS with an $80 million emergency appropriation in FY1999 to meet detention mandates. Both House and Senate appropriators criticized INS for not requesting sufficient funding. The Administration proposed removing eligibility restrictions under Section 245(i) of the INA in its FY2000 budget submission. The FY2000 budget proposal included a plan to increase funding for criminal alien detention by removing eligibility restrictions under Section 245(i) of the INA. Despite increased funding, INS struggled to process immigration and naturalization applications, with a total pending caseload of over 4 million at the end of FY1999. Senate report language earmarked additional funds to address the backlog, including $96 million from DOJ's Working Capital Fund. The FY2000 budget included a transfer of nearly $50 million from the examinations fee account to the Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR). The conference agreement provided $124 million to fund INS's naturalization backlog reduction efforts. INS's restructuring split funding into two accounts: Enforcement and Border Affairs, and Citizenship and Benefits, Immigration Support, and Program Direction. The House Judiciary's Immigration and Claims Subcommittee approved a bill to dismantle INS by creating separate service and enforcement bureaus within the Department of Justice. The bill also proposed establishing an Office of the Associate Attorney General for Immigration Affairs to oversee these bureaus and the Executive Office for Immigration Review. The Subcommittee defeated an amendment to H.R. 2528 similar to a restructuring proposal. The Senate Judiciary's Immigration Subcommittee held a hearing on INS restructuring proposal (S. 1563) with no further action. The DOJ submitted its 5-year strategic plan to Congress in September 1997. The DOJ submitted its Strategic Plan for 1997-2002 to Congress in September 1997, with the Senate Appropriations Committee commending the Assistant Attorney General for Administration for preparing DOJ's FY1999 performance plan. The committee found the strength of the performance plan in its clear strategies for meeting performance goals and urged DOJ to follow GAO recommendations for fiscal year 2000. The DOJ FY2000 Summary Performance Plan outlines the Department of Justice's goals for FY2000, aligning with long-term strategic goals and budget requests. The DOJ's FY2000 Summary Performance Plan outlines goals for seven core functional areas, including investigation and prosecution of criminal offenses, immigration, detention and incarceration, and protection of the federal judiciary. Specific goals include removing violent criminals from the streets, reducing violent crime on Indian reservations, and improving the nation's capability to prevent terrorist acts within the United States. The DOJ aims to combat gang activity, prevent terrorist acts, respond to cyber-attacks, reduce prison overcrowding, dismantle drug trafficking operations, enforce civil rights laws, and protect U.S. borders. The Senate Committee requested DOJ's experiences resulting from GPRA by July 1, 1999. GAO found that DOJ's performance plan for FY2000 establishes clear relationships between goals and measures. In FY2000, GAO found that the DOJ's performance plan establishes clear relationships between goals and measures, quantifiable goals, and strategies to protect performance data credibility. However, the plan lacks identification of mutually reinforcing goals among DOJ components and complimentary performance indicators. President's FY2000 budget request included a significant increase in funding for the Department of Commerce and related agencies. H.R. 1141 repealed the funding cutoff for FY1999 appropriations, including additional funding for the 2000 census. H.R. 1141 included an additional $44.9 million for the 2000 census in FY1999, with a revised submission requesting an extra $1.7 billion for the census in FY2000. The Census Bureau would receive the majority of the increased appropriation for FY2000, totaling $3.4 billion. Other agencies like NOAA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology would also see noticeable funding increases. The Senate approved $7.2 billion for the Department (S. 1217), which is about $1.9 billion below the amount requested by the Administration for FY2000. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $8.0 billion, about $1 billion below the President's request. The House-passed bill approved $8.6 million for the Department of Commerce, which is $3.5 million above the FY1999 appropriation and $370 million below the Administration's request. Key funding issues included streamlining department programs, funding for the Bureau of the Census for the Year 2000 census, and federal support for industrial technology development programs at NIST. The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) would implement new Presidential initiatives to protect the environment and foster research in the 21st century. The President's FY2000 budget request for the Department of Commerce included $57.5 million for General Administration, with $23.4 million allocated for the Inspector General's office. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $51.9 million, while the House Appropriations Committee recommended $52 million for the Department. The Committee recommended $52 million, including $22 million for the Office of Inspector General, which was $4.1 million higher than the Senate-approved level. Congress approved $51.5 million, $500 thousand above the FY1999 appropriation. The President requested $55.1 million for Economic and Statistical Analysis programs, $6.6 million above FY1999. The Senate essentially approved the President's request. The House recommended $48.5 million, same as FY1999, and Congress approved $49.5 million, $1 million above FY1999. The President requested $4.8 billion for the Bureau of the Census for FY2000, $3.4 billion higher than the previous year. The Senate approved $3.1 billion, $1.7 billion below the President's request. The House and Congress approved $4.7 billion. The additional $1.7 billion for the decennial census was not approved. During the FY1998 CJS Appropriations debate, Congress discussed the Census Bureau's plan to use new sample survey results in the 2000 decennial census. Proponents argued that sampling would lower costs and improve accuracy, while opponents raised concerns about legality, feasibility, and method flaws. The appropriations bill granted $390 million for the census, including $27 million for a contingency plan if sampling was not used. The Congress allocated funds for the Census Bureau to develop a contingency plan for the 2000 decennial census, including $4 million for modifications to the dress rehearsal and $4 million transferred to the Census Monitoring Board. Section 209 of P.L. 105-119 allowed individuals to challenge the use of statistical methods in court. Additionally, a bipartisan Census Monitoring Board was established to oversee the census process. The bipartisan Census Monitoring Board was established to observe and monitor all aspects of the 2000 census preparation and implementation. A $4 million appropriation was authorized for each fiscal year from FY1998 to FY2001. The Bureau's FY1999 funding for Census 2000 activities was $1.027 billion, exceeding the House-passed and Senate-passed amounts. The Omnibus legislation funded CJS agencies until June 15, 1999, with additional funding contingent on another appropriations measure. H.R. 1141 repealed this restriction and provided $2.8 billion for 2000 census activities in FY2000. Congress expressed concern about the Bureau's delay in submitting a revised budget. H.R. 1141 provided $44.9 million for census preparations in FY1999. The Senate approved $2.8 billion for the census in FY2000. The House approved $4.5 billion for the 2000 Census. Congress also approved $311.5 million for the International Trade Administration for FY2000. The Congress approved $311.3 million for FY2000, an increase of $22.2 million over the FY1999 appropriation. They also approved $54.0 million for the Bureau of Export Administration, $1.7 million more than FY1999 but $6.5 million less than the Administration's request. The Congress approved $311.3 million for FY2000, an increase of $22.2 million over the previous year. The Senate and House approved funding for the Minority Business Development Agency, with the Senate matching the President's request of $27.6 million and the House approving $27 million. The Congress approved $27.3 million for the Economic Development Administration (EDA) in FY2000, slightly below the President's request. EDA's funding has been fluctuating in recent years, with the agency facing reductions and restorations in funding levels. The President's FY2000 budget proposal requested $393 million for EDA, with specific allocations for Economic Development Assistance Programs and Salaries and Expenses. The Congress approved $27.3 million for the Economic Development Administration (EDA) in FY2000. The full Senate approved $203.4 million for EDAP and $24.9 million for S&E, while the House approved $364.4 million for EDAP and $24 million for S&E. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 provides EDA with $362 million for EDAP and $26.5 million for S&E. Funding for the agency's Economic Development Assistance Programs was reduced by $6.5 million compared to FY1999 levels. The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) is funded by user fees. In FY1999, total funding was $785 million, with $643 million from fee collections, $102 million from a fee increase, and $40 million from unobligated funds. However, $71 million was rescinded and returned to the Treasury. For FY2000, the President requested a budget authority of $922 million, including an estimated $966 million in fees. The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) funding for FY2000 included $160 million not to be spent until FY2001, with the Senate approving a budget authority of $902 million and the House mandating $852 million. No fee increase for health and life insurance benefits was included in the final legislation. The final legislation for FY2000 gives the PTO budget authority to spend $871 million, an 11% increase over FY1999. The budget includes funding for various offices at NOAA and does not include a fee increase for health and life insurance benefits. The NOAA budget request for FY2000 includes Procurement, Acquisition, and Construction (PAC), Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund, Coastal Zone Management Fund, and strategic goals for various services. This is in line with the Government Performance and Results Act of 1994. For more information on NOAA, refer to CRS Report RL30139(pdf). Congress passed H.R. 3421 on November 18, 1999. Congress passed H.R. 3421, The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2000, providing $2.34 billion for NOAA for FY2000. The bill allocated $1.69 billion for Operations, Research Facilities, $596 million for Procurement, Acquisitions and Construction, and $59.5 million for other NOAA accounts. Funding for Executive Programs and Administration was capped at $31.4 million. NOAA must report on new space requirements for employees in the Gulf of Mexico by March 1, 2000. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2000 allocated $2.34 billion for NOAA for FY2000. Congress did not approve a $3.4 million recission of FY1999 emergency appropriations for NOAA. Appropriations for line offices included NOS-$279 million, NMFS-$422 million, and OAR-$301 million with specific increases for various programs. H.R. 3194 allocated funding for NOAA in FY2000, with increases for various programs such as National Estuarine Research Reserve System construction and National Marine Sanctuaries construction. Congress approved $2.30 billion in total funding for NOAA, which was 8.4% below the requested amount. In FY2000, Congress approved $2.30 billion in total funding for NOAA, which was 8.4% below the President's request and 5.7% below FY1999 appropriations. The funding breakdown for NOAA line offices in H.R. 2670 was as follows: NOS-$267.4 million; NMFS-$403.7 million; OAR-$300 million; NWS-$603.9 million; NESDIS-$111.1 million; PS-$62.6 million; FPM-$13.2 million; FAC-$11.2 million; PCSR-$50 million. Additional BA for NOAA included $36 million in previous year deobligations. Non-ORF accounts included PAC-$589.1 million; PCSR fund-$50 million; CZMA-$4 million (transfer) and $3.2 million for other fishery funds. The committee approved various fund transfers and rescissions totaling $68 million for ORF and other fishery funds. They did not authorize $34 million in new fee collections but approved $445 million for NWS activities, including $16 million for AWIPS build 5.0. Funding for system acquisitions decreased due to the completion of weather modernization systems deployment. Additionally, the committee did not approve the transfer of GRERL from OAR to NOS, but allocated an extra $5.2 million for NOS research. The committee approved additional funding for NOS research on pfisteria, hypoxia, and harmful algal blooms, while funding for GLOBE was only half of what was requested. Sea Grant and undersea research programs received higher funding levels than requested by the President. Weather research saw a 2% increase over the President's request, and NMFS received large increases for information collection and analysis. NESDIS received increases for satellite systems acquisition, while Program Support saw an overall decrease in funding below FY1999 levels. The committee report retained directives for NOAA to provide details on a new budget structure reflecting administrative expenditures. The House passed H.R. 2670 on August 6, 1999, approving amounts proposed by the House Appropriations Committee for NOAA for FY2000. The bill required a new budget structure reflecting administrative expenditures, an operating plan for expenditure of FY2000 appropriations, and a modernization plan for fisheries research vessels. Additionally, appropriations for retired NOAA CORPS officers were scored as mandatory spending. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $1.96 billion for NOAA in new budget authority for FY2000, which is $5.9 billion less than the President's request. The Senate approved $2.6 billion in funding for NOAA, with ORF receiving $1.78 billion. Total BA approved for NOAA for FY2000 is about $103 million below FY1999 funding levels. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved funding for various fisheries programs, including $671 million for PAC, $100 million for Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery, and $7.1 million for U.S. fisheries. Rescissions were made for NOAA, including $1.2 million from the Fisheries Promotional Fund and $3.4 million from ORF. The Senate bill included language prohibiting repair and maintenance of NOAA vessels outside the U.S. The President requested $2.5 billion for NOAA in FY2000, a 10% increase from FY1999. In FY2000, $2.5 billion was allocated for NOAA, a 10% increase from FY1999. $1.7 billion was for ORF, $631 million for PAC, and $100 million for Pacific NW Coastal Salmon Habitats Restoration. Nearly $600 million was requested for federal R&D. The budget included funding for new initiatives like Ocean 2000, Natural Disaster Reduction, and Climate in the 21st Century. Additionally, $34 million in new fisheries and charting fees were requested. The Administration requested $34 million in new fisheries and charting fees. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) received $641.2 million for FY1999, with funding for Scientific and Technical Research and Services, Industrial Technology Services, and construction. Funding for the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) increased by 3% from the previous year. The Advanced Technology Program (ATP) received a 3% increase in funding for FY1999, providing seed financing for businesses to develop generic technologies. Opponents criticize ATP as \"corporate welfare,\" while the Administration defends it as crucial for industrial competitiveness. The Senate proposed a 15% funding increase for ATP in FY2000, but the House passed a bill with no appropriation for the program. The House bill for FY2000 did not initially include funding for the Advanced Technology Program (ATP), questioning its necessity. However, the program was eventually funded at $142.6 million, a 28% decrease from the previous year. The President's budget requested $737 million for NIST, with proposed changes in support for ATP and construction projects. Scientific and Technical Research and Services would receive $289.6 million, while ITS would be funded at $338.5 million, including $238.7 million for ATP and $99.8 million for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership. Construction funding would increase by 88% to $106.8 million for facility improvements. The Senate approved FY2000 appropriations of $742 million for NIST, with $288 million for STRS and $336.3 million for ITS. This included $226.5 million for the Advanced Technology Program and $109.8 million for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership. Construction funding would more than double to $117.5 million. However, the House funded NIST at $436.6 million, a decrease of 32% from the previous year, with no support for the Advanced Technology Program. The final version of the bill as enacted into law provides $639 million in FY2000 appropriations for NIST, with $283 million for STRS, $247.4 million for ITS (including $142.6 million for ATP and $104.8 million for MEP), and $108.4 million for construction. This funding is fundamentally the same as the previous year but 13% below the President's request. The Office of the Undersecretary for Technology and the Office of Technology Policy (OTP) received $9.5 million in funding from the FY1999 Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, an increase of almost 12% over the previous year. The increase was mainly for the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Technology (EPSCoT) to strengthen technological infrastructure in states under-represented in federal R&D funding. The President requested $9 million for the Office in FY2000, a 5% decrease due to the cessation of funding for the EPSCoT program. The Senate and House bills proposed $8 million for OTP in FY2000, 16% less than the previous year. NTIA manages communications policy, awards grants, and requested a budget of $72.3 million for FY2000. The Clinton Administration has requested a budget increase for NTIA in FY2000, including $35 million for public broadcast facilities and $17.2 million for salaries and expenses, to support the conversion of U.S. broadcast technology to digital. The Administration has recommended a $17.2 million budget for FY2000, a 65% increase over FY1999. The IIAP has requested $20.1 million for FY2000, an 11% increase over FY1999. The overall NTIA budget for FY2000 is $52.9 million, with allocations for public broadcasting facilities, salaries and expenses, and the IIAP. The Government Performance and Results Act requires agencies to develop strategic plans with goals and performance measures. The Department of Commerce's strategic plan focuses on building for the future and promoting U.S. interests. The Department of Commerce's strategic plan focuses on three themes: promoting U.S. competitiveness, advancing science and technology, and managing resources effectively to ensure economic opportunity. The plan emphasizes building relationships among bureaus and partnerships with other agencies for overall effectiveness. The Commerce Strategic Plan aims to strengthen relationships with external partners for success in the changing technological world and global economy. Legislative proposals have been considered for the abolition of the Department of Commerce, arguing it is unwieldy. The Clinton Administration strongly opposes abolishing the Commerce Department, arguing that it benefits the American people by promoting economic growth, increasing international competitiveness, and advancing U.S. technology. Despite some congressional interest in reorganizing or downsizing the Department, a bill for its abolition introduced in the 104th Congress did not pass. The Department of Commerce abolition bill (H.R. 2667) was introduced in 1997 by Representatives Royce and Kasich, with a similar version (S. 1316) introduced in the Senate by Senator Abraham. No further action was taken on the issue. In 1999, a similar bill (H.R. 2452) was introduced by Representative Royce but no further action was taken in the House. No similar legislation was introduced in the Senate. In FY2000, Congress approved $3.96 billion in total budget authority for the Judiciary, an 8.4% increase over the previous year. The approved amount exceeded the total funding approved by the House and Senate, including adjustments for lower court operations, Defender Services, federal judges' salaries, and funding for the Supreme Court's building. In FY2000, Congress approved a significant increase in funding for the Judiciary, including higher salaries for federal judges and authorization for nine new Article III judgeships. Chief Justice Rehnquist and the Judicial Conference's Budget Committee warned of the serious impact of lower funding levels approved by the House and Senate on the Judiciary's ability to provide services. The largest disparity in funding was seen in the Salaries and Expenses account for the Courts of Appeals, District Courts, and Other Judicial Services. The funding for the Judiciary in FY2000 saw a significant increase, including higher salaries for federal judges and authorization for new judgeships. The largest disparity in funding was in the Salaries and Expenses account for the Courts of Appeals, District Courts, and Other Judicial Services, with the Senate approving $2.99 billion, a 4.5% increase over the previous year. The Judiciary had requested $3.25 billion, citing the need to maintain essential court operations and services. The Judiciary's FY2000 budget submission included facilities and expenses, representing 21% of the budget. Efforts were made to control GSA rental growth, but rental payments continued to consume a larger portion of court funds. The committee recommended a downward adjustment in court staff requests, which the Judiciary protested, citing a $211 million funding shortfall that could lead to an 11% reduction in court support staff. This could severely curtail court operations and services. The House approved $3.09 billion for Salaries and Expenses, which was below the Judiciary's request but sufficient to avoid personnel actions and allow for hiring. The Judiciary historically finds additional resources throughout the year to fund critical operations, alleviating any shortfall. The House's proposed funding level was seen as less negative than the Senate's by the Judiciary. Chief Justice Rehnquist criticized both the Senate and House FY2000 appropriations bills for underfunding the Judiciary, leading to potential furloughs and adverse impacts on court operations. The Senate bill would provide $280 million less than needed, while the House bill would provide $180 million less. The Senate Appropriations Committee requested a study on adjusting the ratio of magistrate judges to U.S. district judges to address workload increases in lower courts, particularly in handling immigration proceedings. Congress approved $3.1 billion for Salaries and Expenses, a 10.0% increase over FY1999. The Judiciary requested $411.4 million for Defender Services in FY2000, a 5.0% increase over the previous year's budget. Congressional appropriators had concerns about rising Defender Services costs, particularly in capital cases, and directed the Judiciary to review these costs and report findings to Congress by September 30, 1999. The FY2000 budget for Defender Services was approved at $385.1 million, which was a 1.8% reduction from the requested amount of $411.4 million. Congress included funding for a $5 increase in hourly compensation for Criminal Justice Act panel attorneys, instead of the $10 increase proposed by the Senate. The Judiciary expressed concerns that the FY2000 funding approved for Defender Services would be insufficient to pay panel attorneys at a higher rate, potentially leading to delays in trials and violations of Sixth Amendment rights. Congress ultimately approved $31.2 million more for Defender Services than the Senate had proposed. In response to the Judiciary's request, Congress authorized a 3.4% cost-of-living increase in judges' salaries for FY2000, appropriating $9.6 million for this purpose. The requested salary increase was agreed to by the Senate but not by the House in their respective CJS bills; House-Senate conferees then approved the Senate's recommendation, making the upward pay adjustment for judges effective January 2000. In FY1999, Congress declined to include a pay adjustment for judges despite a request from the Judiciary. Chief Justice Rehnquist criticized Congress for denying judges a pay raise, calling it regressive. However, Congress approved a $8.0 million increase in funding for the Supreme Court's building and grounds for FY2000. This amount was $2.6 million higher than the previous year but fell short of the Judiciary's initial request. The House-Senate conferees approved $8.0 million for the Supreme Court's building and grounds in FY2000, citing the Architect of the Capitol's estimate. The Senate had initially approved $9.7 million, including funds for building improvements and perimeter security enhancements. The House approved $6.9 million, much less than the Senate and below the Judiciary's initial request. The Senate Appropriations Committee rejected $3.5 million for off-site design and construction, requesting a space utilization study instead. In FY2000, Congress approved a $8.0 million budget for the Supreme Court's building and grounds, a decrease from the original request. Additionally, a significant increase in funding was allocated for Court Security, with $193.0 million appropriated for FY2000, a 10.6% increase over the previous year. The Senate had initially proposed $196.0 million for Court Security, reflecting a refined estimate by the U.S. Marshals Service. The Judiciary expressed dissatisfaction with the Senate's approved amount for court security funding in FY2000, as nearly $10 million in planned security enhancements could not be funded, leading to increased threats. The House approved $190.0 million, while the final approved amount was $193.0 million, which included adjustments to base, program increases for security officers, perimeter security, and additional security equipment. Congress approved decreased FY2000 funding of $8.5 million for the United States Sentencing Commission, a 10.4% decrease from FY1999. The Senate recommended $4.7 million, a 50.0% decrease, while the Judiciary requested $10.6 million. The Senate ultimately approved $9.7 million and the House approved $8.5 million, noting vacancies in the Commission. The Judiciary recommended reassessing the need for the Commission due to vacancies. Nominees were confirmed in November 1999. Budget cuts were a concern, impacting the agency's recovery and potentially leading to layoffs. Funding needs for the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts were also discussed. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts oversees administrative matters of lower federal courts, including probation and bankruptcy systems. Congress approved $55.0 million for the AO, slightly higher than the Judiciary's request of $58.4 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $56.1 million, stating it provided most requested base adjustments. The Judiciary argued that the approved funding level would hinder efficiency efforts and base services. Congress approved a provision for nine new U.S. district judgeships, the first authorized since 1990. This provision was added to Judiciary's FY2000 appropriations legislation and enacted into law. The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) requires agencies to develop strategic plans with goals and performance measures. The FY2000 budget for the Department of State and international broadcasting was set at $6.3 billion after reorganization of foreign policy agencies in FY1999. In FY1999, the U.S. Information Agency and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency were abolished and merged into the Department of State. The FY2000 State Department appropriation included funds for ACDA and USIA. Congress appropriated $5.5 billion for the Department of State and $421.8 million for international broadcasting, without breaking out funding for ACDA and USIA functions. The FY2000 State Department request also included funds for increased overseas security measures. The Administration requested funds for increased overseas security measures following the 1998 terrorist attacks on U.S. embassies in Africa. Congress allocated $1.56 billion for embassy security in FY1999. For FY2000, the Administration requested $568 million for worldwide security upgrades and an advance appropriation of $3.6 billion for FY2001 - FY2005. The Senate passed $583.5 million for overseas security in FY2000, while the House passed $568 million for security upgrades. The final appropriation for overseas security upgrades in FY2000 was set at $568 million by Congress and the President. The President's FY2000 request for State's administration of foreign affairs was $4,094.8 million, including $568 million for worldwide security upgrades. The Senate agreed to $3,714.6 million for administration of foreign affairs, $583.5 million for security and maintenance of overseas buildings, and $26.5 million for the inspector general. The House recommended $3,889.9 million for the administration of foreign affairs account, above the Senate level but below the Administration request. The final appropriation included $4.0 billion for administration of foreign affairs, with $742 million for security and maintenance. The capital investment fund request for FY2000 was $90 million, $47.9 million below the FY1999 level. The Senate agreed to reduce the fund to $50 million to reinstate money for the National Endowment for Democracy. The final bill set $80 million for the capital investment fund, maintaining the FY2000 level. The United States contributes to the United Nations through voluntary payments and assessed contributions. Funding for U.N. peacekeeping missions has decreased in recent years, with FY1999 appropriations at $922 million for contributions to international organizations and $231 million for international peacekeeping. The Administration requested funds for U.N. arrearage payments, but Congress did not provide authority for expenditure. The FY2000 budget included $963.3 million for CIO and $235 million for international peacekeeping. The Senate passed $943.3 million for CIO, $107 million for U.N. arrearage payments, and $280.9 million for peacekeeping. The House passed $842 million for CIO, $200 million for peacekeeping, and $351 million for arrearage payments. Congress approved a total of $1,436.2 million, with $885 million for CIO, $200 million for peacekeeping, and $351 million for U.S. arrearages to the U.N. The President vetoed the FY2000 CJS appropriation bill due to the amount approved for arrearages. The FY2000 CJS appropriation bill provided $885.2 million for CIO, $500 million for peacekeeping, and $351 million for U.S. arrearage payments to the U.N. Education and cultural exchange programs funded within USIA include programs such as Fulbright, Muskie, and Humphrey academic exchanges. Funding for government exchange programs has declined 14% since FY1995. The Senate set FY2000 funding for this account at $216.5 million, while the House passed a significantly lower level of $175 million. In FY2000, Congress and the Administration agreed on $205 million for education and cultural affairs, with no specified amount for the Fulbright exchange program. USIA's international broadcasting operations include Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Cuba Broadcasting, Radio Free Asia, Radio Free Iraq, and Radio Free Iran. In FY1999, Congress approved $384.5 million for international broadcasting, with $22.1 million for Cuba Broadcasting and $13.2 million for radio construction. After integration into the Department of State, the BBG became an independent agency with a requested budget of $431.7 million for international broadcasting. The Administration requested $431.7 million for international broadcasting and $20.9 million for capital improvements for FY2000. The Senate approved $386.1 million for broadcasting and $13.2 million for capital improvements. The House approved $410.4 million for international broadcasting activities and $11.3 million for capital improvements. ACDA's FY1999 level is $1.2 million below FY1998. ACDA became integrated into the State Department in April 1999. The Administration requested $47.7 million for State's ACDA-related activities in FY2000. Congress did not set a budget level for ACDA as it is within State's Administration of Foreign Affairs account. The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) was enacted in 1993. The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) enacted in 1993 required agencies to develop strategic plans with goals, objectives, and performance measures.

There are ongoing debates over funding adequacy and the appropriateness of certain activities for federally funded legal aid attorneys. Congress traditionally includes provisions in annual appropriations laws restricting LSC-funded activities. The Administration has requested $340 million for LSC every year since FY1997 to partially restore funding cutbacks.

The EEOC funding was initially frozen at the FY1999 level, hindering progress in reducing discrimination case backlogs. Congress later raised the EEOC appropriation to $282 million. The Commission on Civil Rights received $8.9 million for FY1999, with a proposed increase to $11 million for FY2000. The Senate and House Committees recommended and approved $8.9 million for the Commission. The FCC, an independent agency, was also mentioned.

The President vetoed the CJS spending bill (H.R. 2670) due to objections with the FCC section, including the lack of a provision to protect taxpayer interests in the telecommunications spectrum auction process and insufficient funds for FCC operations and technology investments. The bill did not address these concerns raised by the President. The omnibus budget agreement signed into law by President Clinton on November 29, 1999 did not include language addressing his concerns about the FCC reclaiming spectrum from bankrupt C-block licensees. The funding total of $210 million for the Commission remained the same as in the vetoed CJS bill, with no additional funds allocated for FCC technology investments. Reports indicated that re-auction legislation was still a priority for the Clinton administration and some Senators in 2000. The conference report on the CJS bill dropped FCC regulation of telephone companies' accounting methods, along with two other FCC provisions. One provision would have allowed the FCC to operate its headquarters independently, and the other would have required a report on new telephone area codes.

They were troubled by the lack of measurable goals and clear linkages between performance goals and program activities in agencies' budget requests. The Committee emphasized the importance of full and effective implementation of the Results Act. The Committee prioritizes the full implementation of the Results Act for all agencies under its jurisdiction. Progress in addressing weaknesses in performance plans will be considered alongside funding requests to ensure accurate budgetary information.
