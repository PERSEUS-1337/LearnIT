    "content": "The Act titled \"Brevard County Beach Equity Act of 2000\" addresses erosion mitigation in Brevard County, Florida. The \"Brevard County Beach Equity Act of 2000\" defines key terms related to navigation and shoreline protection projects, such as Canaveral Harbor Project and Shoreline Protection Project, and specifies the role of the Secretary of the Army in these projects. The Secretary will conduct a study in cooperation with non-Federal entities to determine if erosion in Brevard County, Florida is due to the Canaveral Harbor Project. The study will review existing data and reports, with an independent coastal expert hired to review and report on the findings. The Secretary will select an expert from an approved list to review erosion mitigation measures for the Canaveral Harbor Project in Brevard County, Florida. The study will consider the effects of previous mitigation measures, excluding those from the Shoreline Protection Project. Mitigation determinations must be made within 180 days. The Secretary will determine if measures are needed to prevent erosion or property damage from the Canaveral Harbor Project within 180 days. Following this determination, necessary actions will be planned, designed, and implemented to address any identified issues. Federal and non-Federal costs will be allocated accordingly. The Federal and non-Federal shares of costs for implementing measures under this subsection will be the same as for the Canaveral Harbor Project. If the Secretary carries out renourishment within the Shoreline Protection Project area, the project cooperation agreement will be modified to increase the Federal share of costs to reflect the Secretary's increased expenses. The Secretary will credit or reimburse non-Federal interests for excess funds spent on the Shoreline Protection Project. Section 310 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1999 is repealed. Up to $250,000 from Canaveral Harbor Project funds can be used for a study, and mitigation costs will be treated as project operation and maintenance costs."
