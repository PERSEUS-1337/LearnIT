    "content": "Child welfare services aim to prevent child abuse and neglect, ensure safe homes, and promote well-being. States have primary authority in this area, with a system involving various professionals like social workers, judges, and law enforcement. They work together to protect children, investigate abuse, provide services to families, and remove children from unsafe homes when necessary. Child welfare services involve ensuring children's safety by removing them from unsafe homes when necessary, providing foster care, and facilitating permanency planning through reunification or adoption. Federal funding supports state child welfare agencies primarily for foster care services. Federal child welfare funding, provided through the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, requires states to contribute 20-50% of program costs and adhere to federal policies ensuring child and family well-being. The Children's Bureau administers these funds for foster care services, emphasizing the safety and permanency of children in care. Child welfare funding is part of the Administration on Children, Youth, and Families within the ACF. Discretionary funding for child welfare programs is provided in the annual appropriations bill for the Departments of Commerce and Justice. State child welfare agencies also utilize federal funding streams like TANF, SSBG, and Medicaid. The federal funding streams for child welfare programs have statutory goals that overlap with child welfare purposes, but states are not required to use them solely for those purposes. States do not need to meet specific federal requirements for their child welfare programs to receive this funding. The report discusses FY2018 appropriations activities for child welfare programs, final actions for FY2017, funding determinations, the impact of sequestration, and provides descriptions and funding levels for each federal child welfare program from FY2013-FY2017. The FY2018 appropriations for child welfare programs are uncertain due to short-term continuing resolutions. Funding levels for FY2018 remain unclear until a final appropriations bill is enacted. The FY2018 appropriations for child welfare programs are uncertain due to short-term continuing resolutions. Funding levels for FY2018 remain unclear until a final appropriations bill is enacted. The current CR stipulates limited funding actions for continuing projects and activities, with child welfare discretionary funding based on FY2017 levels reduced by 0.6791%. Total child welfare discretionary funding would be around $593 million, maintaining current law program needs for those programs receiving annual appropriated mandatory funding. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31) allocated $8.9 billion for child welfare programs in FY2017, including $7.8 billion for foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship. Funding for other child welfare activities remained mostly unchanged from FY2016 levels. Child welfare activities in FY2017 saw delayed appropriations until May 5, 2017, with three short-term continuing resolutions. Nearly all child welfare funds are provided in annual appropriations acts, with the largest share allocated to foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship. The largest share of federal support for child welfare is provided for foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. This funding is mandatory and open-ended, with the federal government committed to paying a part of eligible program expenditures. The annual appropriation level typically matches the estimated amount necessary for the federal government to meet its commitment. Funding for child welfare programs is authorized under different funding mechanisms. The largest share of federal support is provided for foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. This funding is mandatory and open-ended, with the federal government committed to paying a part of eligible program expenditures. Additional funds can be drawn from the federal Treasury if the estimated amount is underestimated, or the excess amount will lapse if overestimated. Other child welfare programs have discretionary or capped mandatory funding authorizations. Discretionary funding authorizations are decided as part of the annual appropriations process for child welfare programs like CWS, Adoption Opportunities, and grants under CAPTA. Sequestration may apply to nonexempt programs with discretionary funding through FY2021. Mandatory child welfare funding under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act is not subject to sequestration. Mandatory child welfare funding under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act is exempt from sequestration, while funding under Title IV-B for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program is non-exempt and subject to annual reductions. The FY2018 sequestration for mandatory PSSF funding is uncertain until final funding levels are determined. Child welfare programs with discretionary funding were subject to sequestration in FY2013, but no sequestration was applicable in subsequent years due to budget caps. The need for discretionary sequestration in FY2018 is yet to be determined. Federal child welfare programs are funded through Title IV-B of the Social Security Act, providing support for child welfare activities in states, territories, and tribes. Final funding levels for FY2013-FY2017 and funding authority types are outlined. The need for discretionary sequestration for FY2018 is pending final appropriations. Title IV-B programs authorize funding for child welfare services, including support for states, territories, and tribes to protect children, prevent abuse, promote safety, and provide training for child welfare workforce. Funding is competitively awarded to eligible entities without federal eligibility criteria for recipients. States can use federal funding to provide child welfare services, with a focus on child protective services, family support, preservation, and reunification services. Family preservation and time-limited family reunification services are funded by states using federal funds. The funds are allocated for foster care maintenance payments, program administration, adoption services, and other activities. States receive a base allotment of $70,000 in funding, with additional funds distributed based on the population of children in each state. Child Welfare Services funding is provided to states based on their per capita income, with a requirement for states to contribute 25% of the funds. Tribal allotments are determined by HHS based on the tribal population. The program was authorized in 1935 under the Social Security Act and received $325 million in annual discretionary funding until FY2016. Funding was extended through FY2017 at nearly $269 million. The Promoting Safe and Stable Families (PSSF) program provides formula grant funding to states, tribes, and territories to support at-risk families, prevent maltreatment, preserve families, ensure children's safety, and provide services for children in foster care or adoptive families. States must meet federal requirements related to comprehensive services for children in families to receive funding. The Promoting Safe and Stable Families (PSSF) program provides funding to states for comprehensive services to children in families. States must reserve part of the funding for other grants and activities before distributing PSSF funds. States are required to spend a significant portion of the federal funding on family support, family preservation, time-limited family reunification, and adoption promotion and support services. For FY2017, states planned to allocate their federal PSSF funding as follows: 26% for family support services, 23% for family preservation services, 22% for adoption promotion and support services, and 22% for time-limited family reunification. The Promoting Safe and Stable Families (PSSF) program, added to the Social Security Act in 1993, allocates funding to states for services to children in families. Funding is reserved for family support, preservation, reunification, and adoption services. Despite an authorized annual funding level of $545 million, Congress has never fully funded the program. The Promoting Safe and Stable Families (PSSF) program, added to the Social Security Act in 1993, allocates funding to states for services to children in families. Funding is reserved for family support, preservation, reunification, and adoption services. Despite an authorized annual funding level of $545 million, Congress has never fully funded the program. Beginning in FY2002, funding has been subject to sequestration, reducing final PSSF funding by $118 million across FY2013-FY2017. In FY2017, Congress provided $381 million for PSSF and related activities, comparable to the FY2016 funding level. The PSSF program allocates funding to states for child and family services based on their population of children receiving SNAP benefits. States must match 25% of the funds provided. Funding is also reserved for related programs like the Court Improvement Program and grants for children affected by parental substance abuse. Before PSSF funds are distributed to states for child and family services, specific dollar or percentage amounts are set aside for each program or activity. PSSF funding for FY2013-FY2017 is divided by purpose or activity, with remaining funds allocated for services to children and families after required reservations. Family Connection Grants, last funded in FY2014, support services to keep children in foster care connected with their families. Family Connection Grants enable children in foster care to stay connected with their families through various programs like kinship navigator, family finding, family group decisionmaking, and residential family treatment. 49 grantees, including public child welfare agencies and private nonprofit agencies, have received these grants. Family Connection Grants were awarded to public child welfare agencies and private nonprofit agencies in 23 states. Grantees were required to provide matching funds and participate in evaluation activities. The grants were established under the Fostering Connections to Success and Improving Adoptions Act of 2008 and funded through separate legislation. Section 426 of the Social Security Act authorizes HHS to make grants for research or demonstration projects in child welfare, training for workers, and support for research-based services. Eligible entities include public or nonprofit institutions, agencies conducting child welfare activities, and state or local child welfare agencies. HHS has broad authority to administer these grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements. Section 426 of the Social Security Act authorizes funding for various initiatives in child welfare, including awards to colleges and universities for education stipends, training curriculum on leadership, workforce framework development, leadership academies, online training for supervisors, and a national peer network for professional development. Funds are also available for the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being. The NSCAW study, mandated by Section 429 of the Social Security Act, involves nationally representative surveys of children at risk of abuse or neglect. Two surveys have been conducted in 1999 and 2008, gathering information on a sample of 6,000 children and their families over five years. The NSCAW study involves nationally representative surveys of children at risk of abuse or neglect. A third survey is planned for late summer 2017, funded by the Child Welfare Research account. This survey provides unique data on children and families investigated for abuse or neglect, offering a comprehensive view of those served by child welfare agencies. NSCAW gathers information from children, parents, caregivers, teachers, and caseworkers to examine the socio-behavioral, education, health status of children and families served by child welfare agencies. Title IV-E of the Social Security Act entitles states to reimbursement for providing foster care, adoption assistance, or kinship guardianship. Each state and the District of Columbia has an approved IV-E plan. Title IV-E provides capped mandatory funding for services to children aging out of foster care, with 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands having approved plans. Additionally, 10 tribal entities have approved Title IV-E plans. This funding also supports technical assistance for child welfare services. Title IV-E provides annual capped mandatory funding for technical assistance related to child welfare services for tribal children, including competitive grants for tribes to develop a Title IV-E plan. It also authorizes discretionary funding for incentive payments to states and territories that increase adoptions and legal guardianships of children from foster care. Legislation for these programs is overseen by the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on Finance. Foster care is a temporary arrangement for children found to be abused or neglected until a permanent home is established. The Title IV-E program aims to find permanent homes for children in foster care, either by safely returning them to their parents or through adoption, legal guardianship, or placement with relatives. The number of children in foster care has fluctuated over the years, with close to 437,000 children in foster care as of the last day of FY2016. States, tribes, or territories with approved Title IV-E plans receive federal reimbursement for eligible costs related to providing foster care. Eligibility criteria are outlined in law and regulation. The Title IV-E program aims to find permanent homes for children in foster care, with eligibility criteria stipulating low income, judicial findings, living arrangements, and age requirements. Less than half of children in foster care meet these criteria. The Title IV-E program provides assistance for youth in foster care or child care institutions under the age of 18, or up to 21 in some cases. Some jurisdictions have approval to extend assistance beyond age 18. Eligible costs include foster care maintenance payments and caseworker services. The Title IV-E program provides assistance for youth in foster care or child care institutions under the age of 18, or up to 21 in some cases. Eligible costs include foster care maintenance payments, caseworker services, program-related data system development, training and recruitment of foster care providers, and program administration costs. Federal support covers a percentage of these costs annually. Currently, 28 jurisdictions have approved child welfare demonstration projects using Title IV-E foster care funds to provide services to children and families, even if they are not normally eligible. HHS cannot grant new waivers, and no state can operate a waiver project after September 30, 2019. (Appendix E lists jurisdictions with current Title IV-E waiver projects). Title IV-E waiver projects, authorized by Congress in 1994, allow states to demonstrate innovative practices in child welfare while remaining cost-neutral to the federal Treasury. Projects have specific approval periods, must not cost more in federal support, and are independently evaluated. They vary in scope, operating statewide or in specific regions, focusing on different age groups and service needs. Title IV-E waiver projects aim to prevent child abuse, neglect, and foster care entry, as well as expedite permanency for children in foster care. Some projects also focus on reducing the use of group care, addressing behavioral health needs, supporting caregivers with substance use disorders, and decreasing placement instability. The Title IV-E waiver projects aim to prevent child abuse, neglect, and foster care entry, expedite permanency for children in foster care, reduce group care usage, address behavioral health needs, support caregivers with substance use disorders, and decrease placement instability. HHS and OMB must ensure cost neutrality for approved waiver projects, often through capped allocations of federal Title IV-E foster care funding. States without caps may need to provide the same average per child cost for \"usual care\" as for \"treatment\" care using waiver funds. The Title IV-E waiver projects aim to prevent child abuse, neglect, and foster care entry, expedite permanency for children in foster care, reduce group care usage, address behavioral health needs, support caregivers with substance use disorders, and decrease placement instability. States must provide needed foster care services and meet federal child protections for children using waiver funds. Each jurisdiction must also provide the nonfederal share of program funding, with varying percentages based on program costs. In state FY2014, most of the funding under the Title IV-E waiver project was used for foster care costs, with 58% for Title IV-E eligible children, 32% for non-eligible children, and the rest for other services and program development. Title IV-E foster care funding is provided annually with no year limit. The Administration estimates $5.091 billion is needed for Title IV-E foster care funding in FY2017. States must enter into adoption assistance agreements for children with \"special needs\" under Title IV-E. In FY2017, $5.091 billion is estimated to be needed for Title IV-E foster care funding. States must establish adoption assistance agreements for children with \"special needs,\" which include specific conditions or factors that make adoption without assistance unlikely. These factors often include age, membership in a sibling group, disabilities, or being part of a minority group. Special needs adoptees are typically from foster care, with 82% of children adopted from foster care in FY2015 meeting the state's criteria for special needs. In FY2015, 82% of children adopted from foster care had special needs, including sibling group membership, medical conditions, age, and race/ethnicity. Federal reimbursement is available for adoption expenses and ongoing subsidies for children with special needs. Additional eligibility criteria for ongoing assistance are being phased out based on age of the special needs. During FY2016, close to 456,700 children received monthly Title IV-E adoption assistance payments. States with an approved Title IV-E plan can seek federal reimbursement for these payments and related costs. The funding for adoption assistance is authorized on a permanent basis, with Congress providing annual funding based on HHS estimates. As of July 2017, HHS estimated a need for $2.658 billion for these expenses. HHS estimated a need for $2.658 billion in federal Title IV-E adoption assistance budget authority for FY2017. States and tribes can seek federal reimbursement for kinship guardianship assistance payments for eligible children. During FY2016, ongoing monthly Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance payments were made for approximately 25,500 children who were previously in foster care. Funding for this program is authorized permanently, and jurisdictions with an approved plan can receive reimbursement for program costs, including payments to legal relative guardians and program administration. HHS estimates FY2017 federal budget authority needed for Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance at $136 million. Title IV-E funding is an \"open-ended entitlement\" providing reimbursement for eligible program costs incurred by states or tribes. Congress provides definite budget authority enabling HHS to reimburse states, territories, and tribes for their Title IV-E costs. The annual budget request of the President includes definite budget authority provided by Congress for Title IV-E program costs. If Congress authorizes more funding than needed, the extra authority will lapse. In cases where the definite budget authority is insufficient, there is also an \"indefinite budget authority\" to access additional funds. Table 7 shows funding obligated by HHS for Title IV-E programs from FY2013-FY2017. The Social Security Act authorizes HHS to provide grants to tribes for preparing Title IV-E plans, including costs for data collection systems and court procedures. These grants are awarded competitively to tribes intending to submit a plan within 24 months. As of FY2017, 34 tribes had received plan development grants, with 10 tribes approved by November 2017. As of November 2017, 10 tribes had approved Title IV-E plans, and HHS is required to provide technical assistance to tribes for child welfare programs. This includes funding the National Child Welfare Capacity Building Center for Tribes. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 added technical assistance and IV-E plan development grants to the Social Security Act. This law provides a permanent annual appropriation of $3 million for the John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence Program, which helps youth transition from foster care to adulthood. States are expected to provide various supports to former foster youth aged 18-20 to promote self-sufficiency. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) provides support to former foster youth aged 18-20, including mentoring and connections with adults. States must involve youth in decisions about services. In FY2013, nearly 100,000 youth received independent living services, with academic support, career preparation, and housing education being common. Funding for the program is a permanent entitlement to states. The Chafee program is a permanent entitlement providing support to former foster youth aged 18-20, including mentoring and connections with adults. States and territories can receive funds if they have an approved Title IV-E plan, with tribes also eligible for direct federal support. The annual funding amount is $140 million, increasing to $143 million in FY2020. CFCIP funds are not subject to sequestration and can be used for Educational and Training Vouchers (ETVs) valued at up to $5,000 a year for postsecondary education or training. The Educational and Training Vouchers (ETVs) provide up to $5,000 annually for the \"cost of attendance\" at institutions of higher education. Discretionary funding is distributed based on a state's share of children in foster care. HHS reserves 1.5% of the funding for program evaluations and technical assistance. General program funds are distributed to states and territories based on their share of the national population of children in foster care. States must provide assurances to HHS to receive CFCIP or ETV funding, and contribute 20% of total spending from nonfederal resources. Adoption Incentive Payments were established in 1997 to ensure children's safety and expedite adoptions. Since the enactment of the Adoption and Safe Families Act in 1997, the number of children leaving foster care for adoption has increased, with over 57,000 adoptions completed in FY2016. The program was reauthorized in 2014 to include incentives for legal guardianship placements, with close to 24,000 children leaving foster care for guardianship that year. States do not receive incentive payments for every adoption or guardianship. States earn incentives for increasing the rate of children leaving foster care for adoption or guardianship. Incentives include $5,000 for each adoption of a foster child, $4,000 for legal guardianship, $7,500 for ages 9 to 13, and $10,000 for ages 14 or older. A state qualifies for incentives if the percentage of children leaving foster care exceeds the previous year. States earn incentives for increasing the rate of children leaving foster care for adoption or guardianship. Incentives include $5,000 for each adoption of a foster child, $4,000 for legal guardianship, $7,500 for ages 9 to 13, and $10,000 for ages 14 or older. The amount of incentive payments earned by states has consistently outpaced the annual funding appropriated to pay those incentives. HHS has awarded the payments across two years to ensure states receive the full incentives earned. The $55 million in incentive payments earned by states in FY2016 exceeds the annual funding of $38 million appropriated for these payments. HHS used funds from FY2017 to make initial payments, leaving a balance of $50 million to be paid from the FY2018 appropriation. This is $12 million more than the usual annual amount provided for incentive payments. The Adoption and Legal Guardianship Incentive program received FY2017 funding under P.L. 115-31, despite the expiration of the discretionary funding authorization. CAPTA, enacted in 1974, authorizes funding for child protective services and research projects related to child abuse and neglect. The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) authorizes funding for prevention, assessment, and treatment of child abuse and neglect, as well as community-based grants. It focuses on providing social services in response to abuse or neglect by parents or caretakers. Legislation for CAPTA is handled by specific committees in the House and Senate. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 amended CAPTA to require identification and support for child victims of sex trafficking. In FY2015, state and local child protective services received 4.0 million calls alleging abuse or neglect, involving 7.2 million children. CPS determined responses were needed for 2.2 million referrals, affecting 3.4 million children. CAPTA State Grants provide funding for CPS improvements, but the funding per investigation is less than $12 nationally. The bulk of the cost to address child abuse or neglect allegations is mainly covered by states and localities using federal funding like the Social Services Block Grant. CAPTA State Grants offer funding for CPS program improvements in various areas. Most states plan to use the funds for intake, assessment, screening, investigation, risk assessment tools, case management, and service delivery. States must assure HHS to receive CAPTA state grant funds. State grant funds require states to have a system in place to receive and screen reports of child abuse or neglect, develop a plan of safe care for substance-exposed infants, mandate specific individuals to report abuse, track reports through a technology system, maintain confidentiality of records, offer training to CPS workers, and provide an advocate for each victim in judicial proceedings. The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) requires states to appoint a guardian ad litem for child abuse victims in court proceedings and establish Citizen Review Panels to evaluate CPS policies. Recent amendments to CAPTA include the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 and the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016. The CAPTA Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-320) made changes to the law, including mandating reporting of child abuse, using \"differential response,\" tracking cases, and not reuniting children with abusive parents. It also required states to report CPS workforce demographics and training policies to HHS. The 2010 CAPTA Reauthorization Act mandated reporting of child abuse, implemented \"differential response,\" and required states to report CPS workforce demographics and training policies to HHS. The 2017 Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act requires states to have procedures for identifying and assessing child victims of sex trafficking, training CPS workers, and coordinating with other social service agencies. Columbia, Puerto Rico, and three states (California, Hawaii, Washington) submitted assurances of compliance with trafficking provisions. Four states (Arizona, Nevada, South Carolina, West Virginia) status pending. Children's Bureau to determine implementation status and may require a \"program improvement plan.\" States required to report child sex trafficking victims to HHS starting FY2018. States receiving CAPTA funding mandated to have policies for notifying CPS of infant abuse signs. Statewide policies mandate health care providers to notify CPS of infants showing signs of prenatal drug exposure. CARA requires this notice regardless of the drug's legality and outlines a plan addressing the child's health, well-being, and the parent's substance abuse treatment needs. States must report data on identified children, developed safe care plans, and service referrals. States are also tasked with monitoring compliance and HHS will collect data starting in FY2018. The CARA provisions require states to monitor their compliance and report efforts to HHS ACF regional offices. States failing to comply can enter a \"program improvement plan.\" 23 states entered into a PIP by December 2017. Funding for grants was extended through FY2017, with each state receiving a base allotment of $50,000. Funds under CAPTA are distributed among states based on child population shares. The 2010 reauthorization act set a minimum grant of $100,000 for states with small child populations. Despite funding decreases, no changes have been made to grant distribution. Final funding for CAPTA state grants from FY2013-FY2017 is detailed in Table 11. The enactment of CAPTA created a federal focal point for preventing, identifying, and treating child abuse and neglect. Funding supports research, projects, data collection, and dissemination to improve practices. HHS maintains a national clearinghouse for best practices, provides technical assistance, and publishes data on child maltreatment. The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) requires HHS to fund research, projects, and data collection on child maltreatment. HHS can also establish an office on child abuse and neglect for coordination of activities. The Office of Child Abuse and Neglect (OCAN) at HHS leads prevention and treatment efforts across federal agencies. The Office of Child Abuse and Neglect (OCAN) at HHS leads prevention and treatment efforts across federal agencies, using CAPTA discretionary funds to support various activities such as data collection, publication of annual reports, capacity building for child welfare workers, and partnerships for supportive housing for families in the child welfare system. The Design Options for Understanding Child Maltreatment project aims to identify new methods for obtaining accurate information on child abuse and neglect. Funds from the CAPTA Discretionary Activities account are used to establish the National Advisory Committee on Sex Trafficking of Children and Youth. HHS awards these funds to public and private entities for CAPTA activities. Congress sometimes specifies the use of these funds in appropriations bills. HHS funded the Quality Improvement Center for Research-Based Infant-Toddler Court Teams using CAPTA funding. Congress extended funding for CAPTA discretionary activities through FY2017. Title II of CAPTA supports community-based organizations to prevent child abuse and neglect through Community-Based Child Abuse Prevention grants. Lead entities in each state and territory receive these grants. The lead entity in each state and territory receives funds to distribute to community-based organizations working to prevent child abuse and neglect. These funds support various activities such as parent education, social service referrals, home visiting, and public information campaigns. Additionally, 1% of funds are set aside for tribal and migrant programs, and HHS can allocate additional funds for peer review processes and information clearinghouses. The CAPTA Reauthorization Act of 2010 extended funding for CBCAP grants through FY2017, with each state required to provide a 20% nonfederal matching fund. Funding details for FY2013-FY2017 are shown in Table 11. The CAPTA Reauthorization Act of 2010 extended funding for CBCAP grants through FY2017, with each state required to provide a 20% nonfederal matching fund. Each state's allocation of CBCAP funds is based on the amount of nonfederal money leveraged for child abuse prevention activities. 70% of the grant funding is distributed based on the state's share of children in the nation, while the remaining 30% is based on nonfederal funds directed to community-based child abuse prevention services. Children's Justice Act grants help improve the assessment, investigation, and prosecution of child abuse and neglect cases, especially those involving suspected sexual abuse and exploitation of children. The CAPTA Reauthorization Act of 2010 extended funding for CBCAP grants through FY2017, with each state required to provide a 20% nonfederal matching fund. States must establish and maintain a multidisciplinary taskforce to review how they handle child abuse and neglect cases, including cases involving more than one jurisdiction. The taskforce must make recommendations for improvements through reform of state law, regulations, and procedures, training, and testing of innovative programs. States are further required to receive recommendations to limit additional trauma to children and their families. The Children's Justice Act grants are funded through the Crime Victims Fund, administered by the Office for Victims of Crime within the Department of Justice. DOJ annually sets aside up to $20 million for Children's Justice Act purposes, with 85% directed to HHS for distribution to states, and 3% retained for competitive grants to tribal entities. Funding for this program was allocated from FY2013 to FY2017. The Victims of Child Abuse Act (VCAA) authorizes child welfare programs administered by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Programs (OJJDP) at the Department of Justice (DOJ). It includes provisions for reporting child abuse, criminal penalties for failure to report, and background checks for individuals providing care on federal land or in federally operated facilities. The Victims of Child Abuse Act (VCAA) authorizes funds to support Children's Advocacy Centers (CACs) for coordinating multidisciplinary responses to child abuse. These centers ensure victims and their families receive necessary support services without added trauma. VCAA also provides funds for training and technical assistance to improve the investigation and prosecution of child abuse. Children's Advocacy Centers (CACs) provide assistance in improving the investigation and prosecution of child abuse and neglect. There are close to 800 CACs nationwide, serving about 325,000 children in 2016. Services include forensic interviews, counseling, medical exams, and referrals. Most children served were female (62.8%) and 12 years old or younger (72.2%). Sexual abuse was the most commonly reported abuse, affecting about two-thirds (66.4%) of the children served. In 2016, sexual abuse was the most commonly reported abuse among children served at CACs, affecting about two-thirds (66.4%) of them. Other reported abuses included physical abuse (19.6%), neglect (7.4%), witnesses to violence (6.9%), child drug endangerment (3.3%), and \"other\" (5.7%). About 60.3% of alleged abusers were related to the children served, and a small percentage were 12 years old or younger. The definition of \"child abuse\" includes physical or sexual abuse, neglect, human trafficking, and the production of child pornography. The law authorized grants for programs to identify and help victims of child pornography, established a Domestic Trafficking Victims Fund, and allocated funds for grants and programming related to child pornography. DOJ awards CAC funding to the National Children's Alliance, which supports local children's advocacy centers and provides training and accreditation. Federal law also mandates the support of four regional children's advocacy centers. The law supports four regional children's advocacy centers in Huntsville, AL; Philadelphia, PA; St. Paul, MN; and Colorado Springs, CO to increase the number of communities with CACs, improve their practice, and develop state chapter organizations. It also aims to enhance the prosecution of child abuse cases by providing additional funds for training and technical assistance to attorneys and others involved in criminal prosecution of child abuse. Annual funding of $15 million for regional and local CACs and $5 million for training and technical assistance for criminal prosecution of child abuse was extended for five years. The funding for improving criminal prosecution of child abuse was extended for five years by P.L. 113-163, with $21 million allocated for FY2017. The Senate Appropriations Committee specified that 90% of the funds should go towards developing and maintaining child advocacy centers, with $5 million designated for Regional Children's Advocacy Centers. An additional $1 million was provided for a pilot project to address child abuse on military installations. Subtitle B of the Victims of Child Abuse Act provides funding for Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASAs) to support child abuse victims. The National CASA Association was founded in 1982 to replicate and support CASA programs nationwide. As of 2015, nearly 950 CASA programs were part of the association. In 1990, Congress authorized funds for CASA to ensure representation for children in court proceedings for child abuse and neglect. Despite serving over 250,000 children in 2015, the National CASA estimated that 452,000 children still needed a CASA volunteer. Each year, funds are awarded to the National CASA Association for this purpose. The National CASA Association receives funds for new local program development and training, with annual discretionary funding set at $12 million for FY2014-FY2018. Federal funding for CASA has been below authorized levels, and OJJDP grants aim to improve the handling of child abuse and neglect cases. The National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges (NCJFCJ) receives grants to improve the judicial system's handling of child abuse and neglect cases. Congress has provided annual funding for this training program, with discretionary funding authority extended to $2.3 million for FY2014-FY2018 as part of the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. The Adoption Opportunities program, first enacted in 1978, requires HHS to support adoption recruitment activities and a national resource center on special needs adoptions. It also authorizes federal funds to encourage and facilitate adoption projects. Funding for the program was set at $2.3 million for each fiscal year from 2014 to 2018. The Adoption Opportunities program, enacted in 1978, supports adoption recruitment activities and a national resource center on special needs adoptions. It authorizes federal funds for projects that encourage adoption of older children, minority groups, and those with special needs. Postadoption supports include counseling, respite care, and training for child welfare personnel. Funding is used directly or through competitive awards to achieve program goals. Eligible entities include states. The Adoption Opportunities program supports adoption recruitment activities and a national resource center on special needs adoptions. Eligible entities include states, local government entities, public or private child welfare or adoption agencies, adoptive family groups, and adoption exchanges. Major program activities include developing a national adoption information exchange system and conducting recruitment efforts on a national level. The Adoption Opportunities program focuses on national recruitment efforts for older, minority, and special needs children, promoting the adoption of children through public service announcements and support for adoptive families. It also aims to increase the number of older children adopted from foster care and minority children placed in adoptive families, with post-adoption services provided. The Adoption Opportunities program aims to provide post-adoption services for families with special needs children and address mental health needs of children in foster care. HHS is working to reduce interstate barriers to placement through the NEICE project, which has shown improved efficiencies in processing interstate placements. Funding has been extended to expand the project to all states by May 2018. The Adoption Opportunities program received annual funding of $40 million for FY2010 and continued appropriations through FY2017. Funding in FY2017 aimed to improve hospital-based adoption support services for pregnant mothers. The Abandoned Infants Assistance Act of 1988 addressed concerns about infants remaining in hospital care unnecessarily. The Abandoned Infants Assistance Act of 1988 authorized funding for local projects to prevent abandonment of infants born with drug exposure or HIV. It addresses infants remaining in hospital care due to lack of out-of-hospital placement options. Funding was last provided in FY2015. The Abandoned Infants Assistance Act of 1988 aims to address the needs of abandoned infants and young children by providing various services such as foster care, residential care programs, respite care, and health, educational, and social services. It also focuses on recruiting and training foster parents and health and social services personnel to support these children. The Abandoned Infants Assistance Act of 1988 funded local projects to support abandoned infants and young children with special medical needs. The National Abandoned Infants Assistance Resource Center provided training and technical assistance to grantees until its closure. Data from the mid-2000s highlighted challenges with infants remaining in hospital care beyond discharge dates. The number of infants in hospitals not yet cleared to leave but unlikely to do so with their parents has decreased. In 2006, there were around 12,900 such infants, down from over 30,600 in 1998 and 21,600 in 1991. These infants were previously mainly in urban hospitals but are now found in suburban and rural areas as well. Positive trends include fewer infants \"boarded\" in hospitals and shorter stays beyond medical necessity, possibly due to improved responsiveness from hospitals and child welfare agencies. Several legislative efforts have led to agencies becoming more responsive to the needs of abandoned infants, such as timely permanency planning, required communication between health care providers and child protection agencies, and federal support under the Abandoned Infants Assistance Act. Funding for Abandoned Infants Assistance has been included in legislation reauthorizing CAPTA, with the most recent extension in the CAPTA Reauthorization Act of 2010. The CAPTA Reauthorization Act of 2010 extended funding for the Abandoned Infants Assistance program until FY2015, with no funding provided by Congress since then. The Obama Administration proposed using the funds for a broader range of at-risk infants and toddlers in FY2016, but Congress did not allocate any funding for the program. The Senate Appropriations Committee did not include funding for the program in its FY2016 budget, citing proposed changes to the program's focus. The Abandoned Infants Assistance program was created in 1988 in response to child welfare crises related to crack cocaine and HIV/AIDS epidemics. It funded projects to prevent abandonment of infants affected by substance abuse and HIV. States have since implemented more effective community responses for infants and families in these situations. Funding amounts are detailed in Table A-1, showing appropriations based on different parts of the Social Security Act. The curr_chunk discusses funding for various child welfare programs, including the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program, Title IV-E foster care, Chafee Foster Care Independence Program, Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, and Victims of Child Abuse Act. It also mentions the Budget Control Act of 2011 and its impact on federal spending. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established spending caps for discretionary spending to reduce the federal deficit. If these caps are exceeded, sequestration, or automatic spending cuts, must be applied. The act also included targets for reductions in mandatory spending, with sequestration as a fallback if deficit reductions were not achieved through other means. Amendments, such as the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, have adjusted the levels of discretionary spending permitted and extended mandatory spending sequestration through FY2025. Sequestration was applied to discretionary and mandatory accounts for FY2013. The sequestration percentages for nonexempt, nondefense discretionary-funded programs and mandatory-funded programs were 5.0% and 5.1% respectively. From FY2014 to FY2017, discretionary appropriations did not exceed spending caps, so sequestration was not required for discretionary programs. However, mandatory-funded programs faced sequestration each year. Sequestration was applied to discretionary and mandatory accounts for FY2013, with spending cuts of 5.0% for nonexempt, nondefense discretionary-funded programs and 5.1% for mandatory-funded programs. From FY2014 to FY2017, discretionary appropriations stayed within spending caps, avoiding sequestration for discretionary programs. However, mandatory-funded programs faced automatic spending cuts each year based on OMB determinations. Child welfare programs are categorized as either \"exempt\" or \"nonexempt\" from sequestration, with nonexempt programs subject to automatic cuts if spending exceeds statutory limits. Tribes with an approved Title IV-E plan since FY2010 may receive direct federal reimbursement for eligible costs. Title IV-E plan approved by HHS allows tribes to receive federal reimbursement for foster care, adoption, and kinship guardianship assistance. Ten tribes/tribal entities had approved plans as of November 2017. States can extend Title IV-E assistance up to age 21 starting from FY2011. Indiana extends Title IV-E assistance to a youth's 20th birthday, while all other jurisdictions extend it to a youth's 21st birthday. Eligible youth must be in foster care or have left foster care for adoption or guardianship at age 16 or older. Additional eligibility requirements include participation in education, work, or work preparation. Wisconsin and West Virginia extend support beyond age 18 only if the youth is in high school or college. Other jurisdictions provide support to older ages based on education, work, participation, or disability criteria. States extending Title IV-E foster care assistance beyond age 18 must also provide adoption and kinship guardianship assistance. Twenty-eight jurisdictions, including 26 states and the District of Columbia, have Child Welfare Demonstration Projects. Twenty-eight jurisdictions, including 26 states, the District of Columbia, and the Port Gamble S'Klallam Tribe, are approved to operate child welfare demonstration projects known as Title IV-E waiver projects. Five states have been running their projects for over a decade, while others started between September 2012 and September 2014. Three states approved for projects between FY2012 and FY2014 opted not to implement them due to competing priorities and cost concerns. The welfare agency and cost concerns influenced each state's decision to implement Title IV-E waiver projects. A detailed summary table and a short report provide information on the focus, target population, outcomes, and cost neutrality methodology of the projects. More details can be found at https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb/waiver_summary_table_active.pdf. In June 2017, 35 states, the District of Columbia, and 8 tribal entities received HHS approval to provide kinship guardianship assistance under Title IV-E plans. In September 2017, states earned over $55.2 million in adoption and legal guardianship incentive payments for their performance in FY2016. In September 2017, states received $5.3 million in adoption and legal guardianship incentive payments for their FY2016 performance. This amount was distributed on a prorated basis, with each state receiving roughly 10% of what they earned. The total program funds remaining after previous payments were $41.1 million. HHS paid $5.3 million of the outstanding $49.9 million in adoption and legal guardianship incentive payments earned by states for FY2016 performance as of September 30, 2016. If FY2018 appropriations meet or exceed the $37.9 million annual level, more payments may be made."
