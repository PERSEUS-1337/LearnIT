    "content": "The Act titled \"First-Time Homebuyers' Tax Credit Act of 2009\" introduces a refundable credit for first-time homebuyers in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This credit is for the purchase of a principal residence by a first-time homebuyer. The First-Time Homebuyers' Tax Credit Act of 2009 allows a credit against the tax for first-time homebuyers of up to $20,000. There are income limitations for eligibility, with a threshold of $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for joint filers. The First-Time Homebuyers' Tax Credit Act of 2009 defines a first-time homebuyer and limits the credit to one principal residence. For married couples filing jointly, both individuals must be first-time homebuyers to qualify for the credit. If multiple unmarried individuals purchase a principal residence, the credit is available. The credit is only available to first-time homebuyers, and the amount allowed is allocated as prescribed by the Secretary. The term 'principal residence' is defined, and certain types of property ownership are excluded. 'Purchase' is defined as any acquisition meeting specific criteria. The credit for first-time homebuyers has specific criteria for property acquisition, excluding certain relationships that could disallow losses under sections 267 or 707(b). The basis of the property in the hands of the buyer must not be determined by the adjusted basis of the property. The credit for first-time homebuyers excludes certain relationships that could disallow losses under sections 267 or 707(b). The purchase price is defined as the adjusted basis of the principal residence on the date of acquisition. No double benefit is allowed for expenses eligible for deduction or credit under other provisions of the tax code. The basis of a residence is reduced by the amount of the credit allowed under this section. The provisions apply to a principal residence if purchased within a specific timeframe.
