    "content": "The \"Invest in Small Business Act of 2007\" is the short title of the Act. It includes increased exclusion and modifications for qualified small business stock. Increased exclusion for gain from the sale of qualified small business stock held for more than 4 years. Empowerment zone businesses now qualify for 100% exclusion. Rule added for stock held among members of controlled group. The new paragraph added excludes stock of a member of a 25-percent controlled group from being treated as qualified small business stock while held by another member of the group. The term '25-percent controlled group' is defined as any controlled group of corporations with 'more than 25 percent' ownership instead of 'at least 80 percent'. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is being amended to repeal the minimum tax preference and the 28 percent capital gains rate on qualified small business stock. Amendments include reducing the holding period for certain tax provisions from 5 years to 4 years and removing paragraph (7) from section 57. Additionally, the definition of a '25-percent controlled group' is revised to include corporations with 'more than 25 percent' ownership. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is being amended to repeal the minimum tax preference and the 28 percent capital gains rate on qualified small business stock. Sections of the Code are amended to redesignate paragraphs and update references to section 1(h)(10). Section 1202(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to increase the aggregate asset limitation for qualified small businesses from $50,000,000 to $100,000,000. Additionally, an inflation adjustment provision is added for taxable years beginning after 2007. Beginning in a calendar year after 2007, the $100,000,000 dollar amounts in paragraph (1) will be increased by a cost-of-living adjustment determined for the calendar year in which the taxable year begins. If the adjusted amount is not a multiple of $1,000, it will be rounded to the next lowest multiple of $100. The amendments made by this section apply for taxable years beginning after 2007. The amendments made by this section apply to stock issued after December 31, 2007, with special rules for stock issued before that date."
