Congress finds that the domestic steel industry is vital to the US economy and national security, but is being harmed by foreign dumping and unfair trade practices. Imports of steel and steel products have been increasing, capturing a significant portion of the US market. The trade adjustment assistance program (TAA) provides benefits and services to workers affected by foreign trade, including education, training, income support, relocation assistance, job search help, and health coverage tax credit. Over 5 million US workers have been certified for TAA benefits since its inception, with over 2.2 million workers served as of September 30, 2015. In fiscal year 2015, the Department of Labor certified workers for TAA benefits. In fiscal year 2015, the Department of Labor certified 413 petitions for eligibility for the trade adjustment assistance program, benefiting 57,631 workers. The program enrolled over 13,000 new participants and provided services to more than 47,000 workers in 2015. The average processing time for petitions was 49.1 days from 2012 to 2015, with a decrease to 47.2 days in 2015. The program offers education and training services to help trade-affected workers acquire new skills for new employment. In 2012-2015, over 9,800 steelworkers and iron ore miners lost jobs due to increased imports. In 2015, 6,500 steelworkers were eligible for trade adjustment assistance. States should fund educational programs for affected workers while their eligibility is pending. States are authorized to reimburse costs for training workers after a petition for trade adjustment assistance is filed. States can use funds to reimburse training costs for workers before they are approved for training under certain conditions. This includes funds from the state, local workforce development areas, or eligible entities. The Trade Act of 1974 allows for reimbursement of training costs for workers under specific conditions, including being covered by a certification for eligibility and meeting training approval requirements. A conforming amendment specifies exceptions to this rule."
