    "content": "The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program provides income assistance to disabled, blind, or aged individuals with low incomes and limited resources. In December 2013, over 8.3 million people received SSI benefits, with an average cash benefit of $529.15. The program paid out over $4.6 billion in benefits that month. Most states supplement the federal SSI benefit with additional payments. The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program provides income assistance to disabled, blind, or aged individuals with low incomes and limited resources. The SSI rate was reduced by one-third in 2014 to about $481 per month for individuals. A cost of living adjustment is applied annually using the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers. Most SSI recipients are eligible for Medicaid and SNAP benefits, and must have limited assets to qualify for SSI. The countable resource limit for SSI eligibility is $2,000 for individuals and $3,000 for couples. Two types of income, earned and unearned, are considered for SSI eligibility and payment amounts. In-kind support and maintenance, such as food, clothing, or shelter, is also taken into account. These limits have been in place since 1989 and are not adjusted for inflation. The Foster Care Independence Act of 1999 (P.L. 106-169) changed SSI eligibility requirements regarding irrevocable trusts. Assets in trusts are now considered for benefit calculations, including both irrevocable and revocable trusts. The Commissioner of Social Security may waive this provision in certain circumstances. When applying for SSI, individuals must provide documentation to determine income and resource eligibility. Excluded resources for SSI eligibility include home, essential transportation car, property for income-producing activity, household goods, and personal effects totaling $2,000. Excluded resources for SSI eligibility include property essential to income-producing activity, household goods and personal effects totaling $2,000 or less, and certain monthly income exclusions. Laws prohibit counting benefits from federal programs as resources for SSI eligibility. The Social Security Act and federal regulations provide resource exclusions for SSI eligibility, including burial expenses and burial plots. Individuals can set aside up to $1,500 for burial expenses, and the value of a burial plot is not counted against the resource limit. The burial expense exclusion for SSI eligibility allows individuals to set aside up to $1,500, with exceptions for life insurance policies and irrevocable burial trusts. Additionally, a Plan for Achieving Self-Support (PASS) is a personalized employment plan for SSI beneficiaries. A Plan for Achieving Self-Support (PASS) is a personalized employment plan for SSI beneficiaries that must be approved by the SSA. It includes a specific employment goal, timeline, needed goods or services, and resources that are not counted against SSI limits. Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) are matched savings accounts for low-income families and individuals to save for education, home purchase, or business creation. Funds can be matched by the state's TANF block grant. Nonprofit organizations and governments can compete for grants to fund IDAs for low-income households under the Assets for Independence Act. Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) funded through grants are known as Demonstration Project IDAs. Money saved in these IDAs, including state contributions and interest earned, is not counted towards SSI eligibility. There are limits on contributions to IDAs, and when a child SSI beneficiary is owed back benefits, they must be placed in a dedicated account in the child's name. This account cannot be invested in securities, and any money and interest earned belong to the child. The representative payee can use money from a dedicated account for the child's medical care, education, personal needs assistance, equipment, housing modifications, therapy, and approved items/services. Daily expenses, food, clothing, and shelter cannot be paid from this account. The payee must keep records of deposits and expenditures, and misuse of funds can result in liability to the SSA. Money in a dedicated account for children does not count towards SSI eligibility."
