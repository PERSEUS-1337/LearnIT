    "content": "In this paper, the properties of sentence vectors are explored through the lens of Automatic Summarization. The study shows that cosine similarity between sentence vectors and document vectors correlates with sentence importance. Specific dimensions of sentence embeddings are linked to effective summaries, a novel finding in this field. The features of different methods of sentence embeddings are also compared, providing insights with applications beyond just summarization. Vector semantics, including models like LSA, word2vec, and GLOVE, are popular for various natural language processing tasks. While these models work well for individual words, generating equivalent vectors for sentences or documents is more challenging. Techniques like paragraph vectors (Doc2Vec) have emerged as promising methods for sentence embeddings. The paragraph vectors model, similar to word2vec, uses a 'paragraph vector' in a Skip-Gram model. Skip-thoughts, based on an encoder-decoder neural network, produces skip-thought vectors that perform well on natural language tasks. Simpler approaches, like linear combinations of word vectors, have achieved state-of-the-art results. Arora et al. propose a promising approach that rivals complex supervised learning methods in performance. The need for effective automatic summarization is driven by the large volume of daily news articles. Sentence extraction is the most basic form of automatic summarization. The most basic form of automatic summarization is sentence extraction, where unmodified sentences are selected from the original document to form a short summary containing key information. Multi-document summarization algorithms require specific properties from sentence vectors, making them practical for real-world applications. News summarization may not need nuanced meanings to be represented. State-of-the-art extractive summarization techniques have been achieved with a wide variety of methods, including the use of recursive neural networks. Several extractive summarization techniques have been developed, including the use of recursive neural networks, graph-based approaches, and regression-based methods. Some researchers have explored the use of modern sentence embedding methods like Paragraph Vectors and Skip-Thought vectors, while others have used word2vec representations for summarization. Several studies have explored text summarization using word2vec representations. BID6 introduced a method based on vector semantics, calculating word embeddings from the document itself rather than a larger corpus. Kageback et al. BID8 utilized cosine similarity and a recursive auto-encoder with word2vec embeddings for summarization. Ren et al. incorporated \"Average Word Embedding\" as a variable in a regression model, while BID3 used word embeddings in a neural network for summarization. The text discusses different methods for sentence embeddings, including SIF Average, Arora, and Paragraph Vectors. These methods convert sentences or documents into vectors using word embeddings and common component removal. The text discusses various methods for sentence embeddings, such as SIF Average, Arora, and Paragraph Vectors. It includes the use of different models like DBOW and combined-skip for generating sentence vectors. The exploration of selector functions like Near and Near Nonredundant is also presented to extract summaries based on vector representations. The text discusses methods for sentence embeddings like SIF Average, Arora, and Paragraph Vectors, as well as models like DBOW and combined-skip. It introduces selector functions like Near Nonredundant, LexRank, and Cluster for generating summaries based on vector representations. The text introduces selector functions like Greedy, Brute Force, and Max Similarity for optimizing cosine similarity between the summary and the document. These selectors aim to select sentences that maximize cosine similarity in different ways. The text introduces selector functions like Greedy, Brute Force, and Max Similarity for optimizing cosine similarity between the summary and the document. These selectors aim to select sentences that maximize cosine similarity in different ways. Another selector, PCA, performs Principal Component Analysis on sentence vectors in a document to select sentences closest to each component. Additionally, a Near-then-Redundancy algorithm minimizes redundancy in sentence selection. Lastly, a Random selector picks sentences randomly to reach a word limit, providing a baseline for algorithm performance. The evaluation of summarization involves using metrics like ROUGE to compare automatically generated summaries with human-written ones. ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 statistics are reported, corresponding to unigrams and bigrams. The DUC 2004 dataset is split into testing and validation sets for analysis. The DUC 2001 dataset was used for training, and results for Multi-Document Summarization on the DUC 2004 dataset are presented. The best performing selector is Greedy, while Paragraph Vectors perform worse with certain algorithms. Despite sophisticated models, basic approaches outperform in general. Analysis of the data provides insights into vector semantics behavior in real-world tasks. The cosine scores between sentence vectors and document vectors follow a normal distribution, with paragraph vectors showing the most pronounced effect. Sentence embeddings for paragraph and skip-thought vectors are closer to the document embedding than expected, with optimal sentences having higher cosine scores. However, the method alone is not powerful enough to produce good summaries. The study calculated isolated ROUGE scores for individual sentences in the training set using four vector functions. To reduce context effects, the document vector was subtracted from sentence vectors before regression. Significant dimensions were found for SIF Average and Paragraph Vectors, with varying p-values. Arora vectors did not show significant dimensions. The study found significant dimensions for SIF Average and Paragraph Vectors in creating summaries, with the Greedy algorithm being the most successful. Despite theoretical implications, regression models lack predictive power for good summaries. The Greedy algorithm aims to maximize a specific objective function for summarization. The Greedy algorithm outperforms other strategies in creating summaries by selecting sentences with low cosine similarity scores that increase the overall sentence similarity. The Greedy algorithm maximizes an equation to select sentences based on salience and redundancy, outperforming handcrafted redundancy penalties. The algorithm prioritizes important sentences first and then fills in the gaps, showing sensitivity to redundancy as more sentences are selected. The success of the algorithm in balancing salience and redundancy has implications for future summarization algorithms. Two ways to compute a document vector are discussed, with Skip-thought vectors performing better with the docvec-avg strategy for text longer than a sentence. The docvec-avg strategy performs significantly better for text longer than a sentence, especially with Skip-thought vectors. However, it shows poor performance with Paragraph Vectors, indicating that Paragraph Vectors can combine information more effectively. SIF Average and Arora vectors, based on word averaging, closely resemble the simple strategy but with a small performance gap due to differences in weighting. Docvec-avg normalizes vectors before adding them, potentially removing useful weighting information present in the simple strategy. The comparison of sentence embedding schemes shows that SIF Average and Arora vectors perform better with selector functions like Near Nonredundant, Greedy, and PCA. These functions focus on judging the similarity of sentence embeddings, with the removal of common components making a difference in their performance. The comparison of sentence embedding schemes shows that Arora vectors have a slight performance edge for most selectors, except for Near and Greedy. Paragraph Vectors perform better with Near and Brute Force selectors, indicating they are good at computing document vectors. However, they struggle with comparing sentence vectors to each other, as seen in the poor performance of Near Nonredundant. Additionally, Paragraph Vectors show a high correlation when regressing on individual features. Skipthought vectors performed poorly compared to other vector functions, but showed better performance with the Clustering selector. Different forms of sentence vectors excel in specific tasks, with Arora's vectors being good at judging sentence similarity and Paragraph Vectors excelling at representing document vectors and features. Skipthought vectors work well in specific contexts not fully explored in the study, highlighting the significant differences between various sentence embedding schemes. The selection of sentence vector methods is crucial for real-world applications. The greedy algorithm chooses the sentence with the highest cosine similarity to the document vector. The algorithm then maximizes a specific equation to select the second vector. This work is supported by the National Science Foundation."
