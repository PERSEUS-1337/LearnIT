    "content": "The \"Presidential Accountability Act\" is the short title of this Act. It addresses acts that affect the personal financial interest of the President or Vice President of the United States. The \"Presidential Accountability Act\" amends Chapter 11 of title 18, United States Code, by adding section 208A. It prohibits the President or Vice President from participating in matters that affect their personal financial interests, unless permitted by subsection (b). The \"Presidential Accountability Act\" prohibits the President or Vice President from participating in matters that affect their personal financial interests, unless permitted by subsection (b) which includes holding the financial interest in a qualified blind trust or making full disclosure to the Director of the Office of Government Ethics. The \"Presidential Accountability Act\" requires the President or Vice President to disclose financial interests and obtain approval from the Director of the Office of Government Ethics to ensure it does not influence their actions or undermine public confidence. In case of a national emergency, they must notify the Director and seek retroactive exemption if immediate action is needed. The Director of the Office of Government Ethics must make a written determination on retroactive exemption requests within 48 hours. If an exemption would not have been granted, the President or Vice President must return any benefit gained or gift financial gains to reduce the public debt. The Office of Government Ethics must make a determination on exemption requests within 10 days, or they will be deemed denied. Requests and determinations must be made public within 10 days, with the agency able to withhold exempt information. The text discusses the requirements for a qualified blind trust, which includes having an independent trustee who is not associated with any interested party. A violation of the trust regulations constitutes a high crime and misdemeanor under the United States Constitution. The requirements for a qualified blind trust include having an independent trustee who is not associated with any interested party, ensuring they cannot be controlled or influenced in the administration of the trust. The requirements for a qualified blind trust include having an independent trustee who is not associated with any interested party, not involved in any joint venture or investment with any interested party, and not a relative of any interested party. Any asset transferred to the trust must be free of restrictions unless approved in writing by the Director of the Office of Government Ethics. The trust instrument must be established to meet these criteria. The trust instrument for a qualified blind trust specifies that the trustee must not consult with interested parties, assets must comply with laws, and the trustee must notify when asset values drop below $1,000. The trust tax return for a qualified blind trust must be prepared by the trustee or designee, and information other than trust income necessary for interested parties' tax returns cannot be disclosed. Interested parties can only receive reports on the trust's total cash value, net income or loss, or reports needed for tax returns. The trustee of a qualified blind trust must prepare the trust tax return as required by law, without disclosing specific assets or holdings. Direct communication between the trustee and interested parties is limited to written communication relating to the financial interests and needs of the party. The interested parties in a blind trust must not try to obtain information about the trust's holdings, including the trust tax return. The trust must comply with requirements certified by the Director of the Office of Government Ethics, who conducts annual recertification. If non-compliance is found, the Committee on Oversight is notified. Government Ethics notifies relevant congressional committees and interested parties when they are no longer eligible for an exemption until trust recertification. Definitions for 'interested party,' 'reporting individual,' 'broker,' and 'investment adviser' are provided. Section 216 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to include new provisions related to the management or control of trusts by advisors. Written certifications must be made public within 10 days. Section 431 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to include the President or Vice President of the United States in contracts."
