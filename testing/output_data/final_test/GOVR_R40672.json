    "content": "Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act provides federal aid to local educational agencies for disadvantaged children in pre-kindergarten through grade 12 schools with high numbers of low-income students. It includes requirements for assessments, adequate yearly progress standards, consequences for schools that do not meet standards, and teacher qualifications. Title I-A is the largest federal education assistance program, serving over 90% of LEAs, 52,000 public schools, and 16.5 million students. The ESEA was first adopted in 1965 and reauthorized by the No Child Left Behind Act in 2001. Although the authorization for ESEA Title I-A has expired, appropriations have continued, and the program is still being implemented. The focus of this report is on the formulas used to allocate Title I-A funds to states, LEAs, and schools under the ESEA program. The report discusses the allocation formulas for various federal K-12 education programs and grants. It will not be updated, but another CRS report covers accountability and policy issues related to ESEA Title I-A. The report focuses on ESEA Title I-A allocation formulas and reauthorization issues. For more detailed discussions, refer to other CRS reports. The report provides descriptions of the allocation formulas, funding trends, and analyses of major issues. Major Title I-A reauthorization issues include reducing annual variations in poverty estimates for grant calculations, increasing targeting of funds on high poverty LEAs since 2001, and considering population weighting factors for grants. The population weighting factors of the Targeted and Education Finance Incentive Grant (EFIG) formulas may need modification to better support LEAs with high poverty rates. The role of the expenditure factor in Title I-A formulas is questioned due to its impact on fund distribution. Consideration for consolidating the four different allocation formulas is also raised. The current Title I-A appropriation allocation formulas are a result of legislative compromise. Questions arise about the authorization level for future years, potential modifications to the effort and equity factors in the EFIG formula, and reconsideration of provisions for intra-LEA allocation. Low participation of middle and high schools in Title I-A programs is noted, suggesting a need for fund allocation modifications within LEAs. Issues affecting a limited number of states or LEAs include the potential removal of special constraints on grants to Puerto Rico, the elimination of the TANF formula factor, and the treatment of each county portion of New York City as separate LEAs under Title I-A allocation formulas. These changes could impact funding levels and allocations within LEAs. The report discusses funding levels and allocations for FY2008, with marginal reference to FY2009 appropriations. ESEA Title I-A uses four formulas for fund allocation to states and LEAs, which are then combined for program purposes. The report discusses the use of four different formulas to allocate funds for ESEA Title I-A, each with distinct allocation patterns and historical significance. The Targeted and EFIG formulas were initially proposed as replacements for previous formulas, with elements like equity and effort factors playing important roles. The Title I-A allocation formulas were initially intended to replace existing formulas but were later authorized to supplement them. The characteristics of these formulas, as amended by NCLB, are described in three different formats: narrative, tabular, and detailed mathematical expressions. These formulas complement each other and have distinct allocation patterns and historical significance. The Title I-A allocation formulas have a consistent structure, with a population factor and an expenditure factor determining maximum grants. Additional factors may be included in some formulas. Grants are adjusted to match available appropriations, considering state and LEA minimum grant provisions. Only LEAs meeting specific criteria can receive grants under Title I-A. The Title I-A allocation formulas allocate funds to LEAs through SEAs using four different formulas: Basic, Concentration, Targeted Grants, and Education Finance Incentive Grants. Funds are calculated at the LEA level and adjusted to meet state minimum grant provisions. The characteristics of these formulas have been amended by NCLB. The Basic Grants formula under Title I-A of the ESEA allocates the largest proportion of funds (47% of FY2008 appropriations) to LEAs with a low eligibility threshold, but its share has been declining since FY2001 due to increases in other formulas. Grants are straightforward and based on each LEA's share. The Basic Grants formula under Title I-A of the ESEA allocates funds based on each LEA's share of a population factor multiplied by an expenditure factor, subject to certain minimums and available appropriations. The population factor includes children aged 5-17 in various categories, such as those in poor families, institutions, or receiving TANF payments. The Basic Grants formula under Title I-A of the ESEA allocates funds based on each LEA's share of a population factor and an expenditure factor, with eligibility thresholds and minimum grant levels. Each state is guaranteed a minimum grant amount. The Basic Grants formula under Title I-A of the ESEA allocates funds based on population and expenditure factors, with minimum state grant thresholds. States receive a minimum of 0.25% of total Basic Grant appropriations if funding is at or below FY2001 levels, and up to 0.35% if above. Grants are subject to ratable reduction if appropriations are insufficient. The Title I-A fiscal requirements include maintenance of effort, supplement not supplant, and comparability. Puerto Rico is treated differently in terms of funding allocation. The Title I-A program provides grants to various areas including Puerto Rico, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Outlying Areas, and certain Freely Associated States. State Education Agencies make adjustments to the grants before distributing them to Local Education Agencies. The Title I-A program provides grants to different areas, with adjustments made by State Education Agencies before distribution to Local Education Agencies. Adjustments include reservations for school improvement grants, state administration, academic achievement awards, charter schools, and LEA boundary changes. States may also use alternative methods for reallocating grants among small LEAs. The Title I-A program provides grants to different areas, with adjustments made by State Education Agencies before distribution to Local Education Agencies. Grants are calculated among small LEAs based on a formula involving population factors, expenditure factors, and hold harmless levels. Adjustments are made in three steps to ensure fair distribution of funds. The final step in calculating LEA grants under Title I-A allocation formulas involves adjustments for school improvement, state administration reservations, achievement awards, and other factors. Grants are calculated in three steps based on population factors, expenditure factors, and hold harmless levels to ensure fair distribution of funds among small LEAs. The Concentration Grant formula is similar to Basic Grants but with adjustments for school improvement, state administration reservations, achievement awards, and other factors. It involves population factors, expenditure factors, and hold harmless levels to distribute funds among small LEAs. The Concentration Grant formula, similar to Basic Grants but with adjustments for school improvement and other factors, has a higher LEA eligibility threshold. Approximately 50% of LEAs receive Concentration Grants, which are based on population and expenditure factors, subject to minimum allocations. The Concentration Grant formula has a higher LEA eligibility threshold compared to Basic Grants, with adjustments for school improvement and other factors. Approximately 50% of LEAs receive Concentration Grants based on population and expenditure factors, subject to minimum allocations. The eligibility thresholds for Concentration Grants include a population factor, an expenditure factor, and a hold harmless level for all LEAs that received grants in the previous year. The Concentration Grant formula has higher LEA eligibility thresholds compared to Basic Grants, with adjustments for school improvement and other factors. LEAs eligible for Concentration Grants can receive them for 4 consecutive years, even if they don't meet the thresholds in those years. The state minimum for Concentration Grants is based on total appropriations, with a maximum limit to prevent states from receiving excessive amounts. The Concentration Grant formula has higher LEA eligibility thresholds compared to Basic Grants, with adjustments for school improvement and other factors. LEAs eligible for Concentration Grants can receive them for 4 consecutive years, even if they don't meet the thresholds in those years. The state minimum for Concentration Grants is based on total appropriations, with a maximum limit to prevent states from receiving excessive amounts. The allocation formula for Concentration Grants includes adjustments by SEAs of LEA grants as calculated by ED, with exceptions for states with a low percentage of children counted in the population factor. The Concentration Grant formula has higher LEA eligibility thresholds compared to Basic Grants, with adjustments for school improvement and other factors. LEAs eligible for Concentration Grants can receive them for 4 consecutive years, even if they don't meet the thresholds in those years. The state minimum for Concentration Grants is based on total appropriations, with a maximum limit to prevent states from receiving excessive amounts. The allocation formula for Concentration Grants includes adjustments by SEAs of LEA grants as calculated by ED, with exceptions for states with a low percentage of children counted in the population factor. The mathematical expression of the Concentration Grant formula is the same as that for Basic Grants, with one exception for states with a low percentage of children counted in the population factor. Targeted Grants, authorized in 1994 but funded in FY2002, make up 21% of Title I-A grants. They are allocated to 87% of LEAs based on a formula similar to Basic Grants. Targeted Grants have grown to be a significant portion of Title I-A grants. The allocation formula for Targeted Grants is similar to Basic Grants but with differences in how children in the population factor are counted. Poor children in Targeted Grants receive weights based on each LEA's child poverty rate, resulting in higher grants per child for LEAs with higher poverty rates. There is a higher eligibility threshold for Targeted Grants compared to Basic Grants. Targeted Grants are based on each LEA's share of a population factor multiplied by an expenditure factor, subject to appropriations, an LEA minimum, and a state minimum. The allocation formula for Targeted Grants factors in weights based on each LEA's child poverty rate, resulting in higher grants per child for LEAs with higher poverty rates. Children in the formula are assigned weights based on the number of school-age children in poor families and the school-age child poverty rate of each LEA. Formula children in LEAs with the highest poverty rates have a weight of up to four, and those in LEAs with the highest numbers of such children have a weight of up to three. The Targeted Grants allocation formula assigns weights to children based on poverty rates in LEAs, with higher weights for children in areas with higher poverty rates. The weights are determined by the number and percentage of children in poverty in each LEA, with the highest weights being up to four for poverty rates and up to three for the number of children in poverty. The weights are applied in a stepwise manner based on the distribution of population factor children among LEAs. The Targeted Grants allocation formula assigns weights to children based on poverty rates in LEAs, with higher weights for children in areas with higher poverty rates. The weights are determined by the number and percentage of children in poverty in each LEA, with the highest weights being up to four for poverty rates and up to three for the number of children in poverty. The weights are applied in a stepwise manner based on the distribution of population factor children among LEAs. Rather than applying the highest weight to all population factor children, the greater of the two weighted child counts for each LEA is used to calculate the Targeted Grant. The weighted population factor counts from Steps 1 and 2 are combined to determine the population factor for an LEA in the calculation of Targeted Grants. The eligibility threshold for a Targeted Grant is based on the number of children counted in the LEA. To be eligible for a Targeted Grant, an LEA must have 10 or more children counted in the population factor, constituting 5% or more of the total school-age population. Each state is guaranteed a minimum grant of up to 0.35% of all Targeted Grant appropriations. Ratable reduction and fiscal requirements are the same as Basic Grants. Puerto Rico, Outlying Areas, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs are treated the same as Basic Grants. The Targeted Grant formula for Puerto Rico includes a cap of 1.82 on the population factor weight. Adjustments to LEA grants are the same as Basic Grants. The EFIG formula differs significantly from other Title I-A allocation formulas and was modified by the NCLB in 2002. All increases in Title I-A appropriations since then have been allocated as either EFIG or Targeted Grants. The EFIG Grants, constituting 21% of FY2008 appropriations, are a growing portion of Title I-A grants allocated among 87% of LEAs. The formula includes unique factors like an effort factor and an equity factor based on per pupil expenditure and variations among LEAs. The EFIG formula for allocating Title I-A grants among LEAs includes unique factors such as an effort factor, an equity factor based on per pupil expenditure variations, and intra-state allocation based on population counts. The expenditure factor for EFIG Grants is subject to more narrow floor and ceiling constraints compared to other Title I-A formulas. State total EFIG Grants are determined by a combination of population, expenditure, effort, and equity factors adjusted by a state minimum. The EFIG formula for allocating Title I-A grants among LEAs includes unique factors such as expenditure, effort, and equity factors adjusted by a state minimum. Each LEA's share of the state total EFIG Grant is based on a weighted population factor count compared to all LEAs in the state, with weights applied to child counts before being used in the formula. The EFIG formula for allocating Title I-A grants among LEAs includes unique factors such as expenditure, effort, and equity factors adjusted by a state minimum. The weights attached to each point on the number and percentage scales differ for EFIG Grants, depending on the state's equity factor. States with higher equity factors have higher weights, with maximum weights 50% higher or twice as high as for Targeted Grants. States with higher equity factors also have high variation in average per pupil expenditure among LEAs. The EFIG formula for Title I-A grants includes unique factors like effort and equity factors. The effort factor compares state spending on education to personal income, while the equity factor measures the disparity in per pupil expenditure among states. The resulting index influences state grants symbolically with limited impact. The equity factor in the EFIG formula for Title I-A grants is based on the coefficient of variation (CV) in per pupil expenditure among LEAs in a state. The CV is calculated with extra weight given to estimated counts of children from poor families. Grants are maximized for states with a 40% higher expenditure per pupil from poor families. Typical equity factors range from 0.0 to 0.25, with most states falling in the 0.10 - 0.20 range. The equity factor is subtracted from 1.30 to determine grants. In the EFIG formula for Title I-A grants, the equity factor is determined by the coefficient of variation (CV) in per pupil expenditure among LEAs in a state. Grants are calculated based on this factor, with states having lower expenditure disparities receiving higher grants. The expenditure factor is the state average per pupil expenditure for public K-12 education, multiplied by 0.40. The LEA minimum grant level is the same as Basic Grants. The Education Finance Incentive Grant Allocation Formula determines state total grants for LEAs based on various factors such as equity, expenditure, and hold harmless levels. State grants may be insufficient to fully pay hold harmless amounts, resulting in proportional shares for LEAs. Further adjustments by SEAs and the calculation of EFIG Allocations follow the same principles as Basic Grants. The Education Finance Incentive Grant Allocation Formula calculates state total EFIG allocations based on factors like equity, expenditure, and hold harmless levels. State grants may not cover hold harmless amounts fully, leading to proportional shares for LEAs. Further adjustments by SEAs and the calculation of LEA EFIG Allocations follow similar principles as Basic Grants. The Education Finance Incentive Grant Allocation Formula calculates state total EFIG allocations based on factors like equity, expenditure, and hold harmless levels. State grants may not cover hold harmless amounts fully, leading to proportional shares for LEAs. In Step 1, the population factor for each eligible LEA is divided by the total population factor for all eligible LEAs in the state. If this is less than the LEA's hold harmless level, the latter amount is used. Step 2 adjusts the amount for each LEA to account for the aggregate costs of raising affected LEAs to their hold harmless level. The final LEA grant is calculated by further adjusting the amount from Step 2 for school improvement and state administration reservations. The Education Finance Incentive Grant Allocation Formula calculates state total EFIG allocations based on factors like equity, expenditure, and hold harmless levels. State grants may not cover hold harmless amounts fully, leading to proportional shares for LEAs. The final LEA grant is calculated by further adjusting the amount for school improvement and state administration reservations, state minimum adjustments, and other possible adjustments discussed above. Under ESEA Title I-A, funds for School Improvement activities are generated through two mechanisms: states reserve 4% of their total Title I-A LEA grants for School Improvement activities, and separate appropriations are made for state School Improvement Grants. These funds are targeted towards schools identified as needing improvement, corrective action, or restructuring due to failing to make AYP for two consecutive years or more. The allocation of funds is based on state total grants under ESEA Title I, Parts A, C, and D, with at least 95% of each grant going towards LEAs. Under ESEA Title I-A, funds for School Improvement activities are allocated through two mechanisms: states reserve 4% of their total Title I-A LEA grants and receive separate appropriations for state School Improvement Grants. These funds are directed to schools in need of improvement, corrective action, or restructuring. Allocation is based on state total grants under ESEA Title I, Parts A, C, and D, with 95% going to LEAs. Each state's allocation is determined by its proportional share of total grants under ESEA Title I. Under ESEA Title I-A, School Improvement Grants are allocated based on state total grants under ESEA Title I, Parts A, C, and D. Most Title I-A funds are given to individual schools, with LEAs ranking schools by percentage of low-income students and serving them in rank order. Schools must have a higher percentage of low-income students than the LEA's average or 35%. Title I-A funds are allocated to schools with a higher percentage of low-income students than the LEA's average or 35%, with the option for LEAs to set higher eligibility thresholds. Funds are distributed based on the number of low-income pupils in each school, not necessarily the same data used for state and LEA allocations. LEAs must use proxies for low-income status, such as free/reduced-price school lunches, TANF, or Medicaid eligibility. Approximately 90% of LEAs use free/reduced-price school lunch data to select Title I-A schools and allocate funds. The income eligibility thresholds for free and reduced-price lunches are higher than the poverty levels used in the allocation formulas to states and LEAs: 130% of poverty for free lunches, 185% for reduced-price lunches. Title I-A funds are allocated among schools in rank order based on the percentage of pupils from low-income families until no further funds are available. LEAs may choose to consider only schools of selected grade levels in determining eligibility for grants, as long as all schools with 75% or more of pupils from low-income families receive grants. In the 2004-2005 school year, an estimated 56% of all public schools in the nation received Title I-A grants, with funds allocated based on the number of pupils from low-income families. LEAs have the flexibility to provide higher grants per child from a low-income family to schools with higher percentages of such pupils. If a LEA provides funds to schools with low-income pupil percentages below 35%, it must ensure a minimum amount of funds per child from a low-income family. In the 2004-2005 school year, 56% of public schools received Title I-A grants based on the number of low-income families. Elementary schools are more likely to receive grants than secondary schools. Funds are allocated based on the number of low-income families in the residential areas served by selected public schools. LEAs can use free/reduced-price school lunch data or alternatives for allocation. Information on Title I-A appropriations for FY2007-2009 and the Administration budget request for FY2010 can be found in Table 4. The Administration's budget for FY2008 requested $13,909,900,000 for Title I-A LEA grants, an increase of $1,071,775,000 (8.3%) over the FY2007 appropriation, plus a separate appropriation of $500 million for school improvement grants. P.L. 110-161, the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008, provided a total of $13,898,875,000 for Title I-A grants to LEAs, plus a separate appropriation of $491,265,000 for school improvement grants. Funding levels for Concentration Grants remained the same for FY2008 as for FY2007. For FY2009, regular appropriations under P.L. 111-8 total $14,492,401,000 for grants to LEAs, with Basic Grants reduced to $6,597,946,000. Targeted and EFIG grants each receive $3,264,712,000. Additionally, $545,633,000 is separately appropriated for School Improvement Grants. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides an additional $13 billion for Title I-A, with $10 billion for LEA grants and $3 billion for School Improvement Grants. The Obama Administration requested a reduction in grants to LEAs for FY2010, with Basic Grants decreasing by $1.5 billion. However, there was a proposed increase of $1 billion for School Improvement Grants under Title I-A. The House passed H.R. 3293 for FY2010 appropriations for Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies. The House passed H.R. 3293 for FY2010 appropriations for Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, providing $14,492,401,000 for Title I-A grants to LEAs, $1,500,000,000 more than the Administration request for Basic Grants. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported its version of H.R. 3293, allocating $13,792,401,000 for Title I-A grants to LEAs, $800,000,000 more than the Administration request for Basic Grants. In FY2008, Title I-A funding increased by 8.3% compared to FY2007. Most states saw higher grants, except Wisconsin. 61% of LEAs received larger grants in FY2008, while 39% received lower grants due to a decrease in the number of school-age children in poor families. In FY2008, Title I-A funding increased by 8.3% compared to FY2007. Most states saw higher grants, except Wisconsin. 61% of LEAs received larger grants in FY2008, while 39% received lower grants due to a decrease in the number of school-age children in poor families. Tables 5-8 provide analyses of Title I-A fund distribution among states and LEAs, with variations in grant amounts reflecting different factors. The final section of the report discusses factors affecting Title I-A funding distribution, such as state minimum grant provisions, expenditure factors, and targeting on LEAs with large numbers of school-age children in poor families. Grants per formula child vary based on state size, expenditure factors, and poverty rates within LEAs. States with large numbers of LEAs with high poverty rates, such as Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, and New Mexico, receive below-average funding due to low expenditure factors. Some states like the District of Columbia, Hawaii, West Virginia, and Wisconsin have favorable equity factors, resulting in higher grants per formula child. However, many formula factors offset each other, leading to similar average grants per formula child compared to the national average. In FY2008, some states receive substantially higher or lower shares of Title I-A funds under different formulas. 19 states have significantly different shares under one of the four formulas, including seven small states with higher shares under Targeted and/or EFIG formulas than Basic or Concentration Grants. Four states with low poverty rates also show varying shares. In FY2008, some states receive significantly different shares of Title I-A funds under different formulas. 19 states have varying shares under one of the four formulas, including seven small states with higher shares under Targeted and/or EFIG formulas than Basic or Concentration Grants. Four states with low poverty rates also show differing shares. Vermont, Wyoming, Connecticut, Minnesota, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Louisiana, West Virginia, Nevada, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Utah, and Washington have substantially higher shares under specific formulas due to various factors. Table 7 provides average Title I-A grants per formula child for LEAs in different categories. The limited numbers of LEAs in each category in Table 7 illustrate patterns of Title I-A allocations, but may not represent all LEAs. The distinctive allocation patterns include higher grants per formula child under Targeted and EFIG formulas for selected LEAs with large numbers of formula children. These patterns will be further discussed in the issue analyses at the end of the report. Selected LEAs with large numbers of formula children receive higher grants per formula child under Targeted and EFIG formulas, while LEAs in minimum grant states receive higher grants per formula child than any other category. LEAs with low percentages of formula children receive grants below the national average. The distribution of Title I-A grants among LEAs varies based on locale categories, with numbers and percentages of formula children receiving grants below average. Table 8 displays this distribution, showing the percentage difference between grants going to LEAs and formula children. Puerto Rico is excluded from this analysis. The distribution of Title I-A grants among LEAs varies based on locale categories, with significant differences in shares of grants versus formula children. Urban areas receive substantially higher shares of grants than their share of formula children, particularly large city groups of LEAs. The distribution of Title I-A grants among LEAs varies based on locale categories, with significant differences in shares of grants versus formula children. Urban areas, particularly large city groups, receive substantially higher shares of grants. The town and rural LEA groups receive lower shares, while suburban LEAs receive lower shares but do not exceed the 10% threshold. The report discusses issues related to amending and reauthorizing the ESEA during the 111th Congress, noting that all factors used to calculate grants are updated annually. The Title I-A allocation formulas are now updated annually using poverty estimates from the Census Bureau's SAIPE program, replacing the previous decennial Census surveys. This change was implemented under the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 to ensure more accurate data for distributing grants among LEAs based on locale categories. The Secretary of Education and Commerce, along with recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences, have updated the population data used for allocating grants. The latest poverty estimates from the SAIPE program are now used to calculate grants based on LEA population data, following recommendations from the NAS panel. The latest poverty estimates from the SAIPE program are used to calculate Title I-A grants, updated annually since IY1999. SAIPE data are indirect estimates, not a separate household survey, and there is a two-year gap in income year estimates for FY2009 and FY2008 grants. The SAIPE program provides indirect estimates for poverty data using statistical modeling from various sources like the decennial census and household surveys. Updates to Title I-A grants aim to distribute funds based on the latest data on school-age children in poor families, but have caused significant shifts in allocation shares among states and regions. The updates to Title I-A grants have led to significant shifts in allocation shares among states and regions, with some states experiencing substantial changes in the estimated number of school-age children in poor families. Table 9 shows data from recent SAIPE estimates used for grant calculations, highlighting the year-to-year variation in poverty estimates. For example, the national aggregate poverty estimate increased by 0.3% from income year 2003 to 2004. The national aggregate poverty estimate increased by 0.3% from IY2003 to IY2004, with individual states ranging from -28.7% to +32.4%. Comparing IY2005 to IY2004, the national estimate increased by 3.8%, while individual states ranged from -9.3% to +27.6%. In IY2007, the national poverty estimate declined by 3.1%, with states varying from -22.6% to +12.7%. The SAIPE poverty estimates for states fluctuate widely annually, especially for states with small populations like Alaska and Montana. During FY1997-2001, special provisions were added to Title I-A appropriations legislation to limit the impact of updates on SAIPE poverty estimates. Hold harmless rates of 85-95% were provided at the LEA level, but higher 100% rates were applied at the state or state plus LEA levels. This occurred when there was little growth in Title I-A funding and significant shifts in the estimated number of school-age children in poor families across states. The states affected ranged from small populations like Alaska and Montana to larger states like Florida and Wisconsin. Beginning in FY2002, the 100% hold harmless rates were removed from Title I-A appropriations acts, leading to increased funding and initial funding of two formulas. This resulted in most states receiving more Title I-A funds, but as appropriations increases declined from FY2003-2007, many LEAs and some states saw reductions in grants. However, in FY2008, Title I-A appropriations increased by 8.3%. For FY2008, Title I-A appropriations increased by 8.3%, with only one state receiving a smaller allocation than the previous year. Concerns about the variability of poverty estimates may lead to proposals to limit reductions in Title I-A grants. One option could be to return to higher hold harmless rates to prevent decreases in grants due to fluctuations in poverty estimates. One option to address the variability of poverty estimates and prevent large swings in Title I-A funding for LEAs is to extend the four-year phase-out of hold-harmless provisions to Targeted and EFIG grants. Another alternative is to combine recent poverty estimates with estimates from previous years to mitigate the impact of annual fluctuations in poverty rates. One approach to address the fluctuation in poverty estimates and stabilize Title I-A funding for LEAs is to blend recent poverty estimates with estimates from previous years. This would help ease the transition to the most recent estimates gradually, reducing the impact of large changes in estimated poverty rates. For example, using the average of poverty estimates from the last two or three years in allocation formulas could be considered. Table 11 shows the potential impact on grants for FY2008 using this method. Comparisons are made between actual grants under current law and estimates under an alternative formula using the average of the latest and second most recent poverty estimates. Under the alternative formula, all states are estimated to have received higher grants for FY2008 compared to FY2007, with increases ranging from 1.8% to 16.1%. The range in variation from previous year grants is somewhat less under the alternative formula than under current law. Comparing estimated FY2008 grants under the alternative formula to actual grants, estimated differences range from -4.3% to 5.9%. Under an alternative formula, grants for FY2008 are estimated to increase for all states compared to FY2007, with variations ranging from -4.3% to 5.9%. This approach considers the latest poverty estimate or the average of the latest and previous year's estimate for each LEA, cushioning losses for areas with estimated decreases in poverty while giving credit for increases. This method has a more limited impact on grants compared to using the average of poverty estimates for the last two years for all LEAs. Under an alternative formula, grants for FY2008 are estimated to increase for all states compared to FY2007, with variations ranging from 0.5% to 19.9%. The range of variation falls between the wider range under current law and the somewhat more narrow range under another alternative formula. Estimated differences in grants fall within a relatively narrow range of -1.5% to 2.5%. Some may support using two-year averages for poverty data to address large variations in poverty estimates and subsequent grants. The SAIPE estimation process relies on sample survey data to increase the reliability of poverty estimates by combining estimates for multiple years. This would allow states and LEAs more time to adjust to changes in allocations and enhance program stability. However, opponents argue that averaging poverty estimates over two years or choosing the greater of the latest estimates would delay updates. Currently, there is a two- to three-year lag between income year and program year. The lag between income year and program year could be extended by using alternatives from Options 2 and 3. Reductions in poverty estimates are somewhat limited by LEA hold harmless provisions. Some suggest using the latest reliable poverty estimates for calculating Title I-A grants. One option is to limit the size of annual shifts in poverty estimates for certain states. The Title I-A allocation formulas are based on the annual percentage change in each state's estimated number of school-age children in poor families. If a state's percentage share of the national total estimated number of children in poverty declines by more than 10%, the estimate used for allocation will be adjusted to reflect a 10% reduction. This adjustment accounts for nationwide increases or decreases in poverty estimates. The Title I-A allocation formulas are based on the annual percentage change in each state's estimated number of school-age children in poor families. A provision limiting reductions in state share of poverty estimates would have affected several states, increasing grants to some while decreasing grants to others. Over 90% of the nation's LEAs receive grants under ESEA Title I-A, with most receiving funding except for those with very low poverty rates or few pupils. Some LEAs, including certain charter schools, are eligible for small Title I-A grants but choose not to participate due to perceived excessive responsibilities. Table 13 shows the distribution of grants among LEAs grouped by poverty rate quintile. Each quintile represents one-fifth of the nation's school-age children in poor families. The data are provided for each Title I-A allocation formula for FY2008. The distribution of Title I-A funds among LEAs varies significantly based on poverty rate quintiles. Basic Grants show a similar share for each quintile, while Concentration Grants have a lower share for the lowest-poverty quintile. Overall, there is a consistent pattern of fund allocation across all quintiles meeting eligibility thresholds. The distribution of Title I-A funds among LEAs varies based on poverty rate quintiles. Grants per poor child are similar for all LEAs meeting eligibility criteria for Basic and Concentration Grants. The distribution under Targeted and EFIG formulas increases steadily from the lowest to the second-highest poverty rate quintile. Grant per formula child continuously increases under these formulas. The allocation of Title I-A funds to LEAs is influenced by poverty rates, with higher funding going to LEAs with higher poverty rates. The Concentration, Targeted, and EFIG Grant formulas allocate more funds to LEAs in the top two poverty rate quintiles compared to the Basic Grant formula. The allocation of Title I-A funds to LEAs is influenced by poverty rates, with higher funding going to LEAs with higher poverty rates. The degree of targeting on high poverty LEAs for total Title I-A grants has increased since the enactment of the NCLB, but the shifts are relatively marginal. For example, the share of total Title I-A funds allocated to LEAs in the two highest poverty rate quintiles rose from 42.3% for FY2002 to 45.2% for FY2008. The analysis compares the distribution of Title I-A funds in FY2008 to FY2001, showing a slight increase in targeting high poverty LEAs. The Targeted and EFIG Grant formulas heavily consider the number and percentage of formula children in each LEA, impacting the targeting of high poverty areas. In FY2008, there was a slight increase in targeting high poverty LEAs for Title I-A funds compared to FY2001. The definition of \"high poverty\" LEAs based on formula children percentages or numbers resulted in 53.4% of grants going to such areas, compared to an estimated 47.9% in FY2001. This shift towards high poverty areas has sparked debates on fund distribution, with concerns about declines in funds going to low poverty LEAs. Low poverty LEAs are experiencing declines in funding despite facing increasing requirements under Title I-A. Funding for Basic Grants, available to LEAs with a child poverty rate of 2.0% to 5.0%, has decreased by 8.0% since FY2001. The Targeted and EFIG Grant formulas allocate more aid to LEAs with higher poverty rates or more formula children. This favors LEAs with high poverty rates in receiving increased funding. The weights in the LEA formula favor high poverty rates over high numbers of formula children. Despite this, the formulas tend to benefit LEAs with both high numbers of formula children and high poverty rates. Larger LEAs receive more weight for formula children, while moderately large LEAs benefit over those with moderately high poverty rates. The Targeted and EFIG Grant formulas provide funding based on poverty rates and numbers of formula children. Table 14 compares grant per formula child for high poverty LEAs with state averages. LEAs with high poverty rates receive more weight in the formulas. The EFIG formula factors in effort and equity, with variations in grants per formula child primarily due to hold harmless effects. The 15 largest LEAs in the nation receive higher grants per formula child under the Targeted and EFIG Grant formulas compared to other LEAs in the same state. Targeted Grants per formula child can be more than twice as high as the state average for the largest LEAs, while EFIG Grants can be more than three times as high. These grants are generally higher than the state average for LEAs with the highest poverty rates, but not as high as for the LEA with the largest number of formula children. The Targeted and EFIG Grant formulas are more favorable to LEAs with high numbers of formula children and high poverty rates. Larger LEAs can apply higher weights to more formula children than smaller LEAs. For example, Los Angeles, California, with a high number of formula children, compared to Hidalgo Independent LEA in Texas with high child poverty rates. The Targeted and EFIG Grant formulas favor LEAs with high numbers of formula children and high poverty rates. Los Angeles has a large majority of formula children in the highest weight category on the numbers scale, while Hidalgo has a smaller percentage in the highest weight category on the percentage scale. The impact of the formulas on different LEAs is shown in Table 16. The table in Table 16 compares state average grants per formula child with grants per formula child to different types of LEAs in Florida, Maryland, and Virginia. LEAs with large numbers of formula children receive grants significantly above the state average. LEAs with high percentages of formula children receive above-average grants in Virginia, but not in Florida or Maryland. The distribution of grants is influenced more by the number of formula children than by poverty rates. Adjustments could be made to the grant formulas to account for this. The distribution of Title I-A grants is influenced more by the number of formula children than by poverty rates. Adjustments could be made to the grant formulas to account for this, such as revising the formula child number scale and weighting scales used for EFIG Grants. State expenditure factors also play a significant role in grant distribution. The Title I-A grants distribution is influenced more by the number of formula children than by poverty rates. Adjustments could be made to the grant formulas to account for this, such as revising the formula child number scale and weighting scales used for EFIG Grants. State expenditure factors also play a significant role in grant distribution, with little incentive to increase state spending on K-12 education. The formulas partially compensate for the lack of a geographical cost adjustment for the poverty population factor income thresholds. The federal share is multiplied by state current expenditures for public education per pupil in the third preceding fiscal year, with floor and ceiling constraints in place. The expenditure factor for Title I-A grants ranges from $2,956 to $4,435 for most formulas, and $3,141 to $4,250 for EFIG Grants in FY2008. This factor acts as a \"weight\" in grant calculations, resulting in higher grants for states at the ceiling compared to the floor. The Title I-A allocation formulas include an expenditure factor to adjust grants based on educational costs and incentivize increased spending on public education. This factor results in higher grants for states with higher educational costs and rewards states with higher per-pupil spending. The Title I-A allocation formulas include an expenditure factor to adjust grants based on educational costs and incentivize increased spending on public education. This factor helps treat different regions of the nation more fairly by considering variations in average expenditures per pupil. However, the expenditure factor is based on state and local spending levels, not the actual costs of providing education in different states. A cost index would be more accurate in measuring relative costs of education across states. The average level of expenditures per pupil in each state for public elementary and secondary education services can vary due to factors such as ability to pay, population priorities, and nature of services provided. Differences in costs of providing education among LEAs within states are not accounted for by the Title I-A expenditure factor. The Title I-A expenditure factor in ESEA allocation formulas may increase grants based on state and local education spending, but limitations exist. Grants only increase if expenditures per pupil exceed the national average. The Title I-A expenditure factor in ESEA allocation formulas may increase grants based on state and local education spending. Grants only increase if expenditures per pupil exceed the national average by more than 4%. However, if a state's expenditure factor is already significantly above 120% or below 80% of the national average, an increase in state and local spending may not affect Title I-A grants. This lack of impact is due to the expenditure factor being the same for all LEAs in each state and based on aggregate state and local spending. Individual LEAs may have little incentive to increase their spending levels as a result. The Title I-A expenditure factor in ESEA allocation formulas may increase grants based on state and local education spending. However, individual LEAs may have little incentive to increase their spending levels as such increases might have minimal impact on aggregate state expenditures per pupil. If a state's expenditure factor is already between the floor and ceiling parameters, an increase in state and local spending may result in a small increase in Title I-A grants. For example, if California increased its average expenditure per pupil by $100, the estimated total Part A grants for FY2008 would likely increase. If the expenditure factor remains constant, estimated total Part A grants to California for FY2008 would increase by $10.7 million, equivalent to 1.7% of additional state and local funds needed to raise expenditure per pupil by $100. This small \"bonus\" with a three-year lag may not motivate states to increase education spending. The current expenditure factor rewards high spending but not effort relative to each state's fiscal capacity. The income thresholds are considered for the current expenditure factor. The income thresholds used to determine poverty vary only by family size, not by location. There are proposals for a cost of living adjustment, but none adopted. Concerns exist about the Title I-A expenditure factor due to limits in its rationale. The Title I-A expenditure factor is being questioned due to its \"disequalizing\" effect, providing higher grants to states with higher income levels. One proposal is to eliminate the factor and use the national average expenditure per pupil for all states, similar to the IDEA state grant program. Table 18 shows the estimated impact of this change on FY2008 Title I-A grants. The proposed change in the Title I-A allocation formula would eliminate the expenditure factor and use the national average expenditure per pupil for all states. This change would significantly impact grant levels, with some states seeing a 10% or more increase in grants while others would experience a decline of 10% or more. The \"dividing line\" between gaining and losing states would not be the national average. The elimination of the expenditure factor in the Title I-A allocation formula would result in states receiving grants based on the national average expenditure per pupil, which is typically 93-95% of the national average. This change would impact states with both above and slightly below average expenditures, as the national average is weighted by total school-age population, while the relevant factor for grants would be weighted by the number of poor and other children. States with high concentrations of poor children, which often have lower expenditure factors, would see a decrease in grants. A cost index could potentially replace the current Title I-A expenditure factor to reflect differences in educational costs. However, the lack of an official index for state or local variations poses a challenge. Efforts have been made to develop a Comparable Wage Index (CWI) for comparing educational costs across states and localities, as shown in Table 19. This index compares the current expenditure factor with the CWI as measures expressed as an index. The Comparable Wage Index (CWI) is used to measure state and local differences in the costs of providing public K-12 education by focusing on salaries for teachers and professional staff. It is based on wages paid to individuals in professions with similar educational requirements outside of K-12 education to minimize the influence of SEA and LEA policies. The CWI does not have a floor or ceiling applied to it, unlike the Title I-A expenditure factor. The CWI is used to measure state and local differences in education costs based on teacher salaries. There are significant differences in state values compared to the national average for Title I-A expenditure factors versus the CWI. Using the CWI instead of the expenditure factor would lead to major shifts in Title I-A grants among states. The correlation between the CWI and expenditure factor is limited, with some states having high expenditure factors but low CWI values. The CWI measures state and local education cost differences based on teacher salaries. Some states have high expenditure factors but low CWI values. Only a few states have a CWI below .80 or above 1.20. The CWI is calculated for individual LEAs and states to reflect cost differences. The Title I-A expenditure factor could be applied to all LEAs, not just at the state level. The current Title I-A expenditure factor aims to incentivize increased spending on public K-12 education or reward high expenditure levels. An alternative proposal is an effort index based on expenditures per pupil relative to state fiscal capacity. This index is limited in impact due to set boundaries, unlike the broader K-12 education expenditure effort index in the EFIG formula. The effort index in Table 20 is based on total state and local expenditures for public K-12 education relative to Total Taxable Resources (TTR). The TTR index measures the ability of governments to raise revenues and varies widely among states. Separate comparisons are made between the expenditure factor and effort factor using the same limits. The TTR-based effort index in Table 20 compares state and local education expenditures to Total Taxable Resources (TTR). States like Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia show significantly higher effort indexes compared to expenditure factors. Many Southern and Western states have low expenditure factors and total taxable resources. On the other hand, states like Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Virginia, Wyoming, and the District of Columbia have higher expenditure factors and total taxable resources. There are differences in Title I-A allocation formulas, raising questions about their distinct roles and purposes. The Title I-A program has four allocation formulas, which has led to complications and confusion. It was never intended to have multiple formulas, and there is interest in consolidating them into one formula. The program historically had one main formula, Basic Grants, and additional formulas for LEAs with high percentages of children in poverty. Consideration is being given to selecting one of the remaining three formulas or creating a new one. The Title I-A program has multiple allocation formulas, causing complications and confusion. There is interest in consolidating them into one formula, possibly combining elements of the Concentration, Targeted, and EFIG Grants formulas. Attention has been focused on funding levels compared to authorized amounts since the enactment of NCLB. Typically, ESEA authorizing statutes specify appropriations only for the first year, with remaining years authorized as \"such sums as may be necessary.\" The NCLB specified funding amounts for Title I-A for FY2002-2007, breaking from the usual practice of authorizing \"such sums as may be necessary.\" Advocates argue for \"full funding\" based on maximum payment calculations under the Basic Grant formula, even in years without specified authorization levels. This formula determines maximum payments for poor and \"formula children\" multiplied by a state expenditure factor, representing the \"full funding\" level for Title I-A. The NCLB specified funding amounts for Title I-A for FY2002-2007, with the goal of increasing funding to the maximum payment level for Basic Grants. However, appropriations for Title I-A were consistently below the authorized amounts each year during FY2002-FY2007. The NCLB specified funding amounts for Title I-A for FY2002-2007, aiming to increase funding to the maximum payment level for Basic Grants. However, appropriations for Title I-A were consistently below the authorized amounts each year, with the gap increasing annually. The practical impact of specifying authorization amounts may be questioned, as there is no precise way to determine the level of additional spending needed to improve low-achieving students' achievement. Despite this, specified authorizations provide a goal for increased funding and reflect the judgment of those involved in the authorization process. If authorization issues are to be specified for future years, there may be proposals to link them to specific goals. Table 21 provides appropriations for FY2001-FY2009 compared to authorization levels for Title I-A. Authorization levels for Title I-A beyond FY2008 are unspecified until new legislation is enacted. For FY2002, the authorization was $13.5 billion, with an appropriation of $10.35 billion, representing a 17.0% increase over FY2001. Funding for Title I-A increased by 14.0% for FY2003 compared to FY2002, with a 5.6% increase for FY2004 compared to FY2003. Funding remained flat from FY2004 to FY2007. In FY2008, there was an 8.3% increase over FY2007, and a 4.3% increase for FY2009. Additional funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) also contributed to a larger increase in funding. Appropriations for Title I-A decreased as a share of authorizations from FY2002 to FY2007, but rose somewhat in FY2008. In FY2002, Title I-A funding was 76% of the authorized amount, decreasing to 51% by FY2007 and increasing to 57% in FY2008. Reauthorization legislation may lead to higher authorization levels, potentially reaching $33.2 billion. The Title I-A EFIG formula is based on state average per pupil expenditure. The effort factor in the Title I-A EFIG formula is based on the comparison of state average per pupil expenditure for public education with state personal income per capita. The resulting index number indicates whether the ratio of expenditures per pupil to personal income is above or below the national average. However, the narrow bounds of the effort factor limit its impact, making it mostly symbolic. Expanding the bounds could address this issue. The effort factor in the Title I-A EFIG formula compares state average per pupil expenditure with state personal income per capita to determine if it is above or below the national average. Expanding the bounds of the effort factor could address its limited impact. An alternative structure based on aggregate measures like total state and local expenditures for public K-12 education and total personal income could provide different implications for states' effort levels based on demographic patterns. The difference between individual and aggregate measures of state effort is illustrated in Table 22, comparing an effort measure based on individual factors to one based on aggregate factors for each state. The differences between individual and aggregate measures of state effort are often substantial, favoring states with relatively few school-age children in the northeastern and north central regions, while aggregate measures favor states with high shares of school-age population in the south and west. The difference between individual and aggregate measures of state effort is shown in Table 22, with some states having lower aggregate effort than individual effort, while others have higher aggregate effort. The impact of these differences depends on the bounds of the EFIG formula effort factor. The formula is based on the coefficient of variation (CV) in average per pupil expenditure among LEAs in a state. In the EFIG formula, an extra weight is applied to estimated counts of children from poor families, maximizing grants for states with higher expenditures per pupil from poor families. State equity factors range from 0.0 to 0.25, with most falling in the 0.10 - 0.20 range. The equity factor is subtracted from 1.30 to determine a multiplier for state grants, with lower expenditure disparities leading to higher grants. The EFIG formula applies extra weight to children from poor families, increasing grants for states with higher expenditures per pupil from poor families. State equity factors range from 0.0 to 0.25, with lower expenditure disparities resulting in higher grants. There are concerns about adjustments for other high-cost groups of pupils, such as LEP pupils and pupils with disabilities, due to data availability and consistency issues. Data on these groups are now being compiled at the LEA level. The EFIG formula considers extra weight for children from poor families, with state equity factors ranging from 0.0 to 0.25. Concerns arise about adjustments for high-cost groups like LEP pupils and pupils with disabilities due to data consistency issues. Data on these groups are now compiled at the LEA level by the National Center for Education Statistics. Questions also arise about the appropriate weights for LEP pupils and pupils with disabilities in calculating state equity factors. Alternative concepts of equity beyond the coefficient of variation are being considered. In addition to the EFIG formula, alternative measures of school finance equity are reviewed in a 2000 report by the National Center for Education Statistics. LEAs allocate Title I-A funds based on the percentage of low-income students in each school, with a minimum threshold of 35% or the LEA's average. LEAs have the option to set higher thresholds to focus funds on fewer schools. LEAs can choose to concentrate Title I-A services on selected grade levels and allocate funds among schools based on the number of low-income families. Schools with higher percentages of low-income pupils may receive higher grants per child. If a school has low-income pupil percentages below 35%, a minimum amount of funds per child must be provided. The allocation of Title I-A funds to schools is based on the number of low-income families, with a minimum amount per child required for schools with low-income pupil percentages below 35%. However, there is a concern that middle and high schools are not receiving an equitable share of funds compared to elementary schools. Data shows that a majority of Title I-A participants are in prekindergarten through grade 6, with only a small percentage in grades 7-12. This disparity is attributed to LEAs focusing funds on selected grade levels. The allocation of Title I-A funds is based on low-income families, with concerns that middle and high schools are not receiving an equitable share compared to elementary schools. Data shows a majority of participants are in grades K-6, with lower participation rates in grades 7-12. There is interest in proposals to increase funding for middle and high schools to ensure equitable distribution. The Bush Administration proposed allocating at least 90 percent of increased Title I-A funds to high schools in their ESEA reauthorization proposal. Another option is to use the \"feeder school\" concept to increase funding for middle and high schools, as permitted by current ED policy guidance. In recent decades, Puerto Rico has been treated as a state in the Title I-A allocation formulas, with special provisions resulting in lower grants than if treated fully as a state. Constraints included a lower expenditure factor limit, gradually phased out under NCLB. The NCLB phased out constraints on Title I-A grants for Puerto Rico, with two remaining special constraints on allocation formulas. The effort factor is set at the minimum level, but has limited impact. A cap on the net weight applied to Puerto Rico's formula child count under the Targeted Grant formula is another constraint. The cap on the net weight applied to Puerto Rico's formula child count under the Targeted Grant formula is substantially lower than the unconstrained weight, resulting in a potential 60% increase in the Targeted Grant to Puerto Rico. The TANF population factor, affecting only a small minority of LEAs and states, is now extremely small and may be questioned for inclusion. The TANF factor, affecting a small number of LEAs and states, is historically significant but may be questioned for inclusion in Title I-A formulas. Only 4.1% of LEAs have children counted under the TANF factor, with these children making up 1% or more of Title I-A formula children in 148 LEAs. The impact of this factor is limited, with most affected LEAs in New York or Ohio and having a small population. The AFDC/TANF children have become a decreasing minority of all Title I-A formula children since the 1974 amendments. Each LEA is treated as a single entity by ED for grant allocation under Title I-A, with funds distributed based on schools' characteristics and poverty levels. Schools selected for Title I-A grants must meet a single poverty standard. Under Title I-A grants, schools are chosen based on a single poverty standard, with funds allocated equally per low-income child or varying amounts based on the percentage of low-income pupils. Exceptions are made for LEAs serving multiple counties. Three LEAs in the Nation serve multiple counties in their entirety: New York City, Hawaii, and Williamsburg/James City County in Virginia. Each county is treated as a separate LEA in the allocation of Title I-A funds, with grants calculated individually and then combined into a total grant for the LEA. The three LEAs serving multiple counties must allocate Title I-A funds based on each county's share of the school-age population, as required by federal regulations. This provision was added in the 1994 Improving America's Schools Act and extended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLBA, P.L. 107-110) introduced changes in the allocation of Title I-A grants, shifting from county-based calculations to LEA-based calculations. This transition aimed to address disparities in funding distribution within multi-county LEAs, ensuring fair allocation based on school-age population counts. The implementation of Title I-A grants under the No Child Left Behind Act has sparked debate, particularly in New York City. The multi-county LEA provision impacts funding for New York City, with potential increases if treated as a single LEA in grant calculations. This is evident in higher estimated grants under the Targeted Grant and Education Finance Incentive Grant formulas for New York City as a single LEA. For FY2008, increases in Targeted and EFIG Grants for New York City as a single LEA are offset by decreases in Basic and Concentration Grants due to hold harmless levels varying among LEAs based on poverty rates. Hold harmless rate for New York City is 90% as one LEA, but Bronx and New York counties qualify for a higher 95% rate if treated as separate LEAs. In FY2008, New York City receives higher grants under Basic and Concentration Grant formulas when treated as five LEAs due to declining estimated number of formula children. If treated as a single LEA, it would receive the same amount under Basic and Concentration Grants, and more under Targeted and EFIG Grants if the city's share of formula children were steady or increasing. Compliance with the multi-county LEA provision of Title I-A could involve setting varying school eligibility thresholds or allocating the same dollar amount per low-income child to each eligible school. Between 1995 and 2003, New York City adjusted school eligibility thresholds citywide and allocated varying amounts per low-income child to comply with Title I-A county provision. From 2003-2004 onwards, they used a combination of variations in school eligibility thresholds and allocations per low-income child to comply with the county provision. In the 2008-2009 school year, both Title I-A funds per low-income pupil and school eligibility thresholds varied among the City's counties. In the 2008-2009 school year, Title I-A funds per low-income pupil and school eligibility thresholds varied among the five counties in New York City. The school eligibility threshold was lower for Queens and Richmond counties compared to the other three counties. The amount allocated per child from a low-income family attending an eligible school also varied across counties. The estimated impact of eliminating the Title I-A multi-county LEA provision in New York City would result in a 49% decline in funding for schools in Richmond county and an 11% decline for Kings county. Conversely, Queens county would see a 2% increase, Bronx county a 3% increase, and New York county a 9% increase in funding. This variation is due to differences in the distribution of school-age children in poor families across the counties. For FY2008, Richmond County has 3.6% of school-age children in poor families but only 1.5% in areas of concentrated poverty eligible for Title I-A grants. In contrast, Queens County has 15.4% of children in poor families and 19.4% in concentrated poverty eligible for Title I-A grants. Arguments support the special rule for multi-county LEAs. Arguments in favor of the current special rule for multi-county LEAs include the historical allocation of Title I-A funds to individual counties in New York City based on the number of school-age children in poor families. Opponents argue that New York City should be treated as a single LEA like others in the Nation. Eliminating the special provision for multi-county LEAs in New York City would shift funds from the county with the lowest child poverty rate to counties with higher poverty rates, ultimately increasing Title I-A funds for the city as a whole."
