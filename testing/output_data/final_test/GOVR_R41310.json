    "content": "Most collective bargaining agreements are between an employer and a labor union, lasting for a specific period of time. Pre-hire agreements in the construction industry can be negotiated before workers are hired for a project. These agreements can be project labor agreements that apply to a specific construction project and specify wages and benefits. Contractors and subcontractors on the project are bound by the agreement. Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) may require union hiring hall use or union membership for employees. Workers can petition the NLRB to decertify the union. Disputes under PLAs can go to mediation and arbitration. PLAs prohibit strikes by unions and lockouts by contractors. They have been used in the US since the 1930s for major projects like the Grand Coulee Dam and Walt Disney World. Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) have been utilized in major projects across the US since the 1930s, including the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, Walt Disney World, and the Kennedy Space Center. The total number of PLAs is unknown, but they have been used in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. President Obama signed Executive Order 13502 in 2009, encouraging federal agencies to consider requiring PLAs on large-scale construction projects with costs exceeding $25 million. The federal government issued an order in 2009 encouraging agencies to consider requiring Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) on large-scale construction projects exceeding $25 million. Agencies are not mandated to use PLAs but can do so if it benefits the government's interests. Quarterly reports on contracts for such projects were requested by the Office of Management and Budget. Final regulations implementing the Executive Order were issued in 2010. The regulations implementing President Obama's EO on Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) went into effect on May 13, 2010. PLAs bind all contractors and subcontractors on a construction project, allowing them to compete for contracts regardless of union affiliation. They include guarantees against job disruptions, procedures for resolving labor disputes, and mechanisms for labor-management cooperation. Agencies are encouraged to consider PLAs early in the acquisition process and may specify the terms and conditions of a PLA. The final rule on Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) allows agencies to specify terms and conditions. Factors for consideration include multiple contractors, skilled worker shortages, project duration, past PLA use, promoting long-term interests, and other relevant factors. Federal agencies may use PLAs on around 30 construction projects annually, based on data from FY2008 and FY2009. Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) provide uniform wages, benefits, and working conditions for construction projects, ensuring a reliable workforce, preventing strikes, and simplifying project management. PLAs help control labor costs, making it easier to complete projects on time and within budget. Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) help ensure projects are completed on time and on budget by setting standard labor costs and improving worker safety. However, opponents argue that PLAs can increase costs and impede efficiency by limiting nonunion contractors' ability to bid on projects and manage the project in the most efficient manner. Nonunion contractors may face restrictions that hinder project efficiency, such as union requirements for workers and pension plans. However, evidence does not show that nonunion construction projects are less safe than union projects. Federal agencies enforce labor standards and workplace safety on construction projects. The Davis-Bacon Act requires federal construction projects to pay workers prevailing wages and fringe benefits based on Department of Labor surveys. The prevailing wage is determined by the majority wage in a job classification or the weighted average wage if no majority exists. In some cases, the locally prevailing wage may be the local union wage. On federal construction projects, contractors may pay workers the local union wage, even without a Project Labor Agreement (PLA). Proponents and opponents of PLAs disagree on their economic effects, as projects using PLAs may differ from those that do not. It is challenging to compare contractor performance on projects with and without PLAs due to differences in cost, size, scope, and timing. The economic effects of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) can be difficult to isolate, especially if contractors use PLAs for their advantages. Research has shown that PLAs can increase project costs, with one study finding a 26% increase in bids for projects in New York. The Thruway Authority hired a consultant to negotiate a PLA for the Tappan Zee Bridge project, resulting in a $6 million cost reduction. The PLA standardized project terms and conditions, replacing 19 local CBAs. Another study at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory showed a 0.4% cost reduction due to lower labor costs and increased apprentice usage. Recent studies have varied in their conclusions on the economic impact of PLAs. The Beacon Hill Institute at Suffolk University conducted studies on the impact of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) on construction costs. They found that PLAs increased costs by $16.51 per square foot in Boston and $30.00 per square foot in Connecticut. The studies controlled for project size, type, and other factors. The study examined the effects of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) on school construction costs in Massachusetts and California. The Massachusetts study found that while projects with PLAs were larger and more expensive, the relationship between PLAs and construction costs was not statistically significant. The California study collected information on 551 projects to analyze the impact of PLAs on construction costs. The study in California analyzed 551 school construction projects, including 65 with a PLA. Projects with a PLA cost 13-15% more per square foot, but most were in Los Angeles with already high construction costs. Another study for the VA found that PLAs can benefit construction costs in highly unionized cities. The study found that Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) can have a beneficial effect by providing consistent wages and work rules in areas with high unionization. However, in cities with low unionization, PLAs may increase construction costs by 5% to 9%. A separate study for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs concluded that a PLA could raise construction costs by 3% to 5% in Pittsburgh, PA. Qualitative research on PLAs highlighted advantages such as assuring timely completion of projects and a steady flow of qualified labor. Interviewees discussed the benefits and drawbacks of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) in the construction industry. While some praised PLAs for ensuring a steady supply of qualified labor, others criticized them for potentially increasing the bargaining power of construction unions. Research on the cost impact of PLAs remains inconclusive due to difficulties in comparing projects with and without PLAs. Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) in construction projects are difficult to analyze due to challenges in controlling for all factors affecting costs. Factors like prevailing wages, quality of construction, timeliness, and safety records are not always accounted for in statistical models. The relationship between PLAs and construction costs is complex and interdependent, as PLAs may impact costs, but the size and cost of construction projects can also influence the use of PLAs."
