The Act highlights the United States' unique achievement in landing humans on the Moon and returning them safely, paying tribute to the fallen Apollo 1 crew. The Apollo 11 mission achieved the national goal set by President Kennedy in 1961 during the Cold War, showcasing the strength and determination of the United States in space exploration. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, designed and tested the powerful Saturn V rocket for the Apollo missions in the 1960s and 1970s. The Saturn V generated more power than 86 Hoover Dams and enabled NASA to complete eight Apollo missions, landing 12 men on the Moon and collecting over 800 pounds of lunar samples. Around 400,000 Americans contributed to these missions. The Apollo program, including Mercury and Gemini programs, involved 400,000 Americans and inspired STEM careers. The 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing will be on July 20, 2019. The Secretary of the Treasury will mint and issue commemorative coins for the 50th anniversary of the first manned Moon landing. The coins include $5 gold coins, $1 silver coins, and half-dollar clad coins with specific weights, diameters, and metal compositions. The commemorative coins for the 50th anniversary of the first manned Moon landing will include $5 gold coins, $1 silver coins, and half-dollar clad coins minted to specific specifications. The coins will be legal tender and considered numismatic items, with the silver coins weighing 5 ounces and containing .999 fine silver. The coins will also have a convex shape similar to the 2014 National Baseball Hall of Fame coins. The coins minted for the 50th anniversary of the first manned Moon landing will have a design similar to the 2014 National Baseball Hall of Fame coins, with a convex shape on the reverse resembling an astronaut's helmet visor. Congress suggests that the design should extend from the reverse to the obverse without increasing the purchase price. The design will be chosen by the Secretary in consultation with the Commission of Fine Arts. The design of the coins minted for the 50th anniversary of the first manned Moon landing will be determined through a competition overseen by the Secretary in consultation with the Commission of Fine Arts, NASA Administrator, and Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee. The coins will feature inscriptions including the year \"2019\" and words like \"Liberty\" and \"In God We Trust\". The design selection process for coins minted for the 50th anniversary of the first manned Moon landing involves submitting proposals to the Secretary for approval. Artists, engravers, and the public can participate in the competition, with designs kept anonymous until a final selection is made. The winning design will receive compensation of at least $5,000. The common reverse design of the coins will feature a close-up representation. The coins minted under this Act will feature a close-up of the famous \"Buzz Aldrin on the Moon\" photograph, showing the visor and part of the helmet reflecting the image of the United States flag and lunar lander. The coins will be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities for a 1-year period starting January 1, 2019, and sold by the Secretary at a price including face value, a surcharge, and other costs. The Secretary will make bulk sales of coins at a discount and accept prepaid orders before issuance. All sales of coins will include a surcharge of $35 per $5 coin and $10 per $1 coin. The surcharges for different coins are $10 for the $1 coin, $5 for the half-dollar coin, and $50 for another $1 coin. The surcharges received will be distributed to the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum and the Astronauts Memorial Foundation for various purposes related to space exploration. The surcharges from the issuance of coins will be distributed to the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum, the Astronauts Memorial Foundation, and the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation for promoting space exploration, science, and technology education, and providing college scholarships for students in STEM fields. Recipients will be subject to audit requirements. No surcharge can be included for any coin issuance in a calendar year if the conditions are not met. The Secretary of the Treasury may issue guidance to limit the number of commemorative coin programs issued in a calendar year. Financial assurances must be in place to ensure no net cost to the government and that all costs related to designing and issuing coins are covered before any funds are disbursed to recipients. The United States Treasury recovers all costs related to designing and issuing coins, including labor, materials, machinery, design compensation, overhead expenses, marketing, and shipping. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
