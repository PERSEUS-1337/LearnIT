    "content": "The \"Veterans Fiduciary Act of 2004\" is defined as the Act. The definition of fiduciary is provided in the Act. The \"Veterans Fiduciary Act of 2004\" defines a fiduciary as a person legally responsible for the care of a claimant or beneficiary, or appointed to receive money for the benefit of a minor or incompetent individual. The \"Veterans Fiduciary Act of 2004\" defines a fiduciary as a person legally responsible for the care of a claimant or beneficiary, or appointed to receive money for the benefit of a minor or incompetent individual. Section 5506 of the act makes conforming amendments to Section 5502, replacing terms like \"guardian, curator, conservator\" with \"fiduciary\" to clarify responsibilities in providing fiduciary services for benefits under the title. Additionally, Section 6101 is amended to remove references to \"guardian, curator\" in alignment with the definition of fiduciary. The title is amended to replace terms like \"guardian, curator\" with \"fiduciary\" for the benefit of a minor, incompetent, or other beneficiary under laws administered by the Secretary. SEC. 3. Investigation and qualification of fiduciaries. Section 3 introduces a new section in Chapter 55 of title 38, United States Code, regarding the investigation and qualification of fiduciaries for beneficiaries. The certification of a person as a fiduciary must be based on an investigation of their fitness for the role, including a face-to-face interview when possible. The Secretary must investigate and certify a person as a fiduciary for a beneficiary based on their fitness for the role, including checking for any criminal convictions resulting in imprisonment for over a year. If convicted, the Secretary may certify the person only after determining rehabilitation and suitability for the role. The Secretary may expedite investigations for fiduciaries, waiving certain requirements. This applies to parents of minors, spouses or parents of incompetent beneficiaries, or court-appointed fiduciaries. The Secretary may expedite investigations for fiduciaries, waiving certain requirements, such as adding new items after the amendment made by section 2(a)(2). SEC. 4. MISUSE OF BENEFITS BY FIDUCIARIES. Investigation and qualification of fiduciaries may be expedited by the Secretary, waiving certain requirements. Sec. 6106 of Chapter 61 of title 38, United States Code, addresses the misuse of benefits by fiduciaries. It states that a fiduciary cannot collect a fee if it is determined that they misused the beneficiary's benefits. Additionally, fiduciaries not affiliated with government agencies can be held liable for misusing a beneficiary's benefits. If a fiduciary misuses a beneficiary's benefit, they are liable for the amount misused, treated as an erroneous payment, and must repay it to the United States. The Secretary will recover the amount and pay it back to the beneficiary. The total amount paid to the beneficiary cannot exceed the total benefit amount misused by the fiduciary. The misuse of benefits by a fiduciary occurs when they receive payment for a beneficiary but use it for other purposes. The Secretary can define the meaning of \"use and benefit\" through regulations. The Secretary's determination of fiduciary misuse of benefits is final. If the Secretary's negligent failure to investigate or monitor a fiduciary leads to benefit misuse, the Secretary must reimburse the beneficiary or alternate fiduciary. This negligence includes not timely reviewing a fiduciary's accounting or not acting promptly on misuse allegations. The Secretary must reimburse beneficiaries for fiduciary misuse of benefits, including cases of negligence in investigating or monitoring fiduciaries. If misuse occurs, the Secretary will reissue the benefit payment to the beneficiary or alternative fiduciary. The Secretary will make efforts to recoup payments from fiduciaries in cases of misuse, with a clerical amendment to the table of sections. SEC. 5. ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS FOR BENEFICIARIES WITH FIDUCIARIES. 6106. Misuse of benefits by fiduciaries. 6107. Reissuance of benefits. Sec. 5508 of title 38, United States Code, requires periodic onsite reviews of institutional fiduciaries in the US who receive benefits on behalf of individuals appointed as fiduciaries under section 5502. This includes fiduciaries serving 15 or more individuals, certified community-based nonprofit social service agencies. The term 'certified community-based nonprofit social service agency' refers to a nonprofit agency that serves as a fiduciary for 50 or more individuals and meets specific bonding and licensing requirements set by the Secretary of the agency. The Secretary must submit a biennial report to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs detailing the results of onsite reviews of fiduciaries and any corrective actions taken in connection with benefits under this title. The biennial report to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs will detail the results of onsite reviews of fiduciaries, corrective actions taken, number of cases of misuse of benefits, actions taken by the Secretary, and final dispositions including penalties imposed. The Secretary may require fiduciaries to file reports or accountings. If a fiduciary fails to submit the required report, the Secretary can require them to appear in person to receive benefit payments. The Secretary may require fiduciaries to file reports or accountings, and if they fail to do so, they may be required to appear in person to receive benefit payments. Additionally, new items were added by an amendment made in section 3(b). Section 5508 mandates periodic onsite reviews of institutional fiduciaries, while section 5509 grants authority to redirect benefit payments if a fiduciary fails to provide required accounting. Chapter 61 of title 38, United States Code, is further amended to include new sections on civil monetary penalties for conversion of benefit payments meant for another individual. Section 6109 authorizes federal courts to order restitution when sentencing a defendant convicted of conversion of benefit payments intended for another individual. This includes civil monetary penalties of up to $5,000 per conversion and an assessment of up to twice the amount converted. Amounts collected under this section are used to cover the Department's collection costs. Federal courts can order restitution for defendants convicted of misusing benefits under this title. The Department is considered the victim in these cases. If full or partial restitution is not ordered, the court must provide reasons. Amounts collected through restitution orders are used to cover expenses incurred by the Department. The appropriations Acts can be used to cover expenses for supervising and investigating fiduciaries. Amounts received from fiduciaries misusing funds paid as benefits are to be returned to the individual unless the Secretary has reissued the benefits, in which case the amounts are treated as overpayments and deposited accordingly. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATES. This Act and its amendments will take effect on the first day of the seventh month after enactment. Sections 6106 and 6107 of title 38 will apply to determinations of fiduciary fund misuse made after enactment. SEC. 7. REPORT TO CONGRESS. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will prepare a report evaluating procedures for fiduciary qualification to protect benefits from misuse. The report will be submitted to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs within 270 days of the Act's enactment, including any appropriate recommendations."
