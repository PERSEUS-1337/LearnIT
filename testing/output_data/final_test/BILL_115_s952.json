    "content": "The Act titled \"End Banking for Human Traffickers Act of 2017\" aims to increase the financial industry's role in combating human trafficking. The \"End Banking for Human Traffickers Act of 2017\" amends the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 to include the Secretary of the Treasury in the President's Interagency Task Force. It also requires the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council to review and enhance training procedures for anti-money laundering programs to target human trafficking operations and refer potential cases to law enforcement agencies. The Interagency Task Force is required to submit recommendations to Congress and financial institutions within 180 days to revise anti-money laundering programs targeting money laundering related to human trafficking. The recommendations must include successful anti-human trafficking programs. Recommended changes to internal policies, procedures, and employee training programs at financial institutions to better deter and detect money laundering related to human trafficking. Recommended revisions to existing regulatory requirements and guidelines for reporting suspicious transactions by financial institutions to facilitate data collection on suspected human trafficking. Additionally, a new reporting requirement is added to describe efforts to eliminate money laundering related to human trafficking. The General, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, must report on efforts to combat money laundering related to human trafficking, including investigations and convictions. This Act does not grant rule-making authority to the Interagency Task Force. Definitions include terms like \"anti-money laundering program\" and \"appropriate Federal banking agency.\" The Insurance Act defines human trafficking as sex trafficking induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or involving individuals under 18, and labor trafficking through force, fraud, or coercion for purposes of involuntary servitude. The Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking is established by the President. The term \"law enforcement agency\" is defined as an agency authorized to engage in the prevention, detection, investigation, or prosecution of criminal or civil law violations at the federal, state, or local level, as per section 105 of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000."
