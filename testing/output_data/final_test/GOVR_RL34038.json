Senator Jack Reed proposed an amendment on September 4, and after debate, the Senate adopted the measure on September 6. The bill was incorporated into Division B of another appropriations bill on November 5, but was later stripped during Senate debate. It was eventually combined with other bills on December 17 to form Division I of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal. The appropriations bill introduced by Representative Chet Edwards on June 11, 2007, was passed by the House on June 15 and sent to the Senate. Senator Jack Reed proposed an amendment on September 4, which was adopted by the Senate on September 6. The bill was eventually combined with other bills on December 17 to form Division I of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2008, which was enacted by the President on December 26, 2007 (P.L. 110-161). The House version of the appropriations bill during the 109th Congress transferred key provisions to the House Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense. The former Subcommittee on Military Quality of Life became the Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies. Congress typically funds the act by appropriating directly to defined accounts like Military Construction \u2013 Army or Family Housing \u2013 Air Force. The President submits detailed justifications for individual construction projects in the annual budget documentation. President George W. Bush issued Executive Order (E.O.) 13457 on January 29, 2008, titled \"Protecting American Taxpayers From Government Spending on Wasteful projects.\" Congress receives detailed justifications for construction projects annually, with committees approving, disapproving, or adding to project lists in explanatory statements. The legal standing of statements in explanatory reports is less clear compared to statutory language in legislation. President George W. Bush issued Executive Order (E.O.) 13457 on January 29, 2008, titled \"Protecting American Taxpayers From Government Spending on Wasteful projects.\" The order prohibits executive agencies from using earmarks included in non-statutory sources for funding unless required by law or deemed meritorious under statutory criteria. The impact of E.O. 13457 on current appropriation practices is uncertain. The Executive Order (E.O.) 13457 issued by President George W. Bush on January 29, 2008, prohibits executive agencies from using earmarks unless required by law or deemed meritorious. The E.O. uses terms like \"should\" and \"shall\" to provide guidance and directives, respectively. It only applies to appropriations enacted after January 29, 2008, and does not affect existing or prior-year appropriations. The E.O. does not prevent congressionally directed funding if it is required by law or deemed meritorious. The President's order allows agency heads to consider congressional views on earmarks, which may affect clarity on spending avoidance. The Executive Order raises questions about future expenditure of appropriated funds, particularly regarding construction projects not explicitly stated in statutory text. It grants agency heads authority to accept congressionally directed projects. The Executive Order grants agency heads the authority to accept congressionally directed funding for projects with merit under statutory criteria or other merit-based decision-making. The 109th Congress failed to pass the Military Construction, Military Quality of Life, and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2007, leading to funding sustained by continuing resolutions. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2007, under H.R. 5631 (P.L. 109-289), continued appropriations through various resolutions until the end of Fiscal Year 2007. This included modifications to military construction and veterans benefits. President George W. Bush recommended an additional $93.4 billion emergency supplemental appropriation for the Global War on Terror in his Fiscal Year 2008 Budget Request. The funds would be used for military construction to improve force protection and safety for U.S. military forces. The supplemental request asked to add $1.38 billion to the FY2007 Army military construction account, $412.5 million to the FY2007 Navy and Marine Corps military construction account, and $60.2 million to the FY2007 Air Force military construction account. The funds would be used for theater-located operations facilities, housing, maintenance, and training infrastructure to support an expansion of Army and Marine Corps ground combat forces. Military construction was included in the budget for \"Continuing the Fight\" and \"Enhancing Ground Forces.\" $980.0 million allocated for construction in Iraq and Afghanistan to support ground force operations. Navy to spend $85.1 million in Djibouti and Guantanamo, Air Force $60.2 million in Afghanistan. $100 million for transitioning Army and Marine units, $729 million for housing and facilities for 92,000 new troops by 2012.

In February 2007, the Department of Defense requested $141.7 billion for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, with additional funding for MRAP vehicles in July and further amendments in October, bringing the total supplemental request to $189.3 billion for FY2008. Construction funding of $42.3 billion was requested in the FY2008 supplemental budget, totaling $189.3 billion. The funding was allocated for various initiatives related to ongoing military operations, including airfield and maintenance enhancements in Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan, and Iraq, as well as new communications and operations centers in Kuwait and Qatar. Other projects included a new headquarters for a Combined Joint Task Force in Djibouti and a special operations logistics warehouse in Qatar.

Military construction accounts provide funds for new construction, improvements, planning, and host nation support of military forces and Department of Defense agencies. The Security Investment Program (NSIP) is the U.S. contribution to support NATO commands with construction costs. Family housing accounts fund construction, maintenance, and utilities for military personnel. The Chemical Demilitarization Construction account is for disposal facilities for chemical weapons. The Base Realignment and Closure Account 1990 funds environmental remediation from previous BRAC rounds. The Base Realignment and Closure Account 2005 provides funding for military construction, relocation, and environmental requirements for the 2005 BRAC round and the DOD Integrated Global Presence and Basing Strategy. Funding details for military construction are listed in the Department of Defense appropriations request for Fiscal Year 2007. The DOD's Base Realignment and Closure Account 2005 funded military construction, relocation, and environmental requirements for the 2005 BRAC round and the Integrated Global Presence and Basing Strategy. The estimated cost for the redeployment of troops and families within the US rose to over $30.7 billion, leading to the introduction of the BRAC Cost Overruns Protection Act in 2007. The BRAC Cost Overruns Protection (BRAC COP) Act of 2007, modeled after the Nunn-McCurdy amendment, aims to address cost overruns in base closure or realignment recommendations. It requires the Secretary of Defense to revise business plans for recommendations with costs exceeding 25%, with Congress empowered to disapprove recommendations. Additionally, increased funding is allocated for the replacement of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Funding for the replacement of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center with a new Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and a community hospital at Ft. Belvoir is addressed in the FY2008 Emergency Supplemental Request for the Global War on Terror. Bills have been introduced in Congress to close Ft. Monmouth, NJ, with a focus on Army communications and electronics research. These bills would ban funding for personnel and function transfers until an audit is completed to assess the impact on the Global War on Terror. The BRAC Commission recommended closing Ft. Monmouth, NJ, with no time limit on submission. Implementation costs for redeployments to new garrisons are included in the BRAC 2005 cost estimate. DOD allocated $756.9 million for redeployment out of the $8.2 billion FY2008 BRAC 2005 appropriation request. $5.6 billion was appropriated for BRAC implementation through November 16, 2007. DOD recommended increasing end strength for Army and Marine Corps. The Department of Defense plans to increase the Marine Corps by 27,000 Marines and the Army National Guard and Army Reserves by 9,200 citizen-soldiers over the next five years, requiring additional military construction costing $15.7 billion between 2007 and 2013. The Senate Committee on Appropriations noted the lack of a comprehensive plan detailing the scope and cost of the total military construction requirement associated with this initiative. The Department of Defense is increasing the Marine Corps and Army National Guard/Reserves, requiring $15.7 billion in military construction. The lack of a comprehensive plan for stationing decisions was noted by the Committee, urging the Secretary of Defense to provide a \"Grow the Force\" plan to Congress. Efforts are being made to redeploy troops to the US and renegotiate overseas installations, focusing on Germany, Italy, Korea, and Japan, with new installations in eastern Europe and other areas. Funding is requested for military construction in the Central Command area, including Afghanistan and Djibouti. The establishment of AFRICOM may lead to future construction in Africa. U.S. forces are consolidating in Germany and expanding installations in Italy. Plans are in place to move Marines and their families from Okinawa to Guam, with Japan covering 60% of the $10 billion construction costs. The Senate Committee on Appropriations expressed concern about the expansion of U.S. forces on Guam, which will involve personnel and family members being redeployed from Okinawa and bases in the United States. The Government Accountability Office reported that the Department of Defense had not fully considered the \"residual value\" of property being returned to host nations in its infrastructure planning for overseas military installations. The Department of Defense has not finalized the number or makeup of forces being transferred to Guam from Japan and the United States, making it difficult to estimate housing, training, and operational requirements. U.S. forces in South Korea are shifting from sites along the Demilitarized Zone to expanded facilities further south, with potential U.S. construction funding of up to $750 million needed. The Department of Veterans Affairs administers federal agencies for veterans. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administers programs providing benefits to veterans, including disability compensation, pensions, medical care, insurance, home loan guarantees, burial benefits, and educational/training benefits.

VHA also covers care for veterans' dependents through CHAMPVA. The Administration requested $34.6 billion for VHA in FY2008, a 1.7% increase from FY2007. The total funding available, including third-party collections, would be approximately $37.0 billion. $27.2 billion is requested for medical services, $3.4 billion for medical administration, $3.6 billion for medical facilities, and $411 million for medical and prosthetic research. The Administration proposed cost-sharing measures for veterans in FY2008, including tiered annual enrollment fees and increased pharmacy copayments to generate additional government revenue. The Administration proposed cost-sharing measures for veterans in FY2008 to increase government revenue. This includes billing veterans directly for treatment associated with nonservice-connected conditions, aiming to generate $311 million in revenue in FY2008 and $1.6 billion over five years. The Administration proposes eliminating cost-sharing measures for veterans in FY2008, aiming to increase government revenue by $44 million in FY2008 and $217 million over five years. The House passed H.R. 2642 providing $37.1 billion for the VHA in FY2008, including $29.0 billion for medical services, $1.9 billion above the President's request. The House-passed H.R. 2642 includes $3.0 billion over the FY2007 enacted amount for the VHA in FY2008. It also allocates funds for medical administration, facilities, and research, with increases above the President's request. Additionally, bill language specifies funding for specialty mental health care, homeless veterans, substance abuse, and blind rehabilitation services. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $37.0 billion for VHA in FY2008, including $29.0 billion for medical services, $3.6 billion for medical administration, $4.1 billion for medical facilities, and $500 million for medical and prosthetic research. No fee increases were recommended, and no funding for the VA was included in H.R. 3043. The final version of H.R. 3043 did not include funding for the VA. It would have provided $37.2 billion for VHA for FY2008, including $29.1 billion for medical services, with additional funding for various programs such as substance abuse services and Vet Centers. The conference agreement also specified minimum amounts to be spent on specialty mental health care and homeless grants. $130 million allocated for homeless grants and per diem program by the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC) responsible for maintaining U.S. monuments and memorials honoring armed forces achievements since World War I. ABMC oversees 24 cemeteries and 25 monuments in 15 countries, including the World War II Memorial in Washington, DC.

The FY2008 Omnibus also includes funds above the budget request for these purposes. The Armed Forces Retirement Home Trust Fund provides funds for the operation and maintenance of the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Washington, DC. The Armed Forces Retirement Home in Washington, DC and Gulfport, Mississippi provide housing and medical care for needy veterans. The Gulfport facility was damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and residents were transferred to the Washington, DC location. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed for the rebuilding of the Gulfport facility with a completion date in 2010, funded by the Armed Forces Retirement Home Trust Fund. The Retirement Home Trust Fund is maintained through various sources, including a $0.50 per month assessment on military personnel. The FY2008 budget includes a federal contribution of $5.1 million and $800,000 for a study on the trust fund's long-term viability.
