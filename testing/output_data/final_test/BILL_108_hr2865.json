    "content": "The \"Clean Air Incentive Act of 2003\" is also known as the Clean Air Incentive Act. It introduces a credit for qualified ozone attainment vehicle property under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Clean Air Incentive Act of 2003 introduces a tax credit for qualified ozone attainment vehicle property placed in service during the taxable year, with varying cost limitations based on the type of vehicle. The tax credit for qualified ozone attainment vehicle property has cost limitations based on the type of vehicle, with varying amounts depending on the weight rating. The credit cannot exceed the regular tax reduced by other credits, over the tentative minimum tax. The tax credit for qualified clean-fuel vehicle property in designated ozone nonattainment areas includes special rules for basis reduction and recapture if the property no longer qualifies. No credit allowed for property used outside the United States or if the taxpayer elects not to apply the section to a vehicle. Coordination with deduction for clean-fuel vehicles limits the cost for motor vehicles under subsection (a)(1)(A). The cost of a vehicle for tax purposes should not exceed the cost without this provision, minus any credit received under section 30B. Conforming amendments are made to the tax code. The provision allows for a credit for qualified ozone attainment vehicle property under section 30B. The amendment to the tax code includes adding a new paragraph related to section 30B(e)(1) and adjusting the net minimum tax for the taxable year. The amendment to the tax code includes changes to section 29(b)(6)(B) and 30B(c)(2), with an effective date after December 31, 2003."
