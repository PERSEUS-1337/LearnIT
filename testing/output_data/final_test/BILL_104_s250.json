The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts will prepare an analysis of bills and resolutions, estimating litigation costs to Federal and State courts resulting from their enactment. The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts will estimate the litigation costs to Federal and State courts resulting from the enactment of bills and resolutions, including attorneys' fees and increased liability for government agencies over a five-year period. The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts will estimate the increased liability for the private sector resulting from bills and resolutions over a five-year period. This estimation includes the basis for each estimate and a description of methods for establishing Federal financial commitments. These provisions do not apply to private bills or those reported by the Committee on Appropriations. The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts will provide analysis to appropriate committees on the increased liability for the private sector resulting from bills and resolutions. This analysis must be submitted before the committee files the bill or resolution and included in the committee report. Senators can request analysis for unreported bills, resolutions, or amendments. Technical and Conforming Amendment: The table of sections for chapter 41 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by adding a new section after section 612. In the Senate, it is not allowed to consider bills, resolutions, or certain amendments without an analysis from the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. This rule applies to bills not reported by a committee and amendments not related to appropriations. Waivers or suspensions of this rule are possible. The Senate requires a three-fifths vote to waive or suspend certain provisions. Congress has the power to enact rules regarding this matter, recognizing each House's constitutional right to change rules related to their procedures."
