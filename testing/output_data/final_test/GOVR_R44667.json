It mandates broad minimum wage coverage and includes provisions for workers with disabilities and youth workers. The FLSA created the Wage and Hour Division (WHD) within the Department of Labor (DOL) to enforce its provisions. The minimum wage has been raised 22 times since 1938 through 10 separate amendments to the FLSA. The minimum wage has been raised 22 times through 10 amendments to the FLSA, with the most recent change in 2007 increasing it to $7.25 per hour. The debate in labor economics focuses on the impacts of minimum wages on employment, earnings, poverty, and hours worked. This report specifically addresses the issue of indexing the federal minimum wage. This report discusses indexing the minimum wage to an economic measure to adjust automatically with changes in that measure. Indexation links the minimum wage to variables like prices and wages to prevent its real value from eroding over time. Indexing the minimum wage to an economic measure helps maintain its value over time by adjusting automatically with changes in the economy, such as inflation. This mechanism avoids the need for legislative action to make periodic adjustments and aims to keep pace with consumer prices. Some states have implemented this indexing method, while recent proposals suggest tying the minimum wage to changes in average or median wage levels. Indexation helps maintain the value of the minimum wage over time by adjusting with changes in the economy, such as inflation. The federal minimum wage has been increased 22 times since 1938, ranging from $0.25 to $7.25 per hour. The concept of indexation is illustrated using the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). The value of the minimum wage in 2016 dollars has varied from $3.96 to $10.98. The issue of indexing the federal minimum wage has been discussed since the enactment of the FLSA in 1938. Since its enactment in 1938, the federal minimum wage has been increased 22 times through 10 separate laws. Despite numerous proposals, the minimum wage rate is not indexed and changes only when Congress amends the FLSA. Indexation is used in federal entitlement programs and wage regulations, but the minimum wage remains unindexed. Indexing the minimum wage is a policy choice about how to structure and maintain a federally established standard. It would provide less volatile changes in the minimum wage, but could lead to automatic adjustments, reducing congressional consideration. The minimum wage has increased 22 times since 1938, with varying periods between rate changes. Congress has amended the FLSA multiple times for rate adjustments. From 1938 to 1978, Congress made seven amendments to the FLSA for the minimum wage rate, totaling 15 rate changes. Between 1978 and 2016, there were three amendments with seven rate changes. The frequency of adjustments varied, with some periods seeing more changes than others. Minimum wage increases could be significant in a short time due to irregular patterns of rate changes. The minimum wage rate increased significantly from $5.15 to $7.25, or 41%, in the 2007 to 2009 period. This was higher compared to the 6.4% change in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) during that time. The goal of the FLSA is to eliminate labor conditions detrimental to the minimum standard of living necessary for workers' well-being. Determining the minimum wage rate involves considering various factors like housing costs, food prices, and productivity increases. Indexation helps maintain the real value of the minimum wage over time, while not adjusting it leads to a decline in its relative value. Congressional action is required to change the minimum wage rate, allowing for a broader economic context to be considered with each adjustment. The 1996 and 2007 amendments broadened legislation by including minimum wage rate increases as part of larger policy changes, such as tax provisions for smaller businesses. Indexation of the minimum wage would separate rate setting from other policy considerations related to wage setting. Indexation of the minimum wage would decouple rate setting from other policy considerations, ensuring that the rate adjusts periodically without being tied to unrelated policies. The index itself determines the changing value of the minimum wage over time, with different indices varying in growth and volatility. The indexation of the minimum wage decouples rate setting from other policy considerations, ensuring periodic adjustments based on changing values. The initial value of indexation impacts future values, locking in past growth and affecting real purchasing power. An indexed minimum wage is tied to changes in another variable, with limits placed on adjustments to prevent decreases or excessive increases. Triggers may be included to consider additional factors like unemployment or economic growth when determining minimum wage adjustments. The minimum wage rate may not increase if economic growth is below a certain level, and adjustments are typically made annually. Different indices, such as CPI-W, CPI-U, PCE, ECI, AHE-Manufacturing, are used to determine minimum wage adjustments. Different indices like CPI-W, CPI-U, PCE, ECI, AHE-Manufacturing, and AHE-Production are used to determine minimum wage adjustments at the federal level. State indices and recent legislative proposals also play a role in this process. The federal minimum wage could have been higher if indexed to various measures since its enactment in 1938. Different indices like CPI-U and CPI-W show potential values if the minimum wage had been adjusted accordingly over time. The inflation-adjusted value of the minimum wage in 2016 would have varied greatly depending on the choice of index and starting point of indexation. Different economic indicators show hypothetical values if the minimum wage had been indexed to various rates set by Congress over time. The CPI is a measure of the average change over time in prices paid by consumers for a market basket of goods and services. The CPI-W, a subset of the CPI-U population, covers approximately 28% of the total population and focuses on wage earners. It is published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The CPI-W, published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is used as an index for state minimum wages and federal minimum wage for certain contract workers. It also serves as the basis for the annual cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security payments. Indexing the federal minimum wage to the CPI-W would have resulted in higher wages over time, as shown in Figure 2. If the federal minimum wage had been indexed to the CPI-W since 1938, its value in 2016 would range from $4.10 to $10.65 per hour. For 8 of the 23 enacted minimum wage rates, if tied to CPI-W, the wage would be below $7.25 today. For 15 rates, it would be above $7.25. Starting indexation between 1956 and 1981 would result in a wage between $1.28 and $3.40 higher than the current rate. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) publishes the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), which measures the average change in prices over time. The CPI-U covers urban households and is used to index state minimum wages and federal benefit programs. The federal minimum wage could have ranged from $4.23 to $10.98 per hour in 2016 if indexed to the CPI-U since 1938. Six of the enacted minimum wage rates would be below $7.25 today if tied to the CPI-U without further adjustments. If the federal minimum wage had been tied to CPI-U since 1938, it could have ranged from $4.23 to $10.98 per hour in 2016. Several methodological improvements have been made to the CPI-U over the years. The CPI-U-RS adjusts the CPI-U to incorporate improvements, estimating inflation rates. If the federal minimum wage had been indexed to the CPI-U-RS since 1950, it could range from $6.45 to $9.56 per hour in 2015. If the federal minimum wage had been indexed to the CPI-U-RS since 1950, it could range from $6.45 to $9.56 per hour in 2015. For 6 of the 20 enacted minimum wage rates, if tied to CPI-U-RS, the minimum wage would be below $7.25 today. For 14 rates, it would be above $7.25, with potential increases ranging from $0.34 to $2.31 above. Indexation starting after 1990 would result in a minimum wage near or below $7.25 in 2015. The PCE is a price index used to measure changes in consumer goods and services. It differs from the CPI in terms of item weights and scope. Minnesota uses the PCE to index its state minimum wage, and the Federal Reserve aims for 2% inflation measured by the PCE. Indexing the federal minimum wage to the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) until 2016 would have resulted in a range of $3.53 to $8.67 per hour, depending on the base year. Data shows that for 12 out of 23 enacted minimum wage rates, if tied to the PCE without further adjustments, the minimum wage would be below $7.25 today, ranging from $0.01 below to $3.72 below. Indexation of the federal minimum wage to the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) would have resulted in varying rates, with 11 out of 23 enacted rates being above $7.25 today. The PCE index would have produced minimum wage rates ranging from $1.42 above to $3.72 below the actual 2016 rate. The Employment Cost Index (ECI) for wages and salaries is a labor cost measure produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The Employment Cost Index (ECI) is a labor cost measure used in federal programs and for adjusting pay for Members of Congress. It shows hypothetical effects of indexing the federal minimum wage to the ECI, with examples of potential rates if indexed since 1981. The ECI would have generally created minimum wage rates similar to CPI-U-RS indexed rates. If the federal minimum wage had been indexed to the ECI since 1981, its value in 2016 would range from $6.82 to $10.10 per hour. Indexation to the ECI would have resulted in minimum wage rates above $7.25 today, similar to rates generated by indexing to the CPI-U-RS. The BLS Current Employment Statistics survey collects data on employment, hours, and earnings by industry. The BLS Current Employment Statistics survey collects data on employment, hours, and earnings by industry, including average hourly earnings for private nonfarm employees. Earnings data for manufacturing workers date back to 1939, while data on production and nonsupervisory workers start in 1964. Figures 7 and 8 illustrate the potential impact of indexing the federal minimum wage to the Average Hourly Earnings (AHE) for different worker categories until 2016. The federal minimum wage could have been higher if indexed to average hourly earnings in manufacturing, with rates ranging from $5.26 above to $0.34 below the actual 2016 rate. If the federal minimum wage had been indexed to average hourly earnings for production and nonsupervisory workers since 1964, the minimum wage in 2016 would have been higher in all years except 2007. Indexation to these earnings would have resulted in the second-highest minimum wage rates compared to other indices, ranging from $4.19 above to $0.02 below the actual 2016 rate. Some states and recent congressional proposals have also considered indexation policies for minimum wage rates. Many states have minimum wage rates above the federal rate, with some indexed to inflation. The number of states with rates above the federal minimum wage has increased to 30. 17 states and DC currently or will in the future index their minimum wage rates to inflation. States like Arizona, Montana, Nevada, and South Dakota index to CPI-U, U.S. City Average, while others like New York, Oregon, and Vermont will start indexing in the future. Vermont, Alaska, Colorado, Michigan, DC, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio, Washington, California, Florida, and Minnesota have different methods of indexing their state minimum wage rates to various versions of the Consumer Price Index. Only Colorado and South Dakota had adjustments to their minimum wage rates from 2015 to 2016 out of the 11 states with inflation indexation in place as of 2016. Some states have specific rules for increasing minimum wage rates based on inflation, such as rounding to the nearest $0.05. Nevada limits annual increases to CPI-U or 3%, while California, Michigan, Minnesota, and Vermont have caps on increases. California and Michigan also have triggers to prevent rate increases based on economic changes. Additionally, 24 localities with minimum wages above the federal rate index their local minimum wage. In 24 localities with minimum wages above the federal rate, the local minimum wage is indexed using a version of the CPI. Proposals in the past three Congresses have suggested using CPI-W, CPI-U, or median hourly earnings as the index for increasing the federal minimum wage. Median hourly earnings proposals would likely increase the minimum wage at a greater rate. All indexation proposals would have provided step increases in the minimum wage rate before starting indexing."
