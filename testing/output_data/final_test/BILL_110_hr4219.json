    "content": "The \"Immediate Benefits for Wounded Warriors Act of 2007\" assigns temporary disability ratings to certain members of the Armed Forces for purposes administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The \"Immediate Benefits for Wounded Warriors Act of 2007\" mandates the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to assign a temporary disability rating of 30 percent to eligible Armed Forces members upon separation or upon diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injury. Upon receiving a permanent disability rating higher than 30 percent, the member will receive disability compensation payments under chapter 11 of title 38, United States Code. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs is required to make payments to eligible Armed Forces members based on the difference between their actual and permanent disability ratings. If the permanent rating is below 30 percent, no payment is required. Disability compensation received is not offset by separation pay under section 1174 of title 10, United States Code. The Act defines an eligible member of the Armed Forces as someone who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom, has not received a disability rating from the VA, is not authorized for pre-stabilization benefits, and has submitted a claim for disability compensation. The member must request a temporary disability rating but has not received compensation. They must be separated from the Armed Forces under specific conditions and have a disability rating of at least 10 percent or a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injury. The Secretary of Defense has responsibilities in this regard. The Secretary of Defense is responsible for notifying the Secretary of Veterans Affairs 30 days before an eligible member of the Armed Forces separates, and transmitting their medical and service records before separation. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs can use the anticipated separation date for providing benefits. Additionally, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs is responsible for maintaining a PTSD and TBI registry. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish a PTSD and TBI registry for eligible members of the Armed Forces who request a temporary disability rating. The authority to assign a temporary disability rating will expire five years after the enactment of the Act."
