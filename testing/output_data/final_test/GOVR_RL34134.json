    "content": "President Bush urged Congress to approve pending free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea to boost U.S. economic growth by accessing new markets. Senator Baucus called for a new import protocol with South Korea for full access to U.S. beef before moving forward with the FTA negotiation. The Senator emphasized the need for a clear protocol outlining criteria for U.S. beef sales in South Korea. U.S. trade officials are in negotiations with Malaysia for a bilateral FTA. President Bush signed a law implementing the FTA with Peru. The Senate approved a trade agreement on December 4 to expand commodity and food exports, benefiting U.S. farmers and agribusiness. Negotiating trade agreements since the mid-1980s has aimed to lower trade barriers and increase agricultural sales overseas. The U.S. has reciprocated by reducing border protection on farm and food products imported from trading partners, considering the import sensitivity of sectors like beef, dairy, and sugar. The 1994 Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture and U.S. FTAs with Canada and Mexico significantly reduced trade barriers, leading to increased export opportunities for U.S. agriculture. Canada and Mexico became fast-growing markets for U.S. agricultural exports due to the removal of border protections through these agreements. Since the mid-1980s, the United States entered into FTAs with Canada and Mexico, leading to increased export opportunities for U.S. agriculture. The Bush Administration pursued a strategy of competitive trade liberalization, using bilateral FTAs to advance U.S. trade objectives in multilateral and regional negotiations. Since 2002, negotiations were initiated with 23 countries, resulting in agreements with 14 countries, of which Congress approved eight FTAs with 12 countries. Since 2002, the Bush Administration initiated negotiations with 23 countries, resulting in agreements with 14 of them. Congress approved eight FTAs with 12 countries, with agreements in effect for 10 countries. Three FTAs are approved but not yet implemented. Negotiations with Malaysia continue despite TPA expiration, while talks with Thailand are suspended. This report examines U.S. agricultural trade developments with current and potential FTA partners, addressing negotiation issues and outstanding matters. The Bush Administration's FTA negotiations since mid-2002 have aimed to improve competitive opportunities for U.S. agricultural commodities in foreign markets and achieve fairer trade conditions. Key objectives include eliminating tariffs and non-tariff barriers on agricultural trade, providing relief mechanisms for the U.S. agricultural sector to adjust to increased competition. The Bush Administration's FTA negotiations aim to improve competitive opportunities for U.S. agricultural commodities by eliminating trade barriers and providing relief mechanisms for the agricultural sector. U.S. officials seek to address issues such as import adjustments, export restrictions, SPS measures, and agricultural export subsidies in negotiations with partner countries. FTAs negotiated by the United States are comprehensive, covering market access for various goods and services, investment protection, intellectual property rights, dispute settlement, labor, environment, and customs administration. The primary objective is to achieve preferential access to each other's markets within an agreed-upon time frame. U.S. officials have clarified that farm support issues will only be addressed in WTO multilateral negotiations, not in FTA talks. Negotiators in FTAs aim to achieve preferential access to each other's markets by reducing tariffs and quotas on agricultural goods. The United States addresses non-tariff barriers like food safety and SPS measures separately. Press reports suggest that bilateral SPS disputes are informally discussed during negotiations. Negotiators in FTAs aim to resolve disputes to achieve other negotiating objectives and prevent barriers from undercutting market access for U.S. exporters. U.S. seeks comprehensive agreements covering all products with long transition periods for sensitive agricultural commodities. Some FTAs provide indefinite protection for certain commodities like sugar and beef through preferential tariff-rate quotas and prohibitive tariffs. The use of safeguards, preferential tariff-rate quotas, and prohibitive tariffs in FTAs protect against import surges and address unique situations. Each agreement has specific provisions for handling sensitive commodities, such as capping sugar imports in perpetuity in some FTAs. The United States and Central American countries have implemented measures to limit imports of certain agricultural products, such as fresh onions, fresh potatoes, and white corn. These measures include expanding in-quota amounts each year while maintaining prohibitive tariffs on over-quota entries. Additionally, Morocco has imposed quotas and prohibitive tariffs on U.S. wheat imports. These unique measures aim to address the sensitivity of certain agricultural products in FTAs, which is not commonly seen in other countries' agreements. The extent of free trade in agricultural products under U.S.-negotiated FTAs has evolved. While some agreements like NAFTA with Mexico allow for complete free trade, others like the FTAs with Israel, Canada, and more recent agreements have long transitions for most agricultural commodities. Exceptions include exclusions for tobacco in the Jordan FTA, sugar in the Australia FTA, and rice in the FTA with South Korea. Decisions by other countries on animal, plant, and human health issues have impacted U.S. agricultural sales in FTA markets. Slow progress in implementing SPS commitments has influenced the pace of concluding FTAs and seeking congressional approval. The controversies surrounding SPS rules as disguised trade barriers have impacted the pace of concluding FTAs and seeking congressional approval. Resolving these issues is crucial for the U.S. agricultural sector to take advantage of market access opportunities created by new FTAs. Exporters seek science-based, transparent, and predictable SPS rules to benefit from new FTAs. U.S. negotiators aim for recognition of their meat inspection system in recent FTA talks. Following the discovery of a cow with mad cow disease in Washington state in 2003, many countries banned U.S. beef imports. The U.S. requested the OIE to review measures to mitigate the risks of BSE. The U.S., Canada, and Mexico asked for a reconsideration of international guidelines for BSE risk status. The U.S. has presented evidence to show the safety of its beef products and effectiveness of its safeguards against BSE. In recent FTAs, the U.S. has pushed for recognition of its measures to address BSE and resume purchases of U.S. beef. Some Members of Congress tie their support for FTAs to the measures taken by partner countries to allow U.S. beef imports. Negotiators have reached agreements or exchanged letters to address SPS issues with FTA countries. Negotiators have reached agreements or exchanged letters to address SPS issues with FTA countries, leveraging FTA negotiations to resolve longstanding SPS issues and attain market openings for U.S. beef imports. For example, the U.S. secured changes in regulations from Colombia, Peru, and Panama to allow for the import of U.S. beef. The recent FTAs reaffirm each partner's rights and obligations under the WTO's 1994 SPS Agreement. They establish a SPS standing committee to resolve bilateral SPS problems and create Technical Groups to work on specific SPS disputes. Unlike NAFTA, FTAs since 1993 prohibit challenging the other partner's SPS standards. U.S. agricultural trade has doubled in the last 25 years, with annual growth averaging 5.1%. The increase in overall U.S. agricultural trade from 1981 to 2006 was driven by factors such as population growth, rising incomes in key export markets, and trade policy developments like FTAs with Canada and Mexico. Annual trade growth averaged 5.1%, with occasional dips due to currency fluctuations and financial crises. The expansion of duty-free access under U.S. unilateral trade preference programs has boosted agricultural imports from developing countries. U.S. free trade agreements increased agricultural trade significantly, with exports growing by almost two thirds from $43 billion in 1981 to $71 billion in 2006. Agricultural exports covered by U.S. FTAs equaled $26 billion (37%) of the total in 2006. In 2006, U.S. agricultural exports covered by FTAs equaled $26 billion, compared to $255 million in 1986. Agricultural imports have grown significantly, reaching $65 billion in 2006. Import growth has averaged 11.5% annually. Agricultural imports covered by U.S. FTAs were $29 billion in 2006. The U.S. implemented three free trade agreements with six countries in 2006, totaling almost $3.3 billion in two-way agricultural trade. In 2006, U.S. agricultural exports under FTAs were $26 billion, compared to $255 million in 1986. Agricultural imports reached $65 billion in 2006, with import growth averaging 11.5% annually. The U.S. implemented three FTAs with six countries in 2006, totaling $3.3 billion in two-way agricultural trade. FTAs with seven more countries could take effect in 2008 or 2009, pending legislative approval. Costa Rica's DR-CAFTA provisions may be completed by February 29, 2008. DR-CAFTA provisions with Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic were completed in early 2007. USTR announced the provisions had gone into effect on March 1, 2007. President Bush signed legislation for FTAs with Oman and Peru in 2006 and 2007 respectively. Two-way agricultural trade with these countries totaled $8.9 billion in 2006. Agricultural exports to these nations equaled $5.1 billion, while imports were valued at $3.8 billion. Agricultural imports were valued at $3.8 billion in 2006. The United States had ongoing FTA negotiations with Thailand and Malaysia, but did not reach agreements before the April 1, 2007 deadline. Two-way U.S. agricultural trade with these countries totaled almost $3.3 billion. Agricultural exports were valued at $1.1 billion, while commodity and food imports totaled $2.2 billion. Trade agreements with various countries could potentially increase agricultural trade by 4.1% to 4.3%, leading to higher exports due to market openings created by eliminating tariffs and border protections over time. Trade liberalization provisions in seven FTAs could lead to a rise in U.S. agricultural imports from Australia, Chile, and Colombia. Estimates suggest an increase in U.S. agricultural exports by 7.2% (USITC) to 3.9% (AFBF) above baseline levels. The USITC and AFBF project increases in U.S. agricultural exports under various FTAs with countries like Australia, Morocco, DR-CAFTA countries, Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. The USITC also projects higher exports to Chile and Singapore by $136 million, while the AFBF estimates increased farm product sales to Bahrain and Oman by $300 million. Additionally, U.S. agricultural imports under six FTAs could increase by $1.5 billion, but trade diversion lowers overall imports to about $700 million. This results in a 1.4% higher import projection by the USITC. The USITC projects a 1.4% increase in U.S. agricultural imports under various FTAs, with most of the increase coming from Australia and Chile. Agricultural imports from developing countries have benefited from low or zero duty access under U.S. unilateral trade preference programs. The USITC projects a 1.4% increase in U.S. agricultural imports under various FTAs, with most of the increase coming from Australia and Chile. Trade agreements with Canada and Mexico have led to significant growth in bilateral agricultural trade, while only three FTAs have operated for more than 10 years. The USITC projects a 1.4% increase in U.S. agricultural imports under various FTAs, with most of the increase coming from Australia and Chile. The growth in two-way trade is also influenced by factors like population growth, income increase, and changing diets, not solely due to trade provisions. Market access provisions for U.S. exporters will take time to show effects due to long transition periods negotiated for sensitive commodities. Further analysis is needed to link changes in trade flows to specific tariff and quota provisions in FTAs. Since the Canada-U.S. Trade Agreement (CUSTA) in 1989, bilateral agricultural trade between the two countries has significantly increased. U.S. agricultural exports to Canada grew almost seven times, while imports from Canada rose six times. Canada is the top agricultural trading partner of the United States, accounting for nearly 19% of two-way U.S. agricultural trade in 2006. In 2006, the main U.S. exports to Canada included vegetables, fresh fruit, breakfast cereals, food preparations, beef, fruit juices, pet food, pork, cocoa, coffee, and confectionery products. The main U.S. imports from Canada were live cattle, bakery products, beef, pork, fresh vegetables, chocolate, frozen vegetables, live hogs, rapeseed oil, confectionery products, wheat, and food preparations. Under CUSTA's agricultural provisions, most agricultural products have traded freely between the US and Canada since 1998. Exceptions include commodities subject to tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) such as dairy products, poultry, and eggs. Both countries can also apply temporary safeguards on trade in fruits, vegetables, and flowers until 2007. The discovery of BSE on both sides of the border has impacted trade. Since mid-2003, the discovery of BSE has affected trade between the US and Mexico. As of January 1, 2008, all agricultural products now trade freely between the two countries, marking the end of a 15-year transition period under NAFTA. Tariffs and quotas on import-sensitive commodities were eliminated, allowing products like corn, dry beans, sugar, and chicken leg quarters to enter the Mexican market from the US. Similarly, products like FCOJ, peanuts, and sugar can now enter the US from Mexico. On January 1, 2003, tariffs and quotas were eliminated on most traded agricultural products, leading to protests by Mexican producers. Mexican President Calderon argued that increased trade integration with the US and Canada would benefit the economy. Opposition members of the Mexican Congress considered renegotiating NAFTA's agricultural provisions. U.S. and Mexican agriculture officials met on January 10, 2008, to ensure smooth implementation of NAFTA. Since NAFTA went into effect in 1994, two-way bilateral trade in agricultural and food products has more than tripled, with U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico rising by more than three times. Mexico is the second largest agricultural trading partner of the United States, accounting for almost 15% of two-way agricultural trade in 2006. Measures are being taken to ensure smooth implementation of NAFTA, with a working group established to address trade concerns in the livestock sector. In 2006, top U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico included corn, soybeans, beef, food preparations, wheat, cotton, and pork. Agricultural imports from Mexico have significantly increased since NAFTA, with top imports being fresh vegetables, beer, fresh fruit, live cattle, confectionery products, sugar, and baked goods. Since NAFTA, U.S. agricultural imports from Mexico have increased significantly, with disputes mainly affecting U.S. exports such as rice, beef, pork, apples, soy oil, and HFCS. Mexican farmers and commodity groups have urged the government to renegotiate certain NAFTA provisions, particularly regarding sensitive agricultural commodities like dry beans and corn. President Calderon faces pressure to reconsider NAFTA renegotiation despite previous officials stating it was not possible. The U.S. and Mexican sugar producing sectors have reached an agreement to control sugar imports between both countries, impacting the debate on the U.S. sugar program in the 2007 farm bill. U.S. sugar processors and growers are pushing for these measures to be included in the bill, while U.S. HFCS manufacturers and some Members of Congress are also involved in the discussions. In response to concerns about \"managed trade\" impacting U.S. HFCS exports to Mexico, the U.S. and six countries in the DR-CAFTA agreed to phase out tariffs on agricultural commodities. Trade in sensitive commodities like fresh potatoes, onions, white corn, and sugar are being addressed. The DR-CAFTA agreement includes unique treatment for certain agricultural commodities like corn and sugar, with quotas increasing annually by 1% to 2%. Tariffs on these commodities will remain high to protect producers. Consultations will be held midway through the transition period. The six countries covered by DR-CAFTA accounted for $5.3 billion in U.S. agricultural trade in 2006. The six countries covered by DR-CAFTA accounted for just over $2.2 billion in U.S. agricultural exports, with the Dominican Republic and Guatemala being the largest markets. DR-CAFTA grants duty-free status to many U.S. farm products exported to these countries, including beef, cotton, wheat, soybeans, fruits, vegetables, and wine. Central American tariffs and quotas on various agricultural products are being phased out over 15 years, with longer transition periods for certain imports from the United States. U.S. exports of corn, cotton, soybeans, and wheat to the Dominican Republic receive immediate duty-free treatment. Dominican Republic tariffs on most U.S. agricultural products are being eliminated over 15 years, with 20-year transitions for specific products. Prior to DR-CAFTA, almost all agricultural imports from the six countries entered the U.S. duty-free, a treatment made permanent by the agreement. DR-CAFTA grants additional market access in the form of country-specific preferential quotas to imports from the region of U.S. import-sensitive agricultural products. The agreement's sugar provisions allow additional sugar from the region to enter the U.S. market, drawing attention during congressional debate. The \"sugar compensation mechanism\" was questioned during a Senate Finance Committee hearing. The unique \"sugar compensation mechanism\" in U.S. FTAs allows the U.S. government to compensate six countries for sugar they can't ship under DR-CAFTA's quotas if it affects the U.S. sugar price support program. Compensation could include surplus commodity donations or cash payments to exporters. The Bush Administration pledged to limit sugar imports through FY2008 to address concerns. The Bush Administration pledged to limit sugar imports through FY2008 to address concerns about the viability of the U.S. sugar program. Sugar producers and processors were not satisfied with this pledge, fearing that DR-CAFTA's sugar provisions could set a precedent for future FTAs. Agricultural imports from the six countries affected equaled $3.0 billion in 2006, with bananas, coffee, pineapple, raw cane sugar, and melons/watermelons being the top purchases. In 2006, agricultural imports from six countries affected by DR-CAFTA totaled $3.0 billion. Costa Rica was the largest supplier with $1.16 billion in sales, followed by Guatemala. The United States began implementing the agreement with four countries and provisions with the Dominican Republic took effect in March 2007. Costa Rica may join as an FTA partner in 2008 pending legislative approval. Australia negotiated for increased access to the U.S. market for beef, dairy products, and sugar. Access for beef, dairy products, and sugar in the U.S. market was a contentious issue during the Australia-U.S. FTA negotiations in February 2004. U.S. negotiators excluded sugar from the agreement and immediately eliminated Australia's tariffs on all U.S. agricultural imports. Australia sought immediate openings for beef and dairy products, but the FTA only provides limited access under quotas with long transition periods. Quotas and high tariffs on some dairy imports will remain indefinitely. A new mechanism for scientific cooperation on sanitary and phytosanitary issues was also established. Analysis suggests that Australia's agricultural sector will benefit more from the FTA than the U.S. Australia's agricultural sector is expected to gain more from the FTA with the U.S. due to increased access to the larger U.S. market for competitive food products. The FTA, implemented in January 2005, allows duty-free access for U.S. agricultural exports to Australia, benefiting products like processed foods, soybeans, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and alcoholic beverages. The agreement also addressed SPS issues, allowing for sales of processed pork products. The U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in 2005 allowed duty-free access for U.S. agricultural exports to Australia, leading to a 34% increase in the value of U.S. agricultural exports to Australia in 2006 compared to the pre-FTA period. Key agricultural exports to Australia in 2006 included pork, pet food, food preparations, walnuts, fresh grapes, breeding horses, confectionery products, essential oils, tobacco, soybean meal, protein isolates, almonds, and fresh oranges. The FTA eliminated U.S. tariffs on 20% of Australian agricultural imports immediately and phased out most other agricultural tariffs and quotas over time. Australia received additional access for commodities subject to U.S. TRQs like beef, dairy products, peanuts, cotton, and tobacco through expanding preferential quotas. However, sugar was not included. The new quotas are in addition to existing WTO quotas. Safeguard protection against import surges from Australia will be triggered for beef and horticultural products. Australia's preferential beef quota will increase to 70,000 MT by 2022. In-quota tariffs were eliminated immediately, while above-quota tariffs will be phased out starting in 2013. No restrictions on beef imports from Australia will be in place from 2023. To protect against surges in beef imports from Australia, a quantity-based safeguard will be available from years 9 through 18. A price-based safeguard could be triggered if beef prices fall below a specified level starting in 2023. The United States will gradually open its market to additional imports of dairy products from Australia under new preferential TRQs, with in-quota tariffs eliminated and quotas increasing annually. Above-quota tariffs on dairy products will remain high indefinitely. Quotas for dairy products will grow annually at compound rates starting in year 18. The new quotas for dairy products from Australia will grow annually at compound rates, in addition to existing WTO quotas. The agreement allows for consultations after year 20 to consider changes in market access commitments. USTR does not expect the additional imports to impact USDA's dairy price support program. Australia is the fifth leading source of U.S. agricultural imports, with imports increasing by 15% in 2006 due to the FTA. In 2006, U.S. agricultural imports from Australia increased by 15%, reaching $2.5 billion. Key imports included beef, veal, wine, lamb meat, sugar, cheese, milk protein concentrates, oranges, and wheat gluten. The U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement phased out tariffs on agricultural products over four years, with a 12-year transition period for import-sensitive products. Chile previously had a 6% tariff on most agricultural products. Chile's tariffs on most agricultural products were 6% before the Free Trade Agreement with the U.S. The agreement allowed duty-free status for over 75% of U.S. agricultural products, including pork, beef, soybeans, wheat, and processed foods. Tariffs and quotas on other products are being phased out over 8, 10, or 12 years. Price bands on certain imports from the U.S. will be eliminated by year 12. U.S. products subject to Chile's safeguards include certain meat products, rice, and wheat products. The Free Trade Agreement with Chile allowed duty-free status for over 75% of U.S. agricultural products, leading to a significant increase in U.S. agricultural exports to Chile. Key products shipped included corn, wheat, soybean meal, corn gluten meal, planting seeds, almonds, food preparations, and animal feeds. Chile's rank as a market for U.S. agriculture rose from 52nd in 2003 to 28th in 2006. The United States granted duty-free status to a large share of Chile's agricultural products immediately or within four years. The Free Trade Agreement with Chile led to duty-free status for over 75% of U.S. agricultural products, resulting in a significant increase in exports to Chile. Key products included corn, wheat, soybean meal, almonds, and animal feeds. Chile's agricultural imports from the U.S. rose by more than one-half in recent years, with leading purchases being fresh grapes and wine. In 2006, Chile was the 9th leading supplier of U.S. agricultural imports, with key purchases including fresh grapes, wine, planting seeds, apples, blueberries, and avocados. Chile agreed to recognize U.S. beef grading programs, allowing for the sale of U.S. beef and pork products with USDA labels in Chile. Chile quickly accepted the U.S. inspection system for food safety before signing the FTA on June 6, 2003. Both countries agreed to work on mutual access for poultry products in a side letter. Duty-free trade under the U.S.-Israel FTA began in 1995, with exceptions for agricultural products. Israel and the United States signed an \"Agreement on Trade in Agricultural Products\" in 1996 to gradually liberalize market access for agricultural trade. Israel offered lower preferential tariffs, established duty-free TRQs for nearly 100 U.S. products, and allowed unlimited duty-free entry for many others. The 1996 Agreement between Israel and the United States established duty-free and expanding TRQs for imports from Israel of various agricultural products. The 2004 Agricultural Agreement further improved access for select U.S. agricultural products to the Israeli market, with about 90% of U.S. agricultural exports entering Israel duty-free and quota-free. The U.S. faces trade barriers in Israel for dairy products, fruits, vegetables, almonds, wine, and processed foods. Sales could increase by $60 to $105 million if barriers were eliminated. U.S. agricultural exports to Israel were $414 million in 2006, down from $537 million in 1997. Israel ranks 21st as a market for U.S. agriculture, with corn, soybeans, wheat, almonds, and soybean meal being top commodities sold. In 2006, U.S. agricultural exports to Israel were $414 million, with top commodities being corn, soybeans, wheat, almonds, and soybean meal. Agricultural imports from Israel in 2006 were $198 million, with baked goods, spices, vegetable seeds, and peppers among the top imports. Discussions for a new agreement were planned for 2008. The Clinton Administration initiated FTA negotiations with Singapore in late 2000 to enhance U.S. access to \"Big Emerging Markets.\" The FTA's agricultural provisions were easy to negotiate as Singapore already had zero tariffs on most agricultural imports. In 2006, U.S. agricultural exports to Singapore totaled $303 million, with a diverse range of products exported. Singapore's top agricultural exports included preparations, preserved reptile skins, non-fat dry milk, broiler meat, oranges, frozen potato french fries, and grapes. Key agricultural imports from Singapore were cocoa butter/oil, baked goods, niger seed, tea preparations, stearic acids and salts, and wool grease. Singapore eliminated tariffs on beer and samsu under the FTA, harmonized excise taxes on distilled spirits, and allowed imports of chewing gum with therapeutic value for sale in pharmacies. The United States will eliminate duties on agricultural imports from Singapore over 4, 8, or 10 years. Preferential TRQs are in place until 2013 for sensitive agricultural products if produced in Singapore. Rules of origin aim to prevent duty-free treatment of food products transhipped through Singapore. FTAs allow for the acceleration of removing trade barriers with mutual agreement. Singapore requested an increase in its 2007 preferential peanut quota from 1.3 MT to 200 MT to benefit its nut snack manufacturers. U.S. peanut industry groups opposed the proposal, fearing it would set a precedent of sourcing peanuts from other origins. They argued that FTAs should not harm the domestic peanut industry. In May 2007, USTR announced that the FTA's peanut quota will not be expanded, allowing Singapore's exporters to utilize the existing U.S. peanut TRQ. Agriculture was a challenging sector for Morocco to negotiate in its FTA with the United States due to its significant contribution to the country's GDP and labor force. Small-scale farmers, mainly producing wheat, dominate the sector. The most sensitive agricultural issue in negotiations was the terms of access in the Moroccan market for U.S. wheat. Morocco ranked 29th as a market for U.S. agricultural exports in 2006, with sales of corn, soybeans, durum wheat, soybean meal, and crude soybean oil totaling $295 million. Under the FTA with the United States, Morocco agreed to reduce tariffs and expand preferential quotas on agricultural imports, including wheat, soybean meal, crude soybean oil, processed olives, olive oil, fresh mandarin oranges, locust bean and guar seed thickener, agar-agar, and tomato powder. These products accounted for a significant portion of the $80 million in agricultural imports from Morocco. The FTA took effect on January 1, 2006, with varying phase-out periods for tariff reductions, including a 25-year transition period for imports of U.S. chicken leg quarters and wings. Morocco also granted access to its market for U.S. high-quality beef and standard quality beef. Morocco granted access to its market for U.S. high-quality beef, standard quality beef, whole birds, chicken leg quarters, wings, frozen chicken products, durum wheat, common bread wheat, wheat products, sugar, sugar-containing products, almonds, and apples. A \"preference clause\" provides better market access for U.S. wheat, beef, poultry, corn, soybeans, and corn/soybean products. Complex provisions detail the terms of U.S. access to the Moroccan market, particularly for wheat. The terms of U.S. access to the Moroccan market for durum wheat and common bread wheat include a reduction in in-quota tariffs over 10 years. The preferential tariff on common wheat imports will decline based on Morocco's MFN rate. U.S. exporters may not receive the preferential rate during certain months unless Morocco imports wheat from another country. Over-quota tariffs for both wheat types will remain high unless Morocco negotiates a reduction with another supplier. U.S. exporters will benefit from any wheat tariff reductions negotiated by Morocco. The preferential quota for common wheat in Morocco will be based on the country's wheat output level, with a smaller quota for higher production and a larger quota for lower output. The durum wheat quota will gradually expand, while the common wheat quota will increase for the first 10 years and then be capped indefinitely from 2015. U.S. wheat will have improved access to the Moroccan market, but a quota and over-quota tariff will always apply. Morocco will operate a wheat auction system for U.S. wheat imports, and the U.S. will eliminate tariffs and offer preferential quota access for agricultural imports from Morocco under various phase-out periods. The United States established preferential TRQs for various products including beef, dairy products, sugar, peanuts, tobacco, cotton, tomato products, dried onions, and garlic. Imports of sugar and SCPs are subject to a \"trade surplus\" calculation. The USITC estimates that full implementation would increase U.S. exports to Morocco primarily in grains, processed food, and tobacco products, with a small increase in imports of processed food products. The U.S. and Jordan signed an FTA to boost the Jordanian economy and strengthen ties. The agreement eliminates tariffs on most bilateral trade by 2010, except for unmanufactured tobacco and cigarettes. Jordan phased out tariffs on U.S. rice, corn, and vegetable oils by 2004, with refined corn and soybean oil tariffs to be eliminated by 2010. Wheat continues to enter tariff-free. The FTA is expected to have minimal impact on U.S. exports of rice, corn, and vegetable oil to Jordan. In the Jordanian market, U.S. exporters relied on USDA credit programs to sell commodities, securing 10-year preferential TRQs for dairy products, sugar, peanuts, and cotton. In 2006, U.S. agricultural exports to Jordan were $142 million, 39% above the pre-FTA average. Leading exports included corn, wheat, rice, almonds, corn oil, and soybean meal. Wheat was historically the top export, supported by PL 480 Title I credits. Agricultural imports from Jordan have quadrupled from $731,000 to $3 million. Imports from Jordan have quadrupled from $731,000 to $3 million, with principal imports being processed chickpeas, sauces, condiments, baked goods, and spices. Bahrain, a significant net agricultural importer, saw diverse U.S. farm and food exports of $15 million in 2006, including protein concentrates, chicken meat, beef, and frozen potato french fries. Bahrain eliminated tariffs on many food products before the FTA, which was approved in December 2005 and took effect on August 1, 2006, providing duty-free access for U.S. agricultural exports on 98% of its agricultural products. The United States granted immediate duty-free access for its agricultural exports on 98% of Bahrain's agricultural tariff lines and phased out tariffs on all other products within 10 years. The FTA with South Korea is considered the most commercially significant for U.S. agriculture since NAFTA with Mexico in 1994. The FTAs with Oman and Peru will not take effect until each country conforms its laws and regulations to reflect the agreements' commitments. An agreement between House leadership and the Bush Administration in May 2007 added labor, environmental, and other provisions to pending FTAs. The timing of when Congress might consider the FTAs is uncertain, with concerns over labor union violence in Colombia and reluctance from the South Korean Government to incorporate labor provisions in the Korea FTA. The Panama FTA's timeline is unclear. President Bush has called for the approval of three FTAs, starting with Colombia. Congress has not prioritized these agreements due to concerns raised, including labor provisions and auto access. The Panama FTA may be sent to Congress in early fall after the term of a controversial legislator ends. Agricultural trade rankings with the U.S. for each country are examined. A last-minute FTA was concluded with South Korea in April 2007. The TPA statute required the President to notify Congress of the intent to sign the agreement by a specific date. Compromises were made for improved access for U.S. agricultural products in the Korean market. The agreement was signed on June 30, 2007, with Congress support contingent on Korea fulfilling commitments to reopen its market to U.S. beef. U.S. agricultural negotiators aimed to increase market access in South Korea, a significant importer of agricultural products. South Korea's agricultural sector is highly protected with an average applied agricultural tariff of 42%. Tariffs are highest for vegetable products, while pistachios, walnuts, pork, poultry products, and fruit juices also face significant tariffs. South Korea uses TRQs to limit imports of various agricultural products, with over-quota tariffs on soybeans and barley reaching prohibitive levels. In 2006, U.S. sales accounted for 25% of South Korea's $12.5 billion agricultural import market, with a decline in market share over the last decade. South Korea was the 6th largest market for U.S. agriculture, with export sales totaling almost $2.9 billion. Leading commodities sold included corn, whole cattle hides, pork, non-durum wheat, soybeans, cotton, and hay. Under the U.S.-South Korea Free Trade Agreement, South Korea would grant duty-free status to almost two-thirds of current U.S. agricultural exports, totaling $1.9 billion. Most remaining agricultural tariffs and quotas will be phased out within 10 years, with tariffs, quotas, and safeguards on all but seven agricultural products being phased out over 12 periods ranging up to 23 years. Seasonal provisions would apply to U.S. sales of oranges, table grapes, and potatoes for chipping. Under the U.S.-South Korea Free Trade Agreement, tariffs on many fruits, vegetables, and food products would be eliminated in two or five years. Tariffs on sensitive commodities like beef, in-season potatoes for chipping, pears, apples, in-shell walnuts, and in-season grapes would be phased out in 15 to 20 years. Tariff-rate quotas with long phase-out periods would apply to cheeses, butter, dairy-based infant foods, barley, whey for food use, and other sensitive products. Slowly-expanding quotas would apply in perpetuity on imports from the United States of skim and whole milk powders, evaporated milk, in-season oranges, potatoes for table use, honey, and identity-preserved soybeans for food use. Under the U.S.-South Korea Free Trade Agreement, South Korea secured the right to administer tariff-rate quotas for agricultural products through an auction or licensing system. Safeguards would be implemented if imports from the United States exceed specified levels. Rice was excluded from the agreement due to its importance to Korea's national identity and economy. The U.S. will still have access to rice quotas under South Korea's WTO commitments. Tariffs on beef will be eliminated in 15 years. The terms of access for U.S. beef into South Korea's market remain unsettled due to concerns over mad cow disease. South Korea was the third largest market for U.S. beef products before imports were banned. The U.S. agreed to phase out tariffs and quotas on all agricultural imports from South Korea under seven phase-out periods. Before U.S. beef imports were banned in South Korea in 2003, it was the third largest market for U.S. beef products. The ban was imposed due to a case of mad cow disease in a Canadian-born cow in Washington state. The United States took regulatory measures to reassure trading partners of the safety of U.S. beef. Bilateral talks in 2006 resulted in an agreement for South Korea to lift the ban by late March 2006, a necessary step before FTA negotiations could begin. In February 2006, South Korea agreed to allow imports of U.S. boneless beef from cattle under 30 months old, with restrictions on specified risk materials. Despite a partial lift of the ban in September 2006, imports of bone-in beef and beef from older cattle remained prohibited. South Korea rejected three shipments of U.S. boneless beef in late 2006. South Korea rejected U.S. beef shipments in late 2006 due to bone fragments, causing an impasse in FTA negotiations. Despite high-level discussions, talks concluded in April 2007 without resolution. President Roh Moo-hyun made a commitment the next day. South Korea's President Roh Moo-hyun promised to uphold OIE recommendations and open the Korean beef market at a reasonable level. The OIE declared the U.S. a \"controlled risk\" country for mad cow disease, prompting the USDA to request South Korea to amend import requirements for U.S. beef. South Korea's animal health agency began assessing BSE risks in the U.S. beef sector to negotiate a revised bilateral agreement. The OIE finding prompted negotiations for a revised bilateral agreement on U.S. beef imports to South Korea. Delays were expected due to the discovery of risk materials and the upcoming presidential election. Despite this, boneless beef exports to South Korea resumed, with the country ranking as the 4th largest market for U.S. beef through September 2007. South Korea ranked as the 4th largest market for U.S. beef through September 2007. South Korean authorities halted inspections of U.S. beef shipments until negotiations to revise the 2006 protocol are concluded. Bilateral talks in October 2007 failed to reach an agreement, with South Korea seeking stricter rules than OIE guidelines to address BSE risks. The U.S. maintains that current rules meet OIE standards and will push for full access in negotiations. South Korea prefers a \"two-phased\" approach to opening up the U.S. beef market, starting with imports of boneless and bone-in beef cuts from cattle less than 30 months old. This would give the U.S. about 80% of its market share before 2003 restrictions. The eventual second step would allow imports of beef from older cattle, with risk materials removed according to OIE's specifications. President-elect Lee Myung-bak supports this approach. President-elect Lee Myung-bak of South Korea is keen on resolving the beef issue quickly by strengthening import rules and placing Korean inspectors at U.S. meat processing plants. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade has warned that failure to resolve the beef issue soon could jeopardize the ratification of the agreement. The timing of the resolution could be influenced by legislative elections scheduled for April 9, 2008, and the dynamics of political party politics in South Korea. The South Korean government is negotiating a new beef agreement with the United States, which is crucial for the ratification of the FTA. Congress is closely monitoring Korea's progress in opening its market before taking up the agreement. Concerns over violence against labor union officials in Colombia have also affected congressional consideration of the FTA. The Bush Administration is actively seeking congressional support for a trade agreement with Colombia in 2008. Colombia is a significant market for U.S. agricultural exports, with sales totaling $868 million in 2006. Key exports to Colombia include corn, wheat, cotton, soybeans, and soybean meal. Agricultural imports from Colombia amounted to nearly $1.5 billion, with unroasted coffee and fresh roses being the leading imports. Colombia's agricultural imports totaled almost $1.5 billion, with leading products being unroasted coffee, fresh roses, bananas, bouquet flowers, carnations, chrysanthemums, and raw cane sugar. The United States and Colombia signed a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in November 2006, eliminating tariffs and quotas on most agricultural products traded bilaterally. The FTA allowed immediate duty-free access for over half of U.S. exports to Colombia. Colombia has agreed to provide duty-free access for a variety of high-quality agricultural products from the United States, including beef, bacon, cotton, wheat, soybeans, apples, pears, peaches, cherries, frozen french fries, and cookies. Additionally, Colombia will eliminate price bands for 150 products and phase out tariffs on most other farm and food products over the next 3 to 19 years. Colombia and the United States have agreed to duty-free access for various agricultural products, including beef, bacon, cotton, wheat, soybeans, apples, and more. The negotiations for the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) were completed in 2006, with some unresolved issues regarding agricultural market access. The FTA was formally agreed upon on November 22, 2006, after Colombia fulfilled its pledge to permit beef imports. The White House agreed on November 22, 2006 as the date for the formal signing of the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Colombia. U.S. negotiators used leverage to address SPS issues and gain support from the domestic beef sector. Colombia's agricultural exports to the U.S. would mostly maintain duty-free access, with a unique treatment for sugar. The U.S. agreed to triple Colombia's access to the U.S. sugar market in the first year. The Colombia FTA includes a new preferential quota for sugar and specified sugar products, increasing annually. U.S. preferential TRQs were also established for beef, dairy products, and tobacco imports from Colombia. The USITC projects gains for U.S. agriculture in rice, corn, wheat, and soybeans, with increased sales of beef, pork, and processed foods. The impact of increased access for Colombian sugar on U.S. imports and production is expected to be minor. Cut flower imports from Colombia could rise with permanent duty-free access. The United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act was signed into law by President Bush on December 14, 2007. This agreement eliminates tariffs and quotas on agricultural products traded between the two countries, with the exception of sugar. Peru currently has tariffs on agricultural imports up to 25%, but under the FTA, the United States gains immediate duty-free access for almost 90% of its current farm exports to Peru. Peru agreed to eliminate price bands on 40 products and phase out tariffs on agricultural products over various transition periods, with variable tariffs reaching up to 68%. Quotas and over-quota tariffs will be expanded and reduced for sensitive commodities over different time frames. Peru and the United States agreed on transition periods for various agricultural products, with preferential TRQs for dairy products and sugar exports under a quota system. Peru will have increased access to the U.S. market for specific commodities, with unique treatment for sugar exports. Peru and the United States agreed on transition periods for agricultural products, with increased access for specific commodities. Peru will have a quota system for sugar exports, with a separate quota for organic sugar. The U.S. over-quota tariff on sugar imports will remain, and a sugar compensation provision is included. In 2006, Peru ranked 37th as a market for U.S. agriculture exports, with leading commodities being corn, cotton, wheat, soybean meal, and soybean oil. In 2006, U.S. agricultural exports to Peru totaled $43 million for corn, $19 million for wheat, $12 million for soybean meal, and $10 million for soybean oil. Agricultural imports from Peru to the U.S. were $602 million, with top products including fresh asparagus, unroasted coffee, raw cane sugar, processed artichokes, processed asparagus, paprika, and mangos. The Senate Finance Committee adopted a non-binding amendment regarding Peru's market access for U.S. beef in the Peru FTA's draft implementing bill. The Finance Committee amendment pressured Peru to allow imports of U.S. beef by a certain deadline. Peru agreed to allow imports of beef from U.S. cattle older than 30 months by a specified date. This decision was likely influenced by the government's objective to have the FTA considered by the U.S. Congress. In 2007, Peru's legislature approved a new trade framework on labor and environment, leading to the White House decision. The White House decision to send the FTA agreement to Congress in late 2008 was influenced by the resolution of the beef access issue with Peru. The USITC projects that the wheat sector will see the most gains for U.S. agriculture, with other sectors like corn, rice, cotton, beef, dairy products, and processed foods also expected to benefit. Additionally, the permanent tariff-free treatment for asparagus may lead to increased investment in Peru by U.S. growers and processors, making Peru a more competitive supplier in the U.S. market. The U.S. and Panama reached a comprehensive FTA agreement with market access provisions for U.S. agriculture. Both countries also signed an agreement on SPS measures for bilateral agricultural trade. This resolved differences over Panama's acceptance of the U.S. meat inspection system and achieved a balance in market access for sensitive agricultural products. Congressional consideration is expected in 2007 after labor and environmental provisions were incorporated into the FTA text. The U.S. has a positive agricultural trade balance with Panama. In 2007, the United States had a strong positive agricultural trade balance with Panama. U.S. agricultural exports to Panama totaled $206 million, with top exports including corn, soybean meal, wheat, food preparations, and rice. Agricultural imports from Panama to the U.S. were $56 million, with top imports being raw cane sugar, unroasted coffee, fresh melons, fresh pineapple, and pumpkins and yams. Almost two-thirds of U.S. farm exports to Panama would receive immediate duty-free treatment under the FTA, including high-quality beef, chicken, turkeys, pork, whey, soybeans, vegetable oils, cotton, wheat, barley, and various fruits. Panama agreed to establish preferential TRQs for U.S. agricultural products including pork, chicken leg quarters, dairy products, corn, rice, and potatoes. Tariffs on most U.S. agricultural imports would be phased out within 15 years, with a 20-year transition period for rice. Panama also agreed to increase tariff-free access for U.S. rice if needed. The United States and Panama agreed to establish preferential TRQs for various agricultural products, including sugar, cheese, milk, and ice cream. The largest duty-free TRQ for sugar will gradually increase over 10 years and then be capped indefinitely. Other TRQs will be phased out in 15 to 17 years. Panama also accepted the U.S. meat and poultry inspection system as equivalent to its own in a separate SPS agreement. Panama agreed to accept the U.S. meat and poultry inspection system as equivalent to its own, allowing facilities certified by USDA to export meat products without further inspection. The agreement also grants access for U.S. beef and poultry based on international standards, streamlines import documentation for U.S. processed foods, and recognizes the U.S. beef grading system. This eliminates long-standing regulatory barriers for U.S. products in Panama's market. The Panama FTA is not expected to be sent to Congress until August due to the term of the legislator elected as chairman of Panama's legislature, who is accused of murdering a U.S. soldier in the 1970s. Oman is a net agricultural importer with limited arable land. The U.S. market share of Oman's agricultural imports is small, with most food needs met by other countries. In 2006, U.S. food exports to Oman totaled $13 million, led by corn, flavored sugar, thickeners, non-fat dry milk, and mixed seasonings. Oman's average applied tariff on agricultural products in 2005 was just over 6%. The U.S.-Oman FTA includes a 5% tariff on most agricultural products, with exemptions for basic commodities. Pork, alcoholic beverages, and dried lemons face a 100% tariff. Oman will phase out duties on most agricultural products over five years, with a 10-year phase-out for those with the highest tariffs. The agreement allows duty-free access for U.S. products on 87% of Oman's agricultural tariff lines immediately. The U.S. will provide duty-free access for Oman's current exports of agricultural products, totaling $2 million in 2005. TRQs phased out over 10 years will allow duty-free access to the U.S. market for beef and specified dairy products produced in Oman. The FTA was signed into legislation on September 26, 2006, but will not take effect immediately. The U.S.-Oman FTA was signed into legislation on September 26, 2006, but will not take effect until the Omani government adopts laws on intellectual property rights and government procurement. FTA negotiations with Thailand and Malaysia did not conclude by the March 2007 deadline for congressional consideration under TPA authority. Talks with Malaysia are ongoing, while negotiations with Thailand may not resume due to public opposition. Congress may consider these agreements under new TPA provisions if negotiations conclude, or the Bush Administration may seek congressional approval without such authority. The U.S. may push for congressional consideration of FTAs with Thailand and Malaysia without TPA authority, depending on the level of opposition. U.S. agriculture sees potential in Thailand if tariffs are reduced, with estimated exports increasing by $800 million. Thailand aims for increased access for its fruit, vegetables, and sugar in the U.S. market. Thailand aims for increased access for its fruit, vegetables, and sugar in the U.S. market, facing opposition from Thai farmers and resistance within the bureaucracy. Negotiations were suspended in 2006 due to a political crisis, with no current plans to resume. In 2006, Thailand was the 16th largest market for U.S. agriculture, with export sales totaling $703 million. Top commodities sold included soybeans, cotton, wheat, animal feeds, whole cattle hides, and food preparations. U.S. agricultural imports from Thailand were over $1.3 billion, led by purchases of natural rubber. Thailand's agricultural imports to the U.S. were just over $1.3 billion, with key purchases including natural rubber, processed fruit (mainly pineapple), rice, food preparations, and non-alcoholic beverages. Thailand imposes high tariffs on various agricultural products, including meat, fresh fruits, vegetables, cheese, and pulses, to protect domestic producers. U.S. negotiators in FTA talks aimed to address issues related to Thailand's management of agricultural TRQs and burdensome requirements for securing imports. Thailand aims to address food safety and health issues in FTA talks with the U.S., seeking increased access for sugar and rice in the American market. U.S. objectives include eliminating non-tariff barriers for agricultural imports from Malaysia. In FTA talks with the U.S., Malaysia's tariffs on agricultural imports average 3.2%, with some products facing tariffs up to 30%. TRQs are in place for various products, but have no practical effect. U.S. negotiators may seek to simplify halal certification for livestock and poultry products. In 2006, Malaysia ranked 22nd as an overseas market for U.S. agriculture with exports totaling $410 million and imports at $829 million. Leading U.S. exports to Malaysia included soybeans, fresh grapes, non-fat dry milk, and tobacco. Top U.S. imports from Malaysia were refined palm oil, natural rubber, refined palm kernel oil, cocoa butter, and industrial fatty acids. Malaysia publicly stated its intention to exclude rice, tobacco, and alcohol products in an FTA with the United States. Malaysia's government corporation regulates imports and promotes domestic rice sales. Malaysia aims to exclude rice, tobacco, and alcohol from an FTA with the United States for national security and public health reasons. Progress was made on negotiating tariff reductions for agricultural products in recent rounds of negotiations. Malaysia plans to introduce compulsory labeling for certain products. Malaysia and the United States continue negotiations for an FTA, with concerns over compulsory labeling for GMO products and potential restrictions on U.S. agricultural exports. Malaysia aims to exclude rice but may include tobacco in the agreement. Discussions are ongoing, with progress made on tariff reductions for agricultural products. Negotiators discussed Malaysian regulations on alcohol and U.S. requests for market access at a recent session. Future rounds of negotiations may be scheduled after Malaysia's parliamentary elections. FTAs will open markets for U.S. agriculture in countries with high agricultural sector protection. U.S. agricultural trade with FTA partners will become more reciprocal as trade barriers are reduced, allowing for increased sales opportunities for U.S. agriculture and agribusiness exporters. The recently negotiated FTAs will provide opportunities for U.S. agricultural sectors, although some may face competition from increased imports. Transition periods and continued growth in U.S. demand will help mitigate competition. Disputes may arise as transition periods end, similar to experiences under NAFTA. Most U.S. agricultural groups and firms support the FTAs for increased market access benefits. The American Farm Bureau Federation supports FTAs for increased market access but did not expect a net gain from the agreement with Australia. National cattlemen trade organizations have differing positions on beef provisions in FTAs. Some U.S. commodity groups oppose FTAs due to increased competition from foreign producers. Opposition varies depending on sensitivity of imports, transition periods, and special provisions. The National Farmers Union (NFU) opposed DR-CAFTA due to concerns about unequal competition with farmers from FTA partner countries. U.S. trade negotiators aim to craft bilateral trade agreements considering support and opposition from agricultural sectors to secure final congressional approval. The strategy includes limiting U.S. trade concessions on sensitive agricultural commodities. The U.S. aims to limit trade concessions on sensitive agricultural commodities to minimize opposition in Congress for trade agreements. Projections on changes to U.S. agricultural trade under FTAs vary due to different analytical approaches. The USITC and AFBF simulations compare trade under each FTA to a baseline, but differ in scope and timing of implementation, leading to varying estimates. The USITC and AFBF use different econometric models to estimate the impact of FTA market access provisions on U.S. agricultural trade. USITC assumes immediate full implementation of FTA provisions, while AFBF focuses on each FTA partner's main agricultural commodity sectors. This results in varying estimates of the effects on the U.S. economy. The AFBF projects the impact of FTA partner's agricultural trade with the United States over long transition periods, considering adjustments in each country's agricultural sector, population growth, and economic growth. USITC analyses do not account for the staged implementation of agricultural provisions in FTAs, leading to understated projections of changes in U.S. agricultural exports and imports due to these agreements. The Farm Bureau's estimates of the impact of Free Trade Agreements on U.S. agricultural trade may overstate the projected increase in exports due to optimistic assumptions about market share.
