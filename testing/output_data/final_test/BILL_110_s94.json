    "content": "The Gasoline Consumer Anti-price-gouging Protection Act includes provisions for protecting consumers against price gouging, justifiable price increases, emergency proclamations, enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission, penalties, and definitions. SEC. 2. PROTECTION OF CONSUMERS AGAINST PRICE GOUGING. It is unlawful for any supplier to increase the price of gasoline or petroleum distillates in specified areas by an unconscionable amount during emergency periods. The prohibition on price gouging for gasoline and petroleum distillates does not apply if the price increase is due to factors such as wholesale cost, replacement costs, operational costs, or market conditions. Other factors considered include whether the price reflects supply and demand in a competitive market and additional costs or risks beyond the supplier's control. The seller incurs additional costs or risks beyond their control. SEC. 4. EMERGENCY PROCLAMATIONS AND ORDERS. The President may issue an emergency proclamation for abnormal market disruptions. If no Presidential proclamation is issued, the FTC can determine and address disruptions affecting multiple states. The proclamation or order must specify the duration. An emergency proclamation or order can be issued for abnormal market disruptions, specifying the reason and area it applies to. It cannot last more than 30 consecutive days, renewable for another 30 days, and can apply up to 7 days before the event. SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT BY FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION. The Federal Trade Commission enforces this Act by treating violations as unfair or deceptive acts. The Commission has the authority to prevent suppliers from violating the Act and apply penalties as per the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Federal Trade Commission enforces the Act by treating violations as unfair or deceptive acts and has the authority to prevent violations and apply penalties. The Act grants the Commission the same jurisdiction, power, and duties as the Federal Trade Commission Act, with regulations to be prescribed within 180 days of enactment. SEC. 6. PENALTIES. Civil Penalty: Suppliers who violate this Act may face civil penalties of up to $500,000 for small business marketers of gasoline and up to $5,000,000 for other suppliers. Penalties will be assessed similarly to those under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Multiple offenses and mitigating factors will be considered in penalty assessment. The violation of the Act incurs a criminal penalty of up to $1,000,000 fine, 2 years imprisonment, or both. The penalty can only be imposed through a criminal action by the Attorney General or designated officers. Each day of violation is considered separate, and efforts to remedy the harm caused are taken into account. The Department of Justice, or an attorney appointed by the Attorney General, can take legal action under section 515 of title 28, United States Code. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"abnormal market disruption\" refers to a situation where there is a reasonable likelihood of an increase in gasoline or petroleum distillates prices due to various factors like extreme weather, natural disasters, or civil disorder. \"Supplier\" is defined as any person involved in selling or distributing gasoline or petroleum distillates. The term \"unconscionable amount\" in this Act refers to a significant price increase in gasoline or petroleum distillates sold by a supplier, exceeding the average prices of the supplier or their competitors during a specified period. The emergency proclamation period must be justified by considering specific factors outlined in section 3. The Act will take effect when the Federal Trade Commission issues a final rule under section 5(c) and publishes it in the Federal Register."
