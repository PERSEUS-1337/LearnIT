    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Innovation Inspiration School Grant Program Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that American college graduates major in engineering at a lower rate compared to Asian countries, with only 5 percent of graduates majoring in engineering in the US. Additionally, US students perform poorly in mathematics and science by 12th grade compared to international peers. Admissions requirements for undergraduate engineering programs include a strong background in mathematics, science, English, social studies, and humanities. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, engineering employment is expected to grow by 11 percent from 2008 through 2018, with engineers earning high starting salaries. Engineers should possess creativity, analytical skills, and good communication abilities. Project- and problem-based learning in a competitive team environment is beneficial for 9th through 12th graders. Participants in FIRST Robotics, a program that inspires young people in science and technology, are more likely to attend higher education full-time (88% vs 53%), major in science or engineering fields, and specifically major in engineering. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, key definitions include terms like \"local educational agency,\" \"low-income student,\" \"secondary school,\" \"Secretary,\" \"STEM,\" and \"non-traditional STEM education teaching methods.\" Non-traditional STEM education teaching methods involve self-directed learning, inquiry-based learning, cooperative learning in small groups, collaboration with mentors, and participation in STEM competitions. SEC. 4. INNOVATIVE INSPIRATION SCHOOL GRANT PROGRAM. The Innovation Inspiration grant program aims to support non-traditional STEM teaching methods, student participation in STEM competitions, foster innovation in STEM careers, and encourage collaboration among students, engineers, and mentors. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to local educational agencies to promote STEM in secondary schools, support non-traditional teaching methods, and broaden students' access to STEM careers. Grants are awarded for up to 5 years in an amount sufficient to achieve program goals. Each local educational agency must submit an application to be considered for the grant. Each local educational agency seeking a grant under this Act must submit an application to the Secretary, detailing how they will implement STEM teaching programs using non-traditional methods, recruit partners and mentors, support educators leading the programs. The grant program aims to support educators and participants in STEM programs through stipends or incentives, recruit underrepresented individuals, secure public and private partners for support, plan for financial sustainability, and evaluate project results among participating students. The grant program supports STEM educators and participants by evaluating graduation rates, attendance at higher education institutions, STEM class participation, and student mentor partnerships. Priority is given to applications targeting specific activities. The grant program supports STEM education activities in rural or urban schools, low-performing schools, or schools serving low-income students. Funds can be used for STEM education promotion, purchasing supplies for non-traditional teaching methods, and providing incentives for teachers. The grant program supports STEM education activities in schools serving low-income students. Funds can be used for student participation in STEM competitions, additional materials for non-traditional teaching, evaluation, and other related activities. The grant program supports STEM education activities in schools serving low-income students. Local educational agencies receiving grants must use funds for nonprofit STEM competitions and may allocate up to 2 percent for administrative costs. They are also required to secure a 50 percent matching contribution from non-Federal sources. The Secretary may waive the matching requirement for a local educational agency if it would cause financial hardship. Grant funds must supplement, not supplant, existing funds for authorized activities. An evaluation program will compare students in the grant project to those who do not participate to assess impact. The Act authorizes appropriations for student participation impact assessment in future courses and postsecondary study. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2014 through 2018, with limitations on evaluation funding."
