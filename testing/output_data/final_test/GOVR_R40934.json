    "content": "The proposed Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) aims to prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity by public and private employers. It includes exemptions for religious organizations, educational institutions, the armed services, and small employers. The proposed Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) aims to prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity by public and private employers. It includes exemptions for religious organizations, educational institutions, the armed services, and small employers. ENDA would be enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and precludes preferential treatment or quotas based on sexual orientation or gender identity. It is patterned on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 but proposes a stand-alone legislative safeguard against discrimination. The proposed Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) aims to prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity by public and private employers. ENDA, like Title VII, prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. It includes exemptions for small employers, religious organizations, educational institutions, and the armed services. ENDA differs from Title VII in several significant respects, such as exemptions for certain organizations and the size of covered employers. The proposed Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) aims to prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity by public and private employers. ENDA would make it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an individual based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The legislation would cover most public and private employees, excluding volunteers who receive no compensation. The Armed Forces would be specifically excluded from coverage under ENDA. The proposed Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) aims to prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in employment. ENDA would forbid all forms of bias in hiring, promotion, compensation, training, and other aspects of employment. It would also prohibit discriminatory practices by employment agencies and labor organizations, as well as retaliation against employees who report discrimination. ENDA aims to prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in employment, forbidding bias in various aspects of employment. It includes provisions to hold employers liable for actions based on sexual orientation or gender identity and limits evidentiary options in such cases. The Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) aims to prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in employment. It includes provisions to hold employers liable for discriminatory actions and limits evidentiary options in such cases. ENDA does not allow disparate impact claims, requiring plaintiffs to prove intent to discriminate, and prohibits preferential treatment or quotas based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) allows employers to enforce reasonable dress and grooming standards, while permitting employees undergoing gender transition to adhere to standards of their identified gender. ENDA also clarifies that no new facilities need to be constructed. Amendments in the Senate version include barring remedies under both ENDA and Title VII for the same lawsuit and allowing mixed-motive claims in employment actions. The committee-approved version of ENDA would prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation, defining it as homosexuality, heterosexuality, or bisexuality. This contrasts with Title VII, which does not include sexual orientation discrimination under sex discrimination. Courts have generally rejected the idea that sex discrimination covers sexual orientation discrimination. ENDA would expand protection against employment discrimination beyond Title VII, which only covers traditional biological sex discrimination. Courts have allowed claims under Title VII for gay individuals facing sex discrimination like sexual harassment or gender stereotyping. Recent court decisions on sexual harassment have been influenced by the Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services case. The Supreme Court ruled that same-sex sexual harassment is actionable under Title VII, emphasizing that the critical question is whether the harassment occurred \"because of sex.\" The Court provided examples of how such an inference could be established, allowing individuals who are gay to prevail under Title VII. In Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, individuals who are gay can succeed under Title VII when an employer discriminates based on failure to conform to sex stereotypes. A female employee was denied partnership in an accounting firm despite being a high performer and told to act more femininely. The Court held that evaluating employees based on stereotypical views of femininity was prohibited under Title VII. Harassment for not conforming to sex stereotypes could constitute harassment \"because of sex,\" even if it is due to a belief of homosexuality. Based on recent decisions, individuals who are gay may be protected under Title VII if discriminated against due to sex, but not for discrimination based on sexual orientation. ENDA aims to address this gap by prohibiting employment discrimination based on gender identity. Under current law, Title VII does not expressly prohibit gender identity discrimination. Some federal courts have interpreted Title VII's prohibition against sex discrimination to cover gender and/or gender identity, while others have not. The Price Waterhouse decision held that discrimination based on not conforming to gender expectations is unlawful gender discrimination. The Price Waterhouse decision established that not conforming to socially constructed gender expectations is considered unlawful gender discrimination under Title VII. Courts have speculated that Title VII encompasses both gender and sex, prohibiting discrimination based on failure to conform to expected gender roles. Cases like Smith v. Salem and Barnes v. Cincinnati have shown that individuals undergoing gender transition can claim sex discrimination if they experience discriminatory treatment for not conforming to traditional gender norms. In Barnes v. Cincinnati, a male police officer transitioning to female was denied a promotion for acting too femininely. The EEOC ruled in Macy v. Holder that intentional discrimination based on gender identity is sex discrimination under Title VII. This decision could have a significant enforcement effect, as the EEOC handles initial claims processing for employment discrimination complaints. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reached a similar conclusion. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit concluded that firing a transgender employee for gender non-conformity violates the Equal Protection Clause. ENDA would explicitly prohibit gender identity discrimination, expanding protection under current employment law. ENDA would not alter current protections based on gender identity under Title VII or state law. Exceptions include the Armed Forces and certain religious organizations being exempt from coverage. Uniformed military personnel are not covered by Title VII, but civilian military employees are protected. ENDA would expand the current protection offered to religious organizations in relation to discrimination in employment practices, including exemptions for certain employers based on religion under Title VII. Religious educational institutions may also be exempt if they are owned or supported by a particular religion. The exemptions under Title VII allow certain organizations, including religious educational institutions, to be exempt from discrimination based on religion. ENDA ensures that these organizations covered by the exemptions of Title VII would not be required to comply with the provisions of the act. ENDA ensures that organizations exempt from Title VII would not be obligated to hire or retain individuals based on sexual orientation or gender identity, regardless of their religious beliefs. This exemption allows even religious organizations that do not oppose homosexuality to refuse to hire gay applicants, preserving their right to discriminate based on these factors. The ENDA exemption allows organizations to discriminate in hiring based on sexual orientation or gender identity, going beyond the Title VII exception. Factors determining eligibility for the exemption include the organization's purpose, ownership, and requirements for staff and members. The ENDA exemption allows organizations to discriminate in hiring based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Factors determining eligibility for the exemption include the organization's purpose, ownership, requirements for staff and members, and the extent of religious practices or nature of products and services offered. No single factor is dispositive, and organizations may qualify for an exemption if their purpose, character, and operations incorporate elements of their religion. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that a religious organization can qualify for an exemption under Title VII despite engaging in secular activities or not adhering strictly to religious tenets. The court emphasized the organization's primarily religious character, including its management by local rabbis and programs observing Jewish holidays. However, the exemption may not apply if there is no clear connection between the organization and its religious beliefs. In EEOC v. Townley Engineering, owners of a mining equipment company claimed a Title VII exemption for mandatory religious services based on their Christian faith-operated business. The court ruled that the exemption is typically for religious entities and closely affiliated organizations, not for-profit companies like Townley. In Pime v. Loyola University of Chicago, a former Jesuit university sought to retain its religious identity despite becoming secular. It claimed a Title VII exemption due to its ties to the Society of Jesus, but the court ruled that simply having religious owners or operators does not make a corporation 'religious' under the exemption. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ruled that despite a \"Jesuit presence\" at the university, it did not qualify for a Title VII exemption. Similarly, in EEOC v. Kamehameha Schools/Bishop Estate, the Ninth Circuit held that a school hiring Protestant teachers for secular education did not qualify for a Title VII exemption based on religious grounds. The court ruled that Kamehameha Schools did not qualify for a Title VII exemption based on religious grounds, despite having some religious characteristics. The schools' primary purpose was deemed secular, aiming to provide native Hawaiians with a solid secular education to participate in contemporary society. The absence of church ownership or control also influenced the court's decision. In Killinger v. Samford University, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that a Baptist college was exempt as a religious institution under Title VII, allowing it to require professors to adhere to the school's religious doctrine. The college's ties to a Baptist convention and its charter promoting the Christian religion were key factors in the court's decision. Independent Christian and other religious schools not owned or controlled by church bodies may face challenges in qualifying for the \"religious organization\" exemption in ENDA. The Senate adopted an amendment clarifying the exemption for religious organizations under ENDA. Federal agencies receiving funding cannot withhold benefits from religious employers exempt from ENDA. Enforcement procedures under ENDA would be similar to those of Title VII, with the DOJ enforcing against state and local governments, and the EEOC handling private employment complaints. Federal courts would have the same authority and powers to address sexual orientation or gender identity discrimination under the legislation as they do under Title VII. They can enforce remedies, including injunctions and affirmative action, to redress discrimination. The Supreme Court has supported a \"make-whole\" theory of relief under Title VII, allowing for affirmative action remedies when necessary. ENDA would forbid employers from using quotas or preferential treatment and provide remedies patterned on Title VII, including back pay awards for lost wages. Private employers could be liable for compensatory and punitive damages, with caps based on the number of employees. Plaintiffs could seek compensatory damages against governmental agencies. The Supreme Court has set limits on damages for employers based on the number of employees. Front pay is excluded from these limits, and ENDA would apply similar remedies as Title VII. ENDA would also waive states' Eleventh Amendment immunity for sexual orientation or gender identity discrimination cases involving federal financial assistance. The Supreme Court has narrowed congressional power to create a private right of action against states for monetary damages through a series of decisions, including Seminole Tribe v. Florida and Alden v. Maine. State sovereign immunity has been upheld, even in their own courts, as seen in City of Boerne v. Flores. Justice Kennedy declared the Religious Freedom Restoration Act unconstitutional. In declaring the Religious Freedom Restoration Act unconstitutional, Justice Kennedy emphasized that Congress's Section 5 power was limited to remedial measures and not defining equal protection. This limitation also applied to state immunity from private lawsuits under various civil rights acts. However, states may still waive Eleventh Amendment immunity for federal benefits conditioned on it. Congress can condition grants to states on waiving Eleventh Amendment immunity. ENDA's attorney's fees provision differs from Title VII. Prevailing parties in litigation may receive attorney's fees under Title VII. The prevailing party in litigation may receive attorney's fees under Title VII, but fee awards to defendant employers are not common. ENDA would allow courts and the EEOC to award attorney's fees to prevailing parties, similar to Title VII. ENDA would allow the EEOC to make fee awards in cases involving federal and private employment discrimination claims."
