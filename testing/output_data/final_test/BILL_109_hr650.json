    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Vaccine Accessibility for Children and Seniors Act of 2005\" or the \"VACS Act of 2005.\" The Congress acknowledges the significant public health benefits of vaccines, which have saved lives and prevented disabilities. Vaccines are available for preventing childhood diseases like polio and measles, as well as diseases among adults like influenza and pneumonia. They reduce medical costs, prevent the need for expensive drugs, and benefit the community by reducing disease exposure. The threat of litigation and high manufacturing costs have led to a decrease in the number of companies producing vaccines in the United States. In 1967, there were 26 companies making vaccines, but now only 4 companies produce the majority of vaccines, leading to limited access. The flu vaccine shortage in 2004 was attributed to costly liability lawsuits, prompting Congress to intervene in 1986. The Congress created the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program in 1986 to lower legal risks for vaccine manufacturers, ensure a stable vaccine supply, and compensate injured patients. Individuals can file claims for vaccine-related injuries in the United States Court of Federal Claims and receive economic damages for medical expenses, rehabilitation, lost earnings, and pain and suffering, with a cap of $250,000. Over $1.5 billion has been paid for vaccine-related injuries. $1.5 billion has been allocated for vaccine-related injuries and complications under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. Awards can exceed $1 million, with some reaching $7.5 million. Despite the program's intent to lower legal risks for vaccine manufacturers, they still face costly litigation due to individuals opting out and pursuing lawsuits in State and Federal courts. Trial attorneys often try to bypass the program by claiming certain vaccines are not covered or that the program does not apply. To ensure valid scientific evidence and protect public health policy, litigation involving federally approved vaccines must occur exclusively in US district courts, outside the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. This allows individuals ineligible for the program to pursue civil litigation. The Act mandates that litigation involving federally approved vaccines must occur exclusively in US district courts, following rules set by the Supreme Court. The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General, in consultation with the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines, must study and report recommendations to Congress within a year to ensure fair compensation for injured patients. The purposes of this Act are to establish legal reforms to facilitate vaccine manufacture, ensure litigation is based on valid scientific evidence, discourage frivolous lawsuits, and provide fair compensation for injured patients. SEC. 3. FEDERAL COURT REMEDY. Section 2122 of the Public Health Service Act is amended to establish a Federal cause of action for claims related to vaccine injuries or deaths occurring after October 1, 1988. The substantive law for such actions will be based on this section and the laws of the state where the vaccine was administered, except for cases under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The Federal cause of action for vaccine-related injuries or deaths after October 1, 1988 grants jurisdiction to district courts in the United States for all damages claims, excluding cases under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The State court action may be removed to the district court of the United States before final judgment. State causes of action for vaccine-related injuries or deaths after October 1, 1988 are preempted. The term 'vaccine' is defined to include any preservative, ingredient, or component of a vaccine, preempting state causes of action for vaccine-related injuries or deaths after October 1, 1988. SEC. 4. SANCTIONS FOR FRIVOLOUS VACCINE LITIGATION; 3-STRIKES RULE FOR SUSPENDING ATTORNEYS WHO COMMIT MULTIPLE RULE 11 VIOLATIONS. Mandatory Suspension for Attorneys Violating Rule 11 in Vaccine Lawsuits: If an attorney violates Rule 11 in connection with a vaccine suit three or more times, they shall be suspended from practicing law in that district court for 1 year, with the possibility of additional suspension. An attorney has the right to appeal a suspension under Rule 11. During the appeal process, the suspension is put on hold. To be reinstated to practice law in a district court after a suspension, the attorney must petition the court following its procedures. SEC. 5. TRIAL PROCEDURE. Section 2123 of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new subsection (b) regarding causation in fact in civil actions related to vaccine injuries or deaths. Amendment to the Public Health Service Act includes changes to subsections (c), (d), and (e) regarding the determination of vaccine-related injuries or deaths. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to section 2122(b)(2) of the Act. Transition rules are outlined in Section 6. If a State law claim for damages or relief related to a vaccine injury is pending in court, the plaintiff can elect to treat it as a Federal law claim under the Public Health Service Act within 30 days of the enactment of this Act. Failure to file this notice within the specified time frame may result in dismissal of the claim. If a State law claim for damages related to a vaccine injury is pending in court, the plaintiff can elect to treat it as a Federal law claim under the Public Health Service Act within 30 days. Failure to file this notice within the specified time frame may result in dismissal with prejudice. If the claim is pending in State court, it can be removed to the district court of the United States by filing a notice of removal containing a statement of grounds and relevant documents. The removal of a State law claim related to a vaccine injury to Federal court must be done within 40 days of the enactment of the Act. Failure to do so will result in the dismissal of the claim with prejudice. The State court must stop proceedings once the claim is removed, and any remanded action will be promptly dismissed with prejudice. SEC. 7. STUDY AND REPORT. The Congress intended the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program to be a flexible, no-fault system to handle claims quickly and avoid traditional litigation. Recent reports suggest delays, increased adversarial process, and claims becoming harder to prove, moving away from Congress' original intent. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program was intended by Congress as a no-fault system to quickly handle claims and avoid traditional litigation. Recent reports show a shift towards more adversarial processes and delays, moving away from the original intent. The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General are required to submit a report to Congress within a year with recommendations to ensure injured patients with legitimate claims are compensated in a less adversarial manner."
