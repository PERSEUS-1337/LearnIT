    "content": "The Military Occupational Specialty Transition (MOST) Program is outlined in Section 1. The Military Occupational Specialty Transition (MOST) Program, outlined in Section 1, establishes a training program for eligible veterans to acquire job market-relevant skills. Eligible veterans are those with limited transferable military occupational specialties, not eligible for other education or training services, and have not gained marketable skills post-military service. The MOST Program provides payments to employers offering apprenticeship or on-the-job training to eligible veterans who meet specific criteria, including having not acquired marketable skills since leaving military service, being discharged under honorable conditions, and being unemployed for at least 90 days in the 180-day period prior to applying for the program. The MOST Program provides payments to employers for apprenticeship or on-the-job training for eligible veterans. The program ensures veterans are paid at least the same rate as nonveterans in similar jobs, are expected to be qualified for employment after training, and will be hired by the employer upon completion of training. The Secretary enters into contracts with employers to provide these programs, with payments made to employers whose programs meet the requirements. The MOST Program provides payments to employers for apprenticeship or on-the-job training for eligible veterans. The amount paid to veterans is 50% of their wages, calculated hourly. Payments are capped at $20,000 in total and $1,666.67 per month, only for the first 12 months of participation. The Secretary can extend payments for veterans on a part-time basis. Payments under this section are capped at $20,000 in total and $1,666.67 per month for eligible veterans participating in the MOST Program. Employers must submit quarterly reports certifying wages paid to veterans, and $60,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2009 to 2018. The Secretary is required to include detailed reporting. The Secretary is required to report on activities under this section in the annual report. The Department must have a separate budget line item for funds to carry out this section. The Military Occupational Specialty Transition (MOST) program is being amended in various sections of the title to include the new section 3687A."
