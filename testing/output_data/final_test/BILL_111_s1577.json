    "content": "The Asthma Act may be cited as the ``Asthma Act''. The findings of the Act are outlined in Section 2. Congress finds that asthma affects millions of adults and children in the US, leading to numerous hospital visits and preventable deaths. The annual healthcare costs related to asthma are significant, but with proper management and public health interventions, asthma can be controlled effectively. Population-based research supported by the National Institutes of Health has shown the benefits of combining medical treatment with patient education to improve asthma management. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program raises awareness about asthma as a chronic disease and promotes effective management through education. Despite extensive knowledge on asthma management strategies, current Federal policy and funding are inadequate, leading to a rise in asthma prevalence, deaths, and expenditures. Additional Federal direction, funding, and support are needed. Additional Federal direction, funding, and support are necessary to increase awareness of asthma as a chronic illness, its symptoms, and environmental factors affecting the disease, as well as to promote education programs for better asthma management. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is addressed in Section 3. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is authorized additional funding of $4,100,000 annually from 2010 to 2014 to expand the program.

This includes determining asthma incidence, prevalence, and preventing health consequences through various means like public service announcements. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in collaboration with states, will conduct local asthma surveillance activities to collect data on asthma prevalence, severity, and management quality. This includes telephone surveys and health care facility surveillance. Data on children suffering from asthma and childhood mortality rates associated with asthma will be compiled and published annually. Additional funding of $8,200,000 annually is authorized for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to support asthma surveillance nationally and in each state from 2010 to 2014. SEC. 5.

States are required to develop action plans for asthma and may receive financial incentives for children's health insurance programs. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will carry out a program to encourage states to assist children with asthma according to guidelines. States with satisfactory asthma plans under the Children's Health Insurance Program may receive grants for activities. Matching funds are required for costs.

Congress encourages hospitals to provide asthma education and training to patients and families upon discharge. They should establish telephone services for patients and communicate with primary health providers. Managed care organizations are urged to disseminate asthma clinical guidelines, collect data, and offer education to patients and families.
