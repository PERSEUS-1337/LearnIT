    "content": "The long-term unemployment rate tends to rise during economic downturns, as seen in past recessions. During the latest recession, the rate increased from 0.9% in December 2007 to 4.0% in October 2010, peaking at 4.4% in 2010. The long-term unemployment rate was 4.0% in October 2010, with 41.8% of unemployed workers looking for work for more than 26 weeks. This high incidence of long-term unemployment coincided with Congress' extension of UC benefits beyond the usual duration. The 111th Congress provided a maximum of 33 weeks of benefits from November 2008 to October 2009. The long-term unemployment rate and share of long-term unemployment were outside the usual ranges in October 2009. An extension of benefits to 53 weeks starting in November 2009 led to even higher long-term unemployment rates in early 2010. The extension of benefits to a maximum of 53 weeks through the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program may have encouraged individuals to keep looking for jobs instead of dropping out of the labor force after using up their regular UC benefits. However, the low hiring rate of employers has made it less likely for workers to refuse job offers in order to continue receiving EUC benefits. An analysis by Valletta and Kuang found that recent extensions of unemployment benefits have had little impact on the historically high level of long-term unemployment during severe labor market downturns. The effects of extended unemployment benefits during severe labor market downturns are relatively small. Studies suggest that temporary benefits could contribute to a slight increase in the unemployment rate. However, the hiring rate has decreased significantly during recent recessions, with a lower hiring rate compared to previous economic downturns. The hiring rate fell during the 2007-2009 recession, reaching a low of 3.5% in March 2003 before gradually increasing. Industry restructuring made it harder for workers to find new jobs quickly. Displaced workers may take longer to find new jobs, especially if their skills do not match those needed in growing industries. The jobless recovery from the 2001 recession prompted economists to analyze the situation. The jobless recovery from the 2001 recession led economists to analyze if increased industry restructuring caused unemployed workers to move to industries with higher labor demand. Groshen and Potter found more industries restructuring during the 2001 recession compared to previous cycles, while Aaronson, Rissman, and Sullivan disagreed, stating that restructuring was less than in earlier periods. They noted the high duration of unemployment in 2002 and 2003. The high duration of unemployment in 2002 and 2003 was attributed to an increased mismatch between the skills of displaced workers and the skills demanded by growing industries. Workers from downsizing industries experienced a significant increase in time spent not working, while it took a considerable amount of time for these resources to be re-employed elsewhere. Rissman's recent work from 1984 to 2009 shows that structural realignment affects unemployed workers differently by industry. Workers in finance, insurance, and real estate can find alternative employment easier due to transferable skills, while those in construction, manufacturing, and transportation struggle to find new jobs. Distinguishing between cyclical and structural unemployment is crucial for implementing effective economic policies. The report discusses the impact of fiscal and monetary policies on reducing unemployment, as well as the need for employment policies in response to permanent shifts in labor demand. It compares long-term unemployment trends after recent recessions using data from the Current Population Survey and the ASEC Supplement. The analysis aims to identify policies to address the plight of jobless workers. The ASEC Supplement, formerly known as the March Supplement, collects data on household and family income sources and amounts. Changes in the CPS over time have impacted the comparability of variables across the last three recessions. New industry and occupation classification systems were adopted in January 2003, affecting how industries and occupations are categorized. Additionally, changes in how survey respondents can report race have made meaningful comparisons over time difficult. The CPS sample size also limits the detail of the analysis due to being a household survey. In 2009, older unemployed workers were more likely to experience long-term unemployment, with 30.4% of 25-34 year olds and 33.1% of 35-44 year olds out of work for at least 27 weeks. Age (a proxy for seniority) tends to protect older workers from layoffs, but offers little protection if companies close. Older workers with higher job tenure may face challenges in finding new employment. Older workers with higher job tenure may face challenges in finding new employment, leading to prolonged joblessness, especially in industries undergoing structural changes. Men have experienced greater unemployment rates than women during and after recessions, attributed to their dominance in cyclically sensitive industries. Recent recessions have shown a shift in long-term unemployment likelihood by gender, with unemployed women now as likely as men to be out of work for over half a year. In 1991, unemployed women were less likely than men to experience long-term joblessness, but by 2009, the gender gap in long-term unemployment had narrowed significantly. Women's increased attachment to the labor force has led to behavior more similar to men, with women now more likely to seek new jobs and persist in their job search for extended periods. Additionally, individuals who completed high school were more likely to experience long-term unemployment in 2009 compared to other groups. In 2009, high school graduates faced a higher risk of long-term unemployment due to the significant impact of the recession on industries like construction and manufacturing. This recession also saw a greater risk of long-term unemployment for workers in the information sector. Unemployment was high among workers laid off from industries like telecommunications, publishing, finance, insurance, and real estate in 2009. Almost two out of five workers did not receive a paycheck for over six months. Displaced manufacturing workers also faced long-term unemployment. Workers in management, business, and financial occupations had a greater probability of being unemployed for more than six months compared to other occupations. Workers in management, business, and financial occupations faced lengthy unemployment due to industry-specific skills and job market conditions. Office and administrative support workers were significantly affected during the 2007-2009 recession, leading to elevated risks of long-term unemployment. Unemployment not only impacts individuals but also their families, causing a loss of earnings and benefits. Unemployed workers may face a loss of income and benefits, including health insurance coverage. They may struggle to keep up with mortgage payments and could face foreclosure. Some may have income from other sources and be eligible for unemployment compensation and other benefits. COBRA allows them to purchase health insurance through their former employer, with possible subsidies. Unemployed workers may be eligible for health coverage income tax credit (HCTC) or Medicaid. The analysis compares long-term unemployed workers with all unemployed and employed workers, focusing on different household types. Data is from the 2010 ASEC survey, collecting information on household earnings, income, and health insurance status for 2009. The 2010 ASEC survey data has limitations in analyzing household characteristics of long-term unemployed workers. Household surveys like the CPS tend to underreport income, especially from sources like interest and dividends. This may result in underestimating household income and benefits received. Figure 8 displays average real earnings of households in 2009, 2001, and 1991 for employed, unemployed, and long-term unemployed workers. In 2009, average household earnings of long-term unemployed workers were lower than those of employed workers ($38,580 vs. $71,730). The earnings of long-term unemployed in 2009 were also lower than in 2001 ($38,580 vs. $43,330). Long-term unemployed households had earnings about 54% of employed workers in 2009, the same as in 1991 but lower than in 2001 (59%). In 2009, the average household income of long-term unemployed individuals was $42,400, which was 54% of the average income of employed workers ($78,240). Married couples with at least one long-term unemployed spouse had average earnings of $51,960, which was 53% of married couples where neither spouse was unemployed. In 2009, almost half of long-term unemployed workers received unemployment benefits, with 27.3% living below the poverty level. About one in five households receiving public assistance had low incomes. In 2009, 21.7% of long-term unemployed workers lived in households receiving SNAP benefits, which was higher than in 2001 (15.7%) but similar to 1991 (19.3%). Only 1.6% of long-term unemployed received public assistance income in 2009, down from 4.3% in 2001 and 7.6% in 1991. The CPS may underestimate the percentage of unemployed receiving public assistance, as shown by comparisons with TANF data. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included a subsidy for up to 15 months for unemployed workers to buy health insurance under COBRA, with a 65% employer tax credit. Some may also be eligible for a health coverage income tax credit to help with premiums. In 2009, 14.8% of long-term unemployed workers had Medicaid coverage, similar to 2001 but higher than 1991. 55.2% of long-term unemployed had health insurance in 2009, lower than employed workers. In 2009, a high percentage of households of the long-term unemployed had no earners, surpassing the rates in 2001 and 1991. Among married couples, if one spouse becomes unemployed, there is a possibility that the other spouse or someone else in the household may be working. In 2009, the percentage of married couple households with two earners decreased. Employed workers are more likely to own their own home compared to unemployed workers. Homeownership fell among workers unemployed for more than six months from 1991 to 2009. There was a slight decline in homeownership among employed workers from 2001 to 2009. After a job loss, some homeowners may struggle to make mortgage payments, leading to delinquency and potential foreclosure. In 2009, over half of delinquent loans were 90 or more days past due, double the previous year. Recessions lead to decreased consumer demand and investment, resulting in lower car and home purchases, reduced travel and entertainment spending, and less investment in new buildings and equipment, ultimately leading to increased unemployment. The response to a recession involves fiscal and monetary policies to address the decline in aggregate demand and rising unemployment. Fiscal policy involves government spending and tax changes, while monetary policy involves actions by the Federal Reserve to impact money supply and interest rates. The pace of job growth and reduction in unemployment during an economic rebound depend on the strength of the recovery. Initially, increased demand for goods and services reduces short-term unemployment, but the average duration of unemployment may still increase post-recession. Employers start hiring more once they are confident in the economic upturn. During economic recovery, firms may prioritize hiring short-term unemployed over long-term unemployed due to perceived lower productivity and skills atrophy. Older workers are also discriminated against in hiring. Employment policies like wage subsidies could help address these labor market challenges. To address labor market difficulties, offering wage subsidies to firms hiring the long-term unemployed compensates for skill shortcomings. Providing training subsidies for workers with deteriorated skills due to lengthy unemployment can also help. Implementing temporary public jobs programs during recessions may prevent skill erosion. Stepped-up enforcement of workplace discrimination laws can discourage employers from not hiring older displaced workers. Economic growth alone may not fully solve reemployment issues for the long-term unemployed. Structural changes during cyclical downturns can further complicate reemployment. During cyclical downturns, long-term unemployment among steelworkers worsened significantly. Wage insurance programs have been proposed to help reemploy workers from restructuring industries by compensating for wage differences in new jobs. Older workers under the ATAA program can receive half of the earnings difference if reemployed within 26 weeks of being laid off. During cyclical downturns, wage insurance programs like the ATAA program can help reemploy workers from restructuring industries by compensating for wage differences in new jobs. Workers laid off can receive one-half of the earnings difference if reemployed within 26 weeks, up to a maximum of $10,000 over two years. Reemployment bonuses and job search assistance have been shown to shorten the length of benefit receipt for unemployed workers. Economic development and relocation assistance may also be appropriate for geographically concentrated industries. President Obama created the position of Director of Recovery for Auto Communities and Workers within the Department of Labor to assist workers affected by the auto industry's restructuring. Relocation assistance is offered to TAA-eligible workers and those served by the Workforce Investment Act. Unemployed workers may not possess the skills needed for jobs in growing industries. Unemployed workers affected by structural changes in the economy may lack the necessary skills for jobs in expanding industries. Education and training may not lead to quick reemployment. Data for analysis is from the Current Population Survey (CPS), a household survey by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The survey represents the civilian, noninstitutional population and excludes individuals in institutions or on active duty in the military. The Current Population Survey (CPS) conducts the Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) Supplement each year, interviewing approximately 50,000 households monthly. The supplement collects information on family income, health insurance coverage, and household details for the previous year. The sample is representative of the civilian, noninstitutional population of the United States, including members of the Armed Forces living in civilian housing units. In the 2010 supplement, 77,000 households were interviewed, with earnings including wage and salary income, self-employment income, tips, commissions, and bonuses. Total income comprises earnings, interest, dividends, and social security. Total income includes earnings, interest, dividends, social security, pension benefits, public assistance, unemployment, worker's compensation, alimony, child support, and other money income. Money income excludes in-kind transfers for food, housing, healthcare, or energy assistance, as well as capital gains and taxes. Family earnings and income in the CPS represent the combined earnings and income of all household members. A family in the CPS is defined as a group of two or more related persons living together, including related subfamilies like married children or unmarried individuals with children. Single individuals are categorized as \"nonfamily householders\" or \"secondary individuals\" in the CPS. In this report, families in the CPS are defined as groups of related persons living together, including subfamilies. Unmarried parents are considered single parents, while unmarried couples without children are treated as single individuals. The analysis includes individuals in the labor force aged 16 and over with positive earnings or income. Topcoding is used to protect survey participant confidentiality by assigning income amounts to higher earners. Changes in topcodes can impact trends in real income and earnings over time. Since 1991, earnings have been topcoded at various amounts ($99,999 in 1991, $150,000 in 2001, and $200,000 in 2009). For individuals earning above these limits, average earnings are reported based on similar characteristics. Similarly, incomes above the topcoded amounts are replaced with average income figures. Confidence Intervals Estimates are based on survey responses from households. Intervals Estimates from survey responses have two types of error: nonsampling (misreported information, processing errors) and sampling (due to surveying a sample, not the entire population). Sampling error is the difference between estimates from a sample and the actual population value. Confidence intervals around population estimates provide accuracy information, with a 90% confidence interval including the average estimate in 90% of samples."
