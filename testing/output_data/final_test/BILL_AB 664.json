    "title": "AB 664",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature intends to develop and test a universal assessment process for LTSS programs, including IHSS. County agencies are required to continue IHSS assessment and authorization processes, making final determinations of IHSS hours. No sooner than January 1, 2015, counties must use the universal assessment tool for IHSS services for specified counties and beneficiary categories. Managed care health plans must cover IHSS services based on the results of the universal assessment process. The department, State Department of Social Services, and California Department of Aging will establish a stakeholder workgroup by June 1, 2013, to develop a universal assessment process and tool for home- and community-based services. The workgroup will include various stakeholders and build upon existing assessment processes for IHSS, MSSP, and other services. The departments will develop a universal assessment tool for home- and community-based services, considering roles, reassessment criteria, oversight, appeals process, data exchange, and person-centered principles. The departments will develop a universal assessment tool for home- and community-based services, considering roles, reassessment criteria, oversight, appeals process, data exchange, and person-centered principles. The workgroup will also address how the assessment can be used to evaluate the need for nursing facility care and redirect individuals to home- and community-based services. By December 1, 2016, a report on the progress of developing the universal assessment process will be submitted to the Legislature, including the counties and beneficiary categories where it may be implemented. Upon completion of the design and development of a new universal assessment tool, managed care health plans, counties, and other home- and community-based services providers may test the tool for a limited number of beneficiaries in selected counties, subject to federal approvals, system testing, and training requirements. The department will implement a rapid-cycle quality improvement system to monitor the universal assessment process and make necessary modifications to meet legislative intent and project goals. Consumers will be informed of the option to participate in the testing phase. Training is required for entities using the tool, and changes resulting from the assessment process will be automated in the system. Beneficiaries can request an additional assessment for home- and community-based services until the IHSS assessment process is amended. The department, State Department of Social Services, and California Department of Aging will report to the Legislature on the initial use of the universal assessment process, potential expansion to other beneficiary categories or counties, and any necessary statutory changes. Annual reports on the status and results of the universal assessment process will be provided, including consumer satisfaction findings. The consumers' ability to respond to assessment items and comparison of data from the universal assessment process to previous tools will be reported. The report must comply with Government Code Section 9795 and this section will be in effect until September 1, 2018."
