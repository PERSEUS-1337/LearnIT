    "content": "The Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2012 includes definitions and titles for Federal-aid highways, additional programs, and rescission of unobligated balances. It may be cited as the \"Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2012\". The Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2012 includes definitions for terms like Part-Year Funding Date and Part-Year Ratio, as well as references to SAFETEA-LU and STEA of 2010. SEC. 101 of TITLE I states the continuation of Federal-Aid Highway Programs. The text outlines the continuation of various transportation provisions authorized under different acts and codes until the Part-Year Funding Date. Authorization of appropriations is also mentioned from the Highway Trust Fund. The text outlines the continuation of transportation provisions authorized until the Part-Year Funding Date, with funds distributed from the Highway Trust Fund for programs and projects. Funds from the Highway Trust Fund for fiscal year 2011 are authorized for transportation programs and projects under various acts and codes. Contract authority allows for funds to be used for obligations. Funds from the Highway Trust Fund for fiscal year 2011 are authorized for transportation programs and projects. These funds shall be available for obligation and administered similarly to funds apportioned under title 23, United States Code. From October 1, 2011, to the Part-Year Funding Date, there is a limitation on obligations included in appropriations Acts for fiscal year 2012. During this period, obligations subject to the limitation shall not exceed the specified amount. The limitation on obligations included in appropriations Acts for fiscal year 2012 is calculated based on the Part-Year Ratio. Exceptions to this limitation include obligations under specific sections of title 23, United States Code. The distribution of obligations is determined through calculations. Upon enactment of an appropriations Act for the Department of Transportation for fiscal year 2012, the Secretary of Transportation must annualize contract authority for Federal-aid highways and highway safety construction programs to calculate the distribution of obligation limitation. This distribution is then multiplied by the Part-Year Ratio. Additionally, authorizations under Title V of SAFETEA-LU are extended. Each program authorized under paragraphs (1) through (5) of section 5101(a) of SAFETEA-LU shall continue from October 1, 2011, to the Part-Year Funding Date at the 2011 funding level multiplied by the Part-Year Ratio. Funds will be distributed to major program areas in the same proportions as in 2011, without specific activity designations. SEC. 102. ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Authorization of Contract Authority: Funds are authorized to be appropriated from the Highway Trust Fund for administrative expenses of the Federal-aid highway program. The funds shall be available for obligation and administered similarly to apportioned funds under title 23, subject to a limitation on obligations for highway construction programs. TITLE II--ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS\n\nSEC. 201. DINGELL-JOHNSON SPORT FISH RESTORATION ACT.\n\nAmends the Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act to include funding provisions for the period from October 1, 2011, to the Part-Year Funding Date set in the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2012.\n\nTITLE III--RESCISSION\n\nSEC. 301. RESCISSION OF UNOBLIGATED BALANCES. On September 1, 2012, $3,130,000,000 of unobligated funds apportioned to each State under title 23, United States Code, is permanently rescinded. Certain funds are exempt from this rescission. States have the authority to determine the amount of rescission from applicable programs."
