    "content": "Congressional authority over immigration in the U.S. is derived from constitutional clauses, including the power to establish rules of naturalization. The Supreme Court has recognized Congress's authority in regulating admission to the country and defining citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment. Despite debates among legal scholars, courts have interpreted Congress's power to establish a uniform rule of naturalization broadly. Private immigration bills are based on the First Amendment and Congress's power to pay debts. Congress has a history of enacting such legislation to provide exceptions for individuals or small groups affected by public immigration laws. Private immigration bills are a last resort for relief after exhausting all other remedies. They provide exceptions for individuals or small groups affected by public immigration laws. The number and type of private bills often reveal flaws in public laws, leading to amendments. Since 1839, 7321 private immigration laws have been enacted, with naturalization waivers constituting the lowest percentage due to the serious implications of conferring citizenship. Private immigration bills confer lawful permanent resident (LPR) status by waiving provisions related to inadmissibility or deportation, numerical limits, and eligible immigrant categories. These bills are considered only after all other avenues for relief have been exhausted, and do not automatically prevent removal or deportation. Private immigration bills confer LPR status by waiving inadmissibility or deportation provisions, numerical limits, and immigrant category restrictions. A stay of removal/deportation may be granted by ICE in DHS upon request from a congressional subcommittee, but this is discretionary and not legally required. The Senate Subcommittee only requests reports on private bills upon written request from the bill's author and does not defer deportation for certain categories of beneficiaries. The House Subcommittee rules state that they will not intervene in removal/deportation proceedings or request a stay from ICE unless the bill is meant to prevent \"extreme hardship\" to the beneficiary or a U.S. citizen spouse, parent, or child. The Senate Subcommittee, on the other hand, generally requests a report upon the author's request without initial consideration of the case's merits, only requiring a showing of hardship for certain disfavored categories. The House Subcommittee will not request a report unless a motion has been made at a formal meeting and a consideration of the \"extreme hardship\" requirement has been met. ICE may grant a stay of removal for a private bill beneficiary until February 1 of the next odd-numbered year. Removal may proceed if the beneficiary's presence becomes contrary to U.S. interests after consultation with the bill's author and Judiciary Committee. ICE may establish a deadline for removal/deportation or voluntary departure if adverse action is taken on a private bill. Adverse actions could include decisions by subcommittees or the full committee to not recommend or report a bill favorably, negative votes, or a veto by the President. The definition of adverse actions is not clearly defined in immigration laws or regulations. ICE may establish a deadline for removal/deportation or voluntary departure if adverse action is taken on a private bill. The February 1 deadline allows time for reintroduction of a bill in the following Congress if no adverse or final positive action is taken. ICE notifies beneficiaries of adverse dispositions and sets new execution dates for removal orders. ICE transmits a complete report on beneficiaries to the Subcommittee, referring them to other agencies for classified information. After submitting a report on a private bill, any new material information or actions affecting a beneficiary must be reported to the Committee or Subcommittee. ICE may informally update the Committee on adverse information. If the bill is reintroduced in the same chamber, additional material and background checks are sent in a supplemental letter. If reintroduced in a different chamber or a previous Congress, a new report is required. If adverse action was taken on a private bill at any time and a new bill is reintroduced for the same purpose for the same beneficiary in either chamber, ICE will not honor a request for a report unless the adverse action on the previous similar bill is reconsidered. Introduction of a private immigration bill to confer permanent resident status for a beneficiary holding a nonimmigrant visa status raises a presumption of termination of such status. Removal/deportation proceedings are conducted to a final determination, and any resulting order may be stayed according to procedural practice. If a beneficiary holding a nonimmigrant visa status desires adjustment through a private bill, removal/deportation proceedings will be initiated and conducted to a final determination. ICE will notify the beneficiary of the termination of nonimmigrant status due to the private bill introduction and request a response within 30 days. If adjustment through the private bill is not desired, nonimmigrant status will likely be restored. If a beneficiary with a nonimmigrant visa status seeks adjustment through a private bill, removal/deportation proceedings will be initiated. If the beneficiary had certain visa statuses, voluntary departure may be granted or visa extension requests denied. Private bills can be granted in increments of one year if the beneficiary maintains visa status. Removal or deportation proceedings will not be initiated in cases involving appealing humanitarian factors. ICE and relevant State Department offices will take action according to the private law terms if a private bill is enacted. ICE will not start removal/deportation proceedings solely based on information in Judiciary Committees' reports. The most important factor for Subcommittees is if the private immigration bill aligns with past private laws' precedents. The House Subcommittee rules state that private bills must meet certain precedents and be of an extraordinary nature to be considered. Certain types of bills require a two-thirds vote to be reviewed, including those that do not comply with rules, waive foreign residence requirements for doctors, or waive naturalization laws. The rules outline criteria for reviewing bills and favorable precedential conditions for different categories. The House Subcommittee rules outline criteria for reviewing private bills, including waivers for adopted children, non-immigrant doctors, criminal grounds for deportation, advanced medical treatment, and persons with deferred action or parole status adjusting to LPR. Private immigration laws historically granted lawful permanent resident (LPR) status to individuals needing expedited status under the quota system from 1921 to 1965. Waivers for various grounds such as health exclusion, military conscription avoidance, visa fraud, expedited naturalization for athletes, and restoration of citizenship are generally disfavored unless proven to be in the national interest. Private immigration laws historically granted lawful permanent resident (LPR) status through expedited processes or waivers for certain individuals, such as foreign orphans adopted by U.S. citizens, war brides, children of U.S. citizen servicemen, and displaced persons/refugees after World War II. These laws also included waivers for grounds of exclusion/inadmissibility and occasionally provided for citizenship through the waiver of certain requirements. In the 1970s, cases of citizenship granted outright generally involved women who lost citizenship through marriage to a foreigner, children born abroad to U.S. citizens who mistakenly believed they were citizens, and persons who lost citizenship due to retention requirements under obsolete laws. In the 1970s, corruption scandals like Abscam led to the expulsion of a House member and a decline in private immigration laws. The trend hit a low point in the 104th Congress with only 2 private immigration laws enacted. The late 1990s saw a brief increase in private laws after the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, but the number declined post-9/11. 72 private immigration bills have been introduced in the 109th Congress, with no laws enacted yet. Errors or delays in processing petitions have left some individuals unable to receive permanent resident status, despite efforts from relatives. Common situations include orphan adoptees aging out before completion of the adoption process and conditional permanent resident petitions not being approved before the death of a U.S. citizen spouse. In orphan adoption cases, U.S. citizens often try to adopt older children whose deceased parents or guardians were connected to the petitioners. The precedents regarding juveniles generally concern children of U.S. citizen parents who needed special dispensation to emigrate for family reunification. Beneficiaries who came to the U.S. as children but did not obtain LPR status due to errors or deaths of parents may be eligible for relief. Family unification is a key factor in granting private law relief. Private law relief is often granted to beneficiaries who face bureaucratic delays or hardships, especially after the death of a U.S. citizen or LPR relative. These beneficiaries typically had pending immigrant visa petitions that expired due to the relative's death, leaving them with no other immigration options. Despite having close relatives in the U.S., they may not be able to petition for the beneficiary, such as minor U.S. citizen children or relatives with insufficient relation. Family ties in the U.S. and lack of familial connections in their native country are key considerations for private law relief eligibility. Private law relief is granted to beneficiaries facing bureaucratic delays or hardships, especially after the death of a U.S. citizen or LPR relative. Special circumstances, such as hate crimes or unique national foreign-policy interests, may warrant private law relief. Cases like that of human rights activist Wei Jingsheng highlight the support provided through private laws for individuals with pending immigration petitions. Enactment of private law supports activists and movements for human rights and democracy. Other laws benefit various individuals in unique circumstances, such as Persian Gulf War evacuees with U.S. ties and a Swiss bank employee who exposed unlawful actions. The House and Senate Subcommittee rules prioritize cases of extreme hardship, requiring a written statement detailing the case's equities and lack of alternative remedies. The Senate rules offer more flexibility without specific precedents. Private law for granting citizenship should not be confused with honorary citizenship, which is a symbolic gesture without granting additional legal rights or imposing extra duties. Honorary citizenship has been awarded to individuals like Mother Teresa, Raoul Wallenberg, Winston Churchill, William Penn, and Hannah Callowhill Penn for their exceptional contributions. Honorary citizenship is a symbolic gesture without granting legal rights or imposing duties. It is granted through a public law, not a private law, to recognize outstanding commitment to humanity and America. Mother Teresa, Winston Churchill, and others have received honorary citizenship for their exceptional contributions. Private Law No. 104-3 H.R. 1031 waives immigration laws for Oscar Salas-Velazquez due to serious family medical conditions, including his wife and child's health risks if they were to join him in Mexico. The House Report acknowledged the extreme hardship faced by the wife and child of Oscar Salas-Velazquez, who suffer from Reiter's syndrome, a severe arthritic disease triggered by intestinal infection. This legislation does not set a precedent for marriage fraud waivers but recognizes the precedent for extreme hardship in cases of medical circumstances. Mrs. Salas-Velazquez and her child cannot visit Mexico due to the risk of developing Reiter's syndrome. Private Bill for the relief of South Vietnamese disabled war veteran Major Nguyen Quy An, who saved American airmen during the war but lost both arms. He was ineligible for a special entry program due to his injuries. Major An, a South Vietnamese disabled war veteran who saved American airmen during the war but lost both arms, was ineligible for a special entry program due to his injuries. An amendment was made to a legislation to allow Major An to file for naturalization without the permanent residence period. The beneficiary, a security guard in a Swiss bank, discovered Holocaust-era bank records and saved them, leading to his firing, harassment, and death threats. He and his family fled to the US and were granted permanent residency under a private bill. The beneficiary, a security guard in a Swiss bank, discovered Holocaust-era bank records, leading to his firing, harassment, and death threats. He and his family fled to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program. No immediate immigration relief was available to them, but a private bill was enacted to make him eligible for Nazi reparations. The beneficiary, a former security guard in a Swiss bank, faced persecution and death threats after discovering Holocaust-era bank records. He and his family fled to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program. A private bill was enacted to make him eligible for Nazi reparations, as he was initially deemed ineligible due to not being a U.S. national at the time of persecution. The private law enacted on 11/21/1997 benefited John Andre Chalot, who was deemed ineligible for Nazi reparations due to technical reasons. Chalot emigrated from France to the U.S. as a child, served in the military, and was a prisoner of war at Buchenwald. Despite becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen after the war, his reparations claim was rejected until the private law deemed him eligible. The private law enacted on 11/10/1998 granted relief to Heraclio Tolley, retroactively making him a naturalized U.S. citizen. Heraclio and his brother were orphaned at a young age and brought to the U.S. by their uncle for better care. The Tolleys took full responsibility for Heraclio and his brother after their uncle's death. They started guardianship proceedings before adoption, causing a delay in the adoption process until after Heraclio's 16th birthday. This led to the need for a private law to grant Heraclio U.S. citizenship retroactively. Private Law No. 105-6 H.R. 379 Title: Private Bill; For the relief of Larry Errol Pieterse. Sponsor: Rep. Linder, John [R-GA-11] (introduced 1/7/1997) Enacted 11/10/1998. Waiver of Deportation\u2014Victim of Being Framed for a Drug Conviction and Sole Financial Support for a U.S. Citizen Spouse with a Chronic Illness. Subsequent changes in immigration laws rendered him deportable, leading to the need for a private bill as the only avenue for relief. The Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims consulted with various sources and found that Mr. Pieterse was innocent of the drug crime he was accused of. He was the sole provider for his sick U.S. citizen spouse and her children. The law allowed for waivers of deportation and inadmissibility, and the offense would not affect his eligibility for naturalization. Private Law No. 105-7 H.R. 1794 Title: Private Bill; For the relief of Mai Hoa \"Jasmine\" Salehi. Sponsor: Rep. Sherman, Brad [D-CA-24] (introduced 6/4/1997) Cosponsors: (none) Committees: House Judiciary H.Rept. 105-689 Latest Major Action: Enacted 11/10/1998. Death of the U.S. Citizen Spouse During Pendency of Conditional Permanent Resident Petition. The beneficiary and her husband filed a petition for her adjustment to conditional permanent resident status, but due to a backlog, her interview was delayed. Unfortunately, her husband was killed during a robbery, making her ineligible for waivers she would have qualified for if her petition had been approved earlier. Private Law No. 105-7 H.R. 1794 Title: Private Bill; For the relief of Mai Hoa \"Jasmine\" Salehi. The House Report noted that Mrs. Salehi's marriage was legitimate, and she would have qualified for a waiver of the two-year marriage requirement if her petition had been approved before her husband's untimely death. Due to a backlog in petition approvals, she was not eligible for the waiver. Private Bill H.R. 1834, sponsored by Rep. Bateman, aimed to provide relief to Mercedes Del Carmen Quiroz Martinez Cruz due to the death of her U.S. citizen spouse during the processing of her conditional permanent resident petition. Despite having evidence of the petition, her petition as the widow of a U.S. citizen was denied. The widow of a U.S. citizen had her petition denied due to the agency losing her husband's original petition. Private Law No. 105-9 H.R. 1949 provided relief for Nuratu Olarewaju Abeke Kadiri, allowing her to adjust her status as an immediate relative. The beneficiary, brought to the US as a minor, never completed adjustment to permanent resident status despite being granted temporary resident status under amnesty. The father failed to complete the process, leading to the beneficiary's petition for permanent status being denied as untimely filed. The beneficiary, brought to the US as a minor, never completed adjustment to permanent resident status despite being granted temporary resident status under amnesty. Her only known family resided in the United States where she had lived since childhood. Private Law No. 105-10 H.R. 2744 was enacted for the relief of Chong Ho Kwak, who was approved for naturalization but became incapacitated after being shot in a robbery. The immigration law prohibited naturalization for those unable to understand the oath. A private bill was enacted in 1999 to waive the oath requirement for individuals with disabilities. The beneficiary's petition for permanent resident status was not approved before her spouse's death. Despite not being able to undergo chest x-rays due to pregnancy, she was found not to have tuberculosis after her husband's death. A private law was necessary for her to be granted permanent resident status as immigration regulations only allow approval of a widow's self-petition under certain conditions. The private law, Private Law No. 106-4 S. 452, granted Belinda McGregor and her child permanent resident status under the FY2000 diversity visa program due to errors by the I.N.S. regarding her eligibility for a diversity visa. Belinda McGregor was granted permanent resident status under the FY2000 diversity visa program due to errors by the I.N.S. A private law was necessary as the I.N.S. could not correct the mistake. The beneficiary's mother had been working in the U.S. and left the beneficiary with friends while she returned to Jamaica for an immigrant visa interview, which was denied. The friends were authorized to proceed with the adoption of the beneficiary. The natural mother of the beneficiary passed away during the adoption process, requiring a private bill for the beneficiary to gain permanent residence as the adoption was not completed before her 17th birthday. Precedent dictates that an adoption must be initiated before the child turns 16 for favorable consideration in immigration cases. The Christians were actively pursuing the adoption before the beneficiary's 16th birthday. Private Law No. 106-8 H.R. 3646 Title: Private Bill; For the relief of certain Persian Gulf evacuees. This law provided for the adjustment to LPR status for individuals evacuated from Kuwait during the Persian Gulf War due to their ties to U.S. citizens. A total of 2,227 persons, mostly Palestinian, were evacuated and later granted deferred enforced departure. Many adjusted status through employer-sponsored visas. Private Law No. 106-10 H.R. 848 provided permanent resident status for remaining evacuees from Kuwait who were unable to adjust status through employer-sponsored visas. Kuwait refused to accept deportees, most of whom were long-time residents but not Kuwaiti nationals. The legislation aimed to resolve the situation by granting permanent resident status to those unable to adjust status. Private Law No. 106-11 H.R. 3184 granted permanent residence to two young adult beneficiaries brought to the U.S. as children by their mother, fleeing Iran after the father's execution. The brothers, raised in the U.S. with no ties to their native country, had their asylum claims denied. Their mother passed away, and the relief was based on their tragic circumstances and law-abiding, employed college student status. Private Law No. 106-11 H.R. 3184 granted permanent residence to two young adult beneficiaries brought to the U.S. as children by their mother, fleeing Iran after the father's execution. The brothers, raised in the U.S. with no ties to their native country, had their asylum claims denied. Their mother passed away, and the relief was based on their tragic circumstances and law-abiding, employed college student status. This private law granted permanent residence to Zohreh Farhang Ghahfarokhi, a former wife of a lawful permanent resident, to prevent extreme hardship to her two daughters, one of whom was a U.S. citizen aged 11 years at the time of the law's enactment. Private Law No. 106-12 H.R. 3414 granted relief to Luis A. Leon-Molina, Ligia Padron, and their family, allowing them to remain lawfully in the U.S. The law corrected an error by the I.N.S. by deeming the family selected for diversity visas under the FY2001 program. The family from Ecuador was denied asylum but the head was selected for a diversity visa under FY1996. Their visa processing was interrupted by a government shutdown, leading to their file being misplaced. Private Law No. 106-13 granted relief to Saeed Rezai for his spouse's serious illness, providing LPR status. The I.N.S. denied a petition for adjustment of status for a beneficiary due to marriage fraud concerns with his first marriage. However, they acknowledged the validity of his second marriage to Ms. Rezai, who has multiple sclerosis. A private immigration bill was passed to provide relief to Wei Jingsheng, sponsored by Sen. Abraham. Sen. Abraham sponsored a private immigration bill to provide relief to a pro-democracy activist from China who served 18 years in prison for his political activities. The bill granted LPR status to the activist, who was seeking medical treatment in the US after being released. Private Law No. 106-16 provided LPR status for a Russian woman and her son with cerebral palsy, allowing them to stay in the US for ongoing medical treatment not available in Russia. They faced deportation after their visitor visas expired, but had no other options for staying in the US permanently. Private Law No. 106-16 granted LPR status to three siblings from El Salvador after their mother's death, allowing them to join their mother in the US. After their mother's death, three siblings from El Salvador were granted LPR status under Private Law No. 106-16. The younger siblings became wards of the court and applied for special immigrant juvenile visas. Sergio Lozano, who turned 18 shortly after arriving in the US, sought relief through Private Law No. 106-18 to avoid separation from his siblings and gain lawful status. The beneficiary, brought to the US illegally by her abusive ex-husband, sought LPR status under private law to dispute custody of her children. Unable to challenge the divorce and custody in Iran, she returned to the US on a fianc\u00e9e visa but lost visitation rights when her fianc\u00e9 learned of her intentions. This law allowed her to remain in the US and potentially regain custody of her children. The Private Law No. 106-19 S. 1078 was enacted to provide relief to Mrs. Elizabeth Eka Bassey, allowing her to dispute custody and reunite with her children in the United States. The law was sponsored by Sen. Helms and addressed the death of the primary visa recipient, Paul Bassey, a Nigerian national and State Department employee. In 1992, Mr. Bassey passed away before he and his family could emigrate to the United States. His family was not eligible for special immigrant status on their own but were able to adjust to LPR status through Private Law No. 106-20 S. 1513. Private Law No. 106-962, sponsored by Sen. Thompson, granted LPR status to a mother and her children due to extreme hardship, including a child with a rare bone cancer who received treatment at St. Jude's Children's Hospital in the U.S. Tragedy struck when the father and one child died in a car accident, leaving the mother paralyzed from the waist down. Private Law No. 106-21 S. 2000 provided permanent resident status for a young adult orphaned child born abroad to a U.S. citizen mother and a father, enabling them to stay in the United States due to extreme hardship caused by disability and ongoing cancer treatment. Private Law No. 106-22 S. 2002 granted relief to Tony Lara, a young adult orphaned child born abroad to a U.S. citizen mother and raised in the U.S. by his grandmother. He needed LPR status to enlist in the military and reside permanently in the U.S. The legislation was necessary as he was not considered a U.S. citizen-at-birth through his mother. Private Law No. 106-22 S. 2002 granted relief to Tony Lara, a young adult orphaned child born abroad to a U.S. citizen mother and raised in the U.S. by his grandmother. He needed LPR status to enlist in the military and reside permanently in the U.S. The legislation was necessary as he was not considered a U.S. citizen-at-birth through his mother. Judiciary; House Judiciary H.Rept. 106-964 Enacted 11/22/2000. Permanent Residency for a Young Adult Who Had Been Abandoned as a Minor. This private law provided LPR status for a beneficiary brought to the U.S. from El Salvador illegally by his parents as a young child. The beneficiary had no ties with El Salvador and was incorrectly advised that he would be deported if he applied for permanent residency earlier. Private Law No. 106-23 S. 2019 granted relief to Malia Miller, a special juvenile immigrant with no ties to El Salvador, who was supported by his wrestling coach and spouse. The beneficiary needed this private law to lawfully remain permanently in the United States. The bill was enacted on 11/22/2000. The beneficiary, who had entered the US on a visitor visa and given birth to a son, was granted humanitarian parole to attend her husband's funeral. A private law was needed to allow her to be approved for permanent resident status due to the two-year marriage requirement. The House Report highlighted the hardship on the US citizen child if he had to leave the country. Private Law No. 106-24 S. 2289 Title: Private Bill; Relief of Jose Guadalupe Tellez Pinales. Sponsor: Sen. Grassley, Chuck [R-IA] (introduced 3/23/2000). Permanent Residency for a Young Adult Brought to the United States Illegally as a Child. Raised by his great uncle in the US, believed to be his parents. Uncle thought beneficiary derived citizenship through his naturalization. The beneficiary, Jose, faced challenges due to lack of formal adoption before turning 16, preventing him from obtaining legal status. He has resided in the U.S. since age three, does not speak Spanish, and wishes to join the U.S. Marine Corps. A private bill was introduced for his relief in Congress. Relief was granted to Rita Mirembe Revell through a private bill due to her terminal illness preventing her from being adopted earlier by Mr. Dennis Revell and Ms. Maureen Reagan. Uganda's adoption restrictions and Ms. Reagan's health issues made it impossible for Rita to be adopted under the laws of Uganda and U.S. immigration law. Rita Mirembe Revell was granted relief through a private bill due to Uganda's adoption restrictions and Ms. Reagan's health issues, which prevented her from being adopted earlier by Mr. Dennis Revell and Ms. Maureen Reagan. The bill was enacted on 11/5/2002. The beneficiary, Mrs. Goveas Foti, was married to a U.S. citizen, Seth Foti, who died in an airplane crash while on official duty. Regulations allow a waiver of the marriage requirement if the petition for permanent residence was approved before the spouse's death. Unfortunately, Mrs. Foti's petition was not approved before Mr. Foti's death, making her ineligible for the waiver. The waiver is typically granted for humanitarian reasons in cases where the petition for conditional permanent residence has been approved. The House Report highlighted that Mrs. Foti's marriage was legitimate, and it was not her fault that she did not meet the marriage requirements of the I.N.A. This case is similar to other private laws enacted in recent years. Private Law No. 108-1 S. 103 and Private Law No. 108-3 H.R. 712 both address the issue of adoption and immigration, requiring adoptions to be initiated before the child turns 16 to be considered legitimate for immigration purposes. Private Law No. 108-4 H.R. 867, enacted on 10/30/2004, addresses the adjustment of status for an orphan adoptee who was adopted abroad before turning 16 but never completed immigration requirements. The beneficiary, unaware of the need for an immigrant visa, later discovered he was not a citizen. On September 15, 2001, Mr. Hassan was killed by an unstable man, rendering his family's adjustment petition invalid. His wife and four daughters in New Jersey faced potential removal from the US. A private bill was introduced to grant them resident status due to Mr. Hassan's death being linked to the events of September 11th. A private bill was enacted to provide relief to Tanya Andrea Goudeau, allowing her adoption to be considered legitimate for immigration purposes despite aging out of eligibility for an adopted orphan visa. The 109th Congress enacted a provision in a public law to allow award-winning athletes Tanith Belbin and Maxim Zavozin to naturalize for international competition in the 2006 Winter Olympics. The 109th Congress enacted a provision in a public law to allow award-winning athletes Tanith Belbin and Maxim Zavozin to naturalize for international competition in the 2006 Winter Olympics. Athletes representing a country must be citizens of that country by the deadline. The relief provision reduced the naturalization period from five to three years for athletes of extraordinary ability who paid a $1,000 fee. The relief provision in a public law allowed athletes Tanith Belbin and Maxim Zavozin to naturalize for international competition in the 2006 Winter Olympics. The naturalization process was completed on December 30 and 31, 2005, respectively. Private immigration bills were not favored during the 109th Congress, with none being enacted."
