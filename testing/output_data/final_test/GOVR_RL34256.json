    "content": "In the early 1980s, U.S. satellites tracked North Korea's growing indigenous nuclear program, which began in the late 1950s with cooperation agreements with the Soviet Union. North Korea built a small nuclear reactor at Yongbyon capable of producing plutonium, and later expanded with two larger reactors. Despite joining the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1985, safeguards inspections did not begin until 1992, raising concerns about North Korea's plutonium production. In 1994, North Korea pledged to freeze its plutonium programs under the Agreed Framework with the United States. Western intelligence estimated they had enough plutonium for one or two bombs. North Korea complied with the agreement, allowing IAEA inspections. However, in 2002, evidence of a clandestine uranium enrichment program led to the breakdown of the agreement. The breakdown of the Agreed Framework led to a conflict between North Korea and the Bush Administration. North Korea restarted its nuclear facilities, leading to negotiations in the Six-Party Talks. Despite efforts to achieve denuclearization, negotiations broke down, and North Korea tested a nuclear device in 2006. North Korea tested a nuclear device in October 2006 and reached an agreement in February 2007 with other members of the Six-Party Talks to implement denuclearization. Phase 1 involved shutting down plutonium production at Yongbyon in exchange for fuel oil. Phase 2 included disabling facilities at Yongbyon and declaring nuclear activities in exchange for fuel oil delivery and removal of certain designations. The United States provided funding for disablement activities until April 2009. In Phase 2 of the agreement, North Korea submitted a declaration of its past plutonium production activities in June 2008. President Bush removed North Korea from the TWEA list and intended to lift the SST designation after North Korea agreed to verification provisions. However, North Korea did not accept initial U.S. verification proposals and threatened to restart reprocessing plutonium in September 2008. A verbal agreement on verification was announced in October 2008, but North Korea disputed sampling at nuclear sites. The Six Parties failed to reach agreement on verification measures in December 2008. Disablement activities at Yongbyon continued until April 2009. North Korea expelled international monitors in April 2009 and announced plans to restart its reprocessing plant, boasting progress in uranium enrichment technology. The Denuclearization Action Plan focused on shutting down plutonium production facilities at Yongbyon but did not address uranium enrichment or warhead dismantlement. Transparency and careful verification were needed for future actions regarding North Korea's nuclear program. North Korea's weapons capability requires transparency and careful verification for complete disarmament. Bilateral talks have been held with the United States since the last Six Party Talks in 2009. North Korea acknowledged a uranium enrichment program in 2009 for nuclear power production. In 2010, North Korea displayed a light-water reactor and uranium enrichment plant at Yongbyon. The enrichment plant's operational status remains unconfirmed, with suspicions of other clandestine facilities. A 2012 announcement committed North Korea to moratoria on nuclear and missile testing and uranium enrichment suspension. North Korea's weapons capability requires transparency and careful verification for complete disarmament. In 2012, North Korea committed to moratoria on nuclear and missile testing, as well as uranium enrichment suspension at Yongbyon under IAEA monitoring. However, violations of these agreements in 2012 led to a collapse of diplomatic efforts. North Korea rejected future denuclearization talks, stating it would only denuclearize when all other nuclear weapons states did so. Acquiring fissile material remains a key hurdle in North Korea's nuclear weapons development. North Korea has the capability to produce fissile materials like plutonium (Pu-239) and highly enriched uranium (HEU) for nuclear weapons. It has the necessary infrastructure for uranium enrichment and plutonium production, including a uranium enrichment facility at Yongbyon. The country used magnox fuel in its earlier nuclear reactor to produce plutonium. Acquiring fissile material is a significant challenge in North Korea's nuclear weapons development. North Korea has the capability to produce plutonium (Pu-239) and highly enriched uranium (HEU) for nuclear weapons. Spent fuel must cool after removal from the reactor before reprocessing to separate plutonium from waste products and uranium. The PUREX separation process is used, involving dissolving the fuel in nitric acid and separating components using organic solvents. Large quantities require significant shielding to prevent radiation exposure. North Korea operated a 5 MWe nuclear reactor and is believed to have separated Pu from spent fuel. North Korea's 5 MWe nuclear reactor is believed to have separated plutonium from spent fuel and taken steps towards weaponization. In 2004, officials showed alloyed \"scrap\" to a US delegation, indicating a level of sophistication in handling plutonium necessary for weapons production. Secretary of State Colin Powell stated in 2002 that North Korea likely had nuclear weapons. In 2005, North Korea officially announced it had manufactured nukes for self-defense. North Korea has manufactured nukes for self-defense, with estimates suggesting they have enough plutonium for approximately five to eight nuclear weapons. The amount of fissile material used in each weapon depends on design sophistication, with North Korea possessing between 30 kg and 50 kg of separated plutonium. North Korea has enough plutonium for approximately five to eight nuclear weapons, with estimates suggesting they could possess up to 50 kg of weapons-grade plutonium. Questions remain about the amount of plutonium produced between 2003 and 2007 when international monitoring was interrupted. North Korea's total stockpile of weapons-grade plutonium was estimated to be 50 kg, with a discrepancy in reported amounts during the Six-Party Talks. An American scholar mentioned that 30.8 kg of plutonium had been potentially weaponized, but North Korea refused inspections on warheads. The Institute for Science and International Security outlined three scenarios for North Korea's fissile material production for nuclear weapons. The North Korean nuclear weapons program involved plutonium production at the Yongbyon reactor, with an estimated 10 kg produced before 1994. Production was frozen between 1994 and 2003 under the Agreed Framework, but restarted after the agreement was abandoned. Activity at the 5 MWe reactor was confirmed in 2003 through satellite photography. In January 2004, North Korean officials confirmed the 5 MWe reactor was operating smoothly at 100% power. Commercial satellite imagery in March also showed activity. The reprocessing facility was reported to be in good condition, with an annual throughput of 110 tons of spent fuel. North Korean officials claimed to have reprocessed all 8,000 fuel rods from the reactor between January and June 2003. In June 2003, reprocessing 8,000 fuel rods could have produced 25-30 kg of plutonium for 4-6 weapons. North Korea officials mentioned a continuous reprocessing campaign in 2004. The 5 MWe reactor was shut down in April 2005 to harvest fuel rods for weapons and resumed in June 2005. Estimates suggest the reactor held 10-15 kg of Pu in April 2005, with potential reprocessing completed by mid-2006. From August 2005 to 2006, the reactor could have produced an additional 6 kg of Pu, enough for 3 more weapons. The reactor was shut down again in July 2007. The 5 MWe reactor in North Korea was shut down in July 2007 and has not been restarted since its cooling tower was destroyed in June 2008. The IAEA was asked to remove its monitoring equipment in April 2009. By November 2009, North Korea announced that all 8,000 spent fuel rods had been reprocessed, producing enough plutonium for one nuclear warhead. Construction has not progressed on the 50 MWe reactor at Yongbyon or the 200 MWe Taechon reactor since 2002. North Korea's 50 MWe reactor at Yongbyon and 200 MWe Taechon reactor have not been completed since 2002. The CIA estimated these reactors could produce 275 kg of plutonium annually. Dr. Hecker suggested a tenfold increase in North Korea's plutonium production if the 50 MWe reactor was operational. North Korea agreed to halt work on these reactors during the Six-Party Talks. Governor Bill Richardson visited North Korea in December 2010. Bill Richardson visited North Korea on an unofficial visit where it was reported that North Korea was willing to negotiate the sale of 12,000 fresh fuel rods. These rods were manufactured for a reactor that was never built but could be used in another reactor if North Korea chose to restart it. In April 2013, North Korea announced plans to restart a reactor, estimated to take six months. In November 2010, North Korean officials showed a U.S. delegation an operating uranium enrichment plant at Yongbyon with 2,000 centrifuges. North Korea had 2,000 centrifuges in an enrichment facility capable of producing 8,000 kg SWU/year. The facility was initially claimed to be for power reactor fuel but later confirmed to also have the capability for weapons material production. North Korea was in the process of building a 100 MW-thermal experimental light-water reactor, matching the reported size of the enrichment plant for its fuel needs. The plant could potentially produce 40 kg of highly enriched uranium per year, which can be used for weapons. Dr. Hecker's visit to North Korea revealed a surprising uranium enrichment plant, indicating a second route to nuclear weapons using highly enriched uranium. Questions arise about North Korea's domestic manufacturing capability and its cooperation with Pakistan for equipment and materials. Analysts believe North Korea may have clandestine uranium enrichment facilities beyond Yongbyon, possibly with a pilot-scale centrifuge plant. Pakistani President Musharraf disclosed in his memoir about A.Q. Khan's involvement in nuclear proliferation. Qadeer Khan, a key figure in Pakistan's nuclear weapons program, transferred centrifuges and technology to North Korea. North Korea also imported high-strength aluminum tubes from Russia for a uranium enrichment program. There is debate on whether North Korea has the capability to manufacture specialized equipment for centrifuges or if it imported the components. North Korea may have built a centrifuge with a less sophisticated design and lower quality requirements. Former IAEA Safeguards Director estimated they were developing a 5,000 centrifuge enrichment capacity. North Korea initially denied having a highly enriched uranium program but later threatened to build a light-water reactor. After a U.N. Security Council Resolution condemning their nuclear test, North Korea announced they would commence uranium enrichment. North Korea has made progress in developing uranium enrichment technology for nuclear fuel, with plans to start experimental enrichment. They have successfully conducted experimental uranium enrichment and have a modern factory equipped with thousands of centrifuges operating to supply fuel for a light-water reactor. In 2001, North Korea began seeking centrifuge-related materials in large quantities. North Korea sought centrifuge-related materials in large quantities in 2001 to produce weapons-grade uranium for nuclear weapons. A 2002 CIA report estimated they were constructing a plant capable of producing enough uranium for two or more nuclear weapons per year. Questions have been raised about the accuracy of these estimates. Joseph DeTrani, former chief negotiator for the Six-Party Talks, confirmed with high confidence in 2002 that North Korea was acquiring materials for a uranium enrichment program. He stated that there is still confidence in the existence of the program at a mid-confidence level. North Korea's ongoing efforts to acquire uranium enrichment capability have been confirmed by various intelligence reports and assessments. The progress towards producing enriched uranium remains unknown, but there is high confidence that North Korea has pursued this capability for nuclear weapons. Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell confirmed this assessment in February 2008, noting a decrease in international procurement by North Korea. North Korea's uranium enrichment efforts have been ongoing, with a decrease in international procurement noted. Intelligence agencies find it easier to detect uranium enrichment-related imports than activities within North Korea. The progress in turning equipment into a working enrichment program is unknown, with challenges in scaling up from small-scale to large-scale production. Dr. Siegfried Hecker believes North Korea had a research and development uranium enrichment effort but likely not at an industrial scale. In 2007, North Korea provided the US with a sample of aluminum tubing to prove its intentions were not for weapons but for conventional weapons or dual-use projects. However, traces of enriched uranium were found on the tubing, raising doubts about North Korea's uranium enrichment program. In 2008, traces of highly-enriched uranium were also found on documents in North Korea's nuclear declaration, further casting doubt on the extent of their uranium enrichment program. In 2008, North Korea's nuclear declaration included a letter denying a highly enriched uranium program, but the IC had concerns about a covert uranium enrichment program. The Director of National Intelligence's 2011 assessment raised doubts about North Korea's quick development of a uranium enrichment facility without prior research or outside assistance. North Korea likely has been pursuing uranium enrichment for an extended period, with the possibility of other related facilities in its territory. The DNI's 2012 threat assessment confirmed long-standing intelligence on North Korea's uranium enrichment program. The issue has been central to denuclearization negotiations since 2002. In 2002, the Bush Administration accused North Korea of having a clandestine uranium enrichment program for nuclear weapons. U.S. negotiator James Kelly presented evidence to North Korean officials, who initially acknowledged the program but later denied it. North Korea claimed the uranium enrichment facility was for peaceful purposes, leading to negotiations on dismantlement and verification for denuclearization. North Korea's new enrichment facility and related offers were downplayed by U.S. officials, stating they are not sufficient for a return to talks. State Department Spokesman P. J. Crowley emphasized the need for North Korea to meet international obligations, reduce tensions, and take steps towards denuclearization for talks to resume. The offer to sell fresh fuel or invite international monitors to the uranium enrichment plant did not show a commitment to denuclearization as demanded by the U.S. and South Korea. Both governments aim to avoid being drawn into lengthy negotiations without progress from Pyongyang. North Korea's offers may have technical value, such as reducing plutonium production if the reactor is restarted and shedding light on their enrichment program. North Korea agreed to a moratorium on enrichment activities at Yongbyon and to allow international inspectors, but the agreements collapsed after a satellite launch attempt. North Korea's February agreements collapsed after a satellite launch attempt in April 2012. Analysts would look for indicators like device yield and fissile material type after a nuclear test. Uncertainties remain on whether North Korea would test a plutonium device, pair it with HEU, or have enough HEU for testing. International community's ability to discern material type in a nuclear test depends on what is vented and detected. North Korea conducted an underground nuclear test at the Punggye-ri site on February 12, 2013. The test yielded several kilotons, with estimates ranging from 6 to 7 kilotons. The seismic activity was similar to previous tests in 2006 and 2009. The U.S. Intelligence Community confirmed the test, while analysis of the event continues. The Korean Ministry of Defense estimated the test yield of North Korea's February 12, 2013, nuclear test to be between 6 and 7 kilotons. North Korea claimed the test was to develop a smaller and lighter warhead, potentially for long-range missiles. The UN Security Council was discussing additional sanctions in response to the test, and experts were waiting for evidence to determine the type of nuclear device used. Hecker and Pabian assessed that North Korea likely used plutonium in both the 2006 and 2009 tests. The DPRK conducted another underground nuclear test in May 2009, claiming it was on a new higher level in terms of explosive power and technology. Experts believe North Korea may test highly enriched uranium-based devices, potentially indicating a clandestine supply of uranium. Venting of the nuclear test site could reveal the type of material used. North Korea conducted an underground nuclear test in May 2009 with an estimated yield of two kilotons TNT equivalent, which was more successful than the 2006 test. The U.S. Intelligence Community assessed the test to have taken place near P'unggye. The 2009 North Korea nuclear test had a higher yield than the 2006 test, indicating the production of nuclear weapons. Open-source information on the device's design and nuclear material used is unavailable. No radioactive noble gases were detected, suggesting containment at the test site. The sub-kiloton yield suggests room for improvement in weapon design. North Korea expected a 4 kiloton yield but achieved only 2 kilotons. The 2006 North Korea nuclear test had a lower yield than expected, less than 1 KT. Radioactive debris confirmed a plutonium device was used, possibly an implosion design. Uncertainties remain about plutonium production and amount used, estimated around 6 kg. The low yield may have been intentional for a missile or to limit plutonium usage. In 2012, DNI Director Clapper referred to the 2006 North Korea nuclear test as a \"partial failure.\" Despite previous assessments of North Korea's capability to arm missiles with nuclear weapons, uncertainties remain. North Korea possesses short and medium-range missiles that could potentially be fitted with nuclear warheads. The Taepo-Dong-2 missile, tested unsuccessfully in July 2006, has the potential to reach the continental United States if operational. The Taepo-Dong-2 missile has the potential to deliver a nuclear-weapon-sized payload to the United States, but successful testing is needed for this capability. Previous launches in 2009 and 2012 were unsuccessful, but North Korea achieved its first successful satellite launch in December 2012. Further testing is necessary to develop a reliable missile. There are concerns that North Korea may have received nuclear weapon designs from A.Q. Khan. North Korea's goal in testing smaller nuclear devices may have been to learn about miniaturization of warheads for ballistic missiles. U.S. officials assess that Pyongyang's nuclear capabilities are more for deterrence and coercive diplomacy rather than war fighting. Pyongyang is unlikely to use nuclear weapons against US forces unless it perceives its regime to be on the verge of military defeat. North Korea expands its nuclear arsenal in response to perceived threats by the US, using nuclear weapons for leverage in diplomatic negotiations. Threatening rhetoric coincides with times of crisis or negotiations. Pyongyang strengthens war deterrent capabilities in response to US actions, seeking removal from the US terrorism list. Statements in 2009 suggest increasing military involvement in nuclear policy. North Korea's military plays a significant role in nuclear policy making, with a focus on increasing defense capabilities, including nuclear deterrent. The country declared itself a \"nuclear-armed state\" in 2012 and adopted a law in 2013 to consolidate its position as a nuclear weapons state. The official media stated that nuclear weapons serve the purpose of deterring aggression and attacking enemies until global denuclearization. The statement outlines North Korea's nuclear use policies, stating that their nuclear weapons can only be used in response to invasion or attack from a hostile nuclear state. It also emphasizes that North Korea will not use nukes against non-nuclear states unless they align with a hostile nuclear state. This policy was detailed following the 2006 nuclear test, which led to increased pressure from the international community. Council Resolution 1718 urges North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons in a verifiable and irreversible manner. In 2007, North Korea committed to disabling all nuclear facilities and providing a complete declaration of its nuclear programs. The Six-Party joint statement in October 2007 outlined the steps for disablement, with the United States leading the activities and providing initial funding. Disablement is a physical measure to prevent facility operation, with a 12-month restart timeframe. The agreement focused on disabling Yongbyon facilities related to North Korea's plutonium program. The disablement process of North Korea's plutonium program began in November 2007 and continued until April 2009. 8 out of 11 steps were completed, with periodic delays due to disputes over energy aid delivery and verification measures. The disablement process of North Korea's plutonium program began in November 2007 and continued until April 2009. Approximately 80% of the 8,000 spent fuel rods had been moved from the reactor to the cooling pond by early April 2009. Pyongyang claimed to have removed the remaining fuel rods and completed reprocessing all 8,000 spent fuel rods by August 2009. In 2009, North Korea had fresh fuel rods stored at Yongbyon, with discussions about disabling or removing them. North Korea mentioned the possibility of selling the fuel rods to South Korea if the US reaffirmed no hostile intent. The North Korean Foreign Ministry claimed to have restarted its reprocessing facility in April 2009, but this could not be independently verified. North Korea claimed to have reprocessed 8,000 spent fuel rods by August 2009 at the Yongbyon facility. The facility was temporarily halted in September 2008 for testing and equipment movement, but was later corrected by November 2008. Experts estimated that restarting the reprocessing plant could take six to eight weeks, with an additional three to four months needed to reprocess the spent fuel rods in storage. North Korea needs three to four months to reprocess spent fuel rods at Yongbyon, yielding 7-8 kg of plutonium, enough for a nuclear weapon. Disablement at the reprocessing facility is limited to the \"front-end\" for safe waste disposal. Restoring the 5-MWt reactor could take six months to a year, with rebuilding the cooling tower in six months. Additional parts or repairs may be needed for the aging reactor. The fuel fabrication facility must also be restored for fuel production. Former Director of the Los Alamos National Laboratories Siegfried Hecker stated that North Korea could restore operations at the 5 megawatt reactor and fuel fabrication facility in approximately six months without foreign equipment or materials. Once operational, they could produce approximately 6 kg of plutonium per year. Future growth in North Korea's arsenal would require larger reactors and progress in their uranium enrichment program. The Bush Administration expected a \"complete and correct\" declaration as part of the Six-Party negotiations. In fall 2007, officials expected North Korea to declare weapons-grade plutonium and uranium enrichment activities. However, the declaration in January 2008 was deemed incomplete by the U.S. Assistant Secretary Hill. North Korea proposed declaring 30 kg of plutonium, lower than U.S. estimates. The U.S. emphasized the need for a comprehensive declaration including materials, facilities, and programs. North Korea also agreed to address concerns about a uranium enrichment program. North Korea agreed to address concerns about a uranium enrichment program but denies having one. Other issues include nuclear proliferation activities and warhead information. The completeness of the declaration is more important than its timing. U.S. officials stated that removal from sanctions lists would only occur after a complete declaration was submitted. In April 2008, the U.S. and North Korea agreed that plutonium production activities would be included in a formal declaration, while enrichment and proliferation issues would be addressed separately in a secret side agreement. In a secret side agreement, North Korea would acknowledge U.S. concerns over proliferation to Syria without confirming or denying them. The agreement also included a pledge to refrain from future nuclear proliferation. Administration officials prioritized ending plutonium production and verifying the plutonium stockpile. Concerns were raised about verifying North Korea's declaration before removing them from the State Sponsors of Terrorism List. North Korean officials provided 19,000 pages of documentation on their nuclear program in May 2008. North Korea provided 19,000 pages of documentation on its nuclear program, including records for the reactor and fuel reprocessing plant at Yongbyon dating back to 1986. Traces of highly-enriched uranium were found on the documents, casting doubt on North Korea's uranium enrichment program. North Korea submitted a declaration of its nuclear programs to China in 2008, addressing its plutonium program and concerns about uranium enrichment and nuclear proliferation. North Korea acknowledged U.S. concerns about uranium enrichment and nuclear proliferation activities, submitting a list of nuclear sites and declaring 37 kg of plutonium. President Bush announced the removal of North Korea's designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism and the end of the Trading with the Enemy Act. The U.S. assisted North Korea in destroying the cooling tower at the Yongbyon reactor. Subsequent verification by IAEA inspectors took place in July 2007. Inspectors verified the shutdown of nuclear facilities at the Yongbyon complex in North Korea from July 2007 to mid-April 2009. The IAEA monitored the halt in construction of nuclear power plants and received contributions from the U.S. and Japan. Future investigations may include North Korea's past nuclear program. The IAEA's role in North Korea's nuclear program was limited to monitoring the shutdown of Yongbyon facilities. Recommendations were made for the IAEA to have an observer role during disablement steps and continued monitoring. The United States and North Korea agreed on a consultative and support role for the IAEA in future verification. Information on North Korea's nuclear weapons production relied on remote monitoring and defector information after IAEA inspectors were expelled in 2002. Satellite images provided some insights but were limited in confirming certain activities. In late January 2003, trucks were detected at Yongbyon, but movement of spent fuel to the reprocessing plant could not be confirmed. Activity at the reprocessing plant was reportedly seen in April 2003, but large-scale reprocessing could not be confirmed. North Korean officials claimed continuous reprocessing in 2004. Efforts to detect Krypton-85 suggested some reprocessing, but were inconclusive. Verification measures sought to address uncertainties, receiving increased attention in the Six-Party process from spring 2008. Verification received increased attention in the Six-Party process in spring 2008, with the U.S. Administration linking SST removal to progress on verification issues. U.S. officials stated that North Korea's declaration must be verifiable for it to be considered \"complete and correct.\" The State Department noted on June 26 that North Korea had started fulfilling its declaration commitment, outlining a comprehensive verification regime including access to sites, materials, sampling, interviews, and documentation related to the North Korean nuclear program. The Six Parties agreed on principles for a verification mechanism for denuclearization in North Korea. The U.S. submitted a detailed verification protocol called the \"Verification Measures Discussion Paper\" to verify all aspects of North Korea's nuclear programs. Verification is crucial for the removal of North Korea's designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism. North Korea objected to provisions related to inspections and sampling in the verification process. They suspended disablement activities at Yongbyon due to not being removed from the terrorism list. Verification measures were to be agreed upon before delisting North Korea. North Korea objected to inspection provisions and suspended disablement activities at Yongbyon. They asked IAEA personnel to remove seals and surveillance equipment from the plutonium reprocessing plant, limiting access to the facility. Monitoring and inspection activities continued, but North Korea planned to introduce nuclear material to the reprocessing plant. North Korea planned to introduce nuclear material to the reprocessing plant, but actions were reversed after the United States and North Korea agreed on a verification mechanism. Ambassador Hill traveled to Pyongyang for bilateral talks on the verification agreement, resulting in agreement on verification measures including sample-taking, site visits, and involvement of South Korea, Japan, and the IAEA. The Verification Protocol will apply to North Korea's plutonium-based program and uranium enrichment activities. The measures are codified in a joint document between the United States and North Korea. The United States removed North Korea from the State Sponsors of Terrorism List on October 11, emphasizing strong verification measures. If North Korea refuses verification, energy assistance may be suspended, sanctions re-imposed, and new restrictions considered. The United States is focused on eliminating North Korea's nuclear weapons programs, including uranium enrichment and nuclear technology proliferation. Concerns arose about the verification agreement details and North Korea's compliance. The Six Parties failed to agree on verification measures due to North Korea's rejection of sampling provisions. Verification and monitoring activities in North Korea ceased when Pyongyang refused inclusion of sampling provisions. North Korea ended monitoring activities in 2009 and expressed willingness to allow IAEA inspectors in 2010 to verify uranium enrichment for peaceful purposes. DPRK committed to abandoning nuclear weapons in 2005 but unresolved issues remain, including decommissioning weapons production facilities. Terms for this work still need negotiation. The negotiation stage for dismantling North Korea's nuclear weapons includes IAEA monitoring of nuclear material stocks and verification of weapons dismantlement. Critics are concerned about the lack of clear verification provisions and key issues like fissile materials and nuclear proliferation activities. Some suggest implementing cooperative threat reduction programs similar to those used in the former Soviet Union. North Korean officials aim to redirect Yongbyon workforce to peaceful nuclear energy use, including research and medical applications. An agreement in 2012 prioritized moratoria on key weapons activities like nuclear testing and uranium enrichment. Future talks may consider similar measures and permanent solutions, such as verifying uranium enrichment facilities and dismantling weapons material production sites. North Korea's reluctance to agree to transparency measures has hindered efforts towards denuclearization. Previous agreements in 2012 collapsed after North Korea violated missile moratorium. Efforts to dismantle North Korea's nuclear weapons program under the Six-Party Talks have been stalled since 2009. In February 2012, North Korea committed to moratoriums on long-range missile testing, nuclear testing, and enrichment activities at Yongbyon. The United States and North Korea discussed a nuclear testing moratorium, enrichment activities at Yongbyon, and the return of IAEA inspectors. Talks will continue to finalize details on nutritional assistance. The DPRK mentioned lifting sanctions and providing light water reactors as priorities once the Six-Party Talks resume. These issues were not included in the U.S. statement, indicating potential areas of disagreement. The U.S. and North Korea had disagreements over sanctions, denuclearization, and access for IAEA inspectors. Talks since 2011 culminated in an agreement in February 29, but uncertainties remained about Kim Jong-Un's willingness to agree to terms. Key unresolved issues included access for IAEA inspectors at Yongbyon and monitoring of food aid. Some analysts believe halting missile and nuclear testing in North Korea is crucial to prevent progress in developing long-range warheads. However, concerns persist about weaponization activities and clandestine uranium enrichment facilities. North Korea's proliferation of missile and nuclear technology is driven by various motivations, including financial gain and provocation. Blair testified in 2009 that North Korea has sold ballistic missiles and materials to Middle Eastern countries, assisted Syria with a nuclear reactor, and is less likely to sell nuclear weapons due to the risk of a military confrontation with the US. The Security Council deliberations focused on interdicting North Korean shipments of missile and WMD-related technologies to prevent proliferation. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1874 calls for inspecting all cargo to and from North Korea for compliance with international law. The Security Council Resolution 1874 prohibits arms transfers from and to North Korea, except for small arms and light weapons. It also calls for inspecting suspect vessels on the high seas with the consent of the flag state and bans bunkering services for such shipments. The resolution includes strict provisions on financial services and transfer of funds to prevent proliferation-related transfers. The Security Council Resolution 1874 prohibits arms transfers to North Korea, except for small arms and light weapons. The Proliferation Security Initiative aims to coordinate international efforts to interdict proscribed WMD and missile-related goods, but China does not participate. Questions remain about China's commitment to interdiction measures and sharing sensitive information, especially regarding Chinese firms implicated in past cases. Emphasis on airspace interdictions is lacking, which could be crucial for intercepting North Korean shipments passing over Chinese airspace. Concerns persist about the true commitment of China and others to prevent WMD and missile-related transfers to and from North Korea. The U.S. funded nuclear disablement activities at Yongbyon through the State Department's Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund (NDF), paying for labor costs, equipment, and fuel. Approximately $20 million was approved for this purpose, with DOE's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) providing technical advisors. The NNSA has been providing technical advisors and teams at Yongbyon overseeing disablement measures, estimating spending around $15 million for Phase Two implementation. Congress has funded energy assistance to North Korea under the Six-Party Talks and plays a role in establishing legal authority for nuclear disablement and dismantlement. Assistance to North Korea is restricted by the Glenn Amendment, requiring a waiver for DOE funds to be spent there. Congress passed language in the FY2008 Supplemental Appropriations Act allowing the President to waive this restriction. The FY2008 Supplemental Appropriations Act (P.L. 110-252) allowed the President to waive the Glenn Amendment restrictions for funds to eliminate North Korea's WMD and missile programs. The waiver would cost over $360 million in FY2009 for verification and disposal activities at Yongbyon. However, a nuclear test by North Korea in May 2009 nullified the waiver authority under the law. The FY2008 Supplemental Appropriations Act allowed the President to waive the Glenn Amendment restrictions for funds to eliminate North Korea's WMD and missile programs. Congress provided funding discretion to DOE's NNSA for activities in North Korea, but did not fund Administration requests in subsequent years due to North Korean withdrawal from talks. The State Department's NDF received funding for potential denuclearization assistance. In the case of a breakthrough in talks, Department of Defense funds must be specifically appropriated for use in North Korea. Authorization was given for CTR funds to be used globally, with potential new initiatives for denuclearization in North Korea. Senator Richard Lugar proposed granting the CTR program \"notwithstanding authority\" for this work. The Defense Department's expertise and resources could make it well-positioned to conduct threat reduction work in North Korea and elsewhere. Congress may influence negotiations with North Korea through legislation, such as the North Korean Counter-Terrorism and Non-Proliferation Act. Congress could play a significant role in monitoring human rights issues, funding denuclearization steps, setting sanctions policies, and establishing normalized ties with North Korea. This includes passing bills like the Security through Termination of Proliferation Act of 2009 (H.R. 485) and House Resolution 1735, which called for the cessation of uranium enrichment activities and dismantling of nuclear facilities under international verification. The United Nations Security Council has passed resolutions condemning North Korea's missile and nuclear tests, imposing strict sanctions on the regime. These sanctions ban trade in military goods, WMD-related technologies, and financial support for prohibited weapons programs. The UN Security Council has imposed strict sanctions on North Korea to prohibit weapons programs, with exceptions for humanitarian aid. Implementation issues arise, especially concerning Chinese companies trading dual-use goods. Monitoring is done by a UN sanctions committee and Panel of Experts."
