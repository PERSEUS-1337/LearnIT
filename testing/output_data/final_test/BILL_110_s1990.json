    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Build, Update, Improve, Lift, and Design Health Centers Act of 2007\" or the \"BUILD Act\". Congress finds that lack of access to basic health services is a significant issue in the United States, with millions of Americans lacking access to primary care providers and health insurance. Health centers play a crucial role in addressing this problem by providing essential healthcare services in underserved communities. Health centers in the United States serve 16 million Americans annually, including minorities, farmworkers, and homeless individuals. Studies show they offer high-quality, cost-effective care at an average cost of $1.25 per day. Expanding access to health centers is a proposed solution to the country's healthcare access issue, with many centers needing renovation. Health centers in the United States, serving 16 million Americans annually, are often located in old buildings. A survey found that 2/3 of health centers in 11 States need facility improvements, with an estimated $2.2 billion in unmet capital needs nationwide. Building new facilities in communities lacking access is crucial, but many health centers struggle to fund these improvements despite raising some funds through donations. Health centers face challenges in raising capital due to limited donor support and low operating margins. Lenders are hesitant to provide loans without positive margins. While the Federal Government offers grants for operational expenses, there is no funding authority for capital needs like new facility construction. To support health centers in providing care to the underserved, the Federal Government should supplement local efforts to meet their capital needs for new facilities or building upgrades. SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT. This section adds a new provision for Health Care Facility Grants and Loan Guarantees under the Public Health Service Act. The term 'eligible health center' refers to health centers receiving grants or subgrants under specific sections of the Public Health Service Act. The Secretary is authorized to award grants for eligible health centers to cover facility costs, including modernization, expansion, replacement, and construction. The Federal share of a grant for expanding or constructing a health center facility cannot exceed 90% of the total project cost, unless the project cost is less than $750,000 or the Secretary waives the maximum. Additionally, facility loan guarantees are available. The Secretary may guarantee at least 90% of loans for health center capital projects, including acquiring, modernizing, or constructing facilities, purchasing equipment, and refinancing loans. The Secretary may guarantee loans for health center capital projects, including refinancing loans, without it being considered a Federal subsidy. The Secretary has the authority for the loan guarantee program and will require applicants to meet certain criteria for grants and loans. The Secretary may guarantee loans for health center capital projects, including refinancing loans, without it being considered a Federal subsidy. Applicants for grants and loans must comply with conditions set forth in section 1621 and give priority to contractors employing workers residing in the area to be served by the health center. The construction contract for health center projects must prioritize hiring residents of the area. Definitions include 'facilities' as buildings used by health centers and 'non-Federal lender' as entities authorized to make loans. The law allows various types of lenders to make loans for health center projects, with a report due in 3 years to evaluate the programs and make recommendations for improvement. The Secretary can use up to 5% of funds for expanding healthcare access in the US. Funds from previous years can be used for loan guarantees for medical facility projects owned by health centers. Authorization of appropriations is amended for this purpose. The authorization of appropriations is amended to include section 330R for expanding healthcare access in the US."
