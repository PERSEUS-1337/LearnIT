It took over some functions of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) after it was disbanded in the early 1950s due to political favoritism allegations. Congress passed the Small Business Act in 1953 (P.L. 83-163) to authorize the SBA's mission. The Small Business Administration (SBA) was established in 1953 to promote small businesses, enhance competition, and support the overall economy. The SBA administers various programs including loan guaranty, contracting, direct loans for disaster recovery, and small business management. The Small Business Administration (SBA) offers programs for small businesses, renters recovering from natural disasters, and business management training. Congressional interest in these programs has grown due to their role in stimulating economic activity and job creation. The SBA's FY2020 budget includes funding for entrepreneurial development programs and disaster recovery assistance. The Small Business Administration (SBA) offers various programs including disaster assistance, capital access programs, contracting programs, regional and district offices, the Office of Inspector General (OIG), and capital investment programs. The Small Business Administration (SBA) offers various programs including disaster assistance in the form of loans, not grants, with unique features. The SBA's estimated costs in FY2019 for different program areas are shown in Table 1. The SBA Disaster Loan Program provides loans directly to individuals, businesses, and nonprofit organizations in declared disaster areas. The program includes home disaster loans, business physical disaster loans, and economic injury disaster loans. The SBA disbursed $401 million in disaster loans in FY2016, $889 million in FY2017, and $3.59 billion in FY2018. The SBA Disaster Loan Program offers loans to individuals, businesses, and nonprofit organizations in declared disaster areas for recovery. Only those in declared disaster areas and contiguous counties are eligible to apply for disaster loans. Declarations recognize damage from floods, nature acts, riots, civil disorders, or industrial accidents. The program includes presidential major disaster declarations and SBA declarations, with two categories for home disaster loans: personal property loans and real property loans for uninsured losses. The SBA Disaster Loan Program offers loans for uninsured losses in declared disaster areas. Personal property loans provide up to $40,000 for repairing or replacing items like furniture and clothing. Interest rates vary based on credit availability, with a maximum rate of 8% for those unable to obtain credit elsewhere. SBA offers loans with interest rates capped at 8% per year for those who can obtain credit elsewhere, and 4% for those who cannot. Homeowners can apply for up to $200,000 to repair their primary residence. Loans cannot be used for upgrades unless required by building codes. Different types of loans are available for businesses and nonprofits in disaster-declared areas. The Small Business Administration (SBA) offers physical disaster loans to businesses and nonprofit organizations in disaster-declared areas. Loans can be up to $2 million for repairs and replacements to property, machinery, equipment, and more. Nonprofits may be eligible for grants from FEMA if rejected or approved for less than the requested amount. Interest rates are capped at 8% per year for those who can obtain credit elsewhere. Economic injury disaster loans (EIDLs) from the Small Business Administration (SBA) have an interest rate capped at 8% for those who can obtain credit elsewhere and 4% for those who cannot. These loans are available to small businesses in disaster-declared areas, with a maximum loan amount of $2 million. The loans are designed to provide operating funds until businesses recover, with a maturity of up to 30 years. Small farms and cooperatives are also eligible for these loans in designated agriculture production disasters. The Small Business Administration (SBA) relies on third parties to provide management and technical assistance training programs for small businesses. The SBA receives appropriations for various Entrepreneurial Development (ED) programs and initiatives, including Small Business Development Centers, Women Business Centers, SCORE, Veterans Programs, Native American Outreach Program, and Entrepreneurship Education Initiative. The Small Business Administration (SBA) receives appropriations for various Entrepreneurial Development (ED) programs, including Small Business Development Centers, Women Business Centers, SCORE, Veterans Programs, Native American Outreach Program, and Entrepreneurship Education Initiative. FY2019 appropriations for these programs range from $131 million for SBDCs to $3.5 million for the Entrepreneurship Education Initiative. Additional programs like the SBA's Growth Accelerators Initiative and 7(j) Technical Assistance Program are discussed separately in other sections of the report. The Small Business Administration (SBA) receives appropriations for various Entrepreneurial Development (ED) programs, including Small Business Development Centers, Women Business Centers, SCORE, Veterans Programs, Native American Outreach Program, and Entrepreneurship Education Initiative. FY2019 appropriations for these programs range from $131 million for SBDCs to $3.5 million for the Entrepreneurship Education Initiative. The SBA reports that over 1 million aspiring entrepreneurs and small business owners receive training from an SBA-supported resource partner each year, with some training offered for free or at low cost through programs customized to local conditions. SBDCs provide free or low-cost assistance in marketing, business strategy, finance, technology transfer, government contracting, management, and manufacturing. SBDCs are funded by grants from the SBA and matching funds. There are 63 lead SBDC service centers, one located in each state. The SBA's Microloan Technical Assistance program provides grants to Microloan intermediaries for management and technical training assistance. WBCs assist women entrepreneurs. WBCs, like SBDCs, focus on helping women entrepreneurs. There are 121 WBCs across the US, with SCORE being established in 1964 as a national volunteer organization with 320 chapters and over 800 branch offices. SCORE partners with 11,000 volunteer counselors to provide management and training assistance to small businesses. PRIME offers SBA grants to nonprofit organizations that support disadvantaged entrepreneurs. The SBA's Office of Veterans Business Development (OVBD) administers management and training programs for veteran-owned businesses, including 22 Veterans Business Outreach Centers. The SBA's Office of Native American Affairs provides educational assistance to Native Americans. The SBA provides assistance to Native Americans to start and expand small businesses through regional innovation clusters and the Entrepreneurial Development Initiative. This includes support for high-growth small businesses in underserved communities through programs like the Emerging Leaders initiative and the SBA Learning Center. The SBA's executive leader education series offers specialized training, technical support, and access to a professional network to strengthen businesses and promote economic development. Participants create a strategic growth action plan at the conclusion of the training. The Learning Center provides free online courses on various business topics, offering resources like toolkits, fact sheets, and audio content for entrepreneurship education. The SBA has authority to make direct loans, excluding disaster loans and loans to Microloan program intermediaries. The SBA has the authority to make direct loans but has not done so since 1998, primarily due to high subsidy rates. Instead, the SBA guarantees loans issued by approved lenders to encourage lending to small businesses. Businesses must meet the Small Business Act's definition of a small business to qualify for SBA assistance. A small business, according to the Small Business Act, is one that is independently owned, not dominant in its field nationally, and meets size standards set by the SBA. The SBA uses industry-specific size standards or a combination of net worth and net income to determine if a business is small. For example, businesses in the SBA's 7(a) loan program are considered small if they meet industry-specific size standards or have less than $15 million in net worth and $5 million in average net income. The SBA determines if a business is small based on industry-specific size standards or a combination of net worth and net income. The size standards consider factors like average annual receipts, number of employees, asset size, or a combination for refineries. The goal is to encourage competition within each industry. The SBA determines small business size based on economic factors like firm size, assets, competition, and industry trends. They offer loan guarantees through programs like 7(a), 504/CDC, international trade, and Microloan. Personal guarantees are required from borrowers. The SBA's Microloan program requires personal guarantees from borrowers and shares the risk of default with lenders. In case of default, the borrower owes the contracted amount less the value of any liquidated collateral. The SBA can recover unpaid debt through various methods. Some businesses are ineligible for loan guarantees, as listed in 13 C.F.R. Section 120.110. Fees are charged for most programs to offset costs, including those related to loan defaults. In most instances, fees for SBA 7(a) loans are set in statute. The SBA can charge lenders up to 2-3.5% for the guaranteed portion of loans, with additional fees for loans exceeding $1 million. Lenders can also collect fees from borrowers to cover administrative expenses. In FY2019, the SBA is waiving the annual fees to assist small business owners. In FY2019, the SBA is waiving the annual service fee for 7(a) loans of $150,000 or less made to small businesses in rural areas or HUBZones and reducing the upfront guaranty fee for these loans. The goal is to achieve a zero subsidy rate, eliminating the need for new loan guaranty appropriations. However, additional appropriations may still be necessary due to insufficient revenue from fees and loan liquidations. The SBA did not request funding for credit subsidies for the 7(a) and 504/CDC loan guaranty programs in FY2016-FY2019 due to improved performance in the loan portfolio. The 7(a) loan guaranty program, named after the Small Business Act, involves loans made by SBA lending partners and partially guaranteed by the SBA. In FY2018, the SBA approved 60,353 7(a) loans totaling nearly $25.4 billion, with a current guaranty rate of 85% for loans of $150,000 or less and 75% for larger loans. Lenders are incentivized to make loans with SBA guarantees, but it is not mandatory. The SBA allows lenders to charge fees and fixed or variable interest rates on 7(a) loans. Maximum interest rates for variable-rate loans are tied to prime rate, LIBOR, or SBA optional peg rate. The spread over these rates depends on loan amount and maturity. The SBA's 7(a) program offers various specialized programs for different borrower groups, including SBAExpress, Export Express, and Community Advantage. These programs provide streamlined loan procedures for loans of specific amounts, such as $350,000 or less. The Small Loan Advantage program, currently used for loans under $350,000, operates as a separate, specialized program within the 7(a) program. The SBAExpress program, established in 1995, offers a 50% loan guarantee on loans of $350,000 or less. It allows lenders to use existing procedures for quicker credit availability. Loan proceeds can be used for various purposes, with some restrictions on debt restructuring. Fees and terms are similar to the 7(a) program, with a maximum seven-year term for revolving credit. The Community Advantage pilot program, which started in 2011, is for mission-focused lenders serving underserved markets. It was initially set to end in 2014 but has been extended to operate until 2022. As of September 2018, there were 113 approved lenders, with a moratorium on new applications from October 2018 to mitigate future loan defaults. Lenders need SBA approval to participate in specialized 7(a) loan guaranty programs. The SBA provides support for Employee Stock Ownership Program trusts, pollution control facilities, and working capital through programs like the Community Adjustment and Investment Program (CAIP). CAIP uses federal funds to pay fees on loans for businesses affected by NAFTA. The SBA also guarantees loans for ESOPs and pollution control facilities. The SBA's loan programs include the 7(a) loan guaranty program for pollution control and CAPLines for short-term working capital. The 504/CDC loan guaranty program provides long-term fixed-rate loans for major assets through Certified Development Companies. Commercial lenders contribute up to 50% of the financing package. The 504/CDC loan guaranty program provides long-term fixed-rate loans for major assets through Certified Development Companies. Commercial lenders provide up to 50% of the financing package, secured by a senior lien, while the CDC's loan of up to 40% is secured by a junior lien. The SBA backs the CDC with a guaranteed debenture, and small businesses must contribute at least 10% as equity. Small businesses must meet certain criteria to participate in the program, such as not exceeding $15 million in tangible net worth and not having average net income of more than $5 million for two full fiscal years before the date of application. In FY2018, the SBA approved 5,874 504/CDC loans totaling nearly $4.8 billion. The SBA offers three loan programs for trade and export promotion: Export Express, Export Working Capital, and International Trade. These programs provide financing for firms looking to begin or expand exporting operations, with guaranties ranging from 75% to 90% on loans up to $5 million. The SBA offers trade and export promotion loan programs with similarities to other SBA loan guaranty programs. For example, the Export Express program is similar to the SBAExpress program but with expedited approval and lower loan amounts. The Export Express program also resembles the International Trade loan program with expedited approval and lower loan amounts. Additionally, the SBA administers grants through the State Trade Expansion Program (STEP) to assist small businesses with export programs. The STEP program provides assistance to small business concerns through trade show exhibitions, training workshops, and foreign trade missions. It was initially authorized for three years with annual appropriations of $30 million in FY2011 and FY2012. Funding has varied over the years, with $8 million in FY2014, $17.4 million in FY2015, and $18 million annually since FY2016. The Microloan program offers direct loans to nonprofit intermediary lenders who then provide microloans up to $50,000 to small businesses and nonprofit child care centers. Authorized in 1991, the program became permanent in 1997 under the Small Business Reauthorization Act. The Microloan program, authorized in 1991 and made permanent in 1997 under the Small Business Reauthorization Act, targets new and early stage businesses in underserved markets. In FY2018, 5,459 small businesses received Microloans totaling $76.8 million, with an average loan amount of $14,071 and an average interest rate of 7.6%. The program aims to assist borrowers with little to no credit history, low-income borrowers, and women and minority entrepreneurs in rural and urban areas who do not qualify for conventional loans. Additionally, several SBA programs help small businesses obtain and perform federal contracts and subcontracts. The 8(a) Program is a contracting program for socially and economically disadvantaged businesses, with specific criteria for ownership and net worth. It allows small businesses to compete for government contracts without facing larger competitors. The 8(a) Program allows socially and economically disadvantaged businesses to compete for government contracts. Eligible firms must have a net worth of less than $250,000 at the time of application and less than $750,000 thereafter. Certified firms can receive set-aside and sole-source contracts, technical assistance, and training. Participation is limited to nine years, and in FY2017, $27.2 billion was awarded to 8(a) firms, with $16.4 billion through 8(a) preferences. The Historically Underutilized Business Zone Program supports small businesses in HUBZones through set-asides, sole-source awards, and price preferences. To be certified, 35% of employees must reside in a HUBZone. In FY2017, $7.53 billion was awarded to HUBZone-certified small businesses, with $1.90 billion awarded with a HUBZone preference. In FY2017, the federal government awarded $18.2 billion to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, with $6.8 billion awarded through set-asides and $4.3 billion awarded in open competition. In FY2017, the federal government awarded $21.3 billion to women-owned small businesses, with $648.9 million awarded with a women-owned small business preference. Contracts may be set aside for economically disadvantaged women-owned small businesses in underrepresented industries, and sole-source contracts can be awarded if the value is below $4 million. In FY2017, the federal government awarded $21.3 billion to women-owned small businesses, with $648.9 million awarded through a women-owned small business preference. This included set-asides and sole-source awards for women-owned small businesses, as well as contracts awarded in open competition. Additionally, other small business preferences were also utilized, such as set-asides and sole-source awards for HUBZone firms, 8(a) firms, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. Agencies may also promote subcontracting with small disadvantaged businesses under certain conditions. SDBs, or socially or economically disadvantaged businesses, must meet eligibility requirements similar to 8(a) firms. Federal agencies must negotiate subcontracting plans with successful bidders to ensure SDBs have a fair chance at subcontracting opportunities. Federal agencies may award contracts or provide incentives for subcontracting with SDBs. The SBA's Dynamic Small Business Search database lists 2,338 SBA-certified SDBs and 122,281 self-certified SDBs. The 7(j) Management and Technical Assistance program offers counseling and training in various areas for eligible individuals and businesses, including 8(a) certified firms and businesses in disadvantaged areas. In FY2018, the SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee program assisted 6,483 small businesses owned by low-income individuals. The program guarantees bid, performance, and payment bonds for small businesses up to $6.5 million individually and up to $10 million with federal certification. The SBA guaranteed 10,800 bid and final surety bonds totaling nearly $6.5 billion in FY2018. A surety bond is an agreement between a surety, contractor, and project owner to ensure project completion. It reduces contracting risks and encourages project owners to work with small businesses. Federal agencies are required to set procurement goals for small businesses since 1978. The government sets procurement goals for small businesses to participate in federal contracts. Each agency must report its progress to the SBA annually. Congress established minimum participation goals for small businesses and those owned by disadvantaged individuals. The goals include a minimum of 20% of total prime contract awards for small businesses and 5% for disadvantaged individuals. Each agency must also set annual goals to maximize opportunities for small businesses. The SBA negotiates annual goals with federal agencies to maximize opportunities for small businesses and disadvantaged individuals in federal contracts. The agency must report progress to the President and Congress annually. The SBA negotiates annual goals with federal agencies to maximize opportunities for small businesses and disadvantaged individuals in federal contracts. Exclusions from federal prime contracts include nonappropriated funds, contracts not covered by Federal Acquisition Regulations, acquisitions for foreign governments, and contracts not reported in the Federal Procurement Data System. The SBA evaluates agencies' performance against goals annually using data from the Federal Procurement Data System to compile the Small Business Goaling Report. The federal small business contracting goals aim to allocate at least 23% of prime contract awards to small businesses owned by disadvantaged individuals, women, HUBZone businesses, and service-disabled veterans. The Small Business Administration sets specific procurement goals for awarding contracts to small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. While there are no penalties for not meeting these goals, the SBA's Small Business Goaling Report raises public awareness and is often referenced by Members when questioning federal agencies. The FY2017 Small Business Goaling Report, based on data from the Federal Procurement Data System, shows that federal agencies met the contracting goals for small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. In FY2017, federal agencies awarded a percentage of their contracts to different types of small businesses, with small businesses receiving 23.88% ($105.7 billion), small disadvantaged businesses receiving 9.10% ($40.2 billion), women-owned small businesses receiving 4.71% ($20.8 billion), HUBZone small businesses receiving 1.65% ($7.3 billion), and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses receiving 4.05% ($17.9 billion) of the total contract value. The Small Business Administration (SBA) provides funding to third parties like SBDCs for management and training services to small business owners. SBA district offices, overseen by the SBA Office of Field Operations and 10 regional offices, conduct outreach events annually for small business stakeholders and resource partners. The SBA district offices focus on core programs like contracting, capital, technical assistance, and exporting. They conduct annual reviews on 8(a) business development firms and on-site examinations of HUBZone certified firms. The Office of Inspector General's mission is to improve SBA management, effectiveness, and detect fraud in agency programs. The Inspector General, nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, directs the office with responsibilities to promote efficiency in SBA programs, conduct audits and investigations, prevent fraud, maintain relationships with other agencies, inform Congress of issues, and comply with audit standards. The SBA has programs to improve small business access to capital markets, including the Small Business Investment Company program and special high technology contracting programs. The SBIC program enhances small business access to venture capital. The SBA works with privately owned SBICs to provide financing to small businesses with private capital and borrowed funds at favorable rates. SBICs offer equity capital through various means like purchasing equity securities, making loans, purchasing debt securities, and providing guarantees to small businesses. The SBIC program provides guarantees for small businesses' monetary obligations to creditors not associated with the SBIC. In FY2018, the SBA committed to guarantee $2.52 billion in SBIC small business investments, with a total of $5.50 billion in financing for 1,151 small businesses. The now inactive NMVC program encourages equity investments in small businesses in low-income areas through public-private partnerships. The NMVC program aims to support local entrepreneurs in low-income areas by providing venture capital investments and technical assistance to create employment opportunities and wealth. The SBA selects participants, provides funding, and regulates operations to ensure public policy objectives are met. The program was appropriated $21.952 million in FY2001 to support SBA-guaranteed debentures and operational assistance grants. The NMVC program received funding for operational assistance grants from FY2001 to FY2006. In 2003, unobligated balances were rescinded. The program's financing declined as initial investments expired, with the active unpaid principal balance peaking at $698 million in FY2008 and reaching $0 in FY2018. The SBIR program aims to increase small, high technology firms' participation in federal research. The SBIR program aims to increase small, high technology firms' participation in federal research and development (R&D) endeavors. It requires federal departments with an R&D budget of $100 million or more to establish and operate a SBIR program. Currently, 11 federal agencies participate in the program, allocating a set percentage of their extramural R&D budget to support mission-related work in small businesses through a three-phase process. Phase I involves awards of up to $163,952 for six months to evaluate a concept's scientific or technical merit and feasibility. The SBIR program supports small businesses in federal R&D projects aligned with the mission of the supporting organization. Phase II awards can reach $1.09 million for R&D, while Phase III focuses on commercialization. Various federal departments and agencies, including NASA and NSF, participate in SBIR programs. The SBIR program supports small businesses in federal R&D projects aligned with the mission of the supporting organization. Funding can be disbursed in the form of contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements by agencies like NASA and NSF. The SBA establishes broad policy and guidelines for SBIR programs, while the STTR program provides funding for research proposals developed cooperatively between small firms and nonprofit research organizations. The Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program provides funding for the exploration of scientific, technical, and commercial feasibility of ideas or technologies. Phase I offers up to $163,952 for one year, with Phase II awards up to $1.09 million for two years. Phase III funding for commercialization is expected to come from the private sector. The program is funded by a set-aside of at least 0.45% of the extramural R&D budget of departments spending over $1 billion annually on R&D. The Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program receives funding for feasibility exploration of ideas or technologies, with participation from various government departments. The SBA oversees the program and describes growth accelerators as organizations aiding entrepreneurs in business scaling. These accelerators provide advice on revenue growth, job creation, and securing funding to accelerate startup success. The SBA's Growth Accelerator Initiative began in FY2014 with a $2.5 million recommendation from Congress. The Growth Accelerator Initiative, funded by Congress, provides grants to universities and accelerators to support startups in areas with limited access to capital. The SBA's Office of Advocacy advocates for small businesses by intervening in regulatory processes. The Small Business Administration (SBA) supports small businesses by intervening early in regulatory processes, providing compliance training, conducting research on regulatory burdens, and facilitating communication between federal agencies and the small business community through programs like the National Women's Business Council, the Office of Ombudsman, and Faith-Based Initiatives. The National Ombudsman's mission is to assist small businesses facing unfair federal regulatory enforcement actions. The Office of Ombudsman works with federal agencies to address entrepreneurs' concerns promptly. The National Ombudsman assists small businesses with unfair federal regulatory enforcement actions by receiving and referring comments to the Inspector General, filing annual reports with Congress, and rating federal agencies based on small business owner feedback. The SBA sponsors faith-based initiatives like the Business Smart Toolkit in collaboration with NAGGL. During the 111th Congress, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided the SBA with additional funding, including subsidies for loan guaranty programs and increasing loan guaranty percentages. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 authorized the establishment of the Small Business Lending Fund and State Small Business Credit Initiative, providing additional funding to the SBA. During the 112th Congress, the SBA's authorization expired in July 2011, leading to temporary extensions until 2013 under the National Defense Authorization Act. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 increased the SBA's surety bond limit and required oversight of federal mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs. It also addressed the SBA's practice of combining size standards within industrial groups. During the 113th Congress, the SBA's SBIC program's annual authorization amount was increased to $4 billion from $3 billion. The Veterans Entrepreneurship Act of 2015 made permanent the waiver of the SBAExpress loan program's upfront guaranty fee for veterans. The Recovery Improvements for Small Entities After Disaster Act of 2015 included provisions to assist individuals and small businesses affected by Hurricane Sandy. The SBA is authorized to provide additional financial assistance to SBDCs, WBCs, SCORE, or proposed consortiums to help small businesses in disaster areas. SBDCs can assist businesses outside their state in disaster areas. The minimum disaster loan amount requiring collateral is temporarily increased to $25,000. P.L. 114-92 expands the definition of a BRAC military base closure area under the HUBZone program. The BRAC military base closure area under the HUBZone program is expanded to include lands within the closed base boundaries and extends eligibility to qualified disaster areas. Native Hawaiian Organizations are added to the list of eligible small businesses. Starting one year from enactment, requirements for individual sureties in the SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Program are added. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, increases the guaranty rate for preferred sureties in the SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Program to 90% and expands the projects eligible for refinancing under the 504/CDC loan guaranty program. It also increases the SBIC program's family of funds limit to $350 million and authorizes $26.5 billion for the 7(a) loan program in FY2016. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 renamed the \"State Trade and Export Promotion\" grant.
