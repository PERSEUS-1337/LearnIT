    "content": "The Act titled \"Mechanical Insulation Installation Incentive Act of 2009\" introduces a new section in the Internal Revenue Code allowing for the expensing of mechanical insulation property. The \"Mechanical Insulation Installation Incentive Act of 2009\" allows for a deduction of a percentage of the cost of mechanical insulation property placed in service during the taxable year. The applicable percentage is the lesser of 30 percent or the excess of energy savings obtained by the property over the energy savings required by Standard 90.1-2007. The \"Mechanical Insulation Installation Incentive Act of 2009\" allows for a deduction of the cost of mechanical insulation property placed in service. The Act specifies rules for maintenance and defines mechanical insulation property as insulation materials, facings, and components. The \"Mechanical Insulation Installation Incentive Act of 2009\" defines insulation property as materials used for thermal, acoustical, and safety requirements in mechanical systems. The cost includes installation expenses and removal/disposal costs. The \"Mechanical Insulation Installation Incentive Act of 2009\" covers the cost of new mechanical insulation property, labor costs for preparation and installation, and coordination with other deductions and credits under the tax code. The deduction or credit for mechanical insulation property costs under this chapter is reduced by the amount already taken into account. An exception is made for maintenance costs. Energy savings must be certified according to regulations. For tax-exempt property, the primary contractor for installation is treated as the taxpayer placing the property in service. The deduction for capital expenditures under Section 263(a)(1) of the Code is amended to include expenditures eligible for a deduction under section 179F. Technical and clerical amendments are made to various sections of the Code to include references to section 179F. The table of sections for part VI of subchapter B of chapter 1 of subtitle A of the Code is amended to include a new item after section 179E. The amendments made by this section apply to property placed in service after the date of enactment of this Act."
