    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Program Act of 2016\". Congress finds that study abroad programs are essential for preparing students for success in the global economy. These programs offer access to international knowledge, language learning opportunities, and cultural understanding. However, only a small percentage of US postsecondary students participate in study abroad, with minority, first-generation, and community college students being underrepresented. The Lincoln Commission was established by Congress to expand study abroad opportunities for US students, with a focus on developing nations. Leadership from administrators and faculty is crucial for increasing participation and improving program quality. A competitive grant program is necessary to encourage and support leadership in making study abroad an integral part of the undergraduate experience. The Act aims to increase access to quality study abroad opportunities, promote diversity in study abroad destinations, especially in developing countries, and encourage institutions of higher education to expand study abroad programs. It also establishes the Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Program. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to include the Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Program, aimed at promoting diversity in study abroad destinations and expanding study abroad programs at institutions of higher education. The term 'national of the United States' refers to a US national or a lawful permanent resident. A 'nontraditional study abroad destination' is a less common location for studying abroad. A 'student' is a US national enrolled in a US higher education institution. 'Study abroad' encompasses educational programs involving study, work, or research. The Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Program is an educational program conducted outside the US that offers academic credit. Its objectives include having at least 1,000,000 undergraduate students study abroad annually within 10 years of its enactment. The Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Program aims to increase study abroad participation to reflect US undergraduate demographics and focus on nontraditional destinations, especially in developing countries. Competitive grants are awarded to higher education institutions for this purpose. The Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Program requires grant applicants to detail plans for using funds, commit to expanding access to study abroad, evaluate progress, sustain increased participation, and establish health and safety guidelines. Consortia of higher education institutions can also apply for grants. Institutions of higher education seeking grants for study abroad programs may include nongovernmental institutions. The Secretary must consider recommendations from the Commission on the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program. Consultation with diverse higher education representatives is required for program implementation. The Secretary must submit an annual report to the Senate and House committees on the implementation of the Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Program Act of 2016. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal year 2017 and subsequent years."
