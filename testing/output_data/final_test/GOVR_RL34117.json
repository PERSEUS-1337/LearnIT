    "content": "Beginning in the late 1970s, Congress deregulated the railroad industry, allowing railroads more flexibility in setting rates and negotiating contracts. Some Members of Congress are now questioning the need to revise the current regime to protect captive rail shippers who feel they are being charged excessive rates by railroads acting like monopolies. Some captive rail shippers claim the railroad acts like a monopoly, charging excessive rates and providing inadequate service. Organizations want Congress to regulate certain aspects of railroad operations to protect shippers' interests. The issue has wider economic implications, raising questions about competition and investment in rail infrastructure. The report explains \"bottlenecks\" and \"terminal switching arrangements,\" key points of contention between railroads and captive customers. The Surface Transportation Board is reviewing policies regarding railroads and captive customers, with legislation supported by shippers. The report discusses injecting more rail-to-rail competition into the industry, following past deregulation acts in the 1970s and 1980s. Railroad deregulation in the late 1970s and early 1980s aimed to deregulate all modes of transportation, including railroads. The 4R Act restructured Northeast railroads and created Conrail from the bankrupt Penn Central Railroad, exempting traffic from regulation if it was deemed an undue burden on commerce. Market dominance was introduced as the absence of effective competition in transportation. The Staggers Act of 1980 advanced railroad deregulation by granting railroads more freedom to set rates, provide different rates and service quality to customers, and enter into confidential contracts. The Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 eliminated many ICC functions and transferred them to STB, which is bipartisan and decisionally independent. The ICC Termination Act transferred many functions to STB, which is housed within the U.S. Department of Transportation. STB regulates captive rail shipper issues and determines market dominance. It requires a rail rate to exceed a revenue to variable cost threshold of 180% before asserting jurisdiction. STB evaluates rate reasonableness based on different methodologies and only acts on complaints from shippers. Competition and railroad revenue adequacy are key in national railroad policy. The Staggers Act of 1980 aims to promote competition in the railroad industry and minimize federal regulatory control. It also seeks to ensure rail carriers earn adequate revenues while promoting a safe and efficient transportation system. The DOT evaluates railroad revenue adequacy annually, and the regulatory environment post-Staggers Act has allowed railroads to adapt to market demands for lower costs and greater productivity. The Obama Administration supports shifting freight from truck to rail for public benefits and has provided federal funds to upgrade rail infrastructure. A 2006 GAO study found improvements in the rail industry's health since the Staggers Act, but noted disparities in rates for different commodities. Captivity in the industry has decreased, but the percentage of traffic with rates above the statutory threshold for relief has increased. The findings suggest that railroads may be engaging in reasonable economic practices or abusing market power. \"Captive shipper\" is a term subject to interpretation, often referring to shippers of bulky materials like coal and grain. Some utilities have faced challenges with railroads failing to deliver coal on time, leading to higher costs and imports from other countries. Grain producers have also complained about railroads not providing enough hopper cars during harvest time. Grain producers complain about railroads not providing enough hopper cars at harvest time. Many shippers bought their own cars but now face issues with railroads not supplying locomotives and crews. Poor rail service drives customers to overseas grain sources. Shippers are not limited to a single railroad, but economic viability determines if they are \"captive.\" Captive shippers may be due to lack of rail competition in certain areas or mergers among railroads reducing competition in other locations. Evaluating captivity is complex as no railroad has unrestrained market power. Owners of facilities built since 1980 had the opportunity to negotiate terms of service with a railroad before construction to avoid captivity. Shippers with multiple facilities may have more options. Some shippers claim to be captive despite having access to alternatives. For example, DuPont considers its Richmond, VA plant captive to CSX Railroad, along with 31 other North American plants. The Richmond plant is located near CSX tracks, Interstate 95, and the Port of Richmond on the James River. DuPont's Richmond plant is considered captive to CSX Railroad, along with 31 other plants. The plant has access to various transportation facilities, including a nearby wharf for bulk material shipments by vessel. Despite claims of captivity, a 2007 STB estimate found captive shipments accounted for less than 10% of all rail shipments. STB's analysis did not find an abuse of market power by railroads and suggested that requiring railroads to interchange traffic with competitors may not be effective. Captive shippers argue that the STB favors railroads and suggest changes to the law to prioritize competition over railroad revenue. They propose that the STB should focus on enhancing competition in rail mergers and monitoring railroad service performance to assist captive shippers. In the 111th and 112th Congress, bills were introduced to improve railroad service performance and increase competition for captive shippers. The Surface Transportation Board Reauthorization Act of 2009 aimed to address bottlenecks and terminal switching arrangements. The Railroad Antitrust Enforcement Act of 2011 sought to enhance competition in the railroad industry. STB considered reviewing competition in the railroad industry in 2009. In early 2011, the Surface Transportation Board revisited the topic of competition in the railroad industry, noting significant changes since the mid-1980s. These changes included the improved economic health of the industry, increased consolidation of Class I railroads, growth of short-line railroads, and increased involvement of customers in activities previously handled by railroads. The Board also highlighted the substantial productivity gains in the industry since 1980, leading to lower rail rates. Since 1980, railroad rates have risen despite previous productivity gains. The Surface Transportation Board reviewed exemptions for certain rail shipments in 2011, prompted by concerns from key members of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Maintaining a regulatory balance between railroads and shippers was emphasized. The Surface Transportation Board (STB) is reviewing issues such as \"bottleneck rates\" and \"competitive access\" which could impact railroads and shippers. The Committee opposes any policy changes that restrict railroads' abilities to invest and meet freight transportation demands. A bottleneck occurs when only one railroad has track serving a specific route, limiting competition. The Surface Transportation Board (STB) ruling in December 1996 affirmed bottleneck rate practices, allowing railroads to set rates for the most efficient route and not offer rates for alternative routes requested by shippers. An exception is made if a shipper already has a contract with a non-bottleneck carrier for a portion of the route. In practice, captive shippers seek changes to require railroads to provide rates on bottleneck segments of a route. Shippers can request separate rates from origin to bottleneck, bottleneck to destination, and through rates. If a shipper chooses a different railroad for a segment, the original railroad must interchange the traffic. Shippers can challenge the reasonableness of rates. The consolidation of the railroad industry has led to more bottlenecks according to captive shippers, but railroads argue that STB mandates track sharing in merger approvals. Most mergers since 1980 have been end-to-end consolidations, not between railroads with parallel tracks, to enhance long-distance freight movement. In 1970, Class I rail shipments had an average length of haul of 515 miles, which has now increased to over 860 miles. Railroads are focusing on long-distance freight, using longer trains and bigger railcars, and implementing through-blocking to reduce costs and transit times. Despite claims that rail mergers benefit shippers by lowering rates and improving service, end-to-end mergers can still create bottlenecks. The concept of \"competitive access\" in the rail industry refers to the extent to which a rail customer can access a second, potentially competing railroad. Unlike other modes of transportation, railways are privately owned, and agreements between railroads may involve sharing tracks to reduce maintenance costs or increase train fluidity, but not necessarily granting access to each other's customers. The Surface Transportation Board (STB) has required railroads to share tracks in certain situations, including access to potential customers. In some cases, the Surface Transportation Board (STB) has mandated railroads to share tracks, such as granting trackage rights during the Union Pacific (UP) and Southern Pacific (SP) merger in 1996. Other remedies for mergers include switching arrangements and terminal access areas to facilitate competition. Railroads often interchange traffic at terminals located at the end points of their networks to complete interline movements. Interchanges can involve partnerships between railroads or handing off cargo to competing railroads for alternative routes. This practice is required by statute and may include using owning railroad tracks outside the terminal area. Interchange on rail routings is limited to specific segments due to STB requirements for merger approval. STB will only order interswitching if anti-competitive conduct is found. Captive shippers want the statute changed to mandate interchange without proving anti-competitive behavior. Railroads argue against this change. The railroads are against proposed changes in the law that would increase interchanging of traffic among railroads, claiming it would lead to delays, higher costs, and decreased competitiveness. They argue that mandatory access to railroad track and terminals would result in more regulation and less competition. The dispute between railroads and captive customers has been ongoing, worsened by high demand for rail service and increased rates before the recent economic downturn. Railroads have been accused of exerting market power by charging higher rates and returning to public pricing, leading to complaints from captive shippers. Shippers argue that public pricing allows railroads to raise prices with little warning and that fuel surcharges are inflated based on a percentage of the freight bill rather than actual fuel costs. STB has investigated these claims. In January 2007, STB directed railroads to change their fuel surcharge method to reflect actual costs. Intermodal rail customers prefer investing in rail infrastructure to solve capacity and service-quality issues. UPS supports creating a federal rail trust fund for infrastructure expansion. Intermodal shipper groups emphasize maintaining a regulatory environment that allows railroads to reinvest in their infrastructure. Rail industry proposal for a 25% tax credit supported by various groups like the Waterfront Coalition and the National Retail Federation. Concerns that resources may shift towards captive customers, impacting the intermodal market. Intermodal shippers facing challenges with fuel prices, truck driver shortages, and new regulations. UPS and other large intermodal shippers unable to shift freight to trucks realistically. Large trucking firms cannot shift long-distance freight to trucks without pricing out customers. UPS and ocean container lines rely on railroads but face significant rate increases due to railroads' market power. Railroads have immense bargaining power and can almost dictate rate increases, limiting intermodal rail service at ports. The railroads counter shipper criticism by arguing that recent pricing and investment strategies are rational responses to changing economic circumstances. They explain that the shift from a rail market with excess capacity to one with excess demand dictates price increases and a preference for shorter-term contracts or public pricing. Shippers now face higher rates due to expired contracts negotiated when railroads had excess capacity. Railroads justify their pricing and investment strategies as responses to changing economic conditions, emphasizing the shift from excess capacity to excess demand. They argue that long-term contracts are necessary to meet long-term expectations, citing recent coal and grain delivery issues as examples of unexpected traffic surges. The Department of Transportation supported railroads during the George W. Bush Administration, emphasizing the need for investors to see a return on their investments in capacity-enhancing projects. The captive shipper debate has been ongoing for over two decades, with changing economic circumstances potentially reshaping it. Captive shippers argue for more flexibility in rerouting their traffic to less congested routes, while railroads oppose increased rail-to-rail competition. They fear it would harm their industry's financial health. The railroads argue that increased intramodal competition could lead to a smaller rail network serving only higher-margin customers, potentially resulting in the shedding of unprofitable lines to maintain a reasonable return on investment. This debate over open access and competition has been ongoing for over two decades, with captive shippers advocating for more flexibility in rerouting their traffic. Open access in the rail industry could lead to a smaller, more efficient rail system serving different customers. There is a debate over whether this system would better serve the interests of shippers, labor, and the public. Multiple railroads operating on the same line may increase costs and prices for rail shippers. Competitive policies in the industry are argued to increase consumer and producer surplus. Competition in the rail industry can lead to a battle over monopoly control, impacting consumer and producer surplus. Economies of scale and scope can increase production costs under competition, especially in industries like railroads. The advantages of railroads in hauling heavy freight long distances are highlighted during periods of high fuel prices and growing demand. Congress is considering the impact of addressing captive shippers on the railroad system's strength and vibrancy."
