Activities eligible for assistance under the water pollution control revolving funds include implementation of conservation and management plans, restoration or protection of riparian areas, promotion of beneficial reuse of wastewater, development of pollution prevention plans, acquisition of lands for mitigation requirements, and enhancement of treatment works security. The water pollution control revolving fund of a State is established, maintained, and credited with repayments, available perpetually for financial assistance. Fees charged by a State for assistance can be deposited in the fund for administration costs. Loan guarantees are provided for revolving funds by municipalities and innovative technologies. Administrative expenses are also addressed in the legislation. The legislation amends Section 603(d) to provide technical and planning assistance for small systems in wastewater treatment operations, including financial management and user fee analysis. The amendment also increases the annual funding cap to $400,000 or 1/2 percent of the current fund valuation, whichever is greater, plus collected fees.

In any fiscal year with over $1.4 billion available, a State must provide grants to financially distressed communities equal to 25% of the difference between the total amount allotted under section 604 and what would have been allotted if the available funds were $1.4 billion.

Financially distressed communities may also receive priority for loans from the state's water pollution control revolving fund. The term 'financially distressed community' is defined as meeting affordability criteria set by the State for treatment works. The Administrator may provide information to help States establish these criteria. Recipients of financial assistance can use the design-build project delivery method for construction projects. The design-build project delivery method allows recipients of financial assistance to construct publicly owned treatment works or infrastructure facilities under a single contract, following specific selection procedures. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2003 to 2007 under Section 607 (33 U.S.C. 1387) is as follows: $3 billion for 2003, $4 billion for 2004, $5 billion for 2005, $6 billion for 2006, and $7 billion for 2007."
