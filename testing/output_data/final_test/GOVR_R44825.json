Congress has increasingly used refundable tax credits for various purposes, such as reducing tax burdens for families with children and helping with education and health insurance costs. The legislative history of the EITC can provide context for current and future debates on refundable tax credits. The earned income tax credit (EITC) has undergone significant legislative changes over the past 40 years, aimed at increasing the credit amount and adjusting eligibility rules. These changes reflect congressional intentions to expand the benefit while targeting it to specific recipients. For more details on the current structure of the EITC, refer to the report's Appendix A or CRS Report R43805. The EITC has evolved over the years with changes aimed at increasing the credit amount and targeting specific recipients. The origins of the EITC can be traced back to the debate in the late 1960s and 1970s on welfare reform, with some policymakers considering alternatives like the \"negative income tax\" concept. The NIT proposals aimed to provide a guaranteed income to families with no earnings, gradually reducing it as earnings increased. President Nixon's \"family assistance plan\" (FAP) was influenced by the NIT idea but faced opposition from Senator Long, who proposed a \"work bonus\" plan to supplement wages for poor workers. Senator Long believed his plan would encourage work and provide a dignified way to help poor Americans. The \"work bonus plan\" proposed by Senator Long aimed to supplement wages for poor workers and prevent the social security tax from affecting low-income earners. It was eventually passed as the earned income tax credit in 1975, providing a maximum credit of $400 for earnings up to $4,000. The credit was seen as a way to encourage work, reduce dependence on cash welfare, and stimulate economic growth during the 1974 recession. The earned income tax credit (EITC) was introduced in 1975 to provide relief to low-income families affected by rising food and energy prices. It aimed to increase after-tax earnings for those subject to social security payroll tax, incentivizing work and self-sufficiency. The EITC was expected to stimulate the economy as low-income individuals were likely to spend a large portion of their disposable incomes. The earned income tax credit (EITC) was introduced in 1975 to assist low-income families by increasing after-tax earnings and encouraging employment. Originally targeted at single mothers with children, the EITC was intended to replace cash welfare. The credit was extended multiple times before becoming permanent in 1978, with the maximum amount increased to $500. The earned income tax credit (EITC) was made permanent in 1978 with a maximum amount of $500. Subsequent increases in 1984 and 1986 adjusted the credit for cost-of-living increases and Social Security taxes. The credit was seen as an effective way to provide work incentives and relief to low-income families. In the early 1990s, legislative changes increased the EITC amount and expanded eligibility to include childless workers. Concerns about cost and noncompliance led to changes aimed at reducing fraud, targeting benefits, and improving administration. Policymakers began using the EITC for poverty reduction, with some viewing it as a better tool for the working poor with children. The EITC was restructured in the early 1990s to be better targeted at the working poor with children, administered by the IRS to avoid creating new bureaucracy. Changes in the formula made the credit vary based on family size, increasing its effectiveness in reducing poverty. The EITC was restructured in the early 1990s to target the working poor with children, varying in size based on family size. The credit was extended to childless workers in OBRA93 to offset a gasoline tax increase, with a smaller maximum credit of $323 for adults aged 25 to 64 not claimed as dependents. The formulas for the childless EITC and EITC for individuals with children have remained unchanged since OBRA93. The EITC was restructured in the early 1990s to target the working poor with children, and later legislation in the 1990s made modifications to reduce fraud and limit eligibility. Congress was concerned with the rising cost of the credit and the potential for fraud and abuse as the EITC became more generous. Gingrich expressed concerns about fraud and abuse in the EITC due to its increasing generosity. A 1994 GAO report found errors in the credit claims. Policymakers were worried about higher-income taxpayers accessing the credit. PRWORA tightened compliance rules to address these issues, including expanding the definition of income to disqualify certain individuals. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (TRA97; P.L. 105-34) created penalties for taxpayers who incorrectly claimed the EITC, including denying the credit for 10 years if claimed fraudulently. Taxpayers had to provide additional information to prove eligibility after this period. These penalties aimed to improve the administration of the credit. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (TRA97) created penalties for fraudulent EITC claims and expanded income definitions for the credit. Congress also made changes to the EITC formula in the 2000s, particularly benefiting married couples and larger families. In 2000, bipartisan congressional interest focused on reducing tax burdens for married couples. A marriage penalty occurs when the refund for a married couple is smaller than the combined refund of two unmarried partners. The structure of the EITC was identified as a primary cause of this penalty among low-income taxpayers in 2001. The Earned Income Credit (EIC) may decrease for married couples due to the aggregation of incomes and qualifying children, resulting in a smaller credit per child compared to when the parents were unmarried. This issue is exacerbated by the lack of a higher phase out range for married taxpayers compared to heads of households. The EITC marriage penalty was reduced by EGTRRA in 2001 and further increased by ARRA in 2009, providing relief up to $5,000. ARRA also raised the credit rate for families with three or more children from 40% to 45%, resulting in a larger credit for these families. The EITC modifications enacted in 2009, including increased marriage penalty relief and a larger credit for families with three or more children, were initially meant to provide temporary economic stimulus. The Obama Administration proposed making these changes permanent, and they were extended through 2017 by the American Taxpayer Relief Act. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act made the marriage penalty relief and larger credit permanent. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act (PATH Act; Division Q of P.L. 114-113) aimed to reduce improper payments of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) by preventing retroactive claims after Social Security numbers are issued. This measure was part of various provisions to curb erroneous EITC claims and fraudulent activities. The law stated that EITC credit would be denied if SSNs were issued after the tax return due date. Additionally, the IRS was required to hold refunds until February 15 for EITC claims to prevent identity theft and revenue loss. The legislative changes were made to prevent revenue loss due to identity theft and refund fraud related to fabricated wages and withholdings. The IRS aims to reduce erroneous EITC payments by cross-checking income information. There are eight formulas to calculate the EITC, depending on marital status and number of children. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for unmarried taxpayers with one child follows a specific calculation process. The credit increases to its maximum value from the first dollar of earnings until reaching the \"earned income amount.\" During the \"phase-in range,\" the credit value is determined by the credit rate multiplied by earnings. Once earnings are between the \"earned income amount\" and the \"phaseout threshold,\" the credit remains constant at its maximum level. Any income above the \"phaseout threshold\" results in a reduction of the credit by the phaseout rate until it reaches zero, known as the \"phaseout range.\""
