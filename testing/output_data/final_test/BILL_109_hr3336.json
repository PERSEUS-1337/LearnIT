The \"Safe Aviation and Flight Enhancement Act of 2005\" finds that the United States needs to improve the retrieval of critical flight data and cockpit voice recordings from commercial aircraft to enhance national security and passenger safety. With advancements in commercial aviation, there is a growing need to ensure quick recovery and analysis of flight data to prevent potential terrorism and avoid disruptions to the commercial air fleet. The need for improved retrieval of flight data and cockpit voice recordings from commercial aircraft is highlighted due to the increased difficulty in locating and recovering black boxes. Deployable recorder technology used by the United States Armed Forces could help avoid unnecessary costs. Installing a second set of recorders that eject from the aircraft during an accident is proposed for public safety. The Navy's successful experience with deployable technology since 1993 suggests that transferring this technology to the commercial sector can improve the survivability and retrieval of recorders in aircraft accidents. This can help reduce the time and cost of mishap investigations, search, rescue, and recovery efforts. Valuable time is often lost searching for fixed flight data recorders in crash wreckage, especially in ocean crashes where critical data may be lost if the black boxes do not survive. Recent air incidents have shown that black boxes may not survive crashes, leading to delays in recovering crucial data. For example, the black boxes from American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 in the 9/11 attacks were not recovered. It took days to retrieve the black boxes from American Airlines Flight 77, with the cockpit voice recorder being damaged beyond repair. In another incident, it took days to locate the cockpit voice recorder and recover the flight data recorder. The recovery of flight data recorders from air disasters like Egypt Air Flight 990, Swiss Air Flight 111, and Valuejet Flight 592 has taken several days in the past due to various challenges. The locator beacon failed on TWA Flight 800, which exploded and crashed in the ocean near Moriches, New York on July 17, 1996. It took 7 days to recover the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder. SEC. 3. REGULATIONS REQUIRING DEPLOYABLE RECORDERS. The Secretary of Transportation must issue regulations within 90 days that require all commercial aircraft to have a second deployable recorder system in addition to the current cockpit voice and digital flight data recorders. This system must utilize combination technology and be mounted as far rear on the airframe as possible. The deployable recording system must be mounted as far rear on the airframe as possible and have the capability to record all mandatory data parameters for the previous 25 hours of operation and cockpit audio for the previous 2 hours. It should be powered by the electrical bus and have an independent power source for 10 minutes of operation in case of normal aircraft power failure. The regulations require the installation of a deployable combination recorder system on commercial aircraft ordered by an air carrier after January 1, 2007. Commercial aircraft are defined as jet aircraft with 10 or more seats or a propeller-driven aircraft with more than 19 seats. The deployable recorder system is a digital flight data recorder. The regulations mandate the installation of a deployable recorder system on commercial aircraft, consisting of a digital flight data recorder, cockpit voice recorder, and emergency locator transmitter in a single unit designed to eject from the aircraft upon accident, fly away from the crash site, and float indefinitely on water. The Secretary of Transportation will provide deployable recorder systems to air carriers for free to comply with regulations. Aircraft manufacturers will be reimbursed for costs incurred in developing and installing these systems."
