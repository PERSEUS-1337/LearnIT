    "content": "The President linked U.S. participation in the JCPOA to addressing its deficiencies. On May 8, 2018, the U.S. announced its withdrawal from the JCPOA by reimposing sanctions. This decision will have significant implications for U.S. policy in the region. The analysis is based on key documents related to the issue. The JCPOA does not provide for any party to \"withdraw.\" The Obama and Trump Administrations both viewed the agreement as nonbinding. President Trump has the authority to cease U.S. implementation of the accord, reimpose sanctions, and redesignate entities for sanctions. President Trump announced the reimposition of all U.S. sanctions revoked to implement the JCPOA without requiring Congress approval. The decision was foreshadowed by Secretary of State Tillerson's remarks on Iran's threats beyond the nuclear agreement. Trump emphasized at the U.N. General Assembly the need to prevent Iran from building a nuclear program under the cover of the Iran Deal. President Trump criticized the Iran Deal as one-sided and embarrassing for the U.S. He announced a new strategy on Iran, hinting at possible termination of the JCPOA if conditions are not met. Despite the deal's aim for peace, Iran's actions have fueled conflict and terror in the Middle East. Trump directed his administration to work with Congress on the issue. President Trump threatened to withdraw the US from the Iran nuclear deal unless Congress and European allies address its flaws, including immediate inspections, preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, removing expiration dates on restrictions, and monitoring Iran's development. The deal is under continuous review and can be terminated by the President at any time. President Trump called for stronger measures against Iran's malign activities, including support for terrorist groups, missile development, cyber threats, human rights violations, and threats to international shipping. He replaced officials who supported the Iran nuclear deal with critics, signaling a more aggressive stance towards Iran. The May 8 announcement by the Administration signaled efforts to address concerns about the JCPOA and broader Iran issues, possibly in a revised nuclear agreement. Global reaction to the announcement closely tracked with the consistent program for U.S. efforts to change Iran's regime. Iran's leaders may refuse to negotiate a new deal, but they will eventually want to make a new and lasting deal that benefits all of Iran and the Iranian people. The May 8 announcement by the Administration prompted global reactions from various countries and leaders regarding the JCPOA. Support came from Israel, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Bahrain, while France, Germany, Britain, and the EU expressed regret over the decision but remained committed to the JCPOA for joint security. European diplomats emphasized the binding international commitment of the JCPOA under Resolution 2231. Efforts by Britain, France, and Germany to address President Trump's concerns about the JCPOA through meetings with U.S. officials led by Brian Hook. Macron and Merkel expressed support for working with the U.S. on additions to the JCPOA or joint action to address nuclear restrictions, Iran's regional activities, and ballistic missile programs. Macron hinted at engaging Iran, Russia, and China in new negotiations. The European leaders expressed willingness to engage Iran, Russia, and China in new negotiations regarding the JCPOA, but no firm agreements were reached during their visits. They emphasized the importance of not risking the collapse of the accord without a clear alternative and stated their intention to continue implementing the JCPOA even if President Trump withdraws from it. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani responded immediately to the announcement, stating that Iran would cooperate. Hassan Rouhani reacted to the May 8 announcement by stating that Iran would work with remaining parties to the accord to keep it intact. He indicated that Iran would continue to implement its commitments as long as it receives economic benefits, but warned of potentially leaving the accord if U.S. sanctions harm its economy. Rouhani also directed Iran's nuclear program officials to be prepared to restart suspended aspects if the agreement collapses entirely. Iranian officials have maintained they will not renegotiate the JCPOA under any circumstances. Iranian officials have insisted they will not renegotiate the JCPOA, with hardliners opposing any such move. Iran's leaders argue that U.S. pressure will not make them give up their civilian nuclear program or ballistic missile defense. Some Iranian military figures suggested limiting missile ranges. Iranian parliamentarians burned copies of the JCPOA in protest. President Trump called for new legislation addressing JCPOA weaknesses. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker and Senator Tom Cotton outlined legislation to automatically reimpose U.S. sanctions on Iran if they violate JCPOA restrictions, even after they expire. Another version negotiated with Senator Robert Menendez was not introduced. Corker suggested Congress might act if European leaders support addressing Trump's concerns about the JCPOA, potentially through a new agreement with Iran or a U.S.-European deal. The Trump Administration chose to cease implementing the JCPOA by reimposing U.S. sanctions instead of using provisions within the agreement itself. The JCPOA includes a \"Dispute Resolution Mechanism\" allowing parties to address violations. The United States has the ability to \"snap back\" sanctions if deemed necessary. The dispute resolution mechanism in the JCPOA allows for the United States to \"snap back\" sanctions if necessary. This mechanism enables any veto-wielding member of the U.N. Security Council to block resolutions lifting sanctions. A U.S. accusation of Iranian noncompliance without evidence from the IAEA could raise questions about using this mechanism to exit the agreement. The INARA law provides options for the Administration to cease U.S. implementation of the JCPOA. The JCPOA dispute resolution mechanism allows for the US to reimpose sanctions based on presidential authority, not invoking INARA provisions. INARA authorizes the President to report Iranian breaches, triggering expedited congressional procedures for reimposing sanctions waived under the JCPOA. The INARA material breach report requires the Administration to accuse Iran of non-compliance with the nuclear commitments of the JCPOA. Other P5+1 parties may question if the US has provided information on potential Iranian breaches to the IAEA for investigation. Failure to do so could raise doubts about the credibility of the accusations. INARA requires the Administration to certify Iranian compliance every 90 days based on four main conditions. This certification is separate from the decision to reimpose sanctions, giving Congress the option to do so under expedited privileges. President Trump announced withholding INARA compliance certification due to concerns about Iran's nuclear program and violations of the JCPOA. He argued that sanctions relief was not proportionate and that Iran could rapidly develop nuclear weapons after restrictions end. President Trump's refusal to certify Iranian compliance under INARA gave Congress the option to reimpose sanctions on Iran. Despite this, Congress has not taken action yet. The President also has the authority to reimpose sanctions by refusing to renew waivers, reissuing Executive Orders, or imposing new sanctions. On May 8, President Trump announced the withdrawal from the JCPOA and the reimposition of all suspended sanctions by November 6. The sanctions on Iran were suspended or revoked, with the full reinstatement set for no later than November 6, 2018. The Administration will restore the \"Specially Designated National\" designation to entities previously delisted to implement the JCPOA, including banks, shipping firms, and civilian manufacturers. The U.S. will re-list entities crucial to Iran's economy, including the Central Bank of Iran, IRISL, Iran Air, and NIOC, under secondary sanctions. The decision to cease implementing the JCPOA may have extensive implications, especially for European Union countries. Possible implications of the U.S. ceasing to implement the JCPOA include EU countries and other major Iran trading partners seeking exemptions from U.S. penalties, potential collapse of the JCPOA without U.S. participation, major international firms exiting Iran leading to economic deterioration, and Iranian leaders arguing against compliance. Iranian leaders may argue that complying with the JCPOA is no longer beneficial and could resume restricted nuclear activities such as reinstalling centrifuges, increasing production, or enriching uranium beyond permitted levels. Iran could also engage in undeclared nuclear activities or restart its weapons program, potentially undetected depending on monitoring and intelligence capabilities. Despite stopping JCPOA obligations, Iran remains bound by IAEA safeguards and the Nonproliferation Treaty. The U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA could prompt Iran to react in ways unrelated to the agreement. Iran could react to the U.S. pullout from the JCPOA by expanding support to armed factions, conducting cyberattacks, increasing missile tests, and potentially prompting other countries to develop nuclear weapons. This could also impact negotiations with North Korea and lead to potential strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. President Trump's statement on Iran's nuclear aspirations could lead to potential military action. The reimposition of sanctions may cause economic unrest in Iran, potentially leading to a renegotiation of the JCPOA or restrictions on Iran's missile program. Iranian officials may negotiate restrictions on Iran's missile program, like limiting the ranges of missiles."
