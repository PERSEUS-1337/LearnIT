    "content": "Exciting work in deep generative models has led to the development of models that can suggest new organic molecules by generating their structure. A new molecule generation model is proposed, where reactants are selected and combined to form complex molecules. This model offers the ability to generate a diverse set of valid and unique molecules. The model can generate a wide set of unique molecules with useful biases in modeling reactions. Modeling synthesis routes offers practical advantages to chemists for suggesting stable and safe routes. The model can also solve one-step retrosynthesis problems by predicting reactants for a target product."
