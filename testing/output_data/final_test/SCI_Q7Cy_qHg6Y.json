    "content": "We propose a method to create realistic 3D facial morphable models with local control for editing facial attributes. Our approach combines part-based 3DMM for different facial regions like eyes, nose, mouth, ears, and facial mask. We use a novel PCA-based method to select expressive eigenvectors for accurate reconstruction. Editing controls are intuitive, based on anthropometric measurements filtered for generative power and mapped to the 3DMM through data-derived matrices. Our part-based 3D facial morphable model approach offers a new balance between local and global control. Tested on a dataset of 135 scans for model derivation and 19 scans for validation, our method demonstrates excellent generative properties and intuitive local control for users. Authoring realistic 3D faces with intuitive controls is essential for various computer graphics applications. Using high-level controls like anthropometric measurements can simplify the editing of human-like character heads. 3D morphable face models (3DMM) are commonly used for animation, face capture, and face editing. Our focus is on editing facial meshes rather than face animation. 3DMMs are constructed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on a data set of scans with the same mesh topology, allowing for the generation of new 3D faces by adjusting the weights of individual eigenvectors. Our approach aims to construct realistic 3D morphable face models by increasing controllability through segmentation into independent subregions and selecting dominant eigenvectors per part. This method improves upon existing techniques by focusing on face modeling rather than just facial animation, resulting in more accurate representations of neutral faces from different individuals. Our method enhances 3D morphable face models by segmenting into subregions and selecting dominant eigenvectors per part. Facial anthropometric measurements are used for editing faces, with a technique to bind essential measurements to eigenvectors. Users can adjust facial parts using sliders controlling anthropometric measurements, mapped to eigenvector weights for generating desired 3D faces. Experimental evidence shows the effectiveness of tailored 3DMMs over global PCA models. Blanz and Vetter proposed a model using PCA from face scans, decomposing the face into four parts for expressiveness. Global PCA methods have limitations in adjusting specific facial features and lack intuitive user control. Local models have been suggested to address these issues by segmenting the face into independent sub-regions and selecting dominant eigenvectors per part. Tena et al. propose localized clustered PCA models for animation, using spectral clustering on geodesic distance and correlation of vertex displacement. Chi et al. adaptively segment face models into soft regions based on user interaction. SPLOCS propose sparse matrix decompositions for localised deformation from animated mesh sequences. The method proposed by Cao et al. involves segmenting the face using spectral clustering and manual adjustment, focusing on expression and identity modeling. Their approach differs from Tena et al. and SPLOCS, as it addresses global differences in facial features rather than localized deformations caused by expressions. The Phace method allows users to edit fat or muscle maps on the face in texture space, providing a physically-based adjustment with implicit control. Wu et al. propose an anatomically-constrained local deformation model for facial improvement. Wu et al. [WBGB16] introduce a local deformation model for facial animation using 1000 parts, decoupling rigid pose from non-rigid deformation. Allen et al. [ACP03] and BodyTalk [SQH*16] offer methods for intuitive editing of 3DMM eigenvector weights, with BodyTalk relating mesh transformations to keywords like \"fit\" and \"sturdy\". However, BodyTalk's method is limited to bodies, not faces, and lacks local editing capabilities. Our approach aims to provide local control in face editing by segmenting the face into independent sub-regions and selecting the best set of eigenvectors. This method is better suited for facial model editing compared to global PCA based methods that have unwanted effects on other parts of the face. Previous work lacks the ability to edit facial models through objective measurements, which our approach addresses. Our method for facial model editing relies on anthropometric measurements as controls, selecting the right set for each facial part. We introduce a pipeline for constructing a 3DMM by segmenting the face into regions and computing independent PCA decomposition on each region. The most dominant eigenvectors are selected across regions, and anthropometric measurements are used for human understandable adjustments of the face. Reconstruction from the measurements is achieved through a mapping to the weights applied to each eigenvector. The paper discusses the construction of 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) using anthropometric measurements and PCA. The approach involves selecting measurements with the least reconstruction error, segmenting the face for PCA decomposition, and blending facial parts for reconstruction. Results are demonstrated and discussed, with a focus on segmenting the face for more accurate decomposition. The paper discusses constructing 3D Morphable Models using anthropometric measurements and PCA. The face is segmented into five parts for PCA decomposition: eyes, nose, mouth, ears, and facial mask. Each part has eigenvectors for reconstruction. Our approach selects the smallest set of eigenvectors that accurately reconstruct the shape by incrementally adding them based on significance. We provide a measurable error for each part's reconstruction, balancing quality with the whole face reconstruction. The accuracy is evaluated by constructing facial parts and blending them together to generate the whole face. After reconstructing facial parts and blending them to form the whole face, the accuracy is assessed by calculating the geometric error between the ground truth and the blended face. This involves rigid alignment, calculating per-vertex Euclidean distances, and computing averages over all vertices and parts to ensure balanced reconstruction quality. The evaluation is done on the entire data set and a set of validation faces not used in training, with median errors computed for both. During incremental eigenvector selection, candidate eigenvectors are chosen based on their impact on decreasing error. A probability density function is used to select eigenvectors, resulting in a more even distribution across parts and maintaining low error. As iteration progresses, reconstruction error decreases for female and male data set faces. The reconstruction error decreases for female and male data set faces. The average errors are 2.00 and 2.13 mm initially, decreasing to 0.75 and 0.74 mm after 80 iterations. An error threshold of 1 mm is chosen to balance the cost of considering eigenvectors and reconstruction accuracy. The eigenvector distribution is shown in Table 1 after achieving 1 mm accuracy. The focus is on blending five segmented parts to construct a realistic new face, diffusing the transition across three strips of vertices. In contrast to other methods, Laplacian blending is used for smooth surface transitions between parts. Energy minimization reduces surface curvature discontinuities at part junctions. Transition zones with quadrilateral strips are defined, with soft constraints for smooth blending. The text discusses the use of Laplacian blending for smooth surface transitions between parts, with soft constraints allowing leeway in the transition zone. Energy minimization reduces surface curvature discontinuities at part junctions, and the process involves solving for vertex positions and rotation matrices iteratively until convergence. The rotation quickly converges, and the iterations stop when the Frobenius norm falls below 0.01 or after 6 iterations. An example of a blended face is shown in Fig. 4. In this paper, the focus is on constructing linear regression models from data using facial anthropometric measurements. 33 parameters are used, each corresponding to Euclidean distances or ratios of distances between surface positions. The PCA eigenvectors do not provide a clear intuitive interpretation, so the emphasis is on intuitive facial measurements between specific surface landmarks. The paper proposes a measurement selection technique to assess the accuracy of facial measurements for each facial part. It evaluates measurements on a data set, adjusting weights of PCA eigenvectors to reconstruct faces with specific characteristics. Unlike previous methods, local mappings are learned per facial part. A process is derived to select the best measures independently for each part. The paper introduces a technique for selecting the most effective facial measurements for reconstructing faces with specific characteristics. It involves learning local mappings for each facial part and adjusting weights of PCA eigenvectors based on user-prescribed differences in measurements. This allows for adjustments such as making a face slimmer or fatter. The method aims to automatically detect the most relevant anthropometric measurements, some of which may be redundant with respect to others.

The method aims to automatically detect relevant anthropometric measurements, some of which may be redundant. In the process of evaluating the set of relevant measurements, it was found that considering more measurements does not necessarily lead to lower reconstruction error. When reconstructing faces, a mapping matrix is created using selected measurements and candidate measurements. The reconstructed face is evaluated for prediction quality by comparing it to the ground truth using a geometric error metric. The reconstruction quality of faces is evaluated by comparing predicted instances to ground truth instances using a geometric error metric. The percentage of faces that see an improvement in error is also measured to ensure accurate evaluation. The combined geometric error and percentage of improvement are used to select the best candidate measurement for reconstruction. The reconstruction quality of faces is evaluated by comparing predicted instances to ground truth instances using a geometric error metric. The percentage of faces that see an improvement in error is also measured to ensure accurate evaluation. Selected anthropometric measurements are determined based on an increase of D GE and a value D NI below 50%. The correlation between measurements is crucial for adjusting faces, with the system automatically calculating adjustments for other measurements to maintain realism. Pearson's correlation coefficient is used to evaluate the relationship between anthropometric measurements. The Pearson's correlation coefficient is used to evaluate the relationship between anthropometric measurements. It helps in adjusting faces by calculating adjustments for other measurements to maintain realism. The coefficient represents the correlation between measurements, with values between -1 and 1. Adjusting one measurement affects others, allowing for evaluation of their influence and creating likely ratings. Automatic clustering may lead to non-symmetrical clusters, requiring manual checking for usability. Our 3DMM computes a set of eigenvectors for each part of the face, allowing for local adjustments. Comparison with other methods like global 3DMM, SPLOCS, and clustered PCA was done using mapping matrices. Clustered PCA with 12 clusters was found to be more symmetrical than with 13 clusters. This approach ensures a sufficient number of eigenvectors per part for accurate adjustments. Our approach involves using 46 eigenvectors for each cluster, selected based on largest eigenvalues, to allow for local or global control. Measurements can be adjusted for specific facial parts or all parts to achieve coherence. Comparison with SPLOCS enables balancing between locality and globality of measurement influence. Our approach involves using 46 eigenvectors for each cluster, selected based on largest eigenvalues, to allow for local or global control. Measurements are based on specific measurement vertices, enforcing locality by checking for significant movement at related vertices. SPLOCS eigenvectors are considered for a measurement if they meet the criterion for one of the measurement vertices. Mapping matrices for all eigenvectors are used to enforce more globality with SPLOCS. Comparisons show different approaches including global PCA eigenvectors, local and global SPLOCS, clustered PCA, and our local and global strategies.

The adjustment of anthropometric measurements using global 3DMM, local SPLOCS, clustered PCA, and our local approach is shown in Figures 10-12. The goal is to have warmer colors around the location where the editing is intended, and colder colors in unrelated regions. Deformation around the nose is focused with clustered PCA and our approach, unlike global eigenvectors and local SPLOCS which result in significant deformation all over the face. The results in Figures 10-12 demonstrate the challenge of locally controlling face deformation and the effectiveness of our approach in adjusting the face based on anthropometric measurements. Our method outperforms clustered PCA in terms of local deformation control. The accompanying video showcases multiple edits on various parts of the face, while Figure 13 displays edits starting from real faces. Our approach captures the essence of anthropometric measurements, offering a user-friendly workflow. The study discusses the impact of eigenvector and measurement selection, face segmentation choice, and the procedure for aligning scans to a common face mesh. Real faces are reconstructed using anthropometric measurements to compute eigenvector weights, with the quality of reconstruction assessed by comparing ground truth measurements to those from the reconstructed face. Error percentages are normalized to a range of 0% to 100%. The study evaluates the impact of eigenvector and measurement selection on face reconstruction accuracy. Results show that using \"our measurements\" leads to lower error percentages compared to other methods. Additionally, using \"all measurements\" for the mapping matrix results in larger errors compared to ground truth measurements. Our approach outperformed SPLOCS and clustered PCA in achieving measurement values prescribed by edit operations on 135 face meshes. The resulting measurement values from our approach were closest to the prescribed values, followed by SPLOCS, with clustered PCA showing the greatest differences. This face segmentation method was developed based on feedback from facial animation artists. Our face segmentation method allows for manual selection of face patches to ensure they match the morphology and muscle locations, providing control that automatic methods lack. This manual selection process is not more cumbersome than current state-of-the-art methods. The state-of-the-art method by Tena et al. requires post-processing to fix segmentation artifacts, and boundaries can sometimes cross important semantic regions like the eyes, causing complications downstream. Input mesh data quality is crucial for good reconstruction. The input mesh data quality is crucial for reconstructing good 3D face models. A new local 3DMM was designed for face editing, segmented into five parts and combined into a single 3DMM. Anthropometric measurements were used for face editing, mapped to the 3DMM through a matrix. The best set of measurements was selected for improved reconstruction. The process involved selecting the best anthropometric measurements to improve reconstruction accuracy. Out of 33 measurements surveyed, 31 improved reconstruction while 2 were rejected. The selection process applies to different 3DMMs and sets of measurements. Results showed superiority over established methods in automatic segmentation and eigenvector basis construction. Our approach showed superiority in local control compared to global 3DMMs. Limitations include linear mapping matrices and few ear measurements. Future work could explore non-linear mappings and additional ear anthropometric measurements. Fixed boundaries restrict head shape deformation compared to global 3DMMs. Future research could involve reconstructing a skull based on anthropometric measurements to generate a facial mask considering skin thickness. Another avenue is creating textures for 3DMMs using Generative Adversarial Networks and anthropometric details for a more realistic facial structure."
