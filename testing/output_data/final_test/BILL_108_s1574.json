FINDINGS.\" Congress directed the Secretary of the Interior to designate Midway Atoll as a National Memorial to the Battle of Midway, honoring the U.S. Armed Forces' courage during World War II. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was tasked with developing the National Memorial. The Senate found that the USFWS has not properly implemented Congress's directive to designate Midway Atoll as a National Memorial to the Battle of Midway. Historic preservation and military history have been overshadowed by the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge. The Secretary of the Interior failed to consult with the International Midway Memorial Foundation as required by law. The airfield on Midway Atoll is crucial for military and civilian aircraft in the northern Pacific. The USFWS had a cooperative relationship with a private contractor for logistical support at Midway Atoll, including maintaining the airfield. Due to USFWS policies, this relationship ended, leading to the Federal Government now spending $8 million annually to maintain the atoll with limited airfield access and no commercial flights. Public access to Midway is severely restricted. The Federal Government's reduction in infrastructure support has severely restricted public access to Midway Atoll, hindering its designation as a National Memorial despite its historical significance as the turning point of World War II in the Pacific. (8) Despite being designated as a National Memorial, no signage or monuments have been erected on Midway Atoll by the Federal Government. (9) There is a lack of historical interpretation or information on the Battle of Midway and its significance on the island. (10) In 2003, a jet fuel spill occurred at Sand Island on Midway Atoll. A jet fuel spill occurred at Sand Island on Midway Atoll, with only one contract employee on-site to manage the fuel farm. The cleanup and remediation cost is estimated at $4.7 million. Upon enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior will review the administration of Midway Atoll and consult with relevant parties. Within 90 days, a new agency will replace USFWS as the administrator of Midway Atoll and the National Memorial. Congress intends for the National Memorial on Midway Atoll to be given equal consideration in all matters related to the administration, development, and preservation of the Atoll. Midway's airport should remain in use as an emergency site for civilian and military aircraft safety. Public access to the Atoll should be maintained for visitors to experience its status as a National Memorial and Wildlife Refuge. The fact that Midway Atoll is a National Memorial to the Battle of Midway must be properly displayed. The Battle of Midway should be properly displayed on Midway Atoll, with historical documentation provided for significant aspects of the infrastructure. Interested organizations like the International Midway Memorial Foundation will be consulted regularly regarding the National Memorial."
