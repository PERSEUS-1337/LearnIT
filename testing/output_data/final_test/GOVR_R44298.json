    "content": "Many U.S. officials and Members of Congress view Spain as a key ally in Europe, with a focus on political developments, security cooperation, and economic ties. The Congressional Friends of Spain Caucus and the U.S.-Spain Council work to strengthen relations between the two countries. The U.S. and Spanish leaders aim to enhance economic, educational, and cultural ties. Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez leads Spain's government after a vote of no confidence removed Mariano Rajoy due to a corruption scandal. S\u00e1nchez's minority government faces challenges in governing. Prime Minister S\u00e1nchez leads a minority government in Spain, relying on support from left-wing and regional nationalist parties. Observers question the government's longevity, with the next general election due in July 2020. Rajoy had also led a minority government before S\u00e1nchez, following a political deadlock in 2016. In the 2016 election, the PP won 137 seats with 33% of the vote, followed by the Socialists with 85 seats (23%), Unidos Podemos with 71 seats (21%), and Ciudadanos with 32 seats (13%). The emergence of Podemos and Ciudadanos signaled a shift in Spain's political landscape, driven by public discontent over economic conditions and austerity policies. The global financial crisis hit Spain hard, leading to high unemployment and austerity policies. Public discontent grew over cuts to health and education spending, corruption allegations, and anger towards politicians. Despite ongoing economic challenges, there have been signs of improvement in the past few years. Spain remains a significant economy on the global stage. Spain, the 14th largest economy globally and the 4th largest in the Eurozone, faced a severe economic downturn post-2008 due to a collapsed housing and construction boom. The recession lasted until 2014, with a sharp increase in government budget deficit and public debt. Unemployment peaked at 26% in 2013, leading to Spain receiving emergency loans to stabilize its banks during the Eurozone crisis in 2012. Since 2011, the Rajoy government in Spain has focused on budgetary austerity and structural reforms to stabilize the economy. Measures included cutting spending, reducing benefits, selling state-owned properties, and increasing taxes. Despite these efforts, the economy has shown strong recovery since 2015, with an average annual growth of 3.2% from 2015-2017 and an expected growth of 2.7% in 2018. Analysts believe Spain's austerity and reforms have been effective, with the budget deficit decreasing to 2.7% of GDP and borrowing costs improving. The Spanish government's fiscal policy loosened in 2018, increasing public pensions, social benefits, and investments while cutting income taxes. Catalonia and the Basque region have strong nationalist movements, with the Basque region historically affected by the separatist group ETA. In recent years, ETA, a separatist group in the Basque region, was weakened by arrests of key leaders and declared a cease-fire in 2011. All Basque nationalist parties have renounced violence in favor of pursuing independence through politics. In April 2017, ETA formally disarmed, handing over the locations of eight weapons caches to French authorities. Catalonia, a wealthy region in northeast Spain, has a population of approximately 7.45 million and accounts for one-fifth of the country's GDP. The independence movement in Catalonia continues to gain momentum. The independence movement in Catalonia has been fueled by economic arguments, with claims that Catalans unfairly support other regions in Spain. The regional government attempted a unilateral referendum on independence in October 2017, following previous plebiscites in 2014. The referendum had high support for independence, but the Spanish government disputes the economic claims. The independence movement in Catalonia has been driven by economic grievances, with claims of unfair financial support for other regions in Spain. Despite opposition from the Spanish government, Catalan leaders have pushed for independence, citing a coalition victory in the 2015 regional election as a mandate. Spain has consistently deemed independence referendums in Catalonia as illegal, citing the constitution's stance on the unity of the Spanish nation. The Spanish government opposes Catalonia's independence referendum, citing the constitution's unity of the Spanish nation. They argue that any agreement for a referendum would be illegal and unconstitutional, as it would require a change in the constitution. The government vowed to prevent the October 1, 2017 vote and took legal action against organizers. National police tried to disrupt the vote and seize ballots. On October 27, 2017, the Catalan parliament voted for independence with 70 in favor, 10 against, and 55 abstentions. The Spanish government invoked Article 155, dissolving the regional government and taking control of Catalonia's police force. The Spanish government invoked Article 155 to take control of Catalonia's police force after the region's independence vote. Catalan leaders fled to Brussels to avoid arrest on charges of rebellion and misuse of public funds, while others face similar charges in Spain. Spain's separatist crisis reached a stalemate after the Catalan parliament selected Quim Torra as the new regional president, a strong supporter of independence. Despite efforts by Spain to control the situation with Article 155 and prosecution of separatist leaders, the pro-independence movement remains strong. The separatist crisis in Spain has reached a stalemate, with court rulings affecting pro-independence forces. Internal divisions within pro-independence parties and challenges in convincing moderate Catalans are evident. Prime Minister S\u00e1nchez has taken a less confrontational approach, proposing a referendum on regional autonomy and engaging in dialogue with Torra. The regional government and central government are in dialogue to normalize relations. Critics of S\u00e1nchez's approach highlight his reliance on pro-independence Catalan parties for parliamentary support. Torres threatened to withdraw support unless a plan for regional independence was offered. The U.S. State Department initially refrained from taking a stance on Catalan separatism but later stated support for Spain's unity after the regional parliament's independence vote in 2017. The United States supports Spain's constitutional measures to maintain unity, as President Trump expressed during a press conference with Prime Minister Rajoy. EU officials have refrained from intervening in the Catalan separatist issue, considering it an internal matter for Spain. Independent Catalonia would need to reapply for EU membership with unanimous approval. In the past, Spain has been a base for Islamist extremists, with notable attacks like the 9/11 involvement and the 2004 Madrid train bombings. Cooperation with the United States on counterterrorism is strong. A 2017 terrorist attack in Barcelona by an Islamic State-inspired cell resulted in 14 deaths and over 100 injuries. Authorities arrested, shot, or killed all 12 members of the cell. The Barcelona terrorist cell, inspired by the Islamic State, had members born in Morocco. Spain and Morocco cooperate closely on counterterrorism, with Moroccan authorities supporting Spanish investigations. Spain has a low number of \"foreign fighters\" compared to other Western European countries. Spanish authorities estimate that around 150 Spanish nationals or residents, mostly Moroccan nationals, have traveled to conflict zones. Spanish police have conducted raids to dismantle jihadist recruiting networks in Ceuta, Melilla, and Madrid. From 2015 to 2017, 128 police operations were carried out against domestic terrorist networks, resulting in 242 arrests. Legislation was passed in 2015 to strengthen counterterrorism laws, criminalizing receiving terrorist training or participating in armed conflicts abroad, allowing for passport seizures, expulsion orders, reentry bans, and streamlined search warrants. The United States and Spain have close political and security cooperation, with Spain being a member of NATO since 1982. The Rajoy government maintained a low profile in international affairs but continued to support European integration and maintain strong ties with the United States and Central and South America. The government implemented reforms to improve terrorism-related prosecutions, including introducing reentry bans for extremists and streamlined search warrants for police. The PP-led government of Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar supported the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. During the Socialist-led government of Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, tensions with the U.S. arose over differences in approach to various issues. Prime Minister S\u00e1nchez is expected to maintain Spain's pro-EU stance and emphasize multilateral foreign policy cooperation through institutions like NATO and the United Nations. The PSOE supports maintaining U.S.-Spain defense cooperation and security ties. Spain plays a significant role in U.S. defense strategy in Europe and Africa through a bilateral Agreement on Defense Cooperation. The United States has access to Spanish military bases, including a naval base at Rota and an airbase at Mor\u00f3n. Increased U.S. presence at these bases in the last five years reversed a decade-long downsizing of U.S. forces in Spain. In 2011, the U.S., Spain, and NATO announced the deployment of four U.S. Aegis BMD-capable ships at Rota for missile defense in Europe. The ships' primary mission is to operate in the Mediterranean to help defend Europe. In 2015, the Spanish government approved a U.S. request to upgrade the basing agreement, making Mor\u00f3n the permanent task force headquarters for the Special-Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force Crisis Response-Africa (SPMAGTF-CR-AF). This allows a permanent U.S. military presence of up to 2,200 Marines in Mor\u00f3n, Spain. The basing agreement in Spain allows for a permanent U.S. military presence of up to 2,200 personnel, including SPMAGTF Marines and civilian staff, with the ability to surge deployment during contingency operations. The SPMAGTF's primary mission is to respond to security assistance calls at U.S. embassies in Africa, with additional missions such as evacuation, humanitarian assistance, and training with partner forces. Spain is actively involved in international security and peacekeeping operations with over 3,000 soldiers deployed in 17 missions as of March 2018. Spain's national police force deployed in 17 missions as of March 2018, including contributions to UN peacekeeping in Lebanon, the international coalition countering ISIS in Iraq and Syria, and NATO missions in Latvia. Spain also participates in various maritime security missions in the Mediterranean Sea, training missions in Mali and Somalia, and provides air transport for operations in Mali, Central African Republic, and the Sahel region. Additionally, Spain has deployed Patriot missiles to Turkey. Spain has deployed Patriot missiles to Turkey to guard against possible ballistic missile threats from Syria. The country's defense budget was negatively affected by economic difficulties, leading to considerable cuts in defense spending between 2009 and 2014. However, Spain has enacted modest annual increases to the defense budget since 2015. NATO reported Spain's defense expenditures for 2017 at $11.655 billion, which is below the 2% of GDP target set by NATO for its member states. Recent funding increases have been primarily directed to the Spanish navy. Recent funding increases have been directed largely to the Spanish navy, including plans for new submarines, frigates, patrol vessels, and marine helicopters. The Spanish army has reorganized its brigades for better deployability, focusing on mechanized formations and special operations forces. The Spanish air force is expecting the final six Eurofighter Typhoon combat aircraft. Spain is considering acquiring F-35As to replace its F-18 fleet, and also looking into purchasing F-35Bs for naval aviation capability. The economic relationship between the U.S. and Spain is significant, with U.S. FDI in Spain at $37.4 billion and Spanish FDI in the U.S. at $68.2 billion in 2016. Over 1,100 U.S. firms have subsidiaries in Spain, while more than 90 Spanish firms have affiliates in the U.S. U.S. goods exports to Spain in 2017 exceeded $11 billion. In 2017, U.S. goods exports to Spain were over $11 billion, while U.S. goods imports from Spain totaled about $15.66 billion. U.S. services exports to Spain were $6.8 billion in 2016, and U.S. services imports from Spain were $6.3 billion. A new protocol amending the U.S.-Spain bilateral tax treaty of 1990 was announced in 2013 to modernize the agreement and align it with U.S. treaties with other European countries. Ratification of the protocol is pending Senate approval."
