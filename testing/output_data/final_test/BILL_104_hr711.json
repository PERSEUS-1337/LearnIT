    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Crime Victims Restitution Act of 1995\" and includes provisions for the order of restitution. Section 3663 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to require courts to order restitution for victims of offenses. Restitution can also be ordered for individuals harmed by the defendant's unlawful conduct during the criminal episode or related unlawful activities. Additionally, minor corrections are made to wording in subsections regarding the practicality of restitution orders. The amendment to Section 3663 of title 18, United States Code requires courts to order restitution for victims of offenses. Restitution must be in the full amount of the victim's losses without considering the offender's economic circumstances or compensation received from insurance. Subsections (d), (e), (f), (g), and (h) are removed, and subsection (i) is redesignated as subsection (m). The court determines the amount of restitution owed to each victim and specifies the payment schedule based on the offender's financial resources, income, and obligations. Restitution can be made through a lump-sum payment, partial payments, or in-kind payments such as returning property or providing services to the victim. When multiple offenders contribute to a victim's loss, the court can make each offender responsible for full restitution or divide the liability based on their contribution and financial circumstances. If an offender causes losses to multiple victims, the court must order full restitution to each victim but can adjust payment schedules based on their economic situations. If a victim receives compensation from insurance or another source, restitution must be paid to the compensating party as ordered by the court. The restitution order ensures that victims receive full compensation before any payments are made to providers of compensation. Victims can still receive compensation from insurance or other sources until fully compensated by the restitution order. Any amount paid under the order is offset against future compensatory damages in federal or state civil proceedings. A restitution order mandates that all fines, penalties, costs, and restitution payments be made by the offender to an entity designated by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. The entity must track the offender's obligations and payment status. The court may stop recordkeeping if compliance with a restitution order cannot be enforced. Offenders must be notified when 90 days overdue, and money received must be disbursed in a specific sequence: penalty assessment, victim restitution, and other required payments. A restitution order is a lien against the offender's property and must be reported to the designated entity for address changes. Compliance with payment schedule is a condition of probation or release, failure to comply may result in probation revocation or other penalties. The court may enforce a restitution order by issuing a restraining order, ordering property sale, accepting a performance bond, or taking other actions to ensure compliance. Factors considered include the defendant's employment status, financial resources, and willfulness in failing to comply. The order can be enforced by the United States through fines collection methods or as a civil judgment, and by the victim named in the order. The court may enforce a restitution order through various means, including issuing a restraining order or ordering property sale. Factors such as the defendant's financial resources and willfulness in non-compliance are considered. The order can be enforced by the United States through fines collection methods or as a civil judgment, and by the victim named in the order. A victim or offender can petition the court to modify a restitution order based on changes in the offender's economic circumstances. SEC. 3. PROCEDURE FOR ISSUING ORDER OF RESTITUTION. Section 3664 of title 18, United States Code is amended to allow the court to order the probation service to gather information on victim loss, defendant's financial resources, needs, earning ability, and other relevant factors for sentencing purposes. The court may refer issues related to a proposed order of restitution to a magistrate or special master for recommendations, subject to the court's final decision."
