    "content": "The Act titled \"Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research Amendments Act of 2003\" retains the task force and amends scientific assessments and research plans. The Act \"Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research Amendments Act of 2003\" amends section 603 by requiring the Task Force to work with governments, industry, academic institutions, and non-governmental organizations to develop assessments and research plans. Scientific assessments of harmful algal blooms must be completed and submitted to the Committee on Science of the House of Representatives every 5 years. The Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research Amendments Act of 2003 mandates scientific assessments of harmful algal blooms in US coastal waters. The assessments will cover marine blooms initially and later include freshwater blooms, examining causes, consequences, economic costs, and policy options for prevention and mitigation. The Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research Amendments Act of 2003 requires scientific assessments of harmful algal blooms in freshwater locations to evaluate progress, needs, and coordination among Federal research programs. The Task Force must submit a scientific assessment of current knowledge about freshwater harmful algal blooms within 24 months of the Act's enactment. The Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research Amendments Act of 2003 mandates a scientific assessment of harmful algal blooms in freshwater locations, including the Great Lakes and estuaries. The assessment aims to understand the causes, consequences, and economic costs of these blooms, establish research priorities, and coordinate Federal efforts to better comprehend freshwater harmful algal blooms. The Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research Amendments Act of 2003 requires a national scientific research plan to reduce the impacts of harmful algal blooms on coastal ecosystems. The plan aims to develop prevention, control, and mitigation methods for freshwater harmful algal blooms, including in the Great Lakes and estuaries. The Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research Amendments Act of 2003 mandates a national research plan to address the impacts of harmful algal blooms on coastal ecosystems, public health, and the economy. The plan includes establishing priorities for a research program on prevention, control, and mitigation methods, improving coordination among federal agencies, and ensuring communication of research findings to relevant stakeholders. The Task Force is required to submit a scientific assessment of hypoxia in US coastal waters every 5 years, including the Great Lakes. The assessment will examine causes, consequences, and costs of hypoxia, evaluate policy actions, and assess progress and needs of Federal efforts. The Task Force is mandated to evaluate Federal research programs on hypoxia causes, characteristics, and impacts, recommend ways to fill modeling and monitoring gaps, and improve coordination among agencies. The Secretary of Commerce will conduct local and regional scientific assessments of hypoxia or harmful algal blooms in coordination with State, Indian tribe, and local governments upon request. The Secretary will conduct scientific assessments on hypoxia or harmful algal blooms in diverse locations with significant impacts. Findings will be communicated to relevant authorities and the public. The assessments will examine causes, consequences, costs, prevention methods, and ecological impacts. The Task Force will consider harmful algal blooms, their ecological and economic impacts, and other relevant topics. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Section 605 of the Act is amended to allocate specific amounts for fiscal years 2001, 2004, 2005, and 2006. This includes funding for research programs and other specified purposes. The Act is amended to allocate $3,000,000 for fiscal year 2005, and $3,000,000 for fiscal year 2006. Additionally, funding is allocated for the Monitoring and Event Response for Harmful Algal Blooms (MERHAB) project. The Act is amended to allocate $3,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2004, 2005, and 2006 for activities described in section 603(f)."
