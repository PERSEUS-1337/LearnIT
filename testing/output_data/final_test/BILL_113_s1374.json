Congress finds that consumption of traditional foods, such as wild salmon and berries, benefits health and well-being, especially among Alaska Natives. These foods have been shown to have a positive impact on health, with local sources being fresher and more nutrient-rich. Providing access to traditional foods in food service programs promotes healthier lifestyles and aids in the healing process for patients. Expanding traditional food options to school systems can promote cultural education and increase demand for local produce, leading to economic stimulation. Local food donations can also lower the cost of meal programs in schools, resulting in more financial stability. The Act aims to provide access to traditional foods in food service programs, encouraging increased consumption and bringing communities together. It also supports hunters by allowing them to donate edible meat to food programs. The Act aims to provide access to traditional foods in food service programs to decrease health disparities among Indians, particularly Alaska Natives, and offer alternative food options. SEC. 4.
