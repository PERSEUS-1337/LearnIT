    "content": "Almost 30 years ago, Congress mandated the federal collection of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and high-level waste for safe disposal. The Department of Energy (DOE) was authorized to enter contracts with nuclear power providers to gather and dispose of SNF in exchange for payments into the Nuclear Waste Fund. However, DOE breached these contracts over 10 years ago by failing to begin disposal by the required deadline, leading to billions spent by nuclear utilities on temporary storage. The breach of contract by the DOE for the collection and disposal of toxic SNF has led to numerous lawsuits by nuclear power providers, resulting in over $2 billion in damage awards and settlements. The potential liability incurred by the DOE from nuclear waste contract litigation is estimated to exceed $20 billion. The Obama Administration has halted funding for the Yucca Mountain repository project and closed the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management. The Obama Administration halted funding for the Yucca Mountain repository project and closed the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management. The Department of Energy (DOE) has attempted to withdraw the Yucca Mountain construction authorization license and established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future to explore alternative disposal options for spent nuclear fuel (SNF). Ongoing litigation over the government's obligations to collect and dispose of SNF under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) has resulted in significant contract damages. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 centralized the management of nuclear waste, making the federal government responsible for its disposal. The Act established a system for selecting a geologic repository for nuclear waste. The report will discuss legal issues arising from waste storage contract litigation and potential liability from delays in waste disposal. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 authorized the DOE to develop a permanent nuclear waste repository funded by commercial nuclear power owners. The Act allowed the federal government to enter contracts with private nuclear facilities for waste disposal. Section 302 of the Act sets a critical deadline for the Secretary to take possession of high-level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 authorized the DOE to develop a permanent nuclear waste repository funded by commercial nuclear power owners. The Act allowed the federal government to enter contracts with private nuclear facilities for waste disposal. Section 302 of the Act sets a critical deadline for the Secretary to take possession of high-level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel. In an effort to streamline the collection and disposal process, the DOE created a \"Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and/or High Level Radioactive Waste\" for use with nuclear power providers. The final contract, published in the Federal Register, modified the language of the NWPA and established fees for disposal services. After facility operations begin, disposal of SNF must start by January 31, 1998 and continue until all waste is disposed of. Nuclear utility providers had to sign the Standard Contract to renew their operating license. DOE identified potential repository sites, with Yucca Mountain chosen in 1987 as the sole candidate site. Amendments to the NWPA were made in 1987 to designate Yucca Mountain, despite lobbying from Washington and Texas delegations. The DOE selection and approval process for the Yucca Mountain facility, strongly lobbied for by Washington and Texas, continued as outlined under the NWPA. By 1993, little progress had been made in preparing to take possession of SNF, with completion of the facility at least a decade away. Concerns arose regarding DOE's ability to meet contractual obligations by January 1998, prompting nuclear utilities to request an update on DOE's preparedness. DOE initially stated that its contractual obligations were not triggered until the permanent repository was complete, leading to an interpretive dispute. DOE issued a \"Final Interpretation of Nuclear Waste Acceptance Issues\" stating it had no legal obligation to begin disposal of SNF by January 31, 1998, without a repository. The department also clarified it lacked authority to provide interim storage for spent nuclear fuel. The nuclear utility companies challenged DOE's interpretation of its obligations under the NWPA and the Standard Contract, leading to ongoing litigation for the past 15 years. Legal questions have arisen due to the complex relationship between the NWPA and the Standard Contract, with DOE initially arguing no obligations without a permanent repository. The DOE was found to be in partial breach of contract for delaying the collection of nuclear utilities' SNF, leading to ongoing litigation with approximately 78 lawsuits filed. The courts ruled that the lack of a permanent repository does not excuse the DOE from liability for the delay. The DOE's liability for the collection and disposal of SNF amounts to over $2 billion, with the majority of lawsuits still pending. Key court decisions have emerged from the contractual dispute between DOE and nuclear power utilities, with the first NWPA-related claim filed in 1996. The D.C. Circuit invalidated DOE's interpretation in Indiana Michigan Power Co. v. Department of Energy. The court invalidated DOE's interpretation of the NWPA, stating that the obligation to \"dispose\" of nuclear waste under Section 302(B) had no limitations and must begin by January 31, 1998. The court rejected the argument that taking title to nuclear waste and disposing of it must be read together. The court concluded that the NWPA and Standard Contract created a binding contractual relationship between DOE and nuclear utilities for waste disposal. DOE delayed compliance with the deadline, citing the need for Yucca Mountain Project results, with a potential opening by 2010. The DOE informed nuclear utilities it couldn't meet the January 31, 1998, deadline due to the lack of a permanent repository at Yucca Mountain, citing it as an \"unavoidable delay\" under the Standard Contract. DOE argued it wasn't liable for any monetary damages resulting from the delay, as per the contract terms. The nuclear utilities requested a writ of mandamus to compel DOE to accept nuclear waste for disposal, but the court refused, stating that the utilities must first pursue administrative remedies. The court rejected DOE's argument that the lack of an operational repository was an unavoidable delay. The court rejected DOE's \"unavoidable delay\" defense regarding the disposal of SNF, issuing a writ of mandamus to compel DOE to begin disposal by January 31, 1998, despite the lack of an operational repository. The DOE challenged the D.C. Circuit's authority in response to the Northern States mandamus, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction to interpret the unavoidable delays clause of the Standard Contract. The D.C. Circuit denied the motion for rehearing, stating that it was enforcing a statutory duty, not adjudicating a contractual dispute. DOE interpreted the mandamus as prohibiting them from using the unavoidable delay clause as a defense in future litigation. Many nuclear utilities waited for the January 31, 1998 deadline before seeking monetary relief. Nuclear utilities waited until the January 31, 1998 deadline to file monetary claims in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The court had to determine if they were required to exhaust administrative remedies before seeking judicial relief under the Standard Contract. In an important 2000 case, the Federal Circuit concluded that adequate relief was not available to nuclear utilities under the Standard Contract, allowing breach of contract claims against DOE to proceed in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. DOE argued that the \"avoidable delays\" clause in the contract could provide administrative relief in lieu of the \"unavoidable delay\" clause. The court ruled that the \"avoidable delay\" provision in the Standard Contract only applied to routine delays, not breaches of critical obligations. Relief in the form of a \"charge or schedule adjustment\" was deemed inadequate to compensate nuclear utilities for damages incurred. This decision allowed signatories to seek monetary damages against DOE for breach of contract in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit invalidated a contractual modification between DOE and utilities regarding the Nuclear Waste Fund, allowing utilities to seek monetary damages for breach of contract in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The U.S. Court of Appeals invalidated a contractual modification between DOE and Exelon Generation Company, stating that using Nuclear Waste Fund (NWF) for on-site \"interim storage\" was not allowed under the NWPA. DOE cannot use NWF funds to offset costs of failing to dispose of nuclear waste, as it would be like paying for its own breach using utilities' funds. The court's strict interpretation prohibits DOE from using NWF funds for anything other than building a permanent repository. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that DOE cannot use Nuclear Waste Fund (NWF) for anything other than building a permanent repository. Litigation has been necessary to determine damages for breach of contract by DOE, with options for full breach or partial breach claims. Successful full breach claims discharge contractual obligations, while partial breach claims preserve the contract relationship and allow for recovery of costs. The nuclear utilities have pursued breach of contract claims under a partial breach theory, allowing for recovery of costs incurred between awareness of breach and trial date. The non-breaching party must choose between continuing the contract in hope of performance or ending it entirely. The availability of a full breach claim to discharge contractual obligations is doubted by the CFC and Federal Circuit. The courts have discussed the implications of discharging contractual obligations for nuclear utilities, noting that it could lead to the loss of operating licenses and other consequences. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) makes the Department of Energy (DOE) the exclusive collector of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) from utilities, prohibiting them from seeking alternative disposal methods. Utilities are required to pay for the disposal of SNF, and breaching this duty could result in the loss of operating licenses. The Federal Circuit has upheld that utilities cannot sue for full breach, and many utilities oppose voiding the Standard Contract due to regulatory risks. The nuclear utilities face substantial regulatory risks and responsibility for disposing of their own spent nuclear fuel. They have been pursuing claims for partial breach to avoid losing the benefit of government disposal. The Federal Circuit has upheld the obligation for utilities to pay into the Nuclear Waste Fund and for the DOE to collect and dispose of SNF. Utilities have no choice but to hold the government to the terms of the Standard Contract while suing for partial breach. In August 2008, the Federal Circuit clarified the method for calculating damages in NWPA breach of contract suits by establishing a rate at which DOE was expected to accept SNF under the Standard Contract. The court rejected DOE's argument for a lower rate from a 1991 report, instead holding that damages would be based on the higher 1987 acceptance rate, which reflected the parties' original intent. Nuclear utilities have successfully recovered expenses incurred in mitigation of DOE's breach by developing, implementing, and maintaining on-site interim SNF storage. Damages are limited to costs incurred from the date the utility became aware of the breach to the date of trial, with no recovery for future damages. The Court of Federal Claims has been entertaining breach of contract suits filed by nuclear utilities against DOE since 1998. In 2005, the Court of Federal Claims dismissed a NWPA breach of contract suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, citing the Standard Contract as a final agency action under U.S. courts of appeals' jurisdiction. The dismissal was appealed to the Federal Circuit, which reversed the decision in PSEG Nuclear v. U.S. The lower court's decision held that the CFC still had jurisdiction over contract disputes under the NWPA. The court clarified that CFC jurisdiction was only precluded for official agency actions under the NWPA, not breach of contract claims. This ruling confirmed CFC's authority to handle NWPA-related breach of contract claims, but the question of whether the D.C. Circuit's previous jurisdiction over similar claims infringed on CFC's jurisdiction remained unresolved. The CFC's jurisdiction over contract disputes under the NWPA was confirmed. DOE sought to invalidate the D.C. Circuit's jurisdiction in Indiana Michigan. The CFC entertained the issue of DOE's \"unavoidable delay\" defense, which the D.C. Circuit had prohibited. The CFC voided the D.C. Circuit's longstanding mandamus, ruling it had exceeded its jurisdiction. The CFC held that the D.C. Circuit exceeded its jurisdiction in the Indiana Michigan decision, voiding the mandamus prohibiting DOE's use of the \"unavoidable delay\" defense. The court's decision was based on jurisdictional conclusions, the limited scope of the NWPA, and the absence of a waiver of sovereign immunity. Nebraska Public Power focused on classifying claims under the NWPA and Standard Contract as either formal agency action or breach of contract within the CFC's exclusive jurisdiction. The CFC in Nebraska Public Power clarified that claims related to the January 31, 1998, statutory deadline were contract claims under its exclusive jurisdiction. The court adopted reasoning from PSEG to establish exclusive jurisdiction over cases involving the Standard Contract, resolving competing claims to jurisdiction. The D.C. Circuit's Northern States mandamus was based on Section 119, granting exclusive jurisdiction over final agency action under Title I of the NWPA. The Federal Circuit limited the scope of Section 119 to claims related to establishing a permanent repository for spent nuclear fuel. The CFC in Nebraska Public Power applied this limitation to cases like Indiana Michigan, which exceeded the D.C. Circuit's jurisdiction under Section 119. The court clarified that the Northern States mandamus was not based on a statutory breach, but on contract claims within the CFC's exclusive jurisdiction. The court determined that the actions brought by nuclear utilities were contractual in nature and fell within the jurisdiction of the CFC. The D.C. Circuit interpreted the claims in Indiana Michigan and Northern States as contractual, emphasizing reliance on the Standard Contract, breach of contract claims, and requests for monetary damages. The dispute in Northern States was seen as contained within the terms of the contract rather than a conflict with the NWPA. The CFC held that the D.C. Circuit's interpretation of the Standard Contract intruded on its exclusive jurisdiction. The D.C. Circuit's decisions were not supported by a waiver of sovereign immunity, as jurisdiction alone does not constitute a waiver. The court found no express waiver in the NWPA for the case to proceed. The court found no express waiver in the NWPA for the case to proceed, as the D.C. Circuit had relied on Section 702 of the APA for a waiver of sovereign immunity. However, the CFC determined that the APA waiver was not applicable as the nuclear utilities had an adequate remedy in the CFC under the Tucker Act. The Federal Circuit rejected the notion that the limitation on available remedies made relief impossible. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected the idea that limitations on remedies in the CFC made relief inadequate. Without a valid waiver of sovereign immunity, the D.C. Circuit's decision in Indiana Michigan was deemed void, rendering the mandamus in Northern States also void. The court ordered parties to brief whether DOE's delay in disposing of SNF was excused by the \"unavoidable delay\" clause. Nebraska Power appealed to the Federal Circuit, which ordered an en banc rehearing. The court asked if the mandamus in Northern States prevents DOE from using the \"unavoidable delay\" defense. The Federal Circuit upheld the D.C. Circuit's jurisdiction in Indiana Michigan and Northern States, rejecting the CFC's major jurisdictional determinations. The court interpreted Section 119 of the NWPA more broadly, affirming the D.C. Circuit's mandamus prohibiting DOE's use of the \"unavoidable delay\" defense. The Federal Circuit interpreted Section 119 of the NWPA broadly, granting federal appellate courts jurisdiction over claims related to the statutory deadline in Title III. This included claims regarding DOE's failure to begin accepting SNF by the deadline of January 31, 1998. The court found that the physical separation of the deadline from the judicial review provision was not indicative of different standards for review. The Federal Circuit interpreted Section 119 of the NWPA broadly, granting jurisdiction over claims related to the statutory deadline. The court held that the APA waived sovereign immunity for claims arising from the NWPA deadline, disagreeing with the CFC's interpretation of Section 704 of the APA. The APA allows judicial review for \"agency action made reviewable by statute\" and \"final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.\" This includes \"special statutory review\" and \"nonstatutory review\" cases where no review of agency action has been granted by statute. The Federal Circuit interpreted Section 119 of the NWPA broadly, granting jurisdiction over claims related to the statutory deadline. The court held that the APA waived sovereign immunity for claims arising from the NWPA deadline, disagreeing with the CFC's interpretation of Section 704 of the APA. The court distinguished between cases where no review of agency action has been granted by statute and where there is \"no other adequate remedy at law.\" The court concluded that the limitation of \"no other adequate remedy\" applied only to nonstatutory review of agency action. The Federal Circuit also held that the D.C. Circuit's mandamus in Northern States did not encroach upon the CFC's exclusive jurisdiction over the adjudication and interpretation of contract rights. The D.C. Circuit and Federal Circuit interpreted the NWPA broadly, enforcing DOE's statutory duties and prohibiting the use of the \"unavoidable delay\" defense in the Standard Contract. The Federal Circuit's decision extinguished DOE's attempt to escape liability through the contract clause. The Federal Circuit's decision in Southern Nuclear clarified the scope of the Northern States mandamus, prohibiting the government from using the \"unavoidable delay\" clause as a defense in the Standard Contract. This has led to confusion and contradictory opinions in the CFC regarding liability and recoverable damages in litigation under the Standard Contract. The court clarified that the mandamus does not prevent the government from raising the unavoidable delay clause in the damages context, but it does prohibit interpreting the Standard Contract in a way that goes against the agency's duty to collect nuclear waste. The D.C. Circuit clarified that while the mandamus does not prevent the government from using the unavoidable delay clause as a defense to damages, it does not allow for interpretations of the Standard Contract that contradict the agency's responsibility to manage nuclear waste. The Federal Circuit's Southern Nuclear opinion has sparked debate on the application of unavoidable delays. The Federal Circuit's Southern Nuclear opinion has led to conflicting interpretations in the Court of Federal Claims regarding the government's use of the unavoidable delay clause in defense to damages. In Rochester Gas and Elec. Corp. v. U.S., the court allowed the government to assert the unavoidable delays clause in opposition to a demand for damages, but did not reach a decision on the defense's merits. In Portland General Elec. Co. v. U.S., the court seemed to accept the principles outlined in the Southern Nuclear opinion. In U.S., the Court of Federal Claims considered the government's use of the unavoidable delay clause in defense to damages. The opinion rejected the argument as the clause had no independent application to the determination of damages. Judge Edward Damich in Entergy Nuclear Fitzpatrick v. U.S. disagreed with the Southern Nuclear decision, finding it contradictory to previous rulings. The court found Southern Nuclear's interpretation of the unavoidable delay clause to be at odds with previous rulings. Judge Damich certified the question for direct appeal to the Federal Circuit, where a decision could potentially allow the government to use the unavoidable delay clause as a defense to certain damages. The court found the argument of using the unavoidable delay clause as a defense to damages unsatisfactory. The total costs for delays in performing on the Standard Contract are hard to predict, with potential damages close to $20.8 billion if the government can start accepting SNF by 2020, which is unlikely due to the termination of the Yucca Mountain project. The Administration's decision to terminate the Yucca Mountain project has led to approximately $500 million in additional legal damages accumulating each year beyond 2020 for DOE. The Department of Justice has spent over $192 million on litigation expenses, while nuclear utilities face $5-7 million in costs per case. Settlement agreements have been reached with some utilities operating 65 out of 118 nuclear facilities covered by the Standard Contract to mitigate damages. The Standard Contract allows contract parties to submit annual reimbursement claims to DOE for delay-related nuclear waste storage costs. DOE has paid approximately $725 million under these settlements. The Department of Justice is in discussions with the nuclear industry to reach a standard settlement with more utilities. Legal questions related to the Standard Contract have been resolved, making the success of claims more predictable for both the government and utilities. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has suggested establishing an administrative claims process for ongoing nuclear waste litigation to reduce expenses for both the government and utilities. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended resolving lawsuits through settlement agreements or alternative processes like mediation. Despite unresolved issues with spent nuclear fuel storage, the Obama Administration has shown a commitment to investing in domestic nuclear power. President Obama has committed to investing in domestic nuclear power, advocating for new clean energy jobs and the construction of safe, clean nuclear power plants. In 2010, he announced government approval of an $8.3 billion loan guarantee for two new reactors in Georgia, the first in over 30 years. In his 2011 State of the Union address, he called for nuclear power to contribute to a national goal of 80% clean energy by 2035. The Department of Energy has developed a new waste disposal contract in preparation for new reactors. The Department of Energy has developed a new waste disposal contract for nuclear waste, including spent nuclear fuel (SNF) from commercial power plants and defense-related nuclear waste. The contract allows for a 20-year delay in completing SNF disposal after a new reactor's operating license expires. This could result in $20.8 billion in damages from delays in waste disposal. The Yucca Mountain facility was intended to store both commercial and defense-related nuclear waste. The majority of the nation's defense waste, including high level liquid waste from the Manhattan Project, is stored in federal facilities in Washington, South Carolina, and Idaho. States have agreements with DOE for waste removal, with Idaho requiring dry storage by 2023 and waste removal by 2035. Failure to meet the deadline could result in penalties of up to $60,000 a day. The federal government faces future financial penalties and potential damages from litigation related to the NWPA. The federal government faces contract litigation related to the NWPA, leading to substantial legal costs. The Department of Justice requested $11.4 million in its FY2011 budget for defense against NWPA suits, adding 10 new attorneys for anticipated trials. Litigation expenses and damages awards are expected to increase with no resolution in sight for storing SNF."
