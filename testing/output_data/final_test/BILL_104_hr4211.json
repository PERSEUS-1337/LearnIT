    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Florida Wetlands Mitigation Banking Study Act of 1996\". Mitigation banking is a central premise of Federal wetlands programs, providing flexibility, efficiency, and environmental advantages in offsetting wetland losses through restoration, enhancement, creation, and preservation. Mitigation banking offers environmental advantages by consolidating compensatory mitigation, pooling resources, reducing processing times, improving oversight, and contributing to the goal of no net loss of wetlands. Florida has a well-developed regulatory framework for mitigation banks, ensuring their success and perpetual protection. This has led to the successful establishment of several mitigation banks in the state. A study of the authorization and use of mitigation banks in Florida is necessary to determine if further Federal legislation or administrative action is needed to encourage their establishment and ensure their success and perpetual protection. SEC. 3. MITIGATION BANKING STUDY. The Secretary of the Army will conduct a study on mitigation banking in Florida to assess its potential and issues. A report on the study's results will be submitted to the President and relevant Senate and House committees by July 1, 1997. Consultation with various agencies like the EPA, NRCS, FWS, and NMFS will be done during the study. The Secretary of the Army will conduct a study on mitigation banking in Florida involving various agencies like the EPA, NRCS, FWS, and NMFS. The study will address the need for Federal legislation to promote responsible establishment, use, and perpetual protection of mitigation banks. The study on mitigation banking in Florida will cover the authorization, legal restrictions, financial responsibility, evaluation of wetland areas, use of mitigation credits, and establishment of service areas for mitigation banks. The report will address the establishment of mitigation banks, their relationship to public acquisition or restoration programs, siting considerations for compatibility with adjacent land uses, coordination of Federal and State authorizations, and public comment opportunities before submission. The Secretary will solicit comments on the report from other States by submitting it to the Interstate Counsel on Water Policy for comment."
