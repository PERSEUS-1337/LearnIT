    "content": "The \"Protect Children from Theft Act of 2017\" introduces additional protections for credit reports of minor consumers under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The \"Protect Children from Theft Act of 2017\" mandates consumer reporting agencies to create blocked files for minor consumers upon request by a covered guardian. The Bureau will establish procedures for proper identification of the guardian and minor, file creation or conversion, and unblocking. The \"Protect Children from Theft Act of 2017\" requires consumer reporting agencies to create blocked files for minor consumers upon request by a covered guardian. A consumer reporting agency must unblock a file upon request by a covered guardian or on the minor consumer's 18th birthday. An alert statement must be included in a file unblocked for a minor consumer who was a victim of fraud or identity theft before their 18th birthday. The Bureau determines fees for creating, converting, or unblocking files for minor consumers. Consumer reporting agencies cannot charge fees for victims of fraud or identity theft before turning 18. Resellers must include alert statements in information for consumers with blocked files. The section outlines exceptions for consumer reporting agencies regarding access to blocked files by law enforcement agencies. It also defines an alert statement as a notification for potential fraud or identity theft victims on consumer reports. The term 'blocked file' refers to a file of a minor consumer maintained by a consumer reporting agency, containing specific information and blocked from providing consumer reports without permission from a covered guardian. A 'covered guardian' is defined as the legal guardian or custodian of a minor child. The Fair Credit Reporting Act defines a 'minor consumer' as an individual under 18 years of age. The Act also specifies that a covered guardian can access a blocked file containing information on a minor consumer. The Fair Credit Reporting Act provides additional protections for credit reports of minor consumers under section 605C."
