    "content": "The Act titled \"Law Enforcement Officers Equity Act\" includes certain positions within the definition of law enforcement officer for retirement purposes. The \"Law Enforcement Officers Equity Act\" amends the Federal Employees Retirement System to include employees involved in investigating or apprehending individuals suspected of criminal offenses and authorized to carry firearms, as well as employees of the Internal Revenue Service primarily responsible for collecting delinquent taxes. The \"Law Enforcement Officers Equity Act\" expands the Federal Employees Retirement System to cover employees involved in investigating criminal offenses, collecting delinquent taxes, and employees authorized to carry firearms. It includes employees of the United States Postal Inspection Service and Department of Veterans Affairs who are police officers. Amendments are made to include these employees in the retirement system. The amendments in the \"Law Enforcement Officers Equity Act\" extend coverage under the Federal Employees Retirement System to include employees engaged in law enforcement activities. This includes individuals appointed as law enforcement officers under specific sections of the United States Code, as amended by the Act. The provisions also apply to current employees meeting certain criteria outlined in the Act. SEC. 3. INCUMBENT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. Service performed by an incumbent on or after the date of the enactment of this Act is treated as service performed as a law enforcement officer under specific sections of title 5, United States Code. Service performed before the enactment can also be treated as law enforcement service if a written election is submitted to the Office of Personnel Management within 5 years. An incumbent can make an election under subsection (a)(2) to pay a deposit for prior service performed, equal to the difference in deductions that would have been made if the amendments had been in effect during that prior service. An incumbent can elect to pay a deposit for prior service to make up for deductions that would have been made if the amendments were in effect during that time. If the full deposit is not paid, prior service remains creditable but the resulting annuity will be reduced. If an incumbent elects to pay a deposit for prior service, the employing agency must remit an amount to the Office equal to the difference in government contributions that would have been paid if the amendments were in effect during that service. Government contributions under this subsection are to be made ratably over a 10-year period for law enforcement officers, exempting them from mandatory separation for 3 years. The Office will not enforce mandatory separation for law enforcement officers for 3 years after the enactment of this Act. Regulations will be established for survivor annuities and reemployed annuitants. Definitions include the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund and the term \"incumbent\" for law enforcement officers appointed before the Act's enactment. The term \"law enforcement officer\" in this Act refers to an individual who meets specific requirements under title 5 of the United States Code. The term \"prior service\" pertains to service performed before retirement deductions begin. The term \"service\" specifically relates to service as a law enforcement officer."
