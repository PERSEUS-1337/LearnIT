    "content": "SECTION 1. NONREFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR ENERGY EFFICIENT TIRES. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section for energy efficient tires. A credit of $15 per qualified energy efficient tire purchased by an individual taxpayer for personal use and placed in service during the taxable year is allowed against the tax imposed. Qualified tires must be certified as energy efficient and not purchased for resale. The credit allowed under subsection (a) for any taxable year is limited by the regular tax liability plus the tax imposed by section 55, minus the credits allowable under this subpart and section 27. Unused credit can be carried forward in certain cases. The excess credit from one taxable year can be carried forward to the next year and added to the allowable credit for that year. Section 23 and 25D are amended to include section 25E. Section 25E is added to various sections of the Code, including 24(b)(3)(B), 25(e)(1)(C), 25D(c), 904(i), and 1400C(d). The Code is amended by adding section 25E to various sections, including 24(b)(3)(B), 25(e)(1)(C), 25D(c), 904(i), and 1400C(d). Additionally, section 25D is revised by inserting 25E in place of 25D in certain paragraphs. The amendments made by section 25E apply to property placed in service after December 31, 2006. Energy efficient tire labeling is addressed in section 2. The Secretary will establish a system for labeling tires based on energy efficiency, with criteria for certifying replacement tires as energy efficient. The main factor for certification is achieving a rolling resistance coefficient at least 10% lower than the average among comparable replacement passenger car tires. The regulations require passenger car tires to meet specific criteria to be certified as energy efficient, including minimum grades for traction, treadwear, and temperature, as well as a speed rating above S or T. The terms \"uniform tire quality grade\" and \"rolling resistance coefficient\" are defined in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's regulations. The term 'rolling resistance coefficient' is defined as the rolling resistance force divided by the wheel load, as determined by specific tests. 'Replacement passenger car tires' refer to passenger car tires that are not original equipment included by the vehicle manufacturer."
