    "content": "SECTION 1. USE OF SAFETY BELTS AND CHILD RESTRAINT SYSTEMS BY CHILDREN. The text introduces a new section in the United States Code regarding the use of safety belts and child restraint systems by children. It defines terms such as child safety restraint law and child safety seat. The law prohibits driving a passenger vehicle with a child under 16 without a properly fastened safety belt, unless the child is under 9 and secured in a child safety seat. The term 'child safety seat' refers to a specially designed seating system that meets federal safety standards and is affixed to a motor vehicle. The term 'motor vehicle' is defined as a vehicle designed for use on public streets, roads, and highways, excluding vehicles operated on rail lines. A 'multipurpose passenger vehicle' is a motor vehicle with certain characteristics. A 'multipurpose passenger vehicle' is a motor vehicle designed to carry up to 10 individuals, constructed on a truck chassis or with features for occasional off-road use. It is different from a 'passenger car' which is also designed to carry up to 10 individuals. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for occupant restraint systems in passenger motor vehicles to meet Federal motor vehicle safety standards. It also mentions the transfer of funds to states for implementing child and passenger protection education programs if they have not enacted a child safety restraint law by a certain date. The curr_chunk discusses the promotion of child and passenger safety through education programs on proper seating positions and the use of child restraint systems. If a state has not enacted a child safety restraint law by specific dates in 2006 and 2007, funds will be transferred to implement these programs. If a state has not enacted a child safety restraint law by specific dates in 2006 and 2007, funds will be transferred to implement education programs on proper seating positions and the use of child restraint systems. The Secretary will transfer a percentage of funds apportioned to the state under certain sections to be used for this purpose. The Federal share of project costs transferred under subsection (b) is 100 percent. The amount transferred may be derived from various apportionments of the State. If funds are transferred to a State under section 402, obligation authority will also be transferred for Federal-aid projects. The amount of obligation authority distributed to the State for Federal-aid highways and highway safety construction programs is determined by multiplying the funds transferred under section 402 by the ratio of the distributed obligation authority to the total apportioned sums for the fiscal year. The obligation authority for Federal-aid highways and highway safety construction programs for the fiscal year is determined by multiplying funds transferred under section 402 by the ratio of distributed obligation authority to total apportioned sums. No limitation on obligations for highway safety programs under section 402 applies to funds transferred to a State under this section. The use of safety belts and child restraint systems by children is mandated."
