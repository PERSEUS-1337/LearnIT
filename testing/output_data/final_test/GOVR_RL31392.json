Instead of allowing taxation, Congress has implemented payment programs like Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) administered by the Department of the Interior to compensate for lost tax revenue. The Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program, administered by the Department of the Interior, compensates for lost tax revenue on federal lands, including those in the National Park System, Bureau of Land Management, and certain other designated areas. Military lands, Department of Energy lands, and lands under the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act have their own payment programs. The Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program covers federal lands excluding those under the Department of Energy, NASA, and Homeland Security. In FY2016, it encompassed 606.9 million acres, compensating local governments for nontaxable federal lands. The program was established in 1976 to provide compensation as federal policy shifted towards retaining lands instead of disposing them. The Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program addresses concerns about federal lands generating uneven revenues for local governments. It authorizes federal payments to compensate for nontaxable lands, with funds available for any governmental use. Specific issues covered include payments for Indian lands and tax equivalency for urban lands. Critics point out inconsistencies, such as counties receiving large payments from other federal programs also getting a minimum payment from PILT. Certain lands, including Fish and Wildlife Service acquired lands, are not eligible for PILT payments, disadvantaging counties in the East and Midwest. The Secure Rural Schools program requires an offset in the next year's PILT payment for Forest Service lands, but not for Bureau of Land Management lands. Oregon and California Grant Lands receive payments without offsets. The Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program provides payments to counties with federal lands, but there are disparities in payment amounts and some counties still face financial challenges. Consensus on changes to the PILT law has been difficult due to the complexity of federal land management policies and issues such as payment levels and inflation erosion. Despite some fluctuations in funding, PILT payments have generally been appropriated in full until the mid-1990s. The Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program, established under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, saw a major increase in appropriations from FY1993 to FY2017. Despite growing authorization levels, appropriations did not increase proportionally, leading to frustration among local governments and calls for increased funding. Since FY1993, the Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program has seen increasing appropriations. Congress made changes to funding, including mandatory spending from FY2008 onwards. The 110th Congress enacted funding changes, with the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 mandating full authorized payments for five years. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act extended mandatory spending to FY2013. The Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program saw increased appropriations since FY1993, with mandatory spending extended to FY2013. Under the Budget Control Act, PILT faced a 5.1% sequestration in FY2013. Congress had to decide on funding for FY2014, either through appropriations constrained by limits or as mandatory spending with budget rules requiring offsets. Failure to find an offset would result in procedural hurdles. The Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program faced hurdles in funding for FY2014, with options for appropriations or mandatory spending. Funding was eventually included in the Agricultural Act of 2014, providing county governments with payments in 2014 and 2015. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, allocated $372 million in discretionary spending for PILT. The Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act included a provision for $70 million in mandatory spending for PILT. The Continuing Appropriations Act of 2016 clarified that the October payment was a supplement for FY2015. Through sequestration, the additional $37 million was reduced by 6.8%, bringing the FY2015 total to $439.5 million. PILT payments for FY2016 were included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2016. For FY2016, PILT payments were provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2016 (P.L. 114-113, Division G), with $452.0 million allocated, covering 98.3% of the full payment. In FY2017, PILT payments were included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2017 (P.L. 115-31), with $465.0 million allocated, covering 99.7% of the full payment. Calculating county PILT payments involves factors like eligible land acres, county population, previous year's payments, and state laws on payment distribution. The PILT payments for federal lands are distributed to entities like school districts instead of county governments. The categories of federal lands eligible for PILT payments are specified in the law. The PILT payments for federal lands are distributed to entities like school districts instead of county governments. Eligible lands include those within the Fort Carson military reservation, semi-active or inactive Army installations, lands acquired under specific acts, and certain exceptions for lands exempt from real estate taxes. The Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program distributes payments for federal lands to entities like school districts instead of county governments. Only specific categories of lands are eligible for PILT payments, with a ceiling payment based on population. Counties with lower populations receive higher payments per person compared to populous counties. The Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program distributes payments for federal lands based on population. Counties with lower populations receive higher payments per person. The maximum PILT payment per person is capped, regardless of the county's actual population size. Federal lands vary in revenue production, with some generating significant revenue from activities like timber sales or recreation concessions. The Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program distributes payments for federal lands based on population, with lower population counties receiving higher payments per person. The program includes an offset provision where previous year's payments from specific federal lands are subtracted from the following year's PILT payment to prevent disparities. This offset provision, known as the standard rate, decreases the PILT payment dollar-for-dollar as other agency payments increase. The Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program ensures each county with eligible lands receives a payment, even if other federal payments exceed a certain level. Once other agency payments reach a threshold, the PILT payment remains fixed at a minimum rate. Any additional payments beyond those specified do not affect future PILT payments. Other payment programs beyond those specified in Table A-3 do not impact later PILT payments. Some agencies, like the National Park Service and Army Corps of Engineers, have no payment programs affecting PILT. Counties may receive payments above the calculated amount, depending on state law. In pass-through states, payments from federal land agencies may go to another entity, like a local school district, without affecting county PILT payments the following year. According to DOI, only Federal land payments actually received by units of government in the prior fiscal year are deducted from PILT payments. If a unit passes payments to independent school districts or special purpose districts as required by State law, those payments are not deducted from the Section 6902 payment. This means that if a state requires counties to pass along federal land payments to local school boards, those amounts are not deducted from the counties' PILT payments for the following year. State #1 pays the PILT amount directly to the local school board, while State #2 does not. This results in State #1 increasing total revenue for the state and counties, while State #2 sees a $2,000 drop in PILT payment to the county. Governors must report payments to each county annually to the Secretary of the Interior, who cross-checks the records. There is a pass-through option for the PILT payment itself, allowing states to require counties to pass payments to local school boards without deduction from PILT payments. To date, Wisconsin is the only state to have elected to pass through PILT payments. The 1994 amendments to PILT adjusted authorization levels for inflation, with rates and payment ceilings adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index. The 1994 amendments to PILT adjusted authorization levels for inflation, with rates and payment ceilings adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index. Increases in authorization do not always lead to a corresponding increase in funds received by counties. Payment calculations for counties involve determining the county's eligible acreage multiplied by $2.66 per acre or the county's ceiling payment based on its population, choosing the lesser of the two numbers, and subtracting the previous year's total payments for eligible lands. The federal agencies control eligible land programs. The deduction amount is based on the governor's annual report to DOI. The standard rate is used for this option. Alternative B involves calculating the county's eligible acreage multiplied by $0.37 per acre or the county's ceiling payment based on its population, choosing the lesser amount. The minimum provision is used for counties that received large payments from other federal agencies the previous year. Counties can receive the greater of two calculations. If appropriations are insufficient, counties receive a pro rata share. In FY2017, the PILT appropriation was $465.0 million, 99.7% of the authorized level. In FY2017, PILT payments were 99.7% of the authorized level, totaling $465.0 million. The standard rate does not guarantee constant federal payments to counties due to time lag in determining payments. PILT payments for the following fiscal year are offset by prior year receipts. The combination of specific payments and PILT in the standard rate allows for exact offsets. PILT payments cannot fall below $0.37 per acre for FY2017. In FY2017, PILT payments were 99.7% of the authorized level, totaling $465.0 million. The standard rate does not guarantee constant federal payments to counties due to time lag in determining payments. PILT payments for the following fiscal year are offset by prior year receipts. The combination of specific payments and PILT in the standard rate allows for exact offsets. PILT payments cannot fall below $0.37 per acre for FY2017. The full offset occurs only when other federal payments in the previous year total less than $2.29 per acre. If federal receipts on FS lands dropped in FY2014, authorized FS payments in FY2015 would fall, with PILT payments increasing to offset the drop in FY2016. Counties will be authorized to receive at least $2.64 per acre from FS and PILT payments combined, but the two payments would not come in the same year. If FS payments are falling, the combined payments in the given year would be less than $2.64 per acre, but if FS payments are rising, the authorized combined payment in the given year would be higher. In FY2017, PILT payments were 99.7% of the authorized level, totaling $465.0 million. The standard rate does not guarantee constant federal payments to counties due to time lag in determining payments. PILT payments for the following fiscal year are offset by prior year receipts.

The full offset occurs only when other federal payments in the previous year total less than $2.29 per acre. County governments show strong support for continuing the mandatory spending feature for PILT, which was the biggest issue facing the program from the 112th through the 114th Congresses. Congressional interest in PILT has focused on whether to approve mandatory spending at the full amount, reduce the program through lower appropriations or changing the formula, and add or subtract lands eligible for payments. PILT garners attention from local governments, with 2,227 counties receiving an average payment of $202,784 in FY2016. The Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program in FY2016 distributed an average payment of $202,784 to 2,227 counties, with some receiving over $1 million and 25 counties getting over $3 million. The impact on local government budgets generates interest despite PILT's small size compared to the federal budget. Issues being debated include the inclusion of different types of lands, tax equivalency for urban lands, and payments affecting the National Wildlife Refuge System. Counties with large federal land holdings may face fiscal uncertainty as PILT funding becomes discretionary. Some counties advocate for adding Indian lands to the PILT program, arguing that these lands benefit from county services without paying property taxes. However, the federal government does not own these lands, making it complex to determine the impact on PILT funding. Congress would need to decide which Indian lands qualify for payments and address various other issues. Adding Indian lands to the PILT program could significantly increase eligible acres for payments, but the impact on authorization levels is uncertain. If all eligible Indian lands are in counties with capped PILT payments, inclusion would have no effect. However, if appropriations are below authorized levels, funding would increase to accommodate the newly eligible lands. Some counties may receive more PILT payments if their eligible acres increase due to the inclusion of Indian lands. Urban federal lands are not excluded from the PILT program. In FY2016, counties with urban areas like Sacramento, Chicago, Cleveland, and the District of Columbia received PILT payments. Eastern counties tend to be small with limited populations and eligible acreage, while western counties are larger with more eligible acres and some, like Sacramento, have large populations. PILT payments do not equate to property tax payments, as shown by examples like Arlington County and the District of Columbia. The formula for PILT does not consider property taxes, leading to potential support for a revised formula that aligns more closely with property tax payments. NWRS lands withdrawn from the public domain are eligible for PILT, while acquired lands are not. The National Wildlife Refuge Fund relies on annual appropriations for full funding, with payments for FY2016 at 23% of the authorized level. Congress may consider making all refuge lands eligible for PILT and providing mandatory spending for NWRF. Eastern counties could benefit the most from this change, with some western states also having NWRS acres not eligible for PILT. Adding 9.8 million acres of NWRS lands currently ineligible for PILT would increase PILT lands by about 1.6%. The PILT program, previously mandatory, now relies on discretionary spending which could destabilize fiscal structures of some jurisdictions. Nationally, PILT reductions may not have a significant fiscal impact on county budgets, but locally the impacts could be substantial. Property taxes are crucial for counties, comprising nearly 47% of own-source revenue nationally. In FY2016, the PILT program received $400.2 million in payments, less than 0.1% of property tax revenue nationally. Counties receiving over $3 million could face adverse effects on government services, but restructuring property tax or raising local fees could offset the reduced federal payment. Smaller payments are crucial for low-property-value, low-population counties with more federally owned land."
