    "content": "The \"Small Business Health Care Tax Credit Act\" may be cited as the short title. It introduces a credit for employee health insurance expenses under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Small Business Health Care Tax Credit Act introduces a credit for qualified small employers based on the percentage of employee health insurance expenses paid during the taxable year. The applicable percentage varies based on the number of qualified employees, with a 50% credit for employers with less than 10 employees, 25% for 10-24 employees, and 20% for 25-49 employees. The Small Business Health Care Tax Credit Act limits the health insurance expenses for qualified employees to $4,000 for self-only coverage and $10,000 for family coverage. A qualified small employer must provide health insurance coverage to all qualified employees and pay at least 50% of the cost for each employee. The term 'small employer' is defined as an employer with average gross receipts not exceeding $5,000,000 over the past three years and employing more than 1 but less than 50 qualified employees. The term 'aggregate gross assets' is also defined for this purpose. The term 'gross assets' is defined as per section 1202(d)(2). For employers not in existence in the preceding year, their qualification as a small employer is based on the average number of employees. The term 'gross assets' is defined as per section 1202(d)(2). For employers not in existence in the preceding year, qualification as a small employer is based on the average number of employees expected to be employed on business days in the current taxable year. Aggregation rules apply to treat certain groups as a single employer. The Secretary may establish regulations regarding references to predecessors of an employer. The term 'qualified employee health insurance expenses' refers to employer payments for health insurance coverage for qualified employees, excluding amounts from salary reduction arrangements. Health insurance coverage is defined as per section 9832(b)(1). The term 'qualified employee' refers to an employee who is not provided health insurance coverage under specific provisions of various laws. The term 'employee' refers to an individual expected to receive up to $50,000 in compensation from the employer, excluding certain employees under section 401(c)(1) but including leased employees under section 414(n). Compensation is defined as amounts in section 6051(a)(3), with a $50,000 inflation adjustment for taxable years after 2007. For taxable years after 2007, the $50,000 amount in compensation for employees will be increased annually based on the cost-of-living adjustment determined for that calendar year. If the adjusted amount is not a multiple of $1,000, it will be rounded down to the nearest thousand. The $50,000 compensation for employees will be adjusted annually based on the cost-of-living. Health insurance coverage must be available to all qualified employees for the employer to qualify. The tax credits for the taxpayer will be increased by the lesser of two calculations. The tax credit for the taxpayer would increase by the amount of employer payroll taxes imposed during the calendar year in which the taxable year begins. Employer payroll taxes include taxes imposed by specific sections.

A special rule applies for qualified employee health insurance expenses, and no double benefit is allowed under any other provision of the tax code. The employee health insurance expenses credit is now part of the general business credit. The table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding a new section 45O. The new section 45O pertains to employee health insurance expenses and is effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2006."
