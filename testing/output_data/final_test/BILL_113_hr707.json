    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Short Term Retention for Agricultural Workers Act of 2013\". The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to include dairy or ranch workers in the H-2A visa program, eliminate the 50 percent rule, set a wage rate based on Federal, State, and local minimum wage rates, and provide legal assistance through the Legal Services Corporation. The Legal Services Corporation may not provide legal assistance for aliens unless they are present in the United States at the time of assistance and parties have attempted mediation. Employer-nonimmigrant arbitration arrangements will be respected. Employers of nonimmigrant workers are not required to permit recipients of assistance. The Legal Services Corporation Act prohibits recipients of grants or contracts from allowing nonimmigrant workers to enter their property without an appointment. STRAW workers can stay in the US for up to 11 months and a total of 3 years with a return to their home country for at least 1 month before re-entering on a different visa. The Legal Services Corporation Act prohibits nonimmigrant workers from entering property without an appointment. STRAW workers can stay in the US for up to 11 months and a total of 3 years with housing provided by the employer. If there is inadequate housing available for migrant farm workers and STRAW workers in the area of intended employment, the employer may provide a housing voucher if verified that suitable housing is within a reasonable commuting distance and usable for the voucher amount. Upon request, the employer must assist workers in locating housing. The employer must assist workers in locating housing for which a voucher will be accepted, and payment must be made with a housing voucher redeemable by the owner or their agent. The employer providing housing through these means will not be considered a housing provider under the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act. The Secretary of Homeland Security will provide nonimmigrant agricultural workers with an identification card. The Secretary of Homeland Security will provide nonimmigrant agricultural workers with an identification card containing an encrypted electronic strip, biometric identifiers, and physical security features. A trust fund will be established by the Secretary of Agriculture to fund the administration and enforcement of the program, issuance of cards, and provide a monetary incentive for workers to return to their country of origin. The Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, will establish regulations for nonimmigrant agricultural workers to return to their country of origin after their visas expire. Employers must pay fica and futa amounts into a trust fund for these workers. The chapter 21 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows for deductions from worker wages and employer payments into a trust fund equivalent to excise taxes under chapter 23. This is in relation to employment considered for the purposes of the Act. Expenditures from the trust fund are used for administering and enforcing the program under this section and for the cost of cards issued. Employee contributions are used for repayment upon return to the country of origin. The United States consulate nearest the worker's residence in the country of origin may be paid to the worker if they demonstrate compliance with the program's terms. Employee contributions related to excise tax can be used for emergency medical services for nonimmigrant agricultural workers. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish rules for payments to nonimmigrant agricultural workers for emergency medical services, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Emergency medical services are defined as those required under the Social Security Act. The Secretary of Agriculture will report semiannually to Congress on the nonimmigrant agricultural worker program, including visa issuance, program effectiveness, enforcement issues, and legislative recommendations. Section 218 of the Social Security Act has been updated to reflect changes in program name and administrator. Section 218 of the Immigration and Nationality Act has been amended to change the program name from \"H-2A worker\" to \"STRAW worker\" and the administrator from the \"Secretary of Labor\" to the \"Secretary of Agriculture.\""
