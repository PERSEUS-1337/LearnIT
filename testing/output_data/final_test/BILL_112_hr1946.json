    "content": "The Act titled \"Preserving Our Hometown Independent Pharmacies Act of 2011\" applies antitrust laws to independent pharmacies negotiating with health plans. The Act \"Preserving Our Hometown Independent Pharmacies Act of 2011\" treats independent pharmacies negotiating with health plans as employees engaged in concerted activities under antitrust laws, protecting them from criminal sanctions or civil damages for actions taken in good faith. This does not affect the National Labor Relations Act. The exemption provided in the \"Preserving Our Hometown Independent Pharmacies Act of 2011\" applies to conduct starting from the enactment date. However, it does not exempt agreements that boycott independent pharmacies, allocate markets among competitors, or violate antitrust laws. The \"Preserving Our Hometown Independent Pharmacies Act of 2011\" exempts certain negotiations between independent pharmacies and health plans from antitrust laws if the group of pharmacies does not exceed 25 percent of all pharmacy licenses in the region. The section clarifies that the Act does not affect Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and excludes certain federal programs from its application in negotiations between independent pharmacies and health plans. The Act excludes certain federal programs from its application in negotiations between independent pharmacies and health plans. It references specific laws such as the Federal employees' health benefits program, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, and parts of the Social Security Act. Definitions include terms like \"antitrust laws\" and \"health plan.\" The term \"health plan\" refers to a group health plan or health insurance issuer offering coverage, including entities that administer services. It excludes Medicare Advantage and prescription drug plans. The terms \"health insurance coverage\" and \"health insurance issuer\" are defined accordingly. The term \"independent pharmacy\" refers to a pharmacy with a market share of less than 10 percent in any PDP region and less than 1 percent in the United States. Members of the same controlled group of corporations and pharmacies under common control shall be treated as 1 pharmacy. The term \"PDP region\" is defined in the Social Security Act. The exemption provided in subsection (a) applies to conduct within a 5-year period from the enactment of the Act and continues for 1 year after. Additionally, there is a General Accountability Office Study and Report requirement. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on the impact of the section's enactment during a 6-month period starting in the 5th year of the 5-year period. A report with recommendations on extending the section will be submitted to Congress. Oversight by the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice over independent pharmacies covered under this section is allowed."
