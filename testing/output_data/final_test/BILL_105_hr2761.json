    "content": "The Act titled \"Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act of 1997\" provides benefits to domestic partners of federal employees. The \"Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act of 1997\" grants benefits to domestic partners of federal employees, requiring certification of eligibility including being each other's sole partner, having a common residence, sharing financial obligations, and not being involved with anyone else. The \"Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act of 1997\" requires domestic partners of federal employees to file a statement of dissolution with the Office of Personnel Management within 30 days if they obtain benefits under the Act. Willful falsification of information in the affidavit may result in disciplinary action and the recovery of benefits received. The \"Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act of 1997\" mandates that domestic partners of federal employees must notify the Office of Personnel Management within 30 days of the employee's death or dissolution of the partnership. If the employee dies, the domestic partner is considered a spouse for benefit purposes. If the partnership dissolves by means other than death, benefits received by the partner will cease. If a partnership dissolves by means other than death, health benefits for the domestic partner will continue for 60 days. The partner must pay for the benefits like a former spouse would under COBRA. Information submitted to the Office of Personnel Management is confidential and used only for certifying eligibility. (1) Domestic partner is defined as an adult person in a committed relationship living with another adult person without being married. (2) Benefits include retirement, life insurance, health insurance, and compensation for work injuries as outlined in specific chapters of the United States Code. (3) An employee is also mentioned in the context. In the United States Code, the term \"employee\" is defined differently for Civil Service Retirement, Federal Employees' Retirement, life insurance, and health insurance. The term \"employee\" is defined in section 8101(1) of title 5, United States Code for compensation for work injuries. The term \"obligations\" refer to duties or responsibilities of an employee's spouse. SEC. 3. EXEMPTION FROM TAX FOR EMPLOYER-PROVIDED FRINGE BENEFITS TO DOMESTIC PARTNERS. An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows employer-provided fringe benefits to domestic partners to be exempt from tax. This includes benefits not included in employees' gross income under specific provisions."
