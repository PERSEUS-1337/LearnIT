    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United Nations Oil-for-Food Accountability Act of 2004\". It includes findings related to the accountability of the oil-for-food program. Congress finds substantial fraud and corruption in the administration of the United Nations' Iraq Oil-for-Food Program, with the former Iraqi regime receiving $10.1 billion in illegal revenues from the program. The United Nations officials, including the Executive Director of the oil-for-food program, may have been involved in an illicit scheme allowing prominent foreign officials to trade Iraqi oil at below-market prices. Resolution 1538 was adopted to investigate these allegations. The United Nations is facing allegations of corruption and mismanagement in the oil-for-food program, which could impact its ability to provide legitimacy to the new Government of Iraq and assist in postwar reconstruction. Paul Volcker will lead an inquiry into these allegations, but investigators will not have subpoena power. The influence of politically connected individuals, companies, and institutions of permanent member states who received Iraqi oil contracts threatens the credibility of the United Nations Security Council in matters of war and peace. The oil-for-food program, defined in this Act, allows the sale of Iraqi petroleum products for humanitarian assistance. United States contributions to the United Nations budget are contingent upon the President certifying UN cooperation. The President must certify UN cooperation for the release of US contributions to the United Nations budget. If certification is not provided, a portion of the funds appropriated for contributions to international organizations will be withheld. The President must certify UN cooperation for the release of US contributions to the United Nations budget, including access to documents related to the oil-for-food program and authorization for release to law enforcement authorities. The United Nations must provide authentic copies of relevant documents to law enforcement authorities upon request, waive immunity for any UN official involved in the oil-for-food program in the US, for civil or criminal acts under Federal or State law. The United Nations must provide documents to law enforcement, waive immunity for officials involved in the oil-for-food program in the US, and ensure officials reimburse Iraq for any financial benefits received improperly."
