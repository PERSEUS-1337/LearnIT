    "content": "We develop a stochastic whole-brain and body simulator of the nematode roundworm C. elegans, allowing imputation of latent membrane potentials from partial calcium fluorescence imaging. This method uses Bayesian machine learning to recover connectome-wide state representations and estimate parameter values, paving the way for simulations of intelligent lifeforms in silico. The study aims to understand how sentience emerges from brain interactions, using a probabilistic brain-body simulator for C. elegans. Posterior inference methods are used to estimate global simulator parameters from calcium fluorescence data, enabling in silico experimentation on digital worm specimens. The study focuses on using a brain-body simulator for C. elegans to explore how the neural circuit units combine to create intelligent behavior. The simplicity and regularity of C. elegans' anatomy make it a widely used model organism in biology and neuroscience research. Neural circuit simulators with anatomically correct structure have been developed to simulate the whole C. elegans connectome, allowing for in-depth exploration of hypotheses. The paper introduces a new C. elegans simulator that integrates existing models and simulators developed by the C. elegans community. The simulator includes components for simulating membrane potential, calcium ion concentration in neurons, physical form of the worm, neural stimuli, and intracellular calcium to observable fluorescence data. The first component focuses on connectome-scale neural dynamics simulation. The 'simple C. elegans' (SCE) simulator integrates models for neural membrane potential dynamics, intracellular calcium ion concentration, body shape simulation, and fluorescence signals observed through calcium imaging. The simulator combines single-compartment neuron models connected by synapses and gap junctions, a worm body shape model driven by a simplified neural network, and anatomically correct representations to drive body shape evolution. The model integrates neural membrane potential dynamics, calcium ion concentration, body shape simulation, and fluorescence signals observed through calcium imaging. Bayesian inference is used to condition simulations on partial observations and perform parameter estimation. The method imputes the entire latent state based on observable calcium imaging signals. The posterior distribution p(x 0:T |y 1:T , \u03b8) quantifies latent states based on observed data. Forward simulation from this distribution provides posterior predictive inference for state evolution, allowing for model comparison and parameter estimation using sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). In the experiment, Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) is used to estimate the posterior distribution and model evidence. A synthetic state trajectory is generated and the true state is recovered from observed data. The filtering distribution by SMC accurately reconstructs the latent behavior of the system, even for neurons not directly observed. The experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) in reconstructing latent states from partial calcium imaging observations. The model accurately predicts body shape without explicit conditioning, showing the tractability of the method. The posterior inference and evidence approximation aid in imputing values and conducting in silico experiments. The flexibility of the method is highlighted by allowing parameters of the simulator to vary for latent state imputation. The paper discusses parameter estimation in a simulator by allowing unknown parameters to be learned. The method combines variational optimization and SMC evidence approximation for stochastic gradient parameter estimation without requiring a differentiable simulator. The paper introduces particle marginal variational optimization (PMVO) for parameter estimation in simulators, combining variational optimization with SMC evidence approximation. PMVO is used to optimize parameters on synthetic data, demonstrating its utility in recovering known simulator parameters. The study optimized two parameters, w m and w s, using PMVO in C. elegans models. Results showed improved imputation of latent states and convergence towards true parameter values. Increasing particles in SMC sweeps and observing more neurons could enhance the model further. In this work, Bayesian inference was explored in whole-connectome neural and whole-body C. elegans simulations. The model-based Bayesian inference, termed \"virtual patch clamp,\" allows for inferring latent membrane potentials from partial non-invasive observations. The method presented enables estimation of model evidence without differentiable simulation components. The C. elegans community has been discussing open research issues related to simulation, as outlined in Figure 1 (a) of the development pipeline. The curr_chunk discusses the implementation of optimization in the C. elegans simulation pipeline, showing its capability on synthetic data. This approach aims to allow neuroscientists to delve deeper into neural function, potentially leading to advancements in understanding intelligence and artificial general intelligence."
