Congress finds that Public Law 102-215 directed the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study of White Clay Creek and its tributaries for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. As part of the study, a watershed management plan was prepared in May 1998 to ensure long-term protection of the area's values and land management. After a study directed by Public Law 102-215, Chester County, Pennsylvania, New Castle County, Delaware, Newark, Delaware, and 12 Pennsylvania municipalities passed resolutions supporting the White Clay Creek Watershed Management Plan and endorsing the designation of the creek and its tributaries for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The White Clay Creek is designated for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The White Clay Creek in Delaware and Pennsylvania, totaling 191 miles, is designated as a recreational river under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.

The Scenic Rivers System can only be designated in areas not considered for reservoir locations by the Delaware River Basin Commission. The Secretary can offer assistance for subsequent designations to Delaware and New Castle County if suitable for designation. The segments designated by subparagraph (A) in Castle County, Delaware, shall be managed in accordance with the Management Plan, with the Director of the National Park Service representing the Secretary in implementation. The federally-assisted water resources projects may have a direct adverse effect on designated segments. The Secretary can provide technical assistance, staff support, and funding up to $150,000 per fiscal year for implementation. Cooperative agreements under section 10(e) are applicable to the designated segments. The designated segments under subparagraph (A) must align with the Management Plan and may receive financial assistance from the United States for long-term protection. State and local zoning laws are deemed to meet the standards under section 6(c). Any segment not part of the National Park system is subject to these provisions. The designated segments under subparagraph (A) that are not part of the National Park System as of the date of enactment of this paragraph shall not be considered part of the National Park System, managed by the National Park Service, or subject to laws governing the National Park System. The Federal Government shall not acquire any land or interests for the purpose of carrying out this paragraph."
