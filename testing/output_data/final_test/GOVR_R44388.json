    "content": "President Barack Obama signed the FAST Act in December 2015, authorizing spending on federal highway, public transportation, and passenger rail programs for five years, totaling about $305 billion. This includes $233 billion for highways, $61 billion for public transportation, and over $10 billion for Amtrak. The act provides funds for a modest increase in spending for both highways and public transportation over expected inflation, reestablishing the pattern of five- or six-year surface transportation authorization bills dating back to the early 1990s. The FAST Act, signed by President Obama in December 2015, authorizes spending on federal highway, public transportation, and passenger rail programs for five years. It includes funds for highways, public transportation, and Amtrak, with a modest increase in spending over expected inflation. The act emphasizes the national importance of moving freight and treats intercity passenger rail as part of the federal surface transportation program. The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) is a key source of funding for federal highway and public transportation programs, including Amtrak. It is primarily financed through taxes on fuels, tires, truck and trailer sales, and a weight-based heavy-vehicle use tax. The HTF consists of two separate accounts for highways and mass transit, with the majority of revenue coming from excise taxes on motor fuels. Fuel tax rates have not been raised since 1993, leading to stagnant revenues that do not increase with inflation. Since 1993, fuel tax rates have not been raised, resulting in stagnant revenues for the Highway Trust Fund (HTF). Due to sluggish economic growth and improved vehicle efficiency, fuel consumption and tax revenue growth have been depressed. Prior to the FAST Act, $73.3 billion was transferred from the general fund to the HTF to cover discrepancies in funding for the Federal-Aid Highway Program. Under the FAST Act, $70 billion will be transferred to the HTF from the general fund to bridge the revenue gap for FY2016 through FY2020. The FAST Act provided $70 billion in general fund transfers to the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) for FY2016 through FY2020, with an additional $300 million from the Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) trust fund. This mixing of revenue sources reduces the relevance of arguments for using HTF funds only on highways and addresses states' complaints about fair share distribution. However, a gap between dedicated HTF revenues and outlays is expected to persist after the FAST Act expires in FY2020, with projections showing insufficient revenues to meet obligations starting in FY2021. The FAST Act provided general fund transfers to the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) for FY2016 through FY2020. However, projections show a $96 billion shortfall in HTF receipts from FY2021 to FY2025 to fund highway and public transportation programs. Congress may need to consider new taxes, existing tax increases, general fund transfers, debt financing, or program reductions to replace or extend the FAST Act in 2021. The Federal-Aid Highway Program (FAHP) focuses on highway construction and is administered by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The Federal-Aid Highway Program (FAHP) is administered by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and focuses on highway construction. Each state has a State Transportation Improvement Plan to prioritize FAHP funds. State DOTs determine funded projects, while MPOs have a growing role in urban areas. FHWA has contract authority over HTF funds, allowing funds to be obligated for projects before appropriations. This approach ensures a legal commitment to provide the funds for highway projects. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) administers the Federal-Aid Highway Program (FAHP) with a legal commitment to provide funds for highway construction projects. 92% of FAHP funding is distributed through five core programs: National Highway Performance Program (NHPP), Surface Transportation Block Grant Program (STBG), Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP), Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ), and National Highway Freight Program. Formula programs determine each state's share of funding based on mathematical calculations set out in the law. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) administers the Federal-Aid Highway Program (FAHP) with a legal commitment to provide funds for highway construction projects. The FAHP funding distribution is formulaic, with states reimbursed for completed work. The FAST Act provides a 4.2% increase in highway funding above previous levels, totaling an average of $45 billion annually for FY2016-FY2020. The FAST Act provides an average of $41 billion annually for Federal-Aid Highway programs for FY2016-FY2020, with a focus on freight movement. It introduces the National Highway Freight Program (NHFP) and the Nationally Significant Freight and Highway Projects Program (NSFHP). The act consolidates funding into a single gross apportionment for each state, distributing funds through core programs and the Metropolitan Planning Program. The FAST Act provides funding for Federal-Aid Highway programs through core programs and apportionment for each state. Funds are divided among programs with set-asides and percentage formulas. States can transfer up to 50% of apportioned funds between programs, except for certain suballocated funds. NHPP is the largest program with overlapping eligibility areas to facilitate fund usage. The FAST Act allows states to use NHPP funds for various purposes, including paying subsidy and administrative costs under TIFIA, funding bridge projects not on the NHS but on the Federal-Aid Highway system, and projects to reduce infrastructure failure risk. STBG has broad eligibility criteria and can be used on any federal-aid highway or bridge projects. The FAST Act authorizes almost $11.7 billion annually for the Surface Transportation Block Grant (STBG) program, which has broad eligibility criteria. Funds can be used for various transportation projects, including federal-aid highways, bridge projects, transit capital projects, nonmotorized transportation routes, and bridge and tunnel inspection. The STBG program absorbs the Transportation Alternatives program from the previous law, with $850 million per year set aside for similar uses. States and MPOs must develop a competitive process for local entities to submit projects for funding, including a portion for the recreational trails program. States may opt out of this program. The Surface Transportation Block Grant (STBG) program allocates funds for various transportation projects, including highways, bridges, transit, and carpool projects. States must allocate a portion of their STBG funding to projects in specified locations based on a population formula. The percentage allocated to areas in the state by population increases annually, ensuring funding for projects in all parts of each state. Under the FAST Act, STBG funds are allocated based on population formula, increasing annually from 51% in FY2016 to 55% in FY2020. Funds for off-system bridges are set aside, with no upper limit on bridge spending. HSIP supports safety projects like improving road infrastructure and is funded at $2.6 billion annually. CMAQ funds projects to reduce emissions. Under the FAST Act, CMAQ funds projects to reduce transportation-related pollutants, with an average annual authorization of $2.4 billion. Eligibility now includes port-related freight operations and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication equipment. NHFP will receive about $1.2 billion annually through FY2020 to assist states. The National Highway Freight Program (NHFP) will average $1.2 billion annually through FY2020 to help states and MPOs remove impediments to the movement of goods. The Nationally Significant Freight and Highway Projects (NSFHP) provides $900 million per year in discretionary grants for projects of regional or national importance. Applicants may apply directly to the Secretary of Transportation for NSFHP grants. ER funds are available following natural disasters or catastrophic highway infrastructure events. ER funds are available for emergency repairs and debris removal on federal-aid highways after natural disasters or infrastructure failures. The program is funded by $100 million annually from the HTF and general fund appropriations. ER funds can only be used on federal-aid highways, and FEMA typically funds debris removal after major disasters. The FAST Act expanded eligibility for ER funds on federally owned roads. Territorial and Puerto Rico Highway programs are funded at $42 million and $158 million annually through FY2020. The ADHS program, part of the Appalachian Development Highway System, aims to reduce isolation and promote economic development in Appalachia through road construction. Funding for the program, extended until 2050 by the FAST Act, allows for a 100% federal share with the option for states to contribute. The Ferry Boats and Ferry Terminal Facilities Program, also under the FAST Act, provides $80 million annually for ferry construction based on a formula considering passengers, vehicles, and route miles. The FAST Act reallocates unused funds for ferryboats and facilities, with increases in funding for Federal Lands Programs and Tribal Transportation Program. Funding for Federal Lands Transportation Program increases to $375 million by FY2020, while Federal Lands Access Program remains at $250 million in FY2016 and increases to $270 million by FY2020. Tribal Transportation Program funding rises to $505 million by FY2020. The FAST Act establishes a Tribal Transportation Self-Governance Program for tribes to administer the Tribal Transportation Program. It also authorizes the Nationally Significant Federal Lands and Tribal Projects Program at $100 million per year. The program includes projects on tribal land and federal land managed by agencies like the National Park Service and the Forest Service. The Tribal High Priority Projects Program was not reauthorized under the FAST Act. The FAST Act establishes a new competitive grant program and formula program to allocate federal funds for critical highway projects, aiming to enhance U.S. economic competitiveness, reduce congestion, improve highway efficiency, and minimize environmental impact. The competitive grant program has funding starting at $800 million in FY2016, increasing to $1 billion in FY2020, open to public entities like states, Metropolitan Planning Organizations, and local governments. The FAST Act establishes a grant program for highway projects with eligible uses of funds including railway-highway grade crossings, connections to ports, and private freight rail projects. Grants are capped at $500 million for freight projects, providing up to 60% of project costs with a minimum grant of $25 million for projects costing at least $100 million. The NHFP is a grant program for highway projects with eligible costs of at least $100 million or a significant share of a state's highway funding. 10% of grant funds are reserved for smaller projects with awarded grants of at least $5 million each. The program has funding of $1.1 billion in FY2016 rising to $1.5 billion in FY2020 and is administered through state DOTs. Funds must be directed toward highway components important to freight movement, including the Primary Highway Freight Network and critical rural and urban freight corridors. Congress has 60 days to disapprove of a DOT grant approval. The FAST Act designates \"critical rural freight corridors\" by state DOTs and \"critical urban freight corridors\" by state DOTs or MPOs, depending on urban area size. These, along with Interstate Highway segments not part of the PHFN, form the NHFN. FHWA issues biennial reports on NHFN condition and performance. States with 2%+ of PHFN mileage must spend funds on PHFN, critical rural, or urban corridors; states with <2% can spend on any NHFN part. Up to 10% of state funds can go towards projects at freight rail, water facilities, or intermodal infrastructure. The FAST Act includes provisions for transportation infrastructure, such as funding for land border infrastructure and railway-highway grade crossings safety improvements. Additionally, it designates critical rural and urban freight corridors as part of the National Highway Freight Network. The FAST Act designates a \"National Multimodal Freight Network\" (NMFN) to guide funding decisions for railways, ports, waterways, airports, and roads. The Under Secretary of Transportation for Policy will oversee the NMFN, with provisions for improving freight planning and tolling on federal-aid highways. The FAST Act allows for toll lanes on existing Interstate routes while maintaining free lanes. It also permits tolls on single-occupant vehicles in HOV lanes, giving local authorities more control. The Act modifies the Interstate System Construction Toll Pilot Program, allowing tolls on certain segments for funding. Intercity buses are mandated to have access to toll roads. The FAST Act reduces funding for the TIFIA program, impacting DOT's ability to issue loans for transportation projects. However, the Act allows funding from other highway programs to cover credit assistance costs. The FAST Act reduces TIFIA program funding but allows other highway programs to cover credit assistance costs. It authorizes new discretionary programs like NSFHPP and NHPP, potentially increasing TIFIA financing. Additionally, the Act allows TIFIA loans to state infrastructure banks for rural projects and includes transit-oriented development infrastructure as eligible projects. The FAST Act allows up to $2 million of TIFIA budget authority each fiscal year to pay application fees for projects costing $75 million or less. It modifies project cost thresholds for credit assistance, sets a maximum loan for a rural project fund at $100 million, and streamlines the application process for loans of $100 million or less. The Act also allows states to capitalize State Infrastructure Banks with federal funds and permits STBG funding for the creation of offices to assist in infrastructure projects. The FAST Act allows STBG funding for creating offices to support public-private partnerships. It establishes a National Surface Transportation and Innovative Finance Bureau within DOT to manage federal transportation financing programs and promote best practices for innovative financing and P3s. The FAST Act establishes a new Regional Infrastructure Accelerator Demonstration Program to assist entities in developing infrastructure priorities and financing strategies. It authorizes $12 million in FY2016 for the program and supports innovative financing and public-private partnerships. The Federal Public Transportation Act of 2015, under Title III of Division A, authorizes $11.8 billion for public transportation in FY2016, increasing to $12.6 billion in FY2020. The total five-year funding is $61.1 billion, with 80% from the mass transit account of the HTF and 20% from the general fund. A significant change is the addition of a competitive discretionary component in the Bus and Bus Facilities Grant Program, providing funding for buses, facilities, and maintenance depots. In FY2016, the Bus Program is authorized at $696 million, with $428 million for formula grants and $268 million for discretionary grants. In FY2020, the Bus Program funding increases to $809 million, with $465 million (57%) for formula grants and $344 million (43%) for discretionary grants. $55 million per year is allocated for low- or no-emission buses and facilities. The FAST Act aims to assist smaller transportation agencies with a pilot program for voluntary state funding pools. The FAST Act allows for the transfer of Bus Program funds between recipients in urbanized areas. The Capital Investment Grant program receives increased funding under the new law, with changes to the definition of Small Starts projects. The FAST Act increases CIG funding to $100 million and project costs to less than $300 million. It allows funding for projects benefiting public transportation and intercity rail. A new Expedited Project Delivery Pilot Program funds projects with federal grants of 25% or less. Other changes include increasing set-asides for Small Transit Intensive Cities and a Pilot Program for Coordinated Access and Mobility. The FAST Act pilot program provides grants for innovative transportation projects for the transportation disadvantaged. It increases the Buy America requirement for rail cars and buses and allows transit agencies to cooperatively procure rolling stock. The FAST Act authorizes funding for positive train control installation, establishes a clearinghouse for cooperative procurement information, affirms FTA's oversight authority for safety improvements, and includes provisions for accelerating project delivery. The SAFETEA and MAP-21 provisions aim to expedite surface transportation project delivery by changing the environmental review process to consider impacts on the human, natural, and cultural environment, as well as compliance requirements. This includes changes to FHWA and FTA procedures to identify and address environmental impacts as required by NEPA. The curr_chunk discusses the impacts of a proposal under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), changes to procedures related to the DOT's prohibition on projects affecting historic sites, and State DOT actions to expedite federal approvals for transportation projects. It also mentions Title XI of the FAST Act, which requires DOT to apply project development procedures for federal-aid highway projects to railroad projects, with potential effects on the environmental review process. The amendments will impact the environmental review process, with NHTSA responsible for vehicle safety regulation and driver safety. FMCSA oversees truck and bus safety and commercial driver safety. NHTSA focuses on safety aspects of passenger vehicles and driver behaviors contributing to crashes. Funding for NHTSA's driver behavior programs increases modestly from FY2015 to FY2020. NHTSA's driver behavior programs receive increased funding from FY2015 to FY2020, primarily through grants to states to address driver behavior issues. The FAST Act introduces changes to safety grant programs, including easing eligibility requirements for incentive grants related to impaired and distracted driving, creating grants for 24-7 sobriety programs, and promoting safety for nonmotorized travelers. Additionally, NHTSA is directed to study potential safety measures. The FAST Act directs NHTSA to study standards for marijuana impairment while consolidating FMCSA grant programs and increasing funding for motor carrier inspections. It also calls for a study on the Compliance, Safety, Accountability program and suspends publication of carrier rankings pending the results. Congress directs FMCSA to adjust the CSA program to reward carriers implementing safety measures, improve data accuracy, and review treatment of preventable crashes. Other provisions include promoting commercial vehicle safety through statutory changes and studies. FMCSA must complete ongoing rulemakings before starting new ones and report to Congress every six months on rulemaking status. The FAST Act makes changes to auto safety laws, including increasing the maximum civil fine for automakers violating safety laws and giving NHTSA authority to enforce repair of recalled vehicles in rental fleets. The FAST Act gives NHTSA authority to enforce repair of recalled vehicles in rental fleets and requires auto dealers to inform motorists of open recalls. It also includes new privacy standards for data stored in event data recorders in vehicles. The FAST Act authorizes NHTSA to enforce vehicle recalls in rental fleets and mandates auto dealers to inform drivers of open recalls. It also establishes privacy standards for data stored in vehicle event data recorders. Additionally, the Act includes provisions for internal NHTSA reforms recommended by the DOT Inspector General and authorizes passenger and freight rail transportation programs. The authorization bill for intercity rail programs, including Amtrak, increases significantly over the period, funded from the general fund. Actual appropriations may be less than authorized amounts, with examples showing significant discrepancies in past years. Amtrak operates intercity passenger rail service over its infrastructure. Amtrak operates intercity passenger rail service over its infrastructure, including the Northeast Corridor. It runs at a deficit of roughly $1 billion annually, receiving support from Congress to cover the shortfall. While the Northeast Corridor makes an operating profit, long-distance trains outside the corridor run large deficits. Critics argue that Amtrak does not cover its costs adequately. The FAST Act requires Amtrak to allocate costs and revenues between the Northeast Corridor and the National Network. Congress also mandates Amtrak to hire an independent entity to develop methodologies for route and service decisions. Additionally, the cap on claims against Amtrak is increased to $295 million, with adjustments based on the Consumer Price Index every five years. The FAST Act includes provisions such as increasing the statutory cap to $295 million, requiring Amtrak to eliminate operating losses on food and beverage services by December 2020, implementing a pilot program for passengers to bring pets, evaluating restoration of intercity rail service between New Orleans and Orlando, allowing bidding for long-distance passenger routes, mandating audio and image recorders on trains, and studying shared use of right-of-way. The FAST Act includes provisions such as increasing the statutory cap to $295 million, requiring Amtrak to eliminate operating losses on food and beverage services by December 2020, implementing a pilot program for passengers to bring pets, evaluating restoration of intercity rail service between New Orleans and Orlando, allowing bidding for long-distance passenger routes, mandating audio and image recorders on trains, and studying shared use of right-of-way. Amtrak, states, and stakeholders submit a study on shared use of right-of-way by passenger and freight rail systems, and requirements for high-speed rail grants over $1 billion to demonstrate funding commitment and operational independence. This aims to limit grants like the one given to the California high-speed rail project."
