    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"David Ray Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2017\" or \"David's Law\". Congress recognizes the serious national problem of violence motivated by factors such as race, religion, and gender. This violence disrupts communities, is divisive, and impacts interstate commerce by hindering movement and access to goods and services. Existing Federal law is deemed inadequate to address this issue. Violence motivated by factors such as race, religion, and gender is a serious national problem that disrupts communities and impacts interstate commerce. Federal intervention is warranted due to the widespread and interstate scope of the issue, as many states lack laws addressing such violence. Some states lack laws addressing violence based on factors like race, religion, and gender, while others provide limited protection based on the victim's characteristics. The Act defines \"hate crime\" in alignment with the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. It also prohibits certain acts of violence. Section 245 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to include harsh penalties for causing bodily injury based on race, color, religion, or national origin, including imprisonment up to 10 years or life if death results from the act. The amended Section 245 of title 18, United States Code, includes penalties for causing bodily injury based on religion, gender, sexual orientation, or disability, with imprisonment up to 10 years and potential life imprisonment if death results from the act. The amended Section 245 of title 18, United States Code, includes penalties for acts such as kidnapping, aggravated sexual abuse, or attempted murder that involve interstate or foreign commerce. The Federal Sentencing Commission will study adult recruitment of juveniles for hate crimes and may amend sentencing guidelines to enhance penalties for adult defendants who recruit juveniles. The Commission will ensure consistency with other guidelines and avoid duplicate punishments. Additionally, there is a grant program established. The Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention will make grants to combat hate crimes by juveniles. Appropriations are authorized for this purpose. Additionally, funding is authorized to increase personnel to prevent and respond to hate crime violations."
