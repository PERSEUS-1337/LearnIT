Congress finds that the proficiency of students in STEM subjects is crucial for the nation's economic competitiveness and scientific innovation. However, students in the United States are not achieving sufficient results in STEM compared to other countries. Research shows that afterschool programs play a vital role in engaging students in STEM fields. A National Research Council study confirmed the importance of afterschool programs in engaging students in STEM fields, especially for underrepresented populations. The study proposed a framework for capabilities fostered by informal learning environments. A 2013 study showed confidence in afterschool programs' ability to develop interest in STEM, engage in STEM activities, and enhance capacities for such activities. The afterschool field aims to impact skills like problem-solving, STEM abilities, career awareness, and teamwork, crucial for workforce readiness. The Federal Government should maximize resources to expand STEM opportunities for students beyond school hours. Afterschool programs collaborate with various organizations to meet student needs effectively. Cross-sector collaborations between afterschool programs, schools, science centers, higher education institutions, businesses, and other entities are benefiting youth engagement in STEM fields. Increased interest in STEM programming in afterschool calls for better partnerships across Federal agencies to provide quality hands-on STEM experiences for young people. The purposes of this Act are to enhance America's economic competitiveness by strengthening STEM education in K-12, engage Federal agencies in afterschool STEM programs, support nonprofit organizations in STEM education, involve higher education institutions, and inspire young people to pursue STEM subjects. The Act defines terms related to afterschool and STEM programs, including afterschool programs for students when school is not in session, the Director of the National Science Foundation, and the meaning of elementary school according to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The curr_chunk defines terms related to education, including middle school, secondary school, institution of higher education, and STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics). The curr_chunk establishes the Afterschool STEM Support Grant Program. The Afterschool STEM Support Grant Program aims to provide high-quality STEM education to underrepresented populations, utilize existing expertise and infrastructure in afterschool programs, encourage STEM grant recipients to contribute to afterschool STEM programs, and offer hands-on learning experiences in STEM research facilities and businesses. The Afterschool STEM Support Grant Program authorizes grants to afterschool or STEM networks to support afterschool programs with STEM content for up to 3 years. The Director ensures each grant is sufficient to achieve program goals, reserving 20% of funds for this purpose. The Director reserves 20% of funds to establish new afterschool or STEM networks in States without existing networks. Afterschool or STEM networks must submit an application with specific information to be considered for a grant. This includes details on the status of afterschool STEM programs in the State or area, such as the number of programs available. The application for afterschool or STEM networks must include details on the number of programs focused on STEM subjects, students served, unmet demand, and resources analysis. The application for afterschool or STEM networks must include an analysis of resources, past work, and a detailed plan to support and grow afterschool programs with STEM content. The application for afterschool or STEM networks must include a description of financial commitments, confirmed partners, and a clear understanding of afterschool programs with STEM content in the State or area to be served by the grant. Priority will be given to applications that demonstrate working relationships with afterschool programs. The grant recipients must have established relationships with afterschool and STEM education stakeholders, work to advance high-quality afterschool programs with STEM content for underserved populations, and leverage public investments in STEM education. Grant funds can be used to develop quality standards for STEM programming in afterschool programs and provide technical assistance, as well as collaborate with State education stakeholders. Provide technical assistance and professional development for afterschool programs to enhance their STEM content. Coordinate training programs for afterschool educators in collaboration with elementary, middle, and secondary schools. Partner with teacher training programs to support afterschool STEM efforts. Partner with teacher training programs to utilize afterschool programs for practicum experiences and employment placements. Help afterschool program providers form strategic partnerships to advance STEM learning, including partnerships with schools, higher education institutions, businesses, and research facilities. Create and distribute tool kits for afterschool programs to form partnerships with STEM professionals as mentors. The curr_chunk focuses on providing technical assistance and guidance for afterschool programs to connect with STEM researchers and professionals, showcasing successful partnerships as models, listing potential partners, and offering guidance on engaging STEM professionals. Additionally, it emphasizes identifying federally supported STEM education programs and research in the grant's area. The curr_chunk provides technical assistance for afterschool programs to collaborate with STEM researchers and professionals. It includes examples of successful partnerships, resources for program settings, guidance on finding program providers, and ensuring effective engagement. The curr_chunk outlines guidance on effective partnership engagement with afterschool providers, crafting mutually beneficial engagements, measuring outcomes for afterschool programs, and submitting annual progress reports. The Director will provide STEM research grant recipients with information on engaging with students in afterschool programs, including mentorships, networking opportunities, toolkits for partnering with afterschool STEM programs, organizing lab visits for students, and creating age-appropriate research projects. The Director will submit a report to Congress within 180 days of the Act's enactment on Federal STEM investments in afterschool programs and best practices for incorporating STEM subjects into afterschool programs."
