    "title": "SB 1310",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 556.4 of the Penal Code is amended to allow information from signs, advertisements, or mechanical devices to be used as evidence to identify responsible parties, including real estate brokers, property owners, and event sponsors. The Legislature implemented an Elderly Parole Program for prisoners aged 60 or older with at least 25 years on their current sentence, following a court order in the California prison overcrowding case. Prisoners aged 60 or older with 25 years on their current sentence are eligible for Elderly Parole Program hearings, whether they have had a parole hearing or not. The BPH reviews three-year denials annually to consider more prompt parole hearings for eligible prisoners under the Elderly Parole Program. Prisoners with longer denial periods can request an advanced hearing if they meet the elder parole eligibility criteria. The BPH may deny parole for elderly prisoners if release poses a risk to public safety. Elderly Parole Program hearings consider age, time served, and physical condition to assess future violence risk. The number of elderly prisoners in California state prisons is increasing, with 27,580 prisoners aged 50 and older in 2013. Costs for geriatric medical needs start accumulating at age 50, when prisoners are considered elderly. In 2010, incarcerating elderly offenders cost 2-3 times more than the general prison population, with an average cost of $51,000 per inmate. Older individuals have low arrest rates, with rates decreasing significantly with age, dropping to 0.14 percent for those aged 50-59. The Elderly Parole Program, established by CDCR, aims to reduce recidivism among older prisoners. Those aged 50 and above, who have served 15 years of their sentence and have a reentry plan, are eligible for parole under this program. This initiative is based on statistics showing lower recidivism rates for elderly prisoners compared to younger age groups. The Elderly Parole Program considers age, time served, and physical condition in assessing the risk of future violence for elderly prisoners. The parole board also evaluates if the prisoner meets the criteria for a parole suitability hearing or advance hearing."
