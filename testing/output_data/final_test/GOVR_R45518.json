    "content": "Banks play a crucial role in the financial system by connecting borrowers to savers and allocating funds across the economy. Banking is vital to the U.S. economy's health and growth, but it also involves risks such as credit extension and liabilities. A regulatory system has evolved to balance the benefits of banking with limiting risks. Congress often considers policies related to the banking industry, especially after the transformative period of the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The 2007-2009 financial crisis revealed weaknesses in the financial system and regulatory regime, leading to the implementation of changes such as the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010 to strengthen regulation and address risks. Policymakers responded to the crisis by making adjustments to financial regulation, including bank regulation, to prevent future collapses. The Basel III Accords led to more stringent bank regulations, with concerns raised about the potential costs outweighing the benefits. In response, Congress passed the EGRRCP Act, which modified regulations for small and mid-sized banks. In response to the Basel III Accords, the EGRRCP Act modified regulations for small and mid-sized banks. Dodd-Frank Act regulations have been implemented over the years, with recent proposals for further changes by federal banking regulatory agencies. Regulators are now reevaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of current regulations. The regulators have proposed reducing regulatory burden without compromising effectiveness. Market trends like fintech and rising interest rates impact the banking industry. This report covers banking-related issues such as safety and soundness regulation, consumer protection, and the establishment of banks. This report provides concise background and analysis of prominent bank policy issues, including safety and soundness regulations aimed at ensuring profitability, preventing criminal activities, and protecting against cyberattacks. It also discusses prudential regulation related to capital requirements and the Volcker Rule. Bank failures can cause systemic stress and economic contraction, leading to losses for stakeholders and taxpayers. Regulators use prudential regulation to ensure banks are profitable and reduce the likelihood of failure. Anti-money laundering measures are in place to prevent criminals from using the banking system for illegal activities. Measures to prevent criminals from using the banking system for illegal activities include cybersecurity regulations and capital requirements to reduce the risk of bank failures. Regulatory tools aim to protect banks and customers from cybercrime and ensure banks can absorb losses to avoid systemic stress and economic contraction. The Volcker Rule prohibits banks from engaging in proprietary trading to prevent excessive risks. The EGRRCP Act mandated changes to prudential regulations, with regulators proposing further changes. Policymakers are debating the balance of benefits and costs of these regulations, leading to ongoing congressional attention. Prudential regulation issues are expected to continue drawing focus. A bank's balance sheet consists of assets, liabilities, and capital, mainly comprising loans owed and securities owned. Banks secure funding by issuing liabilities or raising capital, with assets being the value of loans and securities. Capital is raised through methods like issuing equity or convertible bonds. Capital allows banks to absorb losses and meet obligations, helping them avoid failures. Banks must hold sufficient capital to meet obligations and avoid failures. Requirements align with Basel III standards, expressed as minimum ratios between balance sheet items. Capital ratios fall into leverage or risk-weighted types, with the latter assigning a risk weight based on asset riskiness. The risk-weighted ratio assigns a risk weight to assets based on their riskiness, requiring banks to hold more capital for riskier assets. Debate exists on whether the benefits of capital requirements outweigh the potential costs, such as reduced credit availability. Requiring banks to hold higher levels of capital may make funding more expensive, potentially slowing economic growth. A stable banking system with fewer crises may lead to higher economic growth. Estimating regulatory costs and benefits is uncertain due to complex economic modeling. Debate exists on the necessity and effectiveness of risk-weighted ratios in banking. Proponents argue for using both risk-weighted and leverage ratios to address weaknesses. Without risk weighting, banks may hold riskier assets, but using risk-weighted ratios has its own challenges. The use of risk-weighted ratios in banking has been criticized for various reasons. One concern is that the assigned risk weights may not accurately reflect the true risk of assets, leading to misallocation of resources. For example, banks held seemingly low-risk mortgage-backed securities before the crisis, which resulted in unexpected losses. Critics also argue that risk-weighted requirements are unnecessarily complex and favor larger banks over smaller ones in terms of compliance costs. Section 201 of the EGRRCP Act addresses concerns over risk-weighted ratios and compliance costs for community banks. It introduces the Community Bank Leverage Ratio (CBLR) as an option for banks with less than $10 billion in assets to be exempt from risk-based ratios. Banks meeting certain criteria, including a 9% leverage ratio, limited off-balance sheet exposures, and limited securities trading activity, would qualify for the exemption. The FDIC estimates that over 80% of community banks will be eligible for the CBLR. The new optional exemption, the CBLR, introduced by the EGRRCP Act, aims to exempt community banks with less than $10 billion in assets from risk-based ratios. While over 80% of community banks are estimated to be eligible, concerns remain about the 9% leverage ratio being too high. Additionally, there are proposals for a high-leverage-ratio option for banks of all sizes and specific policy issues regarding capital requirements for large banks. The Volcker Rule prohibits depository banks from engaging in proprietary trading or sponsoring hedge funds. Proprietary trading refers to a bank trading securities for its own profit, characterized as \"playing the market\" or \"speculating.\" Banks can engage in proprietary trading for hedging risks or market-making purposes. This activity is risky and has faced restrictions since the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 initially restricted certain banks from securities activities, but over time, regulations and legislative changes expanded permissible activities. The financial crisis led to debates on risky bank activities, resulting in Dodd-Frank placing restrictions and the Volcker Rule prohibiting proprietary trading by banks to reduce riskiness. One rationale for separating deposit-taking and securities investments is to prevent moral hazard. The Volcker Rule aims to prevent banks from taking excessive risks with taxpayer-backed deposits by prohibiting proprietary trading. Critics question its necessity, arguing that proprietary trading did not significantly contribute to the financial crisis. The Volcker Rule aims to prevent banks from engaging in proprietary trading, but critics argue that trading at commercial banks did not play a significant role in the financial crisis. They believe that the rule would not have prevented major events that led to the crisis and that allowing banks to diversify their risk profiles through trading activities could actually reduce the likelihood of failure. The efficiency of the Volcker Rule is debated due to its complexity, compliance burden, and potential impact on beneficial market activities. Regulatory challenges arise in determining how banks can still trade to hedge risks or make markets while complying with the rule. The Volcker Rule aims to prevent banks from engaging in proprietary trading, but critics argue that it may not have prevented the financial crisis. Regulatory challenges arise in determining how banks can still trade to hedge risks or make markets while complying with the rule. Recent actions have been taken to address concerns over the complexity and compliance burden of the Volcker Rule for small banks. The Volcker Rule aims to prevent banks from engaging in proprietary trading, with recent actions taken to address concerns over the compliance burden for small banks. Section 203 of the EGRRCP Act exempted banks with less than $10 billion in assets from certain trading activity limits. In May 2018, agencies proposed to simplify the rule by clarifying definitions and criteria to reduce uncertainties and tailor compliance requirements based on trading activity size. Proponents argue that community banks do not face excessive burdens under the rule. The Volcker Rule aims to prevent banks from engaging in proprietary trading, with recent actions taken to address concerns over the compliance burden for small banks. Proponents argue that community banks can comply with clear policies and procedures in place for review during examinations. Supporters of the Volcker Rule are critical of regulators' proposals, stating that changes could undermine effective supervision and enforcement. Anti-money laundering (AML) regulations aim to prevent criminal exploitation of financial systems to conceal illicit proceeds, with the U.S. Treasury estimating $300 billion in illicit proceeds generated domestically. Despite robust AML efforts, challenges remain in effectively countering money laundering due to diverse illicit methods. The United States faces challenges in combating money laundering, including diverse illicit methods, cyber-related financial crimes, gaps in legal enforcement, and compliance costs. The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) established the foundation for domestic AML in 1970, with subsequent amendments expanding policy tools to combat crime and prevent money laundering. Key elements of the BSA/AML legal framework include customer identification, recordkeeping, reporting, and compliance programs. The BSA/AML policy framework requires financial institutions to file reports with FinCEN for suspicious transactions and large cash transactions. Regulators enforce compliance with BSA/AML through informal or formal actions, including civil fines for violations. Banks must file SARs for transactions over $5,000 suspected of money laundering and CTRs for certain transactions. The accurate reporting of currency transactions over $10,000 to FinCEN is crucial for flagging suspicious activities that may require further investigation. There is ongoing debate on whether the current regulatory framework effectively prevents money laundering without overly burdening banks. Some suggest that certain aspects of the framework could be reformed to reduce compliance costs while maintaining the ability to combat money laundering. Officials from various agencies stress the importance of current reporting requirements in combating money laundering, particularly concerning beneficial owners and shell companies used to conceal ownership and facilitate anonymous transactions. Policymakers are increasingly concerned about the risks posed by opaque beneficial ownership, highlighted by leaks like the \"Panama Papers.\" In May 2018, a new FinCEN regulation increased requirements for banks to conduct customer due diligence and identify beneficial owners. Congress could amend reporting requirements for banks, such as changing reporting thresholds or increasing financial transparency. The 115th Congress proposed increased financial transparency and reporting requirements for beneficial owners in nonbank fields, including real estate, which could indirectly impact the banking industry. Cybersecurity is a major concern for banks and other financial services providers, as maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of physical records and electronic data is crucial for sustaining trust in the industry. The federal government has recognized the importance of cybersecurity in the financial services sector. The federal government has increasingly recognized the importance of cybersecurity in the financial services industry, with federal regulators using their authority to establish standards for cybersecurity in banks. This includes addressing issues such as information security, data breaches, and protection of business records. Laws at both state and federal levels, such as the Dodd-Frank Act, also have provisions related to cybersecurity in financial services. The Dodd-Frank Act, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and Sarbanes-Oxley Act impose obligations on financial institutions to protect customer privacy and comply with cybersecurity regulations. Federal banking regulators issue guidance to help banks evaluate risks and enforce cybersecurity protocols through adjudicatory actions. This signals how agencies interpret their regulatory authority. The FDIC issues consent orders directing banks to assess information technology programs for cybersecurity compliance. The complex regulatory framework for financial services oversight aims to protect against cyberattacks while minimizing cost burdens on banks. Recent successful hacks on banks underscore the importance of ensuring bank cybersecurity. In 2014, JPMorgan Chase experienced a data breach exposing financial records of 76 million households, highlighting the need for bank cybersecurity. Laws and regulations aim to protect consumers from deceptive practices in financial products. The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection oversees these issues, including concerns about consumer access to banking services and the effectiveness of the Community Reinvestment Act. The Community Reinvestment Act aims to ensure banks provide credit to their operating areas. Banks must comply with consumer protection and fair lending laws, including disclosure requirements and prohibitions against unfair practices. Fair lending laws prevent discrimination based on borrower characteristics. The financial crisis highlighted the need for regulators to focus more on consumer protection. The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB with a single mandate to enforce federal consumer financial law and ensure fair, transparent, and competitive markets for financial products and services. The CFPB is the primary regulator for consumer compliance in banks with over $10 billion in assets, while safety and soundness regulation is handled by the prudential regulator. Smaller banks with $10 billion or less in assets have consumer protection authorities divided between the CFPB and a prudential regulator. Consumer protection responsibilities are split between the CFPB and prudential regulators, with the CFPB having limited authority over small banks. Compliance with consumer protection and fair lending laws is crucial for banks to avoid penalties and reputational risks. The CFPB's consumer complaints database can impact customer decisions on financial services. The recent public reaction to Wells Fargo's unauthorized account openings highlights the importance of consumer protection compliance in financial services. New CFPB regulations have impacted banks and nonbank financial institutions offering products like mortgages and credit cards. Lenders are now complying with rules such as ATR/QM and TRID to gather more borrower information and provide necessary disclosures. The CFPB's new regulations, including TRID, require lenders to provide borrowers with mortgage information. Compliance with these rules has increased banks' operational costs, potentially leading to higher costs for consumers or reduced credit availability. Some argue that the CFPB's efforts reduce consumer harm in financial markets, but debates on balancing consumer protection, credit access, and industry costs continue. The banking sector provides essential financial services for households, allowing them to save, make payments, and access credit. However, many U.S. households, especially those with low incomes or lack of credit history, do not use banking services. In 2017, 6.5% of households were unbanked and 18.7% were underbanked, leading some to rely on alternative financial service providers. Some U.S. households do not use banking services, leading them to rely on alternative financial service providers like payday or auto title loans. Prudential regulators are exploring ways to encourage banks to offer small-dollar credit products to improve financial outcomes for the unbanked and underbanked. Policymakers are also looking into making banking more accessible to a greater portion of the population through initiatives like the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977. The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) evaluates how banks meet credit needs in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Regulators issue CRA credits based on qualifying activities like lending and community investments. These credits determine a bank's performance rating, affecting mergers and expansions. Debate surrounds the effectiveness of current CRA regulations. The effectiveness of current CRA regulations is debated, with the banking industry proposing changes to reduce regulatory burden while still meeting goals. The OCC and Treasury have made proposals to address concerns, but consumer advocates fear relief to banks may harm communities. Treasury recommended changes to CRA regulations in April 2018, including revisiting assessment areas and establishing clearer standards. Treasury recommends clearer standards for CRA-eligible activities to provide flexibility and expand eligible loans, investments, and services. They also suggest increasing the timeliness of CRA performance examinations and incorporating performance incentives to encourage more efficient lending activities. The OCC published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in September 2018, seeking public comment on possible changes to CRA regulation. The OCC is considering adopting a quantitative metric-based approach to CRA performance evaluation, redefining assessment areas, expanding CRA-qualifying activities, and simplifying regulations for the banking industry. Over 1,300 comment letters were received in response to the ANPR, with varying opinions on the proposed changes. The majority of U.S. banks are small community banks facing regulatory relief challenges and a decline in numbers. Community banks, with their focus on core banking activities and relationship lending, play a vital role in providing credit to local communities and underserved groups. They differ from large banking organizations in terms of asset size, geographic scope, and complexity of operations. Community banks are important credit sources for local communities and underserved groups, with fewer employees and resources compared to large banks. Advocates argue that current regulations do not balance benefits and costs for community banks, leading to a decline in their numbers and market presence in recent decades. The number of FDIC-insured institutions in the United States has significantly decreased over the years, with a shift towards larger banks. The decline in community banks was mainly due to mergers, failures, and a lack of new banks, with mergers being the primary reason for the decrease in the past 30 years. The number of new banks reporting data to the FDIC has significantly decreased in recent years, with only five new banks reporting in 2018 compared to an average of 130 in the 1990s. Observers attribute this industry consolidation to factors such as regulatory burden on community banks and financial struggles leading to mergers. Consolidation in the banking industry can occur for various reasons, such as financial struggles leading to mergers or successful community banks being bought by larger ones. Changes in banking regulations and restrictions on branching and interstate banking also play a role in driving consolidation. Federal laws restricting banks' ability to open new branches were not substantially deregulated until 1997 through the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994. Consolidation in the banking industry is facilitated by relaxed regulations, allowing for community banks to merge or larger banks to expand. Economies of scale in compliance and banking operations drive industry consolidation, especially with the increasing importance of information technology. Slow growth post-recession and low interest rates deter new firms from entering the banking market. Regulatory exemptions are provided to community banks to reduce their burden. Regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act provide exemptions and reduced compliance costs for community banks. The EGRRCP Act introduced new exemptions and raised thresholds for existing ones. Bank regulators must consider the impact on community banks during rulemaking. Supervision is less burdensome for small banks, with less-frequent examinations and reporting requirements. Advocates for regulatory relief argue that tailoring regulations for community banks may not adequately balance benefits and costs, especially in areas like systemic stability. Community banks pose less risk to the financial system compared to large banks, which were the focus of post-crisis regulations. Some argue that small banks should not be subject to new regulations post-crisis as they pose less systemic risk. However, opponents point out that prudential regulation and consumer protection are also important goals of regulation. They highlight that many small banks failed during the crisis, indicating the need for stricter regulations. Additionally, easing regulations on community banks may be justified if there are economies of scale in regulatory compliance costs. Regulatory complexity can increase compliance costs for small institutions. Empirical evidence on economies of scale in compliance costs is mixed. A bank with $100 million in assets may face a larger burden in expanding its workforce for compliance compared to a bank with $10 billion in assets. Costs and benefits of regulations may differ based on bank size, potentially resulting in costs outweighing benefits for smaller banks. Debates over the appropriate level of tailoring of regulations involve qualitative assessments. Should exemption thresholds be set high for only the largest banks or low for very small banks? The characteristics of community banks and regional banks are often at issue in this debate. The 2007-2009 financial crisis highlighted the issue of \"too big to fail\" financial institutions, prompting policymakers to take steps through the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III Accords to address the problem. Policymakers in the 116th Congress are still grappling with questions about community banks and whether regional banks should receive the same exemptions as community banks. The Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III Accords were implemented to address the \"too big to fail\" (TBTF) issue by subjecting large banks to enhanced regulations, establishing a resolution regime for bank failures, and increasing capital requirements. However, recent changes have seen some large banks facing reduced regulations and proposed lower capital requirements, raising concerns about potential risks. Policymakers are debating whether these changes appropriately balance easing regulations or increasing the risk of large banks taking on excessive risks. Some bank holding companies with trillions in assets are considered \"too big to fail\" (TBTF) due to their interconnectedness and potential government bailout. This belief creates moral hazard as creditors may not monitor the firm's riskiness, leading to excessive risks. TBTF institutions may have incentives to be excessively risky, gain unfair advantages in the market for funding, and expose taxpayers to losses. Market forces likely drive banks to grow in size and complexity, increasing efficiency and offering a greater array of financial products to attract new customers. The trend of banks becoming very large and complex leading up to the financial crisis of 2008 has continued, with nine banks holding over $250 billion in assets by the third quarter of 2018. The worsening of the crisis in 2008 was attributed to TBTF-related problems, where large institutions took on risky investments resulting in significant losses. The U.S. government intervened to stabilize the financial system and individual institutions like Wachovia and Washington Mutual. During the 2008 financial crisis, large institutions like Wachovia and Washington Mutual were acquired to prevent their failure. Bank of America and Citigroup received assistance through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The Dodd-Frank Act aimed to end \"too big to fail\" by implementing new regulatory and resolution regimes for large banks. The Federal Reserve also imposed additional capital requirements on the largest banks. The Dodd-Frank Act established enhanced regulatory standards for large banks, including higher capital and liquidity requirements, stress tests, living wills, and counterparty limits. It also created the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) to facilitate the winding down of complex banking holding companies with nonbank subsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Act established regulatory standards for large banks, including capital requirements and the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) for winding down complex banking holding companies. Critics argue for raising the $50 billion asset threshold, distinguishing between regional and Wall Street banks. The Dodd-Frank Act set regulatory standards for large banks, including capital requirements and the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) for winding down complex banking holding companies. Critics advocate for raising the $50 billion asset threshold, distinguishing between regional and Wall Street banks. P.L. 115-174 exempted banks with $50-100 billion in assets from enhanced prudential regulation, creating four categories of banks based on size and complexity for those with over $100 billion in assets. The Dodd-Frank Act established regulatory standards for large banks, including capital requirements and the Orderly Liquidation Authority. P.L. 115-174 exempted banks with $50-100 billion in assets from enhanced prudential regulation and created four categories of banks based on size and complexity. These categories impose increasingly stringent requirements on banks, with larger banks facing more stringent regulations. Proponents argue that these changes provide necessary regulatory relief, while opponents disagree. The Federal Reserve has proposed to simplify and relax certain aspects of capital ratio requirements for banks, subject to debate. All banks must hold enough capital to meet risk-weighted and unweighted leverage requirements, with very large and complex banks facing additional requirements. Additionally, banks must hold high-quality capital above minimum levels to avoid limitations on capital distributions. Large banks face restrictions on capital distributions, including dividend payments, due to Federal Reserve stress tests. Stress tests ensure banks have enough capital to withstand market stress scenarios, acting as additional capital requirements. Advanced approaches banks must maintain a fixed minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), more stringent than smaller banks. Currently, 19 large U.S. bank holding companies are classified as advanced approaches banks. G-SIBs must meet enhanced SLR requirements. G-SIBs face additional capital requirements, including an enhanced SLR and a risk-weighted capital surcharge based on systemic importance. There is debate over whether these requirements are appropriately calibrated, with proponents arguing for recalibration to reflect varying levels of risk. Critics of relaxing current capital requirements for large banks argue that it could undermine financial stability. The Fed has proposed new requirements for large banks, linking their capital requirements to risk measures. One proposal ties CCB requirements to stress test results, while the other links eSLR requirements to G-SIB systemic importance scores. The new requirements could reduce capital held by some banks but increase it for others. The OCC and FDIC have specific requirements for banks to operate legally, including federal deposit insurance. Policy questions arise regarding fintech companies receiving national bank charters and restrictions on institutions seeking an ILC charter. Traditional commercial banks must have a government-issued charter, such as national bank charters, state bank charters, federal savings association charters, or state savings association charters. Each charter type determines permissible activities, restrictions, and primary federal regulator. This system allows institutions to choose a regulatory regime suited to their business needs and risks. The differences in business models and regulations are vast and varied. Recent advances in technology, specifically in financial technology (fintech), have allowed nonbank companies to engage in traditional banking activities like lending and payment processing. This raises questions about whether these companies should be permitted to perform such activities, considering the benefits and risks they bring. The rise of fintech companies engaging in banking activities has sparked debates on regulation. One proposal suggests offering an OCC national bank charter to certain fintech firms to streamline regulation across states. Currently, nonbank fintech companies face state-level regulations, requiring licenses in each state they operate. Proponents argue that this fragmented regulatory landscape hinders nationwide expansion. The rise of fintech companies has led to debates on regulation, with uncertainties surrounding laws and regulations for certain fintech firms. One proposal is to offer national bank charters to fintech firms engaging in bank-like activities to ease state-by-state regulatory burdens. This proposal was first suggested in 2016 by the then-Comptroller of the Currency Thomas Curry, and the OCC announced in July 2018 that it would consider applications for national bank charters. The OCC announced in July 2018 that it would consider applications for special purpose bank charters from fintech companies engaged in banking activities without taking deposits. These companies would be subject to all laws and regulations applicable to national banks, ensuring safety, soundness, and fairness. The charter would address regulatory uncertainties and allow innovative companies to operate without facing state-by-state burdens. The OCC announced in July 2018 that it would consider applications for special purpose bank charters from fintech companies engaged in banking activities without taking deposits. This would allow innovative companies to operate without facing state-by-state burdens. Proponents argue that the charter would free companies from unnecessary regulatory burdens while opponents raise concerns about potential risks. Opponents challenge OCC's authority to charter fintech companies, claiming it would bypass state consumer protections. Lawsuits were filed against OCC, but a federal court dismissed them due to lack of standing. State regulators have filed lawsuits against the OCC for its decision to charter nonbanks, particularly industrial loan companies (ILCs) that allow commercial firms to own a bank. ILCs are state regulated with the FDIC as the primary federal regulator, and owning an ILC does not necessarily make a parent company a bank holding company (BHC). Commercial firms, including household-name manufacturers like General Motors and General Electric, have owned industrial loan companies (ILCs) to increase sales by providing financing to customers. However, allowing a single company to be involved in both commerce and banking poses potential risks and goes against the historical policy of separating the two activities in the United States. Having a federally insured bank within a commercial organization can lead to conflicts of interest and threaten the safety of the bank. Concerns have been raised about the competitive advantage of combined organizations over purely commercial or banking entities. This issue was highlighted during the public debate surrounding Walmart and Home Depot's unsuccessful attempts to secure an ILC charter between 2005 and. The FDIC imposed moratoriums on granting ILCs deposit insurance due to concerns over conflicts of interest and safety of banks within commercial organizations. Despite the expiration of moratoriums, no new ILC applications have been approved since 2013. Square and SoFi's applications for ILC charters have reignited debates over the risks associated with deposit-taking ILCs. Since 2013, no new ILC applications have been approved, but FDIC chairman Jelena McWilliams has indicated a reconsideration under her leadership. Policymakers will likely examine the extent to which ILCs create innovative credit sources or allow commercial organizations to act as banks with federal safety nets. Market trends affecting banks include the migration of financial activity to nonbanks, the rise of fintech, and a higher interest rate environment. Credit intermediation is a core banking activity involving transforming safe liabilities into higher-risk assets. Traditional banking involves taking deposits from savers to fund loans to borrowers. Nonbank institutions can also perform credit intermediation similar to banks, known as shadow banking. Illiquid assets funded by liquid liabilities can cause difficulty in meeting short-term obligations without selling assets at low prices. Shadow banking operates without government safety nets like deposit insurance or lender of last resort, making it more vulnerable to financial crises due to liquidity risks. This contrasts with traditional banks, which are protected by government programs and prudential regulations. Increased regulatory burden on banks post-financial crisis could lead to a reduced role for banks in credit intermediation and a rise in nonbank involvement. The financial crisis highlighted risks in shadow banking sector instruments like money market mutual funds and repurchase agreements, which can contribute to systemic distress. Money market mutual funds are managed to preserve principal and can be easily converted to cash, while institutions can access deposit-like funding through short-term markets like commercial paper and repurchase agreements. During the financial crisis, previously safe instruments like money market mutual funds and repurchase agreements faced run-like events as funding providers withdrew. Nonbanks also faced liquidity problems due to exposure to mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities. Regulatory changes have been implemented post-crisis, such as requiring certain money market mutual funds to have a floating net asset value. \"Fintech technologies have the potential to change financial services, impacting banks in terms of investment decisions and competition from tech-focused companies. Concerns remain about shadow banking risks due to funding long-term assets with short-term liabilities, potentially leading to run-risk. Regulatory changes post-crisis include requiring some money market mutual funds to have a floating net asset value.\" Certain financial innovations like online marketplace lending, crowdfunding, blockchain, and robo-advising have the potential to improve social and economic outcomes. Fintech can lead to greater efficiency in financial markets, lower prices, and increased access to financial services for customers and small businesses. Automation and digital technology can replace outdated processes, leading to cost savings and affordable services for new customers. Increased accessibility through fintech may benefit underserved groups like low-income, minority, and rural populations. However, fintech also poses risks due to limited operational history and potential inefficiencies. Eliminating intermediaries could lead to consumers taking on risks they don't fully understand. Policymakers are debating the implications of these developments. Policymakers are debating the integration of financial innovations into the system without additional regulation. Existing regulations may accommodate new technologies while protecting against risks, but some argue that regulations may stifle beneficial innovation. Companies incur costs to comply with regulations, potentially impeding development and introduction of beneficial innovation. In some countries, companies are exploring the use of regulatory \"sandbox\" or \"greenhouse\" to work with regulators on new products under a less strict regulatory framework. The CFPB in the United States has introduced a sandbox for companies to experiment with disclosure forms. Concerns exist that current regulations may not adequately address risks posed by new technologies, leading to potential regulatory arbitrage in the fintech sector. Fintech companies operate differently from traditional banks and face cybersecurity concerns related to data privacy and ownership. The Federal Reserve's response to the financial crisis included keeping interest rates low for an extended period. The Federal Reserve responded to slow economic growth by keeping interest rates low for an extended period using tools like quantitative easing. As economic conditions improved, the Fed began to normalize monetary policy by raising interest rates and reducing its balance sheet size. This shift poses a challenge for banks due to interest rate risk, as their assets with fixed rates do not increase with market rates, while liabilities can be repriced quickly. Rising interest rates pose challenges for banks as short-term liabilities can be repriced quickly, leading to increased interest costs. This can stress net income and cause the market value of fixed-rate assets to fall. Banks also face opportunity costs when resources are tied up in low-interest long-term assets instead of making new loans at higher rates. While rising rates could potentially increase bank profitability by widening the net interest margin, this has not materialized during the Federal Reserve's interest rate normalization process in 2018. During 2018, the yield curve flattened as the difference between long-term and short-term rates decreased. Banks and regulators recognize the importance of managing interest rate risk by carefully examining bank balance sheets and planning for different rate change scenarios. Managing risk during a period of interest rate growth is challenging due to historically low rates and maturing loans from previous environments. New loans made in the past decade were in a low rate environment, presenting challenges for banks. In the past decade, banks faced challenges due to low interest rates and managing a mix of loans with different rates. The Federal Reserve's use of new monetary policy tools and growing balance sheet may make controlling interest rate growth challenging."
