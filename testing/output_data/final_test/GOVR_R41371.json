    "content": "Climate change has received significant policy attention internationally and in the United States. A 2013 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change highlighted evidence of climate warming and concerns about severe and rapid changes with catastrophic consequences. The National Academies state that addressing climate change requires a variety of strategies, including mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation efforts focus on reducing greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, emitted through natural processes and human activities such as burning fossil fuels. Some observers are concerned that current mitigation and adaptation strategies may not prevent change quickly enough to avoid extreme climate disruptions. Geoengineering has been suggested as a timely additional method to mitigate climate change by achieving deliberate modifications of the Earth's energy balance to reduce temperatures and counteract human-made climate change on a large scale. Geoengineering technologies aim to modify the Earth's energy balance to mitigate climate change. These technologies are classified into Solar Radiation Management (SRM) and Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) methods. SRM methods, such as enhanced albedo and aerosol injection, could be deployed quickly with immediate climate impact. Solar Radiation Management (SRM) methods can be deployed quickly with immediate climate impact, but they do not reduce greenhouse gases. If a SRM method fails, global warming could resume rapidly. Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) methods, such as afforestation and ocean fertilization, aim to capture and store carbon. The United Nations and IPCC did not mention geoengineering until 2013, when the IPCC addressed the current status of these technologies in their Fifth Assessment Report. The IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) in 2013 discussed geoengineering methods like Solar Radiation Management (SRM) and Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR). While SRM could offset global temperature rise, it may impact the water cycle and not address ocean acidification. CDR has limitations on a global scale, and there is insufficient knowledge on its long-term CO2 offsetting potential. The 112th and 113th Congress have not taken legislative action on geoengineering. In 2009, the House Science and Technology Committee of the 111th Congress held hearings on geoengineering, examining environmental risks, governance issues, research needs, and economic rationales. Foreign governments and scientists from the UK, Germany, and India have considered engaging in geoengineering research. Scientists from Germany and India, along with others, are considering geoengineering technologies due to concerns about slow emissions reductions, climate uncertainties, tipping points, and the impact of aggressive GHG mitigation strategies. Congressional interest in geoengineering focuses on its effectiveness for addressing climate change. Deployment of geoengineering technologies may raise new concerns about government support, oversight, and long-term effects. In 2012, an American citizen conducted a geoengineering experiment. In 2012, an American citizen conducted a geoengineering experiment off the west coast of Canada, potentially violating international conventions. This report serves as a primer on the policy, science, and governance of geoengineering technologies, discussing governmental involvement and oversight. Geoengineering aims to modify the Earth's energy balance to counteract climate change through deliberate modifications. Geoengineering technologies require global input for implementation, with varying levels of control post-implementation. Limited research and minimal deployment exist, prompting calls for more research on feasibility, effectiveness, costs, and impacts before widespread deployment. Some policymakers advocate for governmental oversight to guide research and implementation. Governmental oversight is crucial for guiding research and overseeing potential deployment of geoengineering technologies. Governance structures, both domestic and international, can either support or constrain these activities based on policymakers' decisions. Key questions surrounding governance include risk factors, policy considerations, the timing of government oversight, its form, responsible parties, and the scope of publicly funded research and development. Geoengineering technologies pose risks that must be considered in policy decisions. Uncertainties in technology and social, ethical, legal, and political aspects highlight the need for government oversight before promoting or starting new projects. The effectiveness of these technologies remains uncertain. Some risks associated with geoengineering include the Technology Control Dilemma, which involves foreseeing risks during design but only resolving them through research and development. Flexibility is needed to support research and limit harmful deployment, while reversibility is crucial for risk mitigation. Risk mitigation in geoengineering relies on the ability to quickly cease a technology program and its adverse effects. While all geoengineering options could be abandoned on short notice, secondary effects may not end immediately due to the complexity of the climate system. Choices made in geoengineering methods could also impact other social, economic, and technological decisions related to climate science. Advancing geoengineering options instead of reducing greenhouse gas emissions could lead to adverse effects like ocean acidification. Investing in geoengineering technologies may lead to adverse effects such as ocean acidification, biodiversity stresses, and climate sensitivity shocks. Encapsulated technologies are seen as more ethical due to their non-polluting nature, while non-encapsulated technologies may result in technical uncertainties and complex policy choices. The need for regulatory action in geoengineering may arise from indirect impacts on agro-forestry, species, and habitat. Commercial involvement can drive innovation but may neglect risk assessments, leading to irresponsible behavior. Private-sector engagement in geoengineering may require public subsidies or GHG emission pricing. Ownership models, intellectual property rights, and trade mechanisms are also important considerations. Public attitudes and engagement in governance could impact the future of geoengineering. Perceptions of risks, trust levels, transparency, liabilities, compensation, and investment economies play a role in political feasibility. Public acceptance may require a wider dialogue between scientists and the public. Public acceptance of geoengineering may depend on a range of social, legal, and political factors that vary across countries and cultures. Views on geoengineering can be influenced by religious and ethical concerns, as well as the perceived risks of climate inaction. Public opinion on geoengineering is crucial for its feasibility. The 2009 report by the United Kingdom's Royal Society identified three perspectives on geoengineering: it is seen as a dangerous manipulation of Earth systems, an insurance policy against mitigation failure, or a way to buy time during international negotiations. Public opinion on geoengineering is difficult to gauge but crucial for its feasibility. Geoengineering technologies aim to address climate change by mitigating Earth's warming through various methods like carbon sequestration and sunlight reflection. These technologies are mostly theoretical, require significant funding for deployment, and lack widespread support. The two main categories are carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and solar radiation management (SRM. Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods aim to cool the planet by removing CO2 from the atmosphere through biological, physical, or chemical means. Different approaches include afforestation, ocean fertilization, and carbon capture and storage technology. The duration of carbon storage varies depending on the method used. Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) techniques, such as carbon capture and sequestration, ocean fertilization, afforestation, and enhanced weathering, could take years to impact climate change. While CDR methods may be easier to govern than solar radiation management (SRM) techniques, they are not ideal for immediate climate alteration. CCS involves capturing and storing CO2 to prevent its release into the atmosphere. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology aims to remove CO2 from anthropogenic sources like biomass, bioenergy, and fossil fuels to prevent its release into the atmosphere. The distinction of labeling CCS as a geoengineering technology depends on the carbon source, with fossil fuels often excluded due to being carbon-positive. Biomass can be used for carbon sequestration by burying it in land or the deep ocean, or by pyrolyzing it into biochar. This process can help slow the release of CO2 into the atmosphere and store carbon in the soil for hundreds to thousands of years. Large-scale carbon capture using biomass requires a steady supply and storage location. CCS technology for fossil fuels is well understood for capturing CO2 but less so for permanent sequestration in geologic reservoirs. CCS technology for fossil fuels has not been deployed at a commercial scale due to costs and regulatory requirements. The EPA's 2013 rule to limit CO2 emissions may change incentives for incorporating CCS into new power plant design. Large-scale CO2 sequestration has not been widely implemented for long-term climate change mitigation. Estimates suggest it may take 10-15 years before CCS for fossil fuels is ready for commercial deployment. BECS, a bioenergy generation method coupled with CO2 capture and sequestration, involves planting biomass crops, harvesting for biofuel production, and storing the captured carbon. It is an unproven method similar to CCS technology for fossil fuels. Lessons learned from CCS in the fossil fuels sector may be applicable to BECS deployment, which could take as long or longer to commercialize. BECS deployment may take as long as fossil-fuel CCS. Challenges include the lack of a regulatory framework for CO2 sequestration. An integrated structure is needed for large-scale CCS, addressing ownership, sequestration sites, leakage, liability, monitoring, and pipeline infrastructure. Concerns exist that widespread CCS implementation could reduce the incentive to reduce fossil fuel use. BECS and bioenergy could reduce motivation to cut fossil fuel use, but BECS may be seen as \"carbon-negative\" compared to CCS from fossil fuels. Concerns include potential contamination of drinking water from CO2 storage. The EPA has regulations for geologic sequestration. Ocean fertilization speeds up carbon sequestration by phytoplankton. Ocean fertilization involves adding iron to certain parts of the ocean to enhance phytoplankton growth, which can help remove carbon from the air. The cost of ocean fertilization is estimated to be between $30 to $300 per ton of carbon sequestered. However, the ecological, economic, and climatological impacts of ocean fertilization are uncertain. Some believe it may enhance fish stocks and cool the atmosphere, while others are concerned about ocean acidification, greenhouse gas emissions, and oxygen reduction. Critics argue that ocean fertilization is not an effective long-term solution for combating climate change. Ocean fertilization is a technique that involves adding iron to the ocean to enhance phytoplankton growth for carbon sequestration. Studies have not proven its long-term effectiveness, and further research is needed to address questions about phytoplankton growth, carbon sequestration duration, and ecosystem disruptions. There are no precedents for large-scale ocean fertilization, and its potential as a carbon credit is uncertain due to the lack of legal frameworks. Any carbon credits from ocean fertilization would currently have to be used in a voluntary carbon market. Afforestation involves planting tree seedlings on sites without trees for several years, primarily for carbon sequestration. Forest communities can store 10 times more carbon than non-forest communities for decades to hundreds of years. Other benefits include erosion control, wildlife habitat, and modifying local climates. Challenges include measuring carbon storage and landowners' reluctance to grow trees on private land. Afforestation involves planting tree seedlings on sites without trees primarily for carbon sequestration. Challenges include landowners' reluctance to grow trees on private land for extensive periods, potential drawbacks such as unexpected CO2 releases from newly forested lands, and significant costs for afforestation. The amount and rate of CO2 sequestration depend on various factors like tree species, climate, soil type, and management practices. Afforestation projects involve planting tree seedlings on sites without trees for carbon sequestration. The estimated sequestration potential ranges from 2.2 to 9.5 metric tons of CO2 per acre per year, taking at least 20 years to see benefits. Most projects occur on marginal croplands, with potential for 60-65 million acres of U.S. agricultural land to be converted to woodlands by 2050. Climate changes may impact the forestry species planted at afforestation sites. The cost of an afforestation project can vary depending on the site's previous land use and terrain, ranging from $65 to $200 per acre. Enhanced weathering, a method to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, involves spreading crushed olivine on agricultural and forested lands. However, there is a lack of literature on how to conduct such projects and their environmental implications. This technique would require large amounts of rocks to be mined, ground, and transported. Enhanced weathering projects involve spreading crushed olivine on agricultural and forested lands, requiring significant amounts of rocks to be mined, ground, and transported. Further research is needed to assess the potential benefits and drawbacks of this technology, including its scale, cost, energy requirements, and environmental consequences. Decisions would need to be made on landscape alterations, disposal of disintegrated material, and project funding. Long-term adverse impacts on air quality, water quality, and aquatic life may occur. Solar radiation management methods aim to reduce incoming solar radiation by enhancing albedo, with no effect on GHG emission rates. Land-based methods like desert reflectors and cloud-based approaches are used for SRM. Solar radiation management (SRM) methods involve modifying albedo through various land, cloud, stratosphere, and space-based techniques. The effectiveness of SRM depends on location, altitude, and atmospheric properties. SRM methods are considered fast and cheap but unproven on a large scale. There are calls for research and oversight programs to evaluate SRM technologies before potential hasty deployment to avoid unforeseen consequences. Solar radiation management (SRM) techniques could have unintended consequences, leading to system failure, changes in climate patterns, ozone depletion, and preservation of non-CO2 greenhouse gases. Some advocate for constraints on SRM research due to environmental risks. Solar radiation management (SRM) techniques applied in the stratosphere or space can extend the atmospheric lifetime of non-CO2 greenhouse gases. Societies may invest less in permanent GHG emission reduction solutions if they rely on SRM for quick relief. Concerns about unknown effects of large-scale geoengineering exist. Some widely discussed SRM techniques include enhanced albedo, aerosol injection, and space-based reflectors. Increasing surface reflectivity is one method to modify the planet's temperature. Increasing surface reflectivity, or albedo, can limit temperature increases by directing more solar radiation back toward space. Urban areas are a key target for enhancing albedo, with methods like painting roofs and paved areas white. While this could cost billions for materials and labor, it can save money on energy costs. Drawbacks include glare and aesthetic concerns. The U.S. Department of Energy has reduced building heating and cooling costs by 70% annually with cool roofs. Enhancing surface albedo can have various benefits such as improving the aesthetic appeal of roofs and paved areas, reducing energy costs in colder climates, and potentially decreasing the use of asphalt. New techniques like genetic engineering of plants and covering oceans with reflective surfaces are being considered to further enhance albedo. Cloud whitening is also proposed as a method to increase albedo. Cloud whitening is a proposed method for enhancing albedo by dispersing cloud-condensation nuclei in desired areas using aircraft, ships, or unmanned seacraft. Satellites could measure cloud albedo and determine cooling needs. Potential impacts on marine ecosystems, ocean currents, and precipitation patterns need further research. The long-term implications of cloud whitening are not fully understood. Aerosol injection involves dispersing aerosols like sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere to cool the Earth by reflecting solar radiation. The cost for this method could be several billion dollars annually, but its effectiveness has not been tested. It aims to mimic the cooling effects of volcanic eruptions. Aerosol injection simulations are based on data from the Mount Pinatubo eruption in 1991, which temporarily cooled global temperatures. Sulfur releases from eruptions have short-term cooling impacts, requiring multiple injections over decades to offset greenhouse gas effects. Benefits include potential ice melting reduction, but risks like drought in Africa and Asia and reduced agricultural productivity exist. Space-based reflectors are proposed as a geoengineering technology to reduce solar radiation. Various shield materials and locations have been suggested, but further research is needed to assess costs and implementation steps. The use of space-based reflectors for geoengineering to reduce solar radiation requires further research to assess costs, implementation steps, maintenance needs, disposal, and ecological impacts. Questions remain about the deployment scale, maturity of the science behind it, and potential consequences if the shield fails. One study estimates the cost of fully reversing global warming with a shield over 25 years to be in the trillions. Policymakers must consider various factors before deciding on pursuing or constraining geoengineering research and deployment activities. Deployment activities for geoengineering are influenced by social, legal, political, scientific, and technical factors, as well as progress on climate-related policies. The debate on government oversight of geoengineering activities and potential responses is discussed. One approach is to maintain the status quo, which involves modest funding for research, limited regulation, and a lack of comprehensive oversight. Advocates of this approach believe private industry and commercial development are best for determining the merits of geoengineering. Advocates of maintaining the status quo believe that private industry and commercial development are best suited to determine the merits of geoengineering research and entrepreneurship. They argue that current regulations for greenhouse gas emission reductions are sufficient to drive market development towards climate engineering if needed. They also emphasize that existing research in marine and atmospheric science, carbon capture, and adaptation strategies can pave the way for technological advancements, suggesting that excessive government intervention may hinder progress. Governments may need to decide on the appropriate level of intervention in geoengineering activities. Avoiding governmental support could be seen as endorsing the status quo, while new support may be viewed as accepting a potentially harmful technology. Public opinion and engagement may already be skeptical due to uncertainties and cost concerns. Policymakers must weigh the arguments for abstention or more aggressive action in determining the future of geoengineering. One possible policy proposal for government oversight of geoengineering involves monitoring and regulating research and deployment activities. Policymakers must determine when to intervene based on the harms and effects they wish to address. Criteria for oversight include the international scope of impacts and introduction of hazardous materials. The impacts of geoengineering include introducing hazardous materials into the environment, disrupting ecosystems, and the potential perturbation and duration of the activity. Suggestions for oversight include setting up an international panel of scientific experts for insight to policymakers, but criticism exists for excluding social scientists, ethics analysts, and the public. Governments should consider evaluating geoengineering research and deployment activities similar to the National Environmental Policy Act. Different policies may be needed to address concerns about the new and uncertain impacts of geoengineering technologies on a broad range of stakeholders. The global impacts of geoengineering activities, involving various actors, may have unevenly distributed benefits and risks. Different technologies and stages of research may require varying oversight methods. Domestic laws may govern the development and implementation of Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) technologies. Implementation of air capture, biochar, biomass sequestration, and terrestrial weathering may be governed by existing U.S. laws. However, ocean-based CDR technologies like ocean fertilization may not be regulated by U.S. law and could have significant cross-border effects. SRM technologies are likely to have substantial impacts across national boundaries. Land surface albedo modification may be manageable under current regulations. Regulatory frameworks for geoengineering technologies must be flexible to cover the full research and deployment cycle, with different oversight needs at various stages. Transboundary issues may arise with certain technologies, requiring international cooperation. Scientists emphasize the importance of addressing environmental impacts and negative consequences early in the development process. Technological development of geoengineering technologies may lead to negative social and economic consequences, especially during small-scale field trials. Different environments may require varying oversight methods, with some falling under existing laws and treaties regulating specific environments. International cooperation is essential for regulating environments like the high seas, transboundary and upper atmosphere, or outer space. Government oversight may include imposing a moratorium or ban on certain geoengineering research or deployment practices. Advocates of a moratorium or ban on geoengineering technologies argue that the science is uncertain and risky, potential impacts are unevenly distributed, research could distract from mitigation efforts, and it could be used as a delaying tactic. Others believe that such restrictions would hinder ongoing research and development in the field. The potential ban on geoengineering technologies could inhibit ongoing research and development, making it difficult to gather necessary information for informed judgments. It may also fail to deter irresponsible parties from engaging in potentially dangerous experimentation due to unclear legal frameworks. In response to the potential ban on geoengineering technologies, suggestions have been made for new legal frameworks to support coordinated research and enforce normative standards. There is debate over whether oversight should be at a local, national, or international level, with different approaches outlined for government oversight including sub-national, national, and international methods. The United States may allow states to develop their own policies for governing geoengineering activities. The United States may allow states to develop their own policies for governing geoengineering activities, but the potential impacts across state boundaries may require a more comprehensive federal policy. The diversity of state policies could pose challenges for private actors, who prefer operating under a single set of laws. The U.S. government has experience in developing policies for emerging technologies, which could serve as best practices for effective regulation. Emerging high-risk technologies like geoengineering face challenges in obtaining private sector financing and research support due to uncertainty and risks. Reasons for lack of private sector involvement include aversion to long-term technical uncertainty, absence of carbon price mechanism, uncertainty over commercial use, and concerns about social, economic, and environmental risks. Emerging technologies like geoengineering may need public subsidies to spur development, while also facing regulatory challenges due to hazards and unintended consequences. Federal laws may apply to domestic geoengineering practices, depending on the type, location, and sponsor of the activity. The federal government could expand existing laws or develop new ones to address geoengineering activities. Administrative agencies may interpret their authority to create rules for specific geoengineering activities. Existing federal laws may already affect activities like subterranean carbon dioxide sequestration. The EPA has issued draft rules regulating CO2 injection for geological sequestration under the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act may require reporting on greenhouse gas emissions from carbon dioxide injection and geologic sequestration. The Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act prohibits unpermitted ocean dumping and permits may be issued by the EPA to prevent degradation of the marine environment. NOAA is authorized to conduct research on ocean resources. MPRSA authorizes NOAA to conduct general research on ocean resources and the EPA to conduct research related to phasing out ocean disposal activities. Stratospheric aerosol injection may implicate the ozone depletion provisions of the Clean Air Act. The EPA must adjust phase-out schedules for ozone-depleting substances according to changes in the Montreal Protocol schedules. Additionally, states have started taking action in the absence of federal legislation. Some states are developing their own policies on geoengineering activities due to minimal federal efforts. Federal agencies lack a coordinated research strategy and do not believe it is necessary to coordinate efforts at this time. There are potential roles for these entities in national geoengineering policies. In assessing national geoengineering policies, policymakers may consider involving multiple agencies with different expertise and authorities. They can perform functions such as conducting research, facilitating information exchange, and funding activities related to geoengineering. The need to expand or restrict legislative authority for federal agencies is also a consideration. The curr_chunk discusses the various functions related to geoengineering, including information exchange, funding, monitoring, regulations, and enforcement. It highlights the lack of a single federal entity authorized to address all aspects of geoengineering technologies. Suggestions for international cooperation include a multilateral agreement to supplement existing treaties or address issues like climate change. The curr_chunk discusses the strengths and weaknesses of international treaties in addressing emerging science on a global level. Treaties can establish normative standards, create enforcement mechanisms, enhance transparency, and facilitate multilateral discussions. However, the conservative nature of treaty negotiations may lead to vague language or non-participation by nations if commitments are perceived as too high. Developing international consensus on norms and commitments in emerging science can be challenging due to cultural, political, environmental, and economic diversity among nations. This process may be time-intensive and risk stalemate, leading some to propose a moratorium on research and deployment activities. Implementing international agreements can also be difficult to monitor and enforce effectively, with countries hesitant to create compliance mechanisms and new institutions. Countries may resist creating compliance mechanisms and new international institutions to protect their sovereignty and ability to address local needs. International agreements may be ineffective without such mechanisms, especially in resolving disputes involving private actors. While global coordination for geoengineering activities is beneficial, local and national laws may still be necessary. Despite the benefits of global coordination for geoengineering activities, local and national laws may still be required to address aspects that cannot be handled on an international scale. While no multilateral treaty specifically targeting geoengineering has been proposed, existing international agreements and customary international law principles may come into play. Governments could potentially use these principles to develop a more comprehensive international approach to geoengineering through new agreements or expansions of existing ones. Customary international law dictates that countries have a duty not to cause significant transboundary harm, which could be relevant to geoengineering projects. This law also influences how countries view international agreements. The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties establishes that signatories must adhere to international agreements unless they clearly state otherwise. Non-parties to an agreement are not bound by its rights and obligations. International agreements on climate change are important for geoengineering projects. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was opened for signature in 1992 and entered into force in 1994. Parties to the UNFCCC are required to gather and share information on greenhouse gas emissions, national policies, and best practices, launch national strategies for addressing emissions, and cooperate in preparing for climate change impacts. The agreement does not explicitly address geoengineering projects. The Kyoto Protocol, opened for signature in 1997 and in force since 2005, commits high-income parties to reduce greenhouse gas emissions until 2012. The United States signed but did not ratify the Protocol. The Convention on Biological Diversity, opened for signature in 1992 and in force since 1993, allows countries to exploit their resources while ensuring environmental protection. The 10th Conference of the Parties to the CBD adopted provisions in October 2010 calling for parties to abstain from geoengineering activities that may affect biodiversity unless risks and impacts have been fully considered. The COP also affirmed its earlier decision regarding ocean fertilization activities, requesting parties to ensure they do not take place without adequate scientific justification. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) establishes a legal regime governing activities on, over, and under the world's oceans and defines countries' jurisdictions over, and rights of access to, the oceans and their resources. Despite not being a party to UNCLOS, the United States views many of its provisions as customary international law. Article 194 of the UNCLOS imposes a duty on parties to prevent, reduce, and control pollution of the marine environment from any source. Pollution is defined as any human-driven introduction of substances or energy into the marine environment that harms living resources, marine life, human health, marine activities, or sea water quality. This provision is significant for geoengineering projects that may pollute the marine environment. Once pollution occurs, the responsible country must control and limit its spread according to Article 194. Article 192 of the UNCLOS imposes an obligation on countries to protect the marine environment. Ocean fertilization and geoengineering activities must not have a negative impact on the marine ecosystem. Large-scale ocean fertilization projects could implicate UNCLOS provisions, including Article 56 and 238 through 241. The London Convention and London Protocol address marine pollution prevention, with the United States being a party to the former but not the latter. The London Protocol, established in 1974, aims to prevent sea pollution by prohibiting the dumping of harmful substances. However, certain geoengineering projects may not violate these prohibitions if they serve a different purpose. Recent amendments have addressed specific technologies, such as sub-seabed carbon dioxide sequestration. The London Protocol, established in 1974, aims to prevent sea pollution by prohibiting the dumping of harmful substances. Recent amendments have addressed specific technologies, such as sub-seabed carbon dioxide sequestration. In 2008, Resolution LC-LP.1 was adopted, stating that ocean fertilization research activities do not constitute dumping under the London Convention and Protocol. Additionally, the use of SRM technologies may implicate international agreements such as the Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques (ENMOD). The United States became a party to ENMOD in 1979, which aims to prohibit the military or hostile use of environmental modification techniques with severe effects. The Convention defines these techniques as deliberate manipulation of natural processes to change the Earth's dynamics, composition, or structure. Parties can still use these techniques for peaceful purposes and exchange scientific information. The Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) aims to limit and reduce air pollutants to combat transboundary pollution. Parties commit to preventing harmful effects on health, the environment, and property in other countries. It is unclear which geoengineering activities CLRTAP would regulate. The Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, along with the Montreal Protocol, aims to control ozone-depleting substances. The United States is a party to both agreements and has agreed to all amendments. Parties are expected to cooperate to understand the effects of human activities on the ozone layer. Certain stratospheric aerosol injection technologies for geoengineering, if they pose a risk to the ozone layer, could implicate phase-out provisions of the Vienna Convention and the Montreal Protocol. No international organization currently has a direct mandate to address all possible geoengineering activities, but existing institutions could potentially be modified to fulfill this role. Assessing the ideal structure for an international institution to oversee geoengineering activities is challenging due to limited understanding of the technologies. Debate exists over creating a new body or assigning jurisdiction to an existing one, considering factors like functions, membership, resources, and subject-area jurisdiction. Some suggest a multilateral body like the United Nations or its specialized agencies should oversee global geoengineering activities due to their international reach, resources, and legitimacy. Some suggest the United Nations or its specialized agencies oversee global geoengineering due to their international reach, resources, and legitimacy. However, concerns exist about the slow and complicated U.N. process, potential bias, and conflicts of interest. Some international organizations like plurilateral or ad hoc bodies, such as the G-20 or Major Economies Forum, could be involved in geoengineering to facilitate dialogue and coordination on specific issues. However, their limited membership may undermine the legitimacy of their response, leading to demands for adequate representation from excluded countries. The use of existing plurilateral groups, multilateral institutions, intergovernmental organizations like the International Energy Association (IEA), and international nongovernmental organizations like the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) could be involved in addressing issues related to energy security, economic development, and environmental protection. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) develops international standards in response to specific needs identified by stakeholders. ISO members have public review procedures for feedback incorporation, and standards must be approved by at least two-thirds of national members to become ISO International Standards. While the ISO has not yet developed comprehensive standards for geoengineering, it has created standards for air quality, water quality, and greenhouse gas emissions reporting. International research consortia play a crucial role in setting research priorities, evaluating emerging technologies, coordinating research efforts, collaborating with various stakeholders, and developing international codes of practice for governing research in new technologies. Geoengineering research could be supported by international consortia to ensure transparency and guidance across different sectors. Collaboration among experts and stakeholders would focus on assessing risks, acceptability, and oversight of geoengineering technologies. This approach aims to build international policy norms from the ground up, integrating governance with ongoing scientific research to address potential hazards. Currently, there is no collaborative mechanism applicable to geoengineering, unlike other scientific collaborations such as CERN and the Human Genome Project. International bodies overseeing geoengineering may lack the authority to fully regulate or enforce compliance with their terms. Cooperation among members is crucial for adherence to international agreements or dispute settlement mechanisms, like the International Court of Justice. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the World Trade Organization have dispute settlement processes for non-compliance with international agreements. The ICJ's judgments can be enforced by the U.N. Security Council, while the WTO Dispute Settlement Body authorizes retaliatory measures for non-compliance with WTO decisions. Geoengineering is an emerging field that requires careful deliberation by policymakers and may necessitate the development or amendment of international agreements, laws, or regulations. Many geoengineering technologies are still in the conceptual and research stages, with limited studies on their cost, environmental effects, and legal implications. If deployed, these technologies have the potential to significantly impact global temperatures. Some foreign governments and private entities are interested in geoengineering projects due to slow progress in greenhouse gas reductions and concerns over climate tipping points. Limited federal involvement in the US has led to piecemeal approaches to addressing geoengineering. If the US government decides to address geoengineering at the federal level, several approaches are possible. The government can influence geoengineering policy development through federal agencies and states, impose moratoriums on certain technologies, develop national policies, and collaborate internationally. Its role in shaping new technologies has been seen in areas like nanotechnology and genetic engineering."
