    "content": "Since the 1940s, the San Joaquin River in Central California has seen a decline in Chinook salmon populations due to water diversion for agriculture by the Bureau of Reclamation's Friant Dam. In 1988, conservation and fishing groups sued the Bureau for river restoration to support salmon recovery. A U.S. District Court judge ruled that the dam's operation violates state law by destroying downstream habitats. In 2006, a Settlement Agreement was reached regarding the operation of Friant Dam in California, which requires new water releases to restore fisheries in the San Joaquin River. Congressional authorization and appropriations are needed for full implementation of the Settlement. The Settlement Agreement reached in 2006 requires new water releases from Friant Dam to restore fisheries in the San Joaquin River. Increased water flows for restoration would reduce diversions for off-stream purposes like irrigation and hydropower. Water deliveries would be reduced, but not necessarily one-for-one, as flood water releases in wet years could provide some restoration flows. No water would be released for restoration in the driest years, avoiding reductions in deliveries to Friant contractors. The Settlement Agreement in 2006 requires new water releases from Friant Dam to restore fisheries in the San Joaquin River. Water deliveries to Friant water contractors may be reduced depending on various factors, impacting surface and groundwater supplies in the area. Despite some opposition, the majority of stakeholders support the Settlement Agreement. The Settlement Agreement in 2006 requires new water releases from Friant Dam to restore fisheries in the San Joaquin River. Environmental, fisheries, and community groups support the Settlement Agreement to avoid trial. Congressional authorization and appropriations are needed for full implementation, with concerns about potential court-ordered remedies. Key legislative issues include financing Settlement implementation and balancing fisheries restoration with water management goals. Addressing concerns of non-party stakeholders without disrupting the agreement is also a challenge. The report provides an overview of topics related to the Settlement in the lawsuit Natural Resources Defense Council v. Rodgers, involving the operation of Friant Dam on the San Joaquin River. It discusses the legal history, pending legislation, fisheries restoration, water management, funding, economic, and third party issues. The Settlement relates to other California water supply and resource management issues. Friant Dam and the Friant Division of the Central Valley Project are located in the southern portion of the San Joaquin Valley, with the river flowing north to the San Joaquin and Sacramento Rivers Delta. The San Joaquin Valley (SJV) is a region extending 250 miles from Stockton to Bakersfield, known for its agriculture. Growers in the area rely on irrigation from the Friant Division for water supply, along with groundwater. The region faces economic challenges but is home to five of the nation's most productive agricultural counties. The San Joaquin Valley (SJV) is home to five of the nation's top agricultural counties, including Fresno, Tulare, Kern, and Merced. The region faces environmental challenges, such as the restoration of the San Joaquin River. The Central Valley Project (CVP) is a reclamation project managed by the Bureau of Reclamation, with the Friant Dam storing water for irrigation purposes. The Friant Division, managed by Reclamation, diverts water from the San Joaquin River for irrigation in Fresno, Kern, Madera, Merced, and Tulare counties. The operation of Friant Dam has led to the drying up of parts of the river and the destruction of native fish species. The Friant Division diverts water from the San Joaquin River for irrigation in several counties, supporting a diverse agricultural economy. However, water diversions have led to the decline of native fish species, including spring-run Chinook salmon in the Upper San Joaquin River. The San Joaquin River historically had significant salmon spawning runs, but Central Valley spring-run Chinook salmon are now extinct in the river due to dam construction. Native fall and late-fall-run Chinook salmon still spawn in tributaries like the Mokelumne, Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers at lower elevations. Artificial production of fall-run Chinook salmon by California Department of Fish and Game hatcheries also contributes to the population. The production of fall-run Chinook salmon by California Department of Fish and Game hatcheries on the Tuolumne, Mokelumne, and Merced Rivers is a concern. Litigation involving the San Joaquin River has a long history, with the most recent Settlement Agreement dating back to a 1988 lawsuit led by environmental groups and anglers. The plaintiffs argued that Reclamation violated various laws including NEPA, ESA, and the Reclamation Act of 1902 by not providing enough water in the river to protect fish below the dam. Litigation on this issue has been ongoing in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California since 1988. In 2004, the District Court found that Reclamation had violated state law by not providing enough water in the San Joaquin River to protect fish populations. This led to settlement negotiations in 2005 and a tentative agreement in June 2006. The Settlement Agreement for the San Joaquin River was finalized in September 2006 and accepted by the District Court in October 2006. The goals of the Settlement are to restore fish populations in the river and minimize water supply impacts to Friant water contractors. Various actions are outlined in the Settlement, some of which require congressional authorization and funding. Authorization and appropriations are needed for the implementation of the Settlement Agreement for the San Joaquin River. If legislation is not enacted by December 31, 2006, the Settlement may become void. Despite introducing implementation legislation, it has not been enacted yet. Third parties have objected to the legislative proposal and timeline set by the Settlement Agreement. An agreement was reached with third parties to support new legislation in exchange for addressing their interests. However, opposition to the Settlement legislation grew as new parties emerged. The bills for San Joaquin River restoration were introduced in Congress but no action was taken before adjournment. They were reintroduced in the next Congress, with hearings held in both houses. The San Joaquin Settlement legislation, introduced in Congress, includes provisions for federal funding of projects costing between $250 million and $1.1 billion. Key points of contention include budgetary offsets under congressional PAYGO rules and the viability of achieving water management goals. Funding mechanisms in the legislation may face challenges in the current budget climate. The San Joaquin Settlement legislation aims to end a 19-year lawsuit and may divert funds from salmon restoration projects. Concerns arise over potential limitations on water exports from the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers Delta, impacting water management goals. Failure to act on the legislation could lead to court-ordered remedies with severe consequences for water users and third parties. The San Joaquin Settlement aims to restore fish populations in the river below Friant Dam and reduce adverse water supply impacts for Friant Division contractors. Historical dam operations caused parts of the river to dry up, leading to detrimental effects on downstream fisheries. The parties agreed to achieve the Restoration Goal by 2025, recognizing that it may not solve all issues. The parties agreed to cooperate in good faith to achieve the dual goals of the Settlement, which includes restoring San Joaquin River fisheries through channel and structural improvements below Friant Dam. The Settlement establishes a framework for achieving these goals through activities like environmental review, design, and construction. The Settlement outlines Phase I and Phase II improvements to the San Joaquin River below Friant Dam, including channel modifications, fish passage enhancements, and gravel pit isolation. These improvements must be completed by specific deadlines, subject to appropriations and unforeseen events. Additionally, the Settlement calls for Restoration Flows, which involve additional water releases from the Dam. The Settlement calls for specific \"Restoration Flows\" from Friant Dam, with base flows for different water year types. The Secretary can also provide \"buffer flows\" up to 10% of restoration flows. Water may be purchased to achieve restoration goals and mitigate seepage losses. Chinook salmon reintroduction is planned by spring 2012. There is no comprehensive program for restoring the San Joaquin River watershed. The Settlement relies on existing salmon restoration studies conducted by various sources, leading to restoration flow levels established under the program. Uncertainties remain regarding historical spring-run Chinook salmon levels and their potential reintroduction. The Settlement relies on existing salmon restoration studies to establish flow levels, but uncertainties remain about successfully reintroducing Chinook salmon to the Upper San Joaquin River due to various factors like water flow, fish passage, water quality, and genetics. The restoration of Chinook salmon in the Upper San Joaquin River faces challenges due to factors like water flow, fish passage, water quality, and genetics. The success of this restoration effort is uncertain, as various factors beyond human control may not be favorable every year, potentially leading to population stress and decline. The complexity of the restoration project is further compounded by the size of the area to be restored, the extreme degradation of existing habitat, and the potential impact of climate change on the salmon population. Concerted attempts to restore salmon habitat in the Sacramento and San Joaquin River basins have shown some success, but total success is difficult to claim in the short time these efforts have been underway. Extensive restoration efforts in the Klamath River Basin have maintained runs and avoided listing under the federal ESA, while nearby populations have been listed. The water management goal outlined in the Settlement includes developing a plan for recirculation, recapture, reuse, and exchange of water. The Settlement aims to establish a plan for recirculating, recapturing, reusing, and exchanging Restoration flows to minimize impacts on Friant long-term contractors. It also introduces a \"Recovered Water Account\" to compensate for water losses, priced at $10 per acre-foot. The Secretary of the Interior will monitor water deliveries to contractors and ensure any reductions are offset by various water management strategies. Concerns exist about potential reductions in water deliveries for off-stream purposes. The Settlement aims to establish a plan for managing restoration flows to minimize impacts on Friant long-term contractors. Concerns exist about potential reductions in water deliveries for off-stream purposes, but the relationship between increased restoration flows and water delivery diversions may not result in a direct 1:1 trade-off. Friant managers have flexibility in balancing deliveries with other available sources, and reductions in deliveries will depend on factors such as water flow recommendations and the type of water year declared. The Settlement aims to manage restoration flows to minimize impacts on Friant long-term contractors. Water flow recommendations, type of water year declared, water contract firmness, mitigation efforts, and available water from the Recovered Water Account will affect individual water users. Annual water supplies for the Friant Division Service Area could be 15-16% less under the Settlement compared to current protocols. The Settlement aims to reduce water supply by an average of 15-16%, with potential reductions ranging from no reduction to 34% in some years. The total annual reduction in water volume is estimated to be 204-225 thousand acre-feet, including both contract and temporary water deliveries. The average annual reduction in long-term water service contract deliveries is estimated at 144 thousand acre-feet. The Settlement aims to reduce water supply by an average of 15-16%, with potential reductions ranging from no reduction to 34% in some years. Deliveries under the Settlement are estimated at 144 taf less than average annual long-term contract supplies. Almost half of Friant contractors have access to other surface water supplies, and 75% use groundwater. Reductions in deliveries represent a decrease in one of multiple supplies for three-quarters of contractors, varying based on water service contracts. Districts with Class I contracts may experience reduced deliveries depending on contract firmness. The Settlement aims to reduce water supply by an average of 15-16%, with potential reductions ranging from 5% to 27% for Friant water districts. These reductions would affect districts without adequate groundwater supplies, impacting their Friant Division contract supplies. The reduction in deliveries under the Settlement would represent a decrease in one of their water sources. The Settlement aims to reduce water supply by 15-16%, impacting Friant water districts without adequate groundwater supplies. This reduction would decrease one of their water sources, leading to uncertainties about how water users will adapt and mitigate the lower deliveries. Various measures like water conservation, efficiency, transfers, and new infrastructure could partially offset the reductions, but the extent and cost of these measures remain unclear. The Settlement includes new financing mechanisms for San Joaquin restoration legislation (H.R. 24 and S. 27) that authorize appropriations and funding mechanisms not subject to annual appropriations by Congress. These mechanisms would provide dedicated funding to implement the agreement. The funding provisions differ somewhat from the proposed legislation but aim to establish stable funding sources. The funding provisions in H.R. 24 and S. 27 for the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act rely on redirecting federal revenues from the Friant Division into a new restoration account. The total federal share of the program is estimated at $500 million, with $430 million allocated through 2017 and an additional $70 million through 2026. The legislation faces challenges due to its financing provisions, requiring offsets for new direct spending under congressional rules. Restoration sponsors are working to reduce the bill's budget score to minimize the offset needed. The San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act's financing formulas may need new agreement among settling parties, potentially difficult. Water supply impacts could have positive and negative economic consequences, with the largest negative effect on agriculture in the short term. Efforts to reduce water supply losses may not fully mitigate agricultural production losses. However, increased recreational expenditures, investment in river restoration, and improved downstream water supply and quality could benefit the region. The Settlement will also impact communities and interests not party to the agreement. The San Joaquin River Settlement may have negative impacts on Friant Division water users, downstream communities, and landowners. Increased water releases could affect areas far from the Friant Division Service Area. Changes in groundwater quality, availability, and water prices could also occur for communities near Friant Division lands. Additionally, funding for the Settlement may divert resources from salmon restoration projects in other river basins. The San Joaquin River restoration may impact Trinity River restoration funding and raise concerns about groundwater supply impacts in the productive farming region of the San Joaquin Valley. The value of agricultural production in five SJV counties receiving water from the Friant Division totaled $9.3 billion in 2002, accounting for a significant portion of California's agriculture production. Multiple studies have examined the potential impacts of water losses on the agricultural sector. Multiple studies have examined the impacts of water losses on the agricultural sector in California, with differences in reporting criteria and analytical approaches making comparisons challenging. Economic models suggest that reduced irrigation water supplies could lower farm revenue due to crop acreage and yield reductions. Studies focusing on potential reductions in the San Joaquin Valley indicate significant economic effects. Studies on the impacts of water reductions in the San Joaquin Valley show varying estimated costs and benefits, with potential lower farm profits, higher operating costs, and negative economic impacts. Estimates range from $40-$180 million per year in potential loss of gross farm revenue, with some studies suggesting offsetting economic and societal benefits. Only two studies reviewed estimate changes in farm profits and costs, with varying scenarios. One study suggests profit losses ranging from 0.4% to 6.7% in different water conditions, while another shows a 2% profit loss with water trading. Farm costs could increase by $110 million in a drought year according to one study, while another predicts additional costs of $11 million for crop producers and $2 million for dairies by 2025. Some studies also project job losses and changes in regional economic conditions. The economic impact of the Settlement on employment and job losses varies across studies. Estimates range from 1,200 to 17,900 potential job losses in different water conditions. Some studies also report substantial monetary benefits approaching $1.8 billion annually, with net gains to the broader economy of $12.6 million during a drought year. However, the differences in reporting criteria and analytical approaches make it challenging to compare and validate these estimates, caution is advised when interpreting the estimated adverse economic effects and costs to the agricultural sectors. The economic impact of the Settlement on various sectors should be viewed with caution as studies do not account for farmers adjusting to water reallocation. Potential effects include costs to municipalities, lost power generation, and benefits from recreational opportunities and improvements. The economic impact of the Settlement includes benefits from recreational opportunities, improvements in water quality, and positive changes in land use values. Experts estimate increased recreational and scenic benefits ranging from $17.4 to $45.2 million annually, with existence values estimated to range from $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion. Significant costs and benefits are expected from the implementation of the Settlement. Costs of the Settlement are concentrated in agriculture and other sectors, while benefits related to existence and recreation are dispersed across the California population. Uncertainties in data and modeling, lack of standards in expert reports, and concerns about groundwater quantity and quality exist among communities. Some communities have adequate groundwater supplies, but others do not, causing concerns for downstream communities and water/power users outside the Friant Division Service Area. Communities and water/power users outside the Friant Division Service Area are worried about potential effects of the Settlement, such as increased flooding, groundwater infiltration, competition with financial commitments, and management of threatened species. The Settlement Agreement aims not to harm those not involved, but changes in water use may impact resources in other areas. Concerns were raised by landowners and entities not part of the agreement. The House Resources Committee held a hearing on September 21, 2006 to address concerns raised by third parties regarding the implementation of the Settlement. Potential concerns included flooding, loss of crops, operational constraints related to salmon protection, impacts on existing salmon populations, effects on water supplies and rights, and funding for restoration projects. Third parties were asked for suggestions to revise draft legislation after the hearing. Parties were asked for suggestions to revise draft implementing legislation for the Settlement. Negotiations resulted in an agreement to modify the legislation. Testimony suggested that many concerns were resolved in the modified legislation introduced in Congress. Some issues remain, including impacts on water supplies for Friant Division contractors and nearby third parties using groundwater. Some fear that increased groundwater pumping to replace decreases in surface supplies may degrade groundwater quality. Settlement participants anticipate limited impacts due to a plan to recirculate, recapture, reuse, exchange, or transfer water released for restoration flows. Uncertainties exist regarding regulatory limitations, water delivery commitments, and funding for proposed projects. Concerns also arise about restoration flows potentially degrading shallow groundwater quality beneath the San Joaquin River. The lower reaches of the river face waterlogging and salt leaching concerns. Restoration flows may lead to substantial infiltration, especially in the upper reaches. Groundwater pumping near the river could increase infiltration rates, potentially causing conflicts between users and settlement parties. Legal questions may arise regarding surface water and groundwater interactions in California. The implementation of the Settlement may impact groundwater quality and quantity in California, leading to changes in water management. Increased reliance on groundwater in the southern San Joaquin Valley could worsen groundwater quality, affecting drinking water and irrigation wells. Adaptation to reduced water deliveries and potential conflicts between users and settlement parties may arise. The Settlement Agreement and implementing legislation aim to restore fisheries below Friant Dam on the San Joaquin River. Reduced surface water flows may lead to more efficient water use and improve groundwater quality outside the Friant Division Service Area. Recent actions address violations of California state fish and game code by Reclamation, with far-reaching implications for California water management. The Settlement Agreement aims to restore fisheries below Friant Dam on the San Joaquin River, with implications for California water management and affected communities. Policy issues arise from constraints imposed by the need to react to a judicial ruling, including how San Joaquin River management ties into other water systems. Recent court decisions may limit future water exports due to the health of threatened Delta Smelt. The future of water resource management in the Central Valley may be constrained by decisions regarding the health of threatened Delta Smelt. Water management goals identified in the Settlement could impact the ability to recapture, recirculate, and reuse San Joaquin River restoration flows. This will require multi-year water planning, investments, and financial resources for conjunctive management. The future of water resource management in the Central Valley may be affected by decisions related to the health of the threatened Delta Smelt. The Settlement Agreement reached in the U.S. District Court has led to difficult choices facing Congress today, such as budgetary constraints and trade-offs between water delivery and ecosystem health. Trade-offs made decades ago continue to impact resource agencies implementing projects and programs. The San Joaquin river restoration aims to address economic and ecological damage from 60 years ago, with concerns about reduced water supplies for off-stream use. The Settlement Agreement would redirect water to maintain in-stream flows for fish restoration, impacting Friant water deliveries to water districts. The Settlement Agreement would redistribute a portion of the annual water supply from agricultural and municipal water districts to achieve restoration flows for fish. The quantity of water for restoration flows would vary annually based on estimated runoff, with higher flows in wetter years and lower flows in drier years. The reduction in water deliveries to off-stream uses in the Friant Division Service Area would not necessarily be one-for-one with the water used for restoration. The Settlement Agreement would redistribute water from agricultural and municipal water districts for fish restoration flows, varying annually based on runoff. In wet years, flood water releases could offset reductions in deliveries to users. Limited data on mitigation actions for reduced deliveries exist, with implementation details still undetermined. The analysis in this appendix is limited to existing data and estimates of water supplies, not accounting for water supply management measures that could reduce the effects of the Settlement on agricultural and municipal water users. It relies on two data sets on estimated reductions to Friant water supplies under the Settlement: Steiner 2005 and BOR 2006. The analysis in this appendix, based on Steiner 2005 and BOR 2006 data sets, provides estimates of potential reductions in Friant water supplies under the Settlement. Despite limitations, the data offer insights into the range of changes water users may face. The Settlement could result in a 15-16% average reduction in annual water supplies for the Friant Division Service Area, with potential reductions ranging from no reduction to as high as 34% in some years. The total average annual reduction in water delivered under the Settlement is estimated to be 204-225 thousand acre-feet less than average annual supplies without the Settlement. The Settlement could lead to a 15-16% average reduction in annual water supplies for the Friant Division Service Area, with potential reductions ranging from no reduction to as high as 34% in some years. The average annual reduction in long-term water service contract deliveries under the Settlement is estimated at 144 taf less than average annual supplies without the Settlement. Almost half of the Friant contractors have access to other surface water supplies, and 75% use groundwater supplies, resulting in a reduction in one of multiple supplies for three-quarters of the contractors. Access to reliable data on non-federal water supply sources is limited, making the extent of other supplies and their reliability unclear. The level of reductions in water supplies for individual districts would vary based on their water service contracts, with first priority deliveries likely to be affected less. Data assumes reductions in supplemental water deliveries before first priority deliveries, estimating average annual reductions in Friant Division long-term water service contract deliveries. Annual reductions in Friant Division long-term water service contract deliveries for individual districts would range from 5% to 27%. The low range applies to contractors with firmer contract supplies, while the high range applies to those with only supplemental supplies. All districts with supplemental contracts have access to groundwater or other surface water sources. Possible actions to offset reduced deliveries include water conservation, efficiency measures, transfers, groundwater storage, water pricing, and new infrastructure. The extent to which these measures could mitigate lower deliveries, their cost, and which measures might be part of the Settlement's water management goal remain unclear. The curr_chunk discusses the complexity of water supplies in the Friant Division Service Area and how water conservation measures could impact long-term water demands. It also addresses the potential effects of the Settlement on Friant Division contract water supplies. The curr_chunk analyzes the reduction in water supplies for individual water districts in the Friant Division Service Area of the CVP. It presents data on average annual water supply reductions under the Settlement and the variation that might be experienced annually. The appendix does not discuss specific effects on groundwater supplies or potential economic impacts. The Friant Division Service Area benefits from federal investments in surface and groundwater supplies, supporting a thriving farm economy and growing population. The area is crossed by large rivers, with the San Joaquin River being the main surface water source stored behind Friant Dam. Groundwater overdraft is a concern despite the area's relative water abundance. Despite being relatively rich in water resources, the Friant Division Service Area faces groundwater overdraft issues due to intense agricultural development in the early 20th Century. Runoff into Millerton Lake varies widely, leading to management challenges in dry and wet years. The lake's capacity of 500 taf is insufficient for multi-year storage, resulting in annual operation and dependence on yearly runoff for water delivery. In non-flood years, most of the water from the San Joaquin River is diverted into canals for Friant water users, leaving the riverbed dry between Gravelley Ford and Mendota Pool. Water between Mendota Pool and Sack Dam is imported CVP water, not from the San Joaquin River. The San Joaquin River Exchange Contractors remove imported Delta water from the river in Reach 3. The river is dry for 46 miles from Sack Dam to Bear Creek (Reach 4), except for groundwater and agricultural runoff. Reclamation operates Friant Dam to maximize water deliveries in the Friant Division while meeting downstream water right obligations and managing flood waters. This management regime has had negative effects on downstream resources, especially anadromous fish, according to a 2004 court ruling. The management regime at Friant Dam has had negative effects on downstream resources, particularly anadromous fish, under California state law. Reclamation makes preliminary runoff projections in January and allocates water supplies based on these projections. Water releases at Friant Dam include riparian flow releases and flood releases. Flood releases may be necessary when forecast runoff is excessive or when water inflow exceeds the capacity of the reservoir. Additional releases above the minimum may be used for temporary water contracts and diversion to canals for long-term water service contractors in the Friant Division Service Area of the CVP. Friant Division Water Supplies serve 28 water districts, delivering water to approximately 1 million acres of farmland and several cities and towns, including Fresno, via the Madera and Friant-Kern Canals. Friant water supply deliveries serve approximately 15,000 farms through the Madera and Friant-Kern Canals. Class I water, the \"firm\" supply, is allocated to long-term water service contractors, while Class II water is supplemental and used for irrigation in wetter years. In wetter years, Class II water is used for irrigation and to recharge groundwater supplies. Temporary water may be provided under \u00a7 215 of the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 when flood waters are released from Friant Dam. This temporary water supply waiver includes ownership and pricing limitations. Demand and deliveries of Class II and \u00a7 215 water vary based on runoff and operational procedures. The complexity of operating procedures and financial incentives impact water supply reductions for Class II contractors. Table A-1 shows average annual water supplies for Friant water districts, with Class I supplies ranging from 200 taf to 800 taf and combined Class II and \u00a7 215 allocations ranging from zero to 1,401 taf. Total annual water supplies in Table A-1 amount to 1,281 taf. The Friant Division Service Area has access to various non-Friant surface water supplies, including rivers like the Kings River, Cottonwood Creek, and Tule River. Many districts in the area have access to these alternative water sources, although they make up a smaller percentage of total supplies compared to Friant surface water or groundwater. The Friant Division Service Area has access to various non-Friant surface water supplies, including rivers like the Kings River, Cottonwood Creek, and Tule River. Some districts may rely on other surface sources for more than 50% of their water supply. Water imports into the area have been limited, but may increase if Friant water deliveries decrease. Limited water availability, cost of alternate supplies, and regulatory constraints may hinder efforts to import water. Groundwater levels in the area have been affected by pumping. Groundwater levels in the Friant Division Service Area were impacted by pumping in the early 20th Century, leading to the construction of Friant Dam and efforts to reduce groundwater demand. Deliveries from the dam reduced pumping, slowing water table decline and land subsidence. However, water table levels in the southern San Joaquin Valley have not fully recovered. Facilities for groundwater pumping are available throughout the area, with limited estimates showing water users in various districts relying on groundwater. Districts in the Friant Division Service Area vary in their groundwater pumping volumes, with some pumping large amounts while others pump smaller amounts annually. Total volumes pumped between 1987 and 2003 ranged from over 2,000 taf in 1990 to 450 taf in 1998. Groundwater banking is being considered as a way to store water during wet years for use in dry years. The water transport system in California increases possibilities for groundwater banking. Users connected to the system could access banked groundwater regardless of their own supply. However, constraints like pumping capacity and operational issues may limit opportunities. The costs to bank and move water, or purchase banked water, may be higher than some users are willing to pay. The Settlement establishes a framework for achieving restoration and water management goals, but the viability of attaining both goals is uncertain and depends on various factors. The Settlement Agreement outlines the water availability for Friant water contractors based on runoff conditions categorized into six water year types. Wet and Normal-Wet years have above-average runoff, while Normal-Dry and Dry years have below-average runoff. The bottom 5% of years are classified as Critical High or Critical. The Settlement Agreement categorizes runoff conditions into six water year types, with the bottom 5% classified as Critical High or Critical Low. Critical Low years are the driest, with less than 400 taf of runoff, while Critical High includes all other years in the bottom 5%. The water year type is determined by comparing runoff predictions to past annual volumes in the Millerton Lake drainage area, guiding monthly water releases based on restoration hydrographs. The Secretary of the Interior is tasked with developing guidelines for determining water year types, as outlined in Paragraph 13, Section j of the Settlement Agreement. The guidelines for determining water year types will impact the implementation of restoration flows from Millerton Lake. The Settlement Agreement defines six water year types, with restoration flows varying based on the designation. The hydrographs in the Settlement, known as the Kondolf hydrographs, were developed based on expert testimony. Restoration flows are higher in wetter years and lower in drier years. The quantity of water used for restoration flows and the reduction in Friant water deliveries are related but not necessarily one-for-one. Estimates of lower Friant water deliveries under the Settlement come from Steiner 2005 and BOR 2006 data sets, based on water quantities required for Kondolf hydrographs. Figures and tables show estimated reduced annual Friant water supplies, using historic conditions as proxies for future effects of the Settlement. The figures and table rank annual runoff from 1962 to 2003, with 1983 having the highest and 1977 the lowest. The data sets have limitations. The impact on Friant water contractors may differ from estimates if the Settlement is implemented. Measures in the Settlement aim to mitigate lower water supplies, including establishing a Recovered Water Account and projects to recirculate and reuse restoration releases. The Friant Water Users Authority outlined potential projects to offset reduced water supplies in a 2007 report. No specific projects are identified. The Settlement Agreement does not specify water management projects or funding distribution between restoration and water management goals. This lack of clarity hinders estimating potential savings and impact on Friant water contractors. Implementation guidelines are yet to be established, allowing for flexibility in how the Settlement will be carried out. The Settlement Agreement will develop guidelines for reductions in water deliveries to Friant Division long-term contractors, impacting operational and allocation decisions at Friant Dam. Flexibility in negotiations may lead to varying contract water supplies compared to previous protocols. The Settlement Agreement aims to transform stair step hydrographs to continuous hydrographs by December 31, 2008, to ensure smooth dam operation and avoid daily fluctuations. Discrepancies between BOR 2006 and Steiner 2005 estimates may impact Friant deliveries and water year type classifications. Numerous factors such as operational changes, water transfers, and recirculation projects could impact water availability in the Friant Division Service Area. Estimates of water reductions are based on available information and assume no operational changes or mitigation efforts. The estimated water supply reductions under the Settlement for Friant Contract Water Supplies are shown in Table A-3, based on Steiner 2005 and BOR 2006 estimates. These figures represent average annual reductions and historical variation, with a relationship between water released for restoration and reduced water deliveries to contractors illustrated in Figure A-5. The restoration flows under the Settlement are higher in wetter years and lower in drier years, with a non-one-for-one relationship between water for restoration flows and reduced deliveries to contractors. Estimates show reductions ranging from 5% to 27% of the average contractor's Friant water supply, with no water released for restoration in the driest years. The average annual reductions in water supply for districts depend on their ratio of Class I and Class II supplies. Higher volumes of Class I water may result in less average reductions. Estimates of average percentage reductions by water year type are discussed in Table A-2 and Figures A-3 and A-4. These estimates are based on no changes in CVP operations or completion of other water management goals. The average annual reductions in water supply for districts depend on their ratio of Class I and Class II supplies. Estimates of average percentage reductions by water year type are discussed in Table A-2 and Figures A-3 and A-4, showing potential variation in reduction magnitude. Figures A-6 through A-8 represent average estimated annual water supplies and reductions using Steiner 2005 data for the period 1962 to 2003. The proportion of water projected to be reduced for different water year types is displayed in Figures A-7 and A-8. Annual water contractor supplies are estimated to be reduced by 15-16% on average, representing 204-225 taf annually. Reductions in contract water supplies for Wet years could be 148-176 taf annually. The data shows that contract water supplies could be reduced by 8-9% in Wet years and 18-19% in Normal-Wet years, with variations in volume ranging from 35 taf to 344 taf in Wet years and 302 taf to 320 taf in Normal-Wet years. In Normal-Wet years, reductions in contract water supplies could range from 154 taf to 397 taf, representing 9% to 29% of annual supplies. For Normal-Dry years, reductions could be around 225 taf to 239 taf, accounting for 22% to 23% of annual supplies. In Dry years, reductions may vary from 136 taf to 181 taf. In Critical High years, contract water supplies could be reduced by 12% to 17%, with no expected reduction in Class II water. In Critical High years, there may be no reduction in Class II water supplies. Without the Settlement, some Critical High years could have \u00a7 215 water deliveries, which would generally not occur under the Settlement. In Critical Low years, no restoration releases are to be made, resulting in no changes to Friant Division water supplies. Variation in the quantity and percent reduction of water supplies could exist for different contract types within each water year type. It is uncertain if Reclamation would attempt to limit this annual variation. The analysis in this section is based on data from Steiner 2005, providing estimates of the impact of the Settlement on individual long-term contractors. The contractor-level analysis covers the period from 1922 to 2003 for Class I and Class II water, excluding \u00a7215 water. Reductions in water supplies depend on the contractor's proportion of Class I to Class II contracts and the water year type, with an average 5% reduction for Class I contract deliveries. The average reduction for Class I contract deliveries is estimated at 5%; for Class II deliveries, it is 27%, and for \u00a7215 deliveries, it is 47%. Districts with both Class I and Class II contracts have varying reductions in water supplies, ranging from -5% to -27%. Under the Settlement, Class I water supplies would not be reduced in Wet and most Normal-Wet years. Under the Settlement, estimates show that Class I water supplies would be lower in Normal-Dry, Dry, and Critical High years, with no change in Critical Low years. Class II and \u00a7215 water supplies would also be lower in Wet, Normal-Wet, and most Normal-Dry years, and somewhat lower in Dry years. Under the Settlement, increased releases for fish restoration efforts from Millerton Lake may result in a 15-16% average reduction in annual water supplies for the Friant Division Service Area compared to current operating protocols. However, reductions could range from no reduction to as high as 34% in some years for three-quarters of the Friant contractors. The reductions in Friant Division deliveries vary for contractors, with estimates ranging from 5% to 27% annually. Different water districts experience different levels of reduction based on their contracts. Class I contract supplies see larger cutbacks compared to Class II contract supplies. Districts with Class II contracts have alternative water sources. It is uncertain if water reductions can be offset by other projects and programs. It is uncertain if water reductions in the Friant Division can be offset by projects and programs from the Settlement, such as efficiency gains, water marketing, pricing, storage, and infrastructure development. The viability of improving efficiencies, securing funding, and achieving restoration and water management goals is uncertain and dependent on various factors."
