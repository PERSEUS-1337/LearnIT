    "content": "The NTIA Digital Network Technology Program Act establishes a program within the National Telecommunications and Information Administration to provide grants or agreements to eligible institutions for instruction in digital network technologies. Eligible institutions can use grants to acquire equipment and technology for teaching, provide educational services for students and faculty, and offer training for individuals seeking to enhance technology skills for classroom use. The curr_chunk discusses implementing joint projects for technology education with various organizations or providing leadership development for administrators, board members, and faculty of eligible institutions. The curr_chunk discusses the application and review procedure outlined in SEC. 173. To be eligible for funding, an institution must submit an application to the Secretary following the procedure established in consultation with a peer review panel. The panel aids in selecting recipients for grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements under section 171. The panel, consisting of cabinet-level officials, representatives of non-Federal organizations, and eligible institutions, ensures diversity in membership to reflect the minority higher education community, including Federal agency personnel and individuals knowledgeable about minority education issues. The Secretary must require eligible institutions to provide non-Federal contributions equal to 1/4 of the grant amount or $500,000, whichever is less. The matching requirement can be waived for institutions with no or low endowments. SEC. 175: An eligible institution receiving a grant over $2,500,000 cannot receive another grant until all other eligible institutions have received funding. SEC. 176: Requires annual report and evaluation. Each institution receiving a grant must provide an annual report to the Secretary on its use of the funding. The Secretary will evaluate the program based on these reports annually and conduct a final evaluation after three years. The evaluation will describe activities undertaken and assess their impact on students, faculty, and staff. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress within 1 year of the final evaluation, including recommendations on the need for Federal support of the program. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act is amended to define an \"eligible institution\" as a historically Black college or university, a Hispanic-serving institution, or a consortium of institutions meeting specific criteria.
