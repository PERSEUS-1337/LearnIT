    "content": "The Act of 2003 may be cited as the \"Whatever It Takes' To Rebuild Act\". Congress finds that major disasters, including those caused by terrorist acts, lead to economic decline in affected areas and reduced tax collections by State and local governments. A report by the General Accounting Office estimated significant tax revenue losses for New York City and State following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The CDL program allows the President to provide loans to local governments facing tax revenue losses due to disasters. For fiscal year 2003, New York City is projected to lose $1.4 billion and the State of New York $4.2 billion in tax revenue. The President can forgive loan repayments if post-disaster revenues are insufficient. The CDL program provides loans to local governments facing revenue losses after disasters. Repayment of loans may be forgiven if post-disaster revenues are insufficient. The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 set a $5,000,000 limit on loans for major disasters, whereas there was no limit before. The $5,000,000 limitation on loans for local governments after disasters is seen as unfair for heavily populated areas like New York City. President George W. Bush urged the Federal Government to provide assistance to New York City after the September 11 attacks, including help for lost tax revenues. SEC. 3. COMMUNITY DISASTER LOANS. Amendments are made to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act regarding eligibility of States and the amount of assistance provided. Additionally, a provision is added for major disasters caused by terrorist attacks, stating that no interest or principal shall be required on loans to States or local governments affected by such disasters. Amendments to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act include provisions for major disasters caused by terrorist attacks, with amendments applicable to disasters occurring after October 30, 2000. The President is authorized to make loans to New York City and the State of New York under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act for losses of tax and other revenues due to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The total amount of loans shall be $8,800,000,000 or more if deemed necessary, with no interest or principal payment required."
