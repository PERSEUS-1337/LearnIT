    "content": "The Act titled \"Concussion Awareness and Education Act of 2015\" includes sections on short title, table of contents, findings, purposes, surveillance of sports-related concussions, research, dissemination of information, and Concussion Research Commission. The Congress finds that there is a lack of comprehensive data on sports-related concussions in youth, with an estimated 1.6 to 3.8 million traumatic brain injuries occurring annually in the United States. The incidence of non-fatal sports-related traumatic brain injuries, including concussions, has increased significantly. However, there is a lack of accurate data on the prevalence of these injuries across different sports and age groups, as well as gaps in the diagnosis and treatment protocols. The Act aims to raise awareness about concussions and change the culture surrounding them among youth and their parents, coaches, and healthcare professionals. More research is needed for proper diagnosis and treatment of sports-related concussions. Officials, educators, trainers, and healthcare professionals consider demographic variations across population groups. SEC. 4. SURVEILLANCE OF SPORTS-RELATED CONCUSSIONS. This section amends Title III of the Public Health Service Act to include surveillance of sports-related concussions. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the CDC Director, will establish a national system to track youth sports-related concussions within a year of the Concussion Awareness and Education Act of 2015. Data collected will include incidence of concussions in individuals aged 5-21, demographic details, and pre-existing conditions. The information to be collected for tracking youth sports-related concussions includes pre-existing conditions, concussion history, protective equipment use, impact monitoring, personnel qualifications, and details of the concussive injury such as sport involved, level of activity, event type, impact location, and nature of impact. The information to be collected for tracking youth sports-related concussions includes pre-existing conditions, concussion history, protective equipment use, impact monitoring, personnel qualifications, and details of the concussive injury such as sport involved, level of activity, event type, impact location, and nature of impact, including contact with playing surface, another player, or equipment, and signs and symptoms consistent with a concussion. SEC. 409K. RESEARCH ON CONCUSSIONS IN YOUTH. The Concussion Awareness and Education Act of 2015 mandates NIH to conduct research on age-specific concussion management guidelines, effects of concussions on quality of life, predictors of outcomes, and biomechanical determinants of injury risk in youth. The study focuses on how the number and time interval between head impacts and concussions affect injury thresholds. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop and share information on concussions with the public through various entities. Additionally, there will be a Concussion Research Commission established. The Concussion Research Commission is established with nine members appointed by various leaders, each with experience in research and treatment. The Concussion Research Commission consists of members appointed based on their expertise in research, treatment, and prevention of concussive injuries. Each member serves for the life of the Commission, with vacancies filled in the same manner as the original appointment process. The Concussion Research Commission members serve without pay, receive travel expenses, and meet at least 4 times a year. The Secretary ensures resources are provided for the Commission's responsibilities. Staff of Federal Agencies can assist upon request. The Concussion Research Commission can request assistance from Federal Agencies' staff without reimbursement. The Commission is required to study programs, formulate recommendations, review a National Academies report, and provide interim reports every 6 months. The Concussion Research Commission must submit interim reports every 6 months to Congress and a final report within 36 months of the Act's enactment. The Commission will terminate upon submitting the final report unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services decides to extend its duration."
