Congress finds that on May 16, 2008, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the US and Saudi Arabia for cooperation in nuclear energy and other fields. Saudi Arabia, with vast energy resources, aims to develop light water reactors and fuel service arrangements. Saudi Arabia has heavily invested in a national natural gas distribution pipeline to support its electricity generation system. Questions have been raised about the need for oil-rich nations like Saudi Arabia to pursue nuclear power, especially considering their abundant petroleum resources. Saudi Arabia's economic rationale for considering nuclear power is questioned due to its abundant petroleum resources and rich solar electricity generation potential. The proliferation of nuclear technology in the Middle East is seen as a threat to regional stability and security. The sense of Congress is expressed regarding the proliferation of nuclear technology in the Middle East as a threat to regional stability and security. Congress affirms the strong ties between the US and Saudi Arabia, disapproves of a nuclear energy cooperation agreement, and encourages cooperation in developing renewable energy sources in Saudi Arabia. The United States supports a program utilizing a country's solar energy potential and is committed to preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. SEC. 3. RESTRICTION ON NUCLEAR COOPERATION WITH THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA. Restriction on Nuclear Cooperation Agreement and Exports: No agreement for nuclear cooperation between the US and Saudi Arabia under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 may enter into force. Additionally, exports of nuclear materials, equipment, and technology to Saudi Arabia are restricted, including items regulated under specific sections of the Act and on the Commerce Control List. Exports to Saudi Arabia under the Commerce Control List are prohibited if the end user is a nuclear facility or if there is a risk of diversion for nuclear use. No licenses or approvals for such exports will be issued by any Federal agency."
