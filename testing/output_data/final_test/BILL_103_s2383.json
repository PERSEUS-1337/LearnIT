    "content": "The Alaska Power Administration Sale Authorization Act is also known as the Act. It authorizes the sale of the Snettisham and Eklutna hydroelectric projects. The Secretary of Energy is authorized to sell the Snettisham Hydroelectric Project to the State of Alaska Power Authority and the Eklutna Hydroelectric Project to the Municipality of Anchorage, Chugach Electric Association, and Matanuska Electric Association. The heads of other Federal departments will assist the Secretary of Energy in implementing authorized sales. Sale proceeds will be deposited in the Treasury. Appropriations are authorized for preparing assets for sale. Sales must occur within 1 year of defining \"first use\" of Snettisham. SEC. 3. EXEMPTION. After the sales authorized by section 2, Eklutna and Snettisham will remain exempt from the Federal Power Act requirements, subject to a Memorandum of Agreement for fish and wildlife protection. The State of Alaska retains authority under the Memorandum of Agreement. The United States District Court for the District of Alaska has jurisdiction to review decisions made under the Memorandum of Agreement and enforce its provisions, including specific performance remedies. Actions challenging the Fish and Wildlife Program of the Governor of Alaska or implementation of the program must be brought within 90 days to avoid being barred. Eklutna lands are subject to specific provisions outlined in the Eklutna Purchase Agreement. The Secretary of the Interior will issue rights-of-way to the Alaska Power Administration for the Eklutna lands at no cost to Eklutna Purchasers. These rights-of-way will be effective for the life of Eklutna and will allow for operation, maintenance, repair, and replacement of Eklutna facilities. If Eklutna is sold to private ownership, the Bureau of Land Management may take action. The Bureau of Land Management may charge fees for continued use of rights-of-way on lands managed by them and military lands. Fee title to lands at Anchorage Substation will be transferred to Eklutna Purchasers at no cost if pending claims are invalid. The State of Alaska may select approximately 853 acres of Eklutna lands for conveyance under specific entitlements. The Secretary of Energy will close out the Alaska Power Administration within a year after the authorized sales have occurred. The Alaska Power Administration will be closed out, and a report on sales will be submitted to Congress. Unused funds will be returned to the Treasury. The Acts of 1950 and 1962 will be repealed once assets are conveyed. Section 302(a) of the Department of Energy Organization Act will be amended accordingly. The Act of August 9, 1955 regarding water resources investigations in Alaska is repealed. The sales of Eklutna and Snettisham under this Act are not considered a disposal of Federal surplus property under specific provisions of law. Section 13 of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 (50 U.S.C. App. 1622) is referenced."
