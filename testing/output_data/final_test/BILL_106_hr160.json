    "content": "The Act titled \"Social Security Strengthening and Protection Act of 1999\" allows for the investment of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund. The Social Security Act is amended to allow investments in qualified investments based on surplus in the total budget of the US Government and Trust Funds. The Social Security Act allows the purchase of qualified investments with surplus funds, ensuring a total cost of at least 90 percent of the surplus. The Managing Trustee can redeem obligations with these investments and hold them until needed for withdrawals or in the public interest. The Managing Trustee can invest surplus funds in qualified investments for the benefit of Social Security beneficiaries. Qualified investments are marketable interest-bearing obligations of the United States that meet specific requirements. The Managing Trustee can invest surplus funds in marketable interest-bearing obligations of the United States that meet specific requirements, including maturity, interest rate, and redemption option. The term 'total budget of the United States Government' includes all spending and receipt accounts designated as on-budget or off-budget. Reforms to the old-age, survivors, and disability insurance program may be enacted after the Social Security Strengthening and Protection Act of 1999. These amendments apply to fiscal years starting on or after October 1, 2000. PROTECTION OF SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUNDS FROM PUBLIC DEBT LIMIT. Protection of Trust Funds: No officer or employee of the United States may delay deposits or credits to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund or the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund to avoid increasing public debt obligations. Additionally, disinvestment from these Trust Funds is prohibited. Protection of Trust Funds: Disinvestment from Trust Funds invested in public debt obligations to reduce outstanding debt is prohibited. During periods when benefits or expenses cannot be paid due to the public debt limit, debt obligations can only be sold to cover these payments. The Secretary of the Treasury may issue public debt obligations to obtain cash for payment of benefits or expenses from the Trust Fund, despite the public debt limit. Advance notice of sale or redemption must be given at least 3 days prior. The Secretary of the Treasury must report to Congress and the Comptroller General regarding expected sales or redemptions of public debt obligations before the date of the transaction. The Comptroller General will review compliance and issue findings and recommendations to Congress. The term \"public debt obligation\" refers to any obligation subject to the public debt limit."
