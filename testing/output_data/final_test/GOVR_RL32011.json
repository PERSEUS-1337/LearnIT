Specific procedures, known as \"trade authorities procedures,\" allow for expedited congressional consideration with no amendments and a final up-or-down vote. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 outlines the statutory authority and requirements for trade agreements. The Act allows for expedited congressional consideration of bills implementing agreements on tariff-and-nontariff barriers with foreign countries. The Trade Act of 1974 outlines expedited legislative procedures for implementing trade agreements, allowing for changes by either House of Congress. These procedures supersede any inconsistent rules and may be supplemented by temporary provisions. The Trade Act of 1974 outlines expedited legislative procedures for implementing trade agreements, allowing for changes by either House of Congress.

The implementing bill is subject to \"mock\" mark-ups by relevant committees before formal submission to Congress for legislative action. Approval of the implementing bill is necessary for the agreement to take effect. The Trade Act of 1974 outlines expedited procedures for implementing trade agreements, including submission of the final legal text, implementing bill, and supporting information to Congress. Failure to comply with this submission requirement would prevent the agreement from entering into force. The implementing bill must be introduced in both Houses of Congress on the day it is submitted. The implementing bill for trade agreements must be introduced in both Houses of Congress by majority leaders or their designees. The bill is then referred to the appropriate committee for consideration, with no amendments allowed. If a committee fails to report on the bill within 45 days, it is automatically discharged. After 45 days, the committee is automatically discharged from further consideration of the bill, which is then placed on the appropriate calendar.

All appeals from the decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the Rules of the House of Representatives to an implementing bill are decided without debate. The vote on final passage of the bill must be taken on or before the 15th day after the bill has been reported by the committee(s) or such committees have been discharged from its further consideration. Committee consideration in the Senate for an implementing revenue bill passed by the House of Representatives is governed by the Rules of the House of Representatives applicable to other bills in similar circumstances. The House of Representatives passed a revenue bill that is now in the Senate for consideration. If the bill is not reported by the relevant committee within 15 days, it is automatically discharged. In the Senate, a motion to proceed to the bill's consideration is privileged and nondebatable. The Senate's debate on implementing bills and motions is limited to 20 hours, divided between majority and minority leaders. Debate on motions is limited to one hour, with additional time allotted by leaders. Further debate limits and motions to recommit are not allowed. The final passage vote requires a simple majority. The final passage vote on implementing bills in the Senate must be taken within 15 days after the bill has been reported. The agreement enters into force upon completion of necessary legal procedures by each party and exchange of written notices. Extension disapproval resolutions can be submitted by relevant reports. Extension disapproval resolutions can be submitted by relevant reports to request an extension of trade authorities procedures for bills implementing agreements involving tariff-and-nontariff barriers. If neither House adopts an extension disapproval resolution before July 1, 2005, trade authorities are extended automatically. An extension disapproval resolution is a resolution introduced by any member and referred to the committees on Ways and Means, and on Rules. On the floor of either House, the resolution is considered under the expedited procedure of the Trade Act of 1974 for resolutions disapproving certain actions. No amendment to the resolution is allowed in the House, and in the Senate, a motion to proceed to the consideration of the resolution is debatable. It is not in order to consider an extension disapproval resolution not reported by the relevant committees. The Congress may deny consideration of implementing bills for tariff-and-nontariff agreements if the President fails to notify or consult with Congress. This can be done through procedural disapproval resolutions introduced by any Member of either House and considered under expedited procedures outlined in the Trade Act of 1974. Amendments are not allowed in the House, and in the Senate, a motion to proceed to the resolution's consideration is debatable. Procedural disapproval resolutions for tariff-and-nontariff agreements can be introduced by any Member of Congress and are referred to specific committees for consideration. The resolutions are nonamendable and follow expedited procedures for approval, with restrictions on consideration if not reported by the relevant committees. The Senate can adopt nonbinding resolutions if trade-remedy laws in a trade agreement are inconsistent with negotiating objectives. Resolutions are introduced by any Member, referred to specific committees, and are nonamendable.
