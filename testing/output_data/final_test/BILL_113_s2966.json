    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Critical Care Assessment and Improvement Act of 2014\". Critical care medicine involves comprehensive care for patients with life-threatening conditions in specialized ICUs, with approximately 5,000,000 admissions in the US annually. The care provided is complex and costly, accounting for over 17% of healthcare expenses. According to a 2006 report by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), demand for critical care medical services in the United States is increasing due to the growing elderly population. This aging population will worsen the shortage of intensivists, compromising the quality and availability of care. Intensivist-led teams currently only treat one-third of critically ill patients despite evidence of their effectiveness. The purpose of this Act is to assess and improve the critical care medical delivery system in the United States to enhance the quality of care for critically ill and injured patients. SEC. 3. STUDIES ON CRITICAL CARE. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will collaborate with the Institute of Medicine to analyze critical care health services in the U.S., develop recommendations to enhance capabilities, and submit a report to Congress within a year of the enactment of the Act. The analysis of the current critical care system in the United States includes capacity, resources, workforce size, health information technology, and medical equipment. It also examines strengths, limitations, future challenges, and the system's ability to provide care during national emergencies. Recommendations on regionalizing critical care systems and the status of critical care are also part of the analysis. The Secretary will update a study on critical care workforce in the US, expanding to include various providers like nurses, physician assistants, pharmacists, and respiratory care practitioners. The NIH Critical Care Coordinating Working Group is established. The Secretary establishes the Critical Care Coordinating Working Group within the National Institutes of Health, including representatives from various institutes to enhance agency coordination on critical care. The Critical Care Coordinating Working Group, including representatives from different institutes like the National Institute on Aging and the National Institute of Minority Health, serves as a focal point for advancing research in critical care, coordinating funding opportunities, developing new funding opportunities, informing investigators about funding, and representing the NIH in government-wide efforts to improve the critical care system. The Critical Care Coordinating Working Group coordinates research efforts and funding opportunities for critical care, including analyzing current research, providing annual reports to the NIH Director, and making recommendations to strengthen partnerships within the NIH and with other entities. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation Critical Care Demonstration Project is established. The Secretary will conduct a demonstration project under the Social Security Act to improve care for critically ill patients in intensive care units. Activities may include enhancing care coordination and incorporating value-based purchasing methodologies. The Secretary will conduct a demonstration project under the Social Security Act to improve care for critically ill patients in intensive care units by implementing novel informatics and monitoring methodologies to enhance care coordination, improve outcomes, and reduce waste. This includes improving prediction models to identify high-risk patients, streamline care delivery, prevent hospital readmissions, and utilize bundled payment approaches to incentivize care redesign."
