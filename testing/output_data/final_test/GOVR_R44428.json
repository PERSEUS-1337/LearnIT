    "content": "The budget cycle involves practices by Congress and the President that impact revenue and expenditure trends. Budget baselines measure how legislative changes affect the budget outlook and are crucial for evaluating policy choices. The process spans four years from budget formation by OMB to final audit, with agencies submitting detailed budget requests about a year and a half before the fiscal year begins. The President typically submits the budget to Congress around February, eight months before the fiscal year starts. The budget resolution, agreed upon by the House and Senate, sets the framework for budgetary legislation. If there is disagreement, a \"deeming resolution\" may be used. Appropriations Committees review agency funding requests and propose budget authority levels. Appropriations acts passed by Congress determine the amount of budget authority available for specific programs. The budget resolution sets the framework for budgetary legislation, with appropriations acts passed by Congress determining the amount of budget authority available for specific programs. Authorizing committees and committees with jurisdiction over revenues also play important roles in budget decision making. Budget baseline projections are used to project the future impact of current laws and measure the effect of future legislation on spending and revenues. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) uses current-law baseline projections with assumptions from budget enforcement legislation, leading to significant effects on deficits, receipts, and expenditures. Policy uncertainties are reduced due to resolved tax policy questions and enacted spending controls. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 set individual tax rates, while discretionary spending levels are constrained by the Budget Control Act of 2011. The CBO baseline projections are based on budget enforcement legislation like the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. It assumes restricted discretionary budget authority and certain expiring tax provisions not being extended, leading to lower spending and higher revenue levels. Macroeconomic assumptions also impact baseline estimates. The baseline projections show rising budget deficits due to increases in mandatory spending, particularly in Social Security and Medicare programs. Debt held by the public is expected to increase throughout the 10-year budget window, driven by budget deficits and federal loan activity. The debt held by the public is influenced by finances, budget deficits, and federal loan activity, and is determined by existing debt size, economic growth, and interest rates. In FY2015, the debt declined due to low interest rates but is projected to increase to 86.1% of GDP by FY2026. Alternative policy assumptions show increased deficit if spending caps are lifted and tax provisions extended. The budget deficit is projected to increase by over $1.0 trillion over the FY2017 to FY2026 period, driven by rising outlays in health care and retirement costs. Federal deficits are expected to continue growing unless major policy changes are implemented. Since FY2002, spending has exceeded revenues each fiscal year, resulting in budget deficits. In FY2015, the U.S. government spent $3.69 trillion and collected $3.25 trillion in revenue, resulting in a budget deficit of 2.5% of GDP. In FY2015, the U.S. government spent $3.69 trillion and collected $3.25 trillion in revenue, resulting in a budget deficit of 2.5% of GDP. Federal outlays are divided into discretionary spending, mandatory spending, and net interest, with entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid making up the bulk of mandatory spending. In FY2000, total outlays equaled 17.6% of GDP, the lowest level since FY1966. Outlays peaked at 24.4% of GDP in FY2009, then fell to 20.3% in FY2014 before rising to 20.7% in FY2015. Under the CBO baseline, outlays are projected to reach 23.1% of GDP in FY2026. Discretionary spending was 6.1% of GDP in FY2000 and increased in most years between FY2000 and FY2010. Discretionary spending peaked at 9.1% of GDP in FY2010, but has since fallen to 6.5% in FY2015 and is projected to decrease further to 5.2% by FY2026. This decline is mainly due to restrictions from the Budget Control Act. Mandatory spending, on the other hand, increased to 12.9% of GDP in FY2015 from 9.4% in FY2000, peaking at 14.5% in FY2009. Mandatory spending increased from 9.4% of GDP in FY2000 to 14.5% in FY2009 due to recession-related outlays. However, with the economic recovery, certain programs saw lower mandatory spending. Despite this, mandatory spending is projected to rise towards 15.0% of GDP by FY2026. In FY2015, mandatory spending accounted for 62.4% of total outlays, while discretionary spending was at 31.6% and net interest at 6.0%. Social Security, Medicare, and federal programs are the largest mandatory spending components. In FY2015, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid made up 50.6% of federal spending. By FY2026, mandatory spending is projected to increase to 64.7% of total outlays, while discretionary spending is expected to decrease to 22.3%. Some experts argue that reducing mandatory spending is necessary to achieve significant cuts in federal spending, but this may disrupt the social safety net. In FY2015, federal revenue collections totaled 18.2% of GDP, higher than the historical average. Real federal revenues have increased in recent years due to an improving economy and certain tax relief provisions. ATRA (P.L. 112-240) increased revenue certainty by extending reduced tax rates for most income groups. In FY2015, federal revenue collections totaled 18.2% of GDP, with individual income taxes being the largest source of federal revenues. Social insurance and corporate income taxes also contributed significantly. The annual budget deficits or surpluses determine the level of publicly held federal debt and interest payments. The FY2015 unified budget deficit was $439 billion, the lowest since FY2007, at 2.5% of GDP. Excluding off-budget items, the on-budget federal deficit was $466 billion. The FY2016 budget deficit is estimated at $544 billion, with spending increases outweighing revenue rises. Outlays for FY2016 are projected to increase to 21.2% of GDP. The FY2016 budget deficit is projected to increase to 21.2% of GDP, with revenues also expected to rise slightly. The federal debt consists of debt held by the public and intragovernmental debt, with the former being the most relevant in macroeconomic terms. Congress historically sets a ceiling on federal debt through a legislatively established limit. The debt limit imposes fiscal accountability on Congress and the President, requiring visible action to authorize further federal borrowing. It can hinder Treasury's ability to manage finances when federal debt nears the limit, leading to extraordinary measures. As of December 31, 2015, federal debt subject to limit was $18.922 trillion. The debt limit is currently suspended until March 15, 2017. The debt limit is currently suspended until March 15, 2017, with total debt subject to limit at $18.9 trillion by the end of 2015. The United States spent $223 billion, or 1.3% of GDP, on net interest payments on the debt in FY2015. Low interest rates have kept net interest payments below the historical average despite increasing borrowing. Some economists are concerned that federal interest costs could rise in the future. Some economists are concerned about rising federal interest costs in the future, which could strain the budget. Interest rates are projected to gradually increase, with net interest payments reaching $830 billion (3.0% of GDP) in FY2026. Legislative actions like the Budget Control Act of 2011 and subsequent revisions have impacted the fiscal outlook. The Budget Control Act of 2011 was enacted to address expiring tax provisions and across-the-board spending cuts, known as the \"fiscal cliff.\" The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 and Balanced Budget Act of 2015 further modified spending levels and suspended the debt limit. These legislative actions have impacted the fiscal outlook for the federal government. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) established spending caps until March 2017 and raised discretionary spending caps for FY2016 and FY2017. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 enacted budget authority for FY2016 in line with the modified caps. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 extended tax provisions and made some permanent. These actions aimed to reduce the deficit by $2.1 trillion over the FY2012-FY2021 period. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established spending caps and a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to identify further savings. When the committee failed to reach an agreement, automatic spending reductions were triggered to begin in FY2013. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 postponed the start of the spending reductions until March 1, 2013, and reduced the FY2013 reductions by $24 billion. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 reduced spending by $24 billion, totaling $85 billion divided between defense and nondefense. It also made changes to tax policy, including extending tax cuts for income below $400,000 ($450,000 for married couples) and increasing tax rates for higher incomes. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 increased the top tax rate on long-term capital gains and dividends to 20% and reinstated limitations on itemized deductions for taxpayers with AGI above $250,000. It also extended tax credits, provided marriage tax penalty relief, and made changes to education-related tax incentives. Additionally, the Act included a permanent \"patch\" for the alternative minimum tax and established permanent estate and gift tax rules. The federal government experienced a funding gap and partial shutdown in October 2013, which ended with the enactment of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014. On October 17, 2013, the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014 was enacted, providing interim appropriations through January 15, 2014. Senator Patty Murray and Representative Paul Ryan released an agreement on discretionary spending caps for FY2014 and FY2015, enacted as the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, which replaced a portion of the automatic spending reductions under the BCA. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA 2015; P.L. 114-74) modified discretionary spending caps for FY2016 and FY2017, increasing them by $50 billion and $30 billion respectively. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) allocated FY2016 discretionary budget authority, while the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (PATH Act) extended 56 tax provisions. The PATH Act extended 56 tax provisions that expired in 2014, with various extensions ranging from two to five years and some made permanent. The Obama Administration submitted its FY2017 budget to Congress, outlining national priorities and policy initiatives. President Obama's policy agenda in the budget submission projected total outlays of $4,147 billion and revenues of $3,644 billion, resulting in a budget deficit of $503 billion. The President's budget for FY2017 proposes tax and spending measures to address initiatives, including adjusting discretionary spending caps set by the Budget Control Act. Congress and the President have made modifications to the BCA to allow for increases in discretionary spending. The budget projects a deficit of $503 billion, with an average annual deficit of $611 billion from FY2017 through FY2026. The President's budget for FY2017 proposes changes to discretionary spending caps, with a decrease in nondefense spending followed by increases in defense and nondefense spending from FY2018 to FY2021. The budget aims to increase total capped discretionary budget authority by $188 billion over the period. It also suggests eliminating the sequester on mandatory programs through FY2025, with deficit reduction achieved through various tax changes and reductions in Overseas Contingency Operations spending. The President's Budget for FY2017 proposes deficit reduction through changes to the tax code, immigration reform, and other health programs, totaling $1,719 billion. It also includes proposed cuts to 117 programs, saving $14 billion in FY2017. The budget presents three deficit projections, including a Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act baseline. The Obama Administration projected a FY2017 deficit of $636 billion under current law. They also introduced an adjusted baseline to show the impact of new policy choices, projecting a deficit of $612 billion. The proposed budget outlines the impact of implementing all policies, aiming for deficit reduction through tax code changes, immigration reform, and program cuts. The Administration projects a deficit of $503 billion in FY2017. The budget deficit is estimated to be 2.6% of GDP for FY2016 and is projected to remain flat at 2.6% of GDP over the next decade under the Proposed Budget. The President's budget proposes deficit reductions of $3,640 billion over the next decade compared to the adjusted baseline. The deficit levels in the proposed budget scenario are lower than both the CBO baseline and the adjusted baseline figures each year. The proposed budget compares to the current law (CBO baseline) and the Administration's adjusted baseline over the next decade. The adjusted baseline assumes certain policies will continue, while the proposed budget shows the outlook if all President's policies were implemented. The deficit reduction's effectiveness can only be measured by actual budget outcomes and sustainability. The proposed budget in the FY2017 budget assumes a reduction in OCO funding, leading to a $636 billion deficit reduction over the FY2017-FY2026 period. The Budget Committees in the House and Senate develop a budget resolution based on information from various sources. The House and Senate Budget Committees are preparing budget resolutions for FY2017, with ongoing challenges in deficit reduction and long-term budget outlook. Increased spending on entitlement programs may lead to rising deficits and debt, prompting a focus on achieving fiscal sustainability. Various budget issues are expected to be prominent in the policy debate. The focus is on achieving fiscal sustainability over the long term, with budget issues being prominent in the congressional debate. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 raised budget caps for FY2016 and FY2017, but they are set to return to previous levels by FY2018. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 provided budget authority for FY2016. Congress is working on the FY2017 appropriations process, with amendments to discretionary caps. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 raised budget caps for FY2016 and FY2017, but they are set to return to previous levels by FY2018. Congress is working on the FY2017 appropriations process, with amendments to discretionary caps. Despite occasional budget deficits, persistent deficits can lead to growing federal debt and adverse macroeconomic consequences in the long term. Large deficits will eventually need to be reduced through increases in taxes, reductions in spending, or both. The federal government is facing long-term budget challenges, with rising health care costs impacting government-financed health care spending. Deficit reduction legislation has not made significant changes to the growing budget portion, requiring additional measures for long-term sustainability. Deficits are projected to continue under the current-law baseline, necessitating a mix of tax increases and spending reductions for fiscal solvency. The current mix of federal fiscal policies is unsustainable in the long term due to the nation's aging population and rising health care costs. Federal spending on health programs is projected to grow from 5.2% of GDP in FY2015 to 8.0% of GDP in FY2040. Future spending on Medicare and Medicaid is expected to rise significantly, leading to a greater share of GDP over time. Interest payments are also projected to consume a larger portion of future federal spending. Interest payments are projected to grow rapidly, from 1.3% of GDP in FY2015 to 4.3% of GDP in FY2040. Debt held by the public is expected to exceed historical highs in the next 15 to 25 years. Maintaining federal outlays at 20% of GDP would require drastic reductions in spending or increased revenues. Maintaining the debt-to-GDP ratio at 74% in FY2040 would necessitate immediate cuts in non-interest spending or revenue increases. To maintain the debt-to-GDP ratio beyond FY2040, a 1.1% reduction in non-interest spending or revenue increase is needed annually. Further reductions to lower debt levels would require larger spending cuts or revenue increases, up to 2.6% of GDP annually. High debt levels could limit the government's flexibility in meeting obligations and responding to citizen needs. Interest payments are projected to increase significantly, reaching 4.3% of GDP by FY2040. Failing to reduce the projected debt growth could lead to future insolvency. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) provides data and analysis to Congress, issuing budget and economic outlook reports throughout the year. These reports set a baseline for evaluating legislative proposals' impact on outlays and revenue collection. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) provides data and analysis to Congress on budget and economic outlook reports. CBO evaluates legislative proposals' impact on outlays and revenue collection, projecting future fiscal health and offering policy options in Budget Options volumes. The President's Budget consists of five major volumes: The Budget, Historical Tables, Analytical Perspectives, Appendix, and Supplemental Materials. These documents outline the Administration's fiscal projections and proposed spending levels for government departments and programs. The Historical Tables volume includes budget data dating back to 1962. Additionally, the Department of the Treasury releases the Green Book, which provides further details on revenue proposals in the budget."
