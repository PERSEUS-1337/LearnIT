    "content": "The U.S. Constitution does not clearly specify how military bases should be managed. The President has the authority to deploy and redeploy armed forces for national defense, including creating and closing military installations. Congress is responsible for legislating policy and funding military infrastructure. Throughout history, the President has had broad authority over military installations, with Congress mostly deferring to the Executive branch. Congress largely deferred to the Executive branch in managing military installations, but enacted legislation in 1977 to limit the President's ability to close or realign major bases. This new law required comprehensive assessments and allowed challenges in court, effectively halting the closure or realignment of significant domestic bases by the Department of Defense. In 1988, new legislation (P.L. 100-526) authorized a limited number of base closures overseen by an independent panel, marking the beginning of the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process. The 1988 BRAC legislation was considered a success and was modified in subsequent rounds in 1991, 1993, 1995, and 2005. The modern BRAC process refers to temporary authority that amends the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-510). The Base Closure Act amends the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, establishing an independent commission to review closure and realignment recommendations from the Secretary of Defense. The commission can accept, reject, or modify the list before forwarding its findings to the President. If the President accepts the recommendations, they are submitted to Congress. Failure to meet the timeframe results in termination of the BRAC process. The Base Closure Act terminates the BRAC process, allowing Congress to disapprove recommendations through a joint resolution. Key features include an independent commission appointed by the President, objective criteria for basing recommendations, GAO review of DOD data, open hearings, and a requirement for the commission's final list to be accepted or rejected in full. Presidential and congressional off-ramps can end the BRAC process if conditions are not met. The BRAC process timeline varies but typically takes around 10 years from authorization to completion. Key milestones include DOD force structure plan, infrastructure inventory, nomination and confirmation of BRAC commissioners, DOD submission of recommendations to the commission, commission deliberations, final report sent to the President, Congress deadline for rejection, DOD implementation, and disposal of real property. BRAC is a cost efficiency measure for DOD's real property management. The Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process allows the Department of Defense to manage its real property assets more efficiently by shedding excess infrastructure. Cost savings have historically been a lower priority compared to military value in previous BRAC rounds. The 2005 BRAC criteria prioritize military value over potential costs and savings, reflecting longstanding DOD policy. The 2005 BRAC selection criteria prioritize military value over potential costs and savings, emphasizing mission capabilities, operational readiness, and impact on joint warfighting. The 2005 BRAC selection criteria prioritize military value, mission capabilities, operational readiness, and impact on joint warfighting. Other criteria include the availability and condition of land, facilities, airspace, cost of operations, and manpower implications for closure or realignment of military installations in the United States. The economic impact on existing communities near military installations, infrastructure support for forces, environmental impact, and disposal of DOD real property post-BRAC round are key considerations. Disposal process may extend beyond initial six-year window, affected by local/state participation and environmental remediation. Total acreage from previous BRAC rounds yet to be disposed is shown in a graph. The Base Closure Act authorizes conveyance mechanisms for disposal of federal property, delegated from GSA to military departments under BRAC. Local communities play a role in BRAC property disposal, unlike routine federal property disposal by GSA. Military departments declare excess property under BRAC for disposal. Under a BRAC, local communities can significantly affect the BRAC property transfer and disposal decisions, which are managed by the Secretary of the responsible military department. Once approved for closure, communities around an installation typically organize a Local Reuse Authority to oversee the redevelopment of the property. Once approved for closure, communities form a Local Redevelopment Authority (LRA) to create and execute a redevelopment plan for the property. The Department of Defense (DOD) provides economic development grants and technical support through its Office of Economic Adjustment (OEA) to assist LRAs. Congress has authorized special transfer authority for DOD to transfer property at less than fair market value, known as an Economic Development Conveyance (EDC), to create employment at former defense facilities. Savings from BRAC come from avoiding the cost of retaining unneeded infrastructure. The Department of Defense (DOD) has consistently argued for a new Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) to save costs by operating installations more efficiently. DOD estimates that a new \"efficiency-focused BRAC\" could save billions annually. However, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has raised concerns about the reliability of DOD's cost savings estimates. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has highlighted the Department of Defense's (DOD) unreliable cost savings estimates related to Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC). GAO's 2013 report revealed limited visibility into the outcomes of the 2005 round due to missing and inconsistent recordkeeping. Questions have been raised about the accuracy of DOD's data used to predict and monitor BRAC effectiveness, long-term savings, and outcomes. DOD's process for providing cost and savings estimates to the BRAC commission was hindered by underestimating requirements and not fully anticipating information technology needs. The department lacks documentation to demonstrate the extent of reduced plant replacement value or vacated space. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has raised concerns about the Department of Defense's (DOD) unreliable cost savings estimates for Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC). DOD lacks documentation to show the extent of reduced plant replacement value or vacated space. Additionally, DOD has not reported to Congress on the cleanup of emerging contaminants at closed installations, leading to increased cleanup costs. OSD lacks a method for accurately collecting information on costs and savings from joint basing, and has not developed a plan for achieving cost savings. DOD has not committed to implementing recommendations for future BRAC rounds. The 2005 BRAC commission noted DOD's overestimated savings and suggested improvements in estimating costs for future BRAC rounds. Chairman Anthony Principi recommended adopting consistent accounting practices and inclusive metrics to enhance analysis. The COBRA accounting procedure used by DoD for base realignment should include cost estimates for environmental restoration and transportation infrastructure. Some suggest improving congressional visibility into BRAC cost effectiveness by requiring disclosure of how closure recommendations meet cost-saving targets. The BRAC process is crucial for disposing of excess infrastructure, with DOD requesting new rounds for efficiency and reducing excess infrastructure. The Department of Defense has focused on efficiency and cost savings in addressing excess infrastructure, following the 2005 BRAC experience. Reports submitted to Congress in 2016 and 2017 assessed base infrastructure excess, with the final estimate at 19%. The Department of Defense submitted a report to Congress in October 2017, justifying the need for a new BRAC round to dispose of excess infrastructure and focus resources on national security priorities. Critics have questioned the Department's methodology for estimating excess infrastructure. Critics question the Department's methodology for estimating excess infrastructure, citing unreasonable research assumptions and metrics. Observers note reliance on outdated values, inconsistent metrics, and data management challenges affecting the ability to measure excess facility inventory. Undersecretary of Defense Norquist stated the Department declined a BRAC round in FY2019 to focus on internal reforms. The Department declined a BRAC round in FY2019 to focus on internal reforms and prepare for a financial audit. Assistant Secretary of Defense Niemeyer mentioned working with Congress on reforms and undergoing a financial-statement audit to improve decision-making on real property. There is no request for another BRAC round in this budget. In FY2019, the Department of Defense plans to improve excess infrastructure accounting processes and demolish unneeded facilities instead of requesting another Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round. The 2005 BRAC round was significant in size and complexity, with efforts focused on transforming military infrastructure. The 2005 BRAC round saw overvalued savings estimates and a significant increase in implementation costs due to rising construction expenses for subsidiary projects not initially included in the plan. Assistant Secretary Niemeyer highlighted that Congress had limited oversight on BRAC implementation costs, leading to deliberate decisions by the Department to use BRAC as a tool for facility expansion, which raised concerns about escalating costs. The Department of Defense periodically proposes legislative language to constrain the Secretary's ability to recommend BRAC actions that do not yield savings within 20 years and emphasize recommendations with net savings within five years. Congress appropriates funding for the Base Closure Account to fund environmental cleanup and caretaker functions at closed bases. In FY2020, the Trump Administration requested $278.5 million for BRAC continuing environmental and caretaker costs, with allocations for the Navy, Army, and Air Force. The FY2020 budget request includes $66.1 million for the Army, $54 million for the Air Force, representing a $63 million decrease from FY2019. Congress urged DOD to accelerate environmental remediation at BRAC sites, providing additional funds for this purpose. Priority should be given to sites with newly identified radiological cleanup costs to expedite the process and facilitate faster turnover of DOD property to the local community. The Department is directed to submit a spend plan for additional BRAC funds to congressional defense committees within 30 days of this Act's enactment. Congressional authorizers and appropriators have consistently included language in defense legislation to prohibit the use of funds for a new BRAC round. In FY2019, authorizers inserted language in the NDAA and defense appropriations bill to prevent a new BRAC round. Members in both chambers proposed legislation in 2017 regarding BRAC. In 2017, legislation was proposed for a new round of base closures, but no full BRAC was enacted. The FY2019 NDAA included provisions for BRAC-like actions within a state based on the governor's recommendation and local community support. Unlike traditional BRAC processes, there is no independent review panel, and the Secretary of Defense must report planned actions to congressional defense committees before implementation. The flexibility of Congress in amending past BRAC processes is highlighted in legislative proposals, with no BRAC legislation proposed in the 116th Congress. The Department does not plan to use new BRAC-like authorities authorized by the FY2019 NDAA, with no state requests received under this authority.

Amended over the years, the statute has retained its essential elements, establishing procedures the Secretary of Defense must follow before closing a military installation where a threshold number (currently 300) of civilian personnel are authorized to be employed, or realigning an installation that involves a reduction In-State BRAC Section 2702 of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 authorizes new in-state BRAC authorities, allowing the Secretary of Defense to realign or close military installations in a State under certain conditions. This includes restrictions on affecting more than 1,000 assigned members of the Armed Forces. The Secretary of Defense can realign or close military installations in a State if recommended by the Governor and included in the annual report. The notice must include a specific description of the installation and statements of support from local government units. The Secretary of Defense must respond to the Governor's recommendation for realignment or closure of a military installation within one year, indicating acceptance or rejection. The plan for reuse or redevelopment of the property must be detailed, with a designated local redevelopment authority responsible for implementation. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress if they intend to realign or close a military installation recommended by the Governor. The report must include the identification of the installations and reasons for the decision. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress with the Governor's recommendation for realignment or closure of military installations. The report includes a master plan for necessary facility actions, cost estimates, and a certification that savings will exceed costs within five years. The Secretary must wait 90 days after submitting a report to Congress before initiating the realignment or closure of military installations. The total cost for realignment or closure of military installations cannot exceed $2 billion, including planning, construction, maintenance, and other related costs.
