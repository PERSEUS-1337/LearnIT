    "content": "The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new section on Energy Efficient Appliance Credit under business-related credits. The Energy Efficient Appliance Credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows for a tax credit based on the production of qualified energy efficient appliances by the taxpayer. The credit amount is determined by the eligible production of appliances meeting specific energy efficiency criteria. The Energy Efficient Appliance Credit offers tax credits for producing energy-efficient appliances that exceed energy conservation standards. For example, a clothes washer with a 1.42 MEF or a refrigerator consuming 15-20% less kWh per year can qualify for a $100 credit. The Energy Efficient Appliance Credit provides tax credits for producing qualified energy efficient appliances that exceed energy conservation standards. Eligible production is determined by the excess of appliances produced in a calendar year compared to the average production in previous years. The Energy Efficient Appliance Credit offers tax credits for producing energy efficient appliances exceeding standards. Eligible production is based on the excess of appliances made in a year compared to previous years, with specific categories outlined for clothes washers and refrigerators. The enactment of this section affects the amount of credit allowed under subparagraph (A)(i) and (A)(ii), with a maximum credit limit of $60,000,000 for a taxpayer over all taxable years. The maximum credit limit for a taxpayer over all taxable years is $60,000,000, with a restriction of $30,000,000 for a combination of specific energy-efficient appliances. The credit amount is capped at 2 percent of the average annual gross receipts of the taxpayer for the preceding 3 taxable years. The qualified energy efficient appliance includes clothes washers and refrigerators meeting specific criteria. A clothes washer is defined as a residential washer, while a refrigerator must be an automatic defrost with a volume of at least 16.5 cubic feet. The term MEF stands for Modified Energy Factor. Special rules similar to section 52 apply. The taxpayer must provide necessary information to claim the energy efficient appliance credit. No carryback of the credit is allowed before the effective date. The energy efficient appliance credit determined under section 45G can be carried to a taxable year before January 1, 2003. Section 38(b) of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to include this credit as part of the general business credit. Additionally, a clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code. The energy efficient appliance credit (Sec. 45G) applies to appliances produced after December 31, 2002, in taxable years ending after that date."
