    "content": "The \"Healthy Children and Families Act of 2007\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress finds that Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program have provided health insurance to millions of low-income pregnant women and children. Nurse home visitation programs can improve their health by promoting access to care, reducing pre-term births, and enhancing child development. These programs also boost maternal employment and economic self-sufficiency. The Act aims to promote evidence-based nurse home visitation services for low-income pregnant mothers and children to improve prenatal health, pregnancy outcomes, child health and development, family stability, and economic self-sufficiency. These programs have been shown to reduce child abuse, neglect, arrests, and involvement in the criminal justice system, with a significant return on investment. The Act aims to promote evidence-based nurse home visitation services for low-income pregnant mothers and children to improve prenatal health, pregnancy outcomes, child health and development, family stability, economic self-sufficiency, reduce child abuse and neglect, maternal and child involvement in the criminal justice system, and increase birth intervals between pregnancies.
