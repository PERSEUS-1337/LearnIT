    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Workforce Reduction Through Attrition Act\" defines key terms such as \"total number of Federal employees,\" \"Federal employee,\" \"agency,\" \"quarter,\" and \"baseline quarter.\" It also establishes workforce limits and reductions. The President, through the Office of Management and Budget, must ensure that the total number of Federal employees does not exceed the applicable maximum for each quarter. The applicable maximum is calculated based on the baseline quarter and the number of employees separating from agencies. The target-attainment quarter is defined as the quarter where the total number of Federal employees does not exceed 90 percent of the total number as of September 30, 2012, or the quarter ending on September 30, 2015. Compliance with employee limits is required, with exceptions outlined. The Act requires reductions in Federal employees through attrition, with exceptions for quarters where the total number exceeds the maximum, allowing for reductions through attrition and a freeze on appointments. Counting rules specify full-time equivalent basis and criteria for determining the total number of Federal employees. The President has the authority to waive provisions of the Act for individual appointments in cases of war, national security, or emergencies. Measures must be taken to prevent an increase in service contracts procurement. The President can waive Act provisions for specific appointments during war, national security, or emergencies. Measures are needed to avoid a rise in service contract procurement, unless it benefits the Government financially. The Office of Management and Budget, in consultation with the Office of Personnel Management, is responsible for monitoring agencies to ensure compliance with the Act's requirements. A written determination must be submitted to the President and Congress every quarter. The President or his designee can prescribe any necessary regulations for implementing the Act."
