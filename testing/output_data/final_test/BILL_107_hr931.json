    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Sudan Peace Act\". It includes findings related to Sudan. The Government of Sudan's intensified prosecution of the war has resulted in over 2,000,000 deaths and 4,000,000 displacements. A comprehensive peace process, protected from manipulation, is crucial for a permanent resolution, human rights protection, and a self-sustaining Sudan. Strengthening and reforming humanitarian relief operations are essential, with continued U.S. leadership being critical. Regardless of Sudan's political status, efforts must continue for peace. The Government of Sudan's manipulation of traditional rivalries and use of militias in areas outside its control hinder self-sustenance and peace efforts. International reconciliation efforts have helped reduce human suffering caused by divide and conquer tactics. The Government of Sudan uses tactics like banning relief flights to disrupt populations' ability to sustain themselves and increase accountability internationally. They plan to use oil sales to escalate the war in areas outside their control and manipulate food aid receipt through veto power in relief operations. The United States and other donor countries have been crucial in providing relief and assistance to areas in Sudan outside of the Government's control, countering the Government's manipulation of food donations for advantage in the civil war. While immediate needs have been addressed, populations in these areas still face extreme disruption in sustaining themselves. The Nuba Mountains and Bahr al Ghazal are particularly at risk. The Nuba Mountains, Bahr al Ghazal, Upper Nile, and Blue Nile regions are excluded from relief distribution by OLS, increasing famine risk. International relief operations, costing over $1,000,000 per day, focus on immediate food needs but are not sustainable long-term. Populations' ability to defend against attacks in areas outside Sudan's control is compromised, leading to the belief in Sudan's government that battlefield success is possible. The United States should use various means of pressure to facilitate a comprehensive solution to the war in Sudan, including multilateralizing economic and diplomatic tools, supporting democratic civil authority, promoting reconciliation mechanisms, strengthening humanitarian relief mechanisms, and cooperating with trading partners. Cooperation among trading partners and multilateral institutions is essential for addressing the war in Sudan. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Government of Sudan\" refers to the National Islamic Front government in Khartoum, Sudan. The term \"OLS\" refers to the United Nations relief operation known as \"Operation Lifeline Sudan\". SEC. 4. CONDEMNATION OF SLAVERY, OTHER HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES, AND TACTICS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF SUDAN. Congress condemns violations of human rights in Sudan, including the Government's role in the slave trade and organized raiding parties in various regions. Congress condemns violations of human rights in Sudan, including the Government's sponsorship of aerial bombardment of civilian targets and the use of raiding and slaving parties to create food shortages and destroy the societies of the Dinka, Nuer, and Nuba peoples. SEC. 5. SUPPORT FOR AN INTERNATIONALLY SANCTIONED PEACE PROCESS. Congress recognizes the importance of a viable peace process in Sudan based on the Declaration of Principles from Nairobi, Kenya. The Secretary of State is authorized to support negotiations, peace settlement planning, and other diplomatic efforts for peace in Sudan. SEC. 6. MULTILATERAL PRESSURE ON COMBATANTS. The sense of Congress is that the United Nations should be utilized to promote peace and recovery in Sudan. The President should work through the US Representative to the UN to revise Operation Lifeline Sudan, investigate slavery in Sudan, and condemn the Government of Sudan. The United Nations should be used to promote peace and recovery in Sudan. The US should work through the UN to revise Operation Lifeline Sudan, investigate slavery, and condemn the Sudanese government for aerial bombardment of civilians. SEC. 7. REPORTING REQUIREMENT. Section 116 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to include additional reporting requirements related to Sudan's oil infrastructure, financing sources, aerial bombardment, and the government's ability to finance the war. The amendment to Section 116 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 includes reporting requirements on Sudan's oil infrastructure, financing sources, aerial bombardment, and obstruction of humanitarian relief efforts in the war. SEC. 8. Congress urges increased use of non-OLS agencies for relief efforts in southern Sudan. President must submit progress report within 90 days. SEC. 9. Contingency plan required for any ban on air transport relief flights. SEC. 9. The President must develop a contingency plan to provide relief to Sudan, including the Nuba Mountains and the Blue Nile regions, in case of a ban on OLS air transport relief flights. The President has the authority to reprogram funds for this plan."
