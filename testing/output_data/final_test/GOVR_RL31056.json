    "content": "The Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate money, but this responsibility has been delegated to the Federal Reserve System (Fed). Critics argue that the Fed's independence is undemocratic, rooted in debates about macroeconomic policy and the coordination of monetary and fiscal policy. The report provides a brief description of the Fed's structure and discusses how its independence impacts monetary policy. It also examines the economic consequences of proposals to limit the Fed's independence, highlighting the importance of understanding monetary policy's role in relation to fiscal policy. The Federal Reserve System was created in response to banking panics in the late 19th century. Despite its original mandate to create an \"elastic currency,\" the Fed later presided over banking panics in the 1930s. Its current role in conducting monetary policy was not initially believed by experts. The Federal Reserve System was initially created in response to banking panics in the late 19th century. Despite its original mandate to create an \"elastic currency,\" the Fed later presided over banking panics in the 1930s. Most experts did not believe that conducting monetary policy was a proper function of government at the time of its creation. The Fed's structure has been changed several times since its inception, with some observers questioning its suitability for the job. The Federal Reserve System's structure has remained largely the same since the late 1930s. U.S. monetary policy is determined by the seven-member Board of Governors, with a Chairman and Vice Chairman serving four-year terms. The President can remove Fed governors \"for cause,\" but not based on policy differences. The Chairman of the Fed, while powerful, only has one vote on the Board. The Federal Reserve System's structure includes 12 regional banks with a nine-member Board of Directors. The Board of Governors appoints six members, while member banks select the other three. The Board of Directors then appoints the president and vice president of each regional bank, subject to approval. The Board of Governors, along with the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank and four other regional bank presidents, make key decisions. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), consisting of the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank and four other regional bank presidents, determines the federal funds rate target through open market operations. The discount rate is set by the Board alone. Money is circulated by purchasing U.S. Treasury securities, generating income known as seigniorage. Member banks receive dividends based on their stake in the system after deducting operating costs. The Federal Reserve remits profits to the Treasury after deducting operating costs and adding to its capital account. In 2005, 92% of profits, totaling $21.5 billion, went to the Treasury, 3% to shareholder banks as dividends, and 5% to capital. This system allows the government to receive revenue from money creation without needing congressional funds for Fed operations. The Federal Reserve's monetary policy goals are determined by Congress, making it neither independent nor undemocratic. However, critics argue that its broad mandate enhances its independence. The Fed's responsibilities include providing an \"elastic currency,\" maintaining stable prices, maximum employment, moderate interest rates, and sustainable growth, as outlined in various legislation. The Federal Reserve's monetary policy goals are set by Congress to align with the employment goals of the federal government. These goals can conflict, but the Fed can usually find legislative authority for its monetary stance. Recessions often occur when aggregate supply exceeds demand due to price stickiness, leading to output declines. In times of economic downturns due to contracts, menus, and uncertainty, output declines, leading to a vicious cycle of rising unemployment and idle resources, lowering aggregate demand. The long-run solution involves price adjustments, but historical examples show this can be prolonged. To counter this, the government can use monetary policy to boost aggregate demand by injecting money into the economy through purchasing U.S. Treasuries, lowering interest rates to stimulate spending. The increase in spending due to lower interest rates boosts aggregate spending through higher investment in capital goods and consumption on interest-sensitive goods. Additionally, lower interest rates attract less investment to the United States, leading to a depreciation of the exchange rate and an increase in foreign spending on U.S. exports. In the long run, the printing of money has no real effect on the economy, and reductions in unemployment from expansionary monetary policy are temporary or dependent on the economy's initial state of full employment. Prices adjust to the increase in the money supply, causing inflation to rise. The closer the economy is to full potential when monetary policy becomes expansionary, the more inflation will increase rather than output. Fiscal policy can also be used to boost aggregate demand through increased government spending or tax cuts. Expansionary fiscal policy can lead to rising interest rates due to deficits being financed out of private saving, reducing availability for private capital investment. In a deep recession, deficit spending may not significantly impact interest rates, but in a near-full potential economy, interest rates will rise substantially, crowding out the increase in aggregate demand. Foreign investment may offset some of the decline when interest rates rise. When interest rates rise, foreign investment is attracted to the country, offsetting some decline in saving for investment. This causes the dollar exchange rate to appreciate, reducing foreign demand for U.S. exports and U.S. demand for import-competing goods. Monetary policy has become more powerful as the U.S. is more open to international capital flows and trade, while fiscal policy has become less powerful. Expansionary fiscal policy cannot sustainably increase the inflation rate beyond a certain limit. The deficit must be controlled to prevent hyperinflation, while monetary policy can influence interest rates temporarily. Expansionary monetary policy in a fully employed economy will lead to higher prices, offsetting the initial impact on interest rates. In the long run, fiscal policy determines interest rates, while monetary policy determines inflation rates. Fiscal policy can have a permanent effect on interest rates through government borrowing, while monetary policy can only temporarily influence interest rates. Expansionary fiscal policy leads to higher interest rates, while expansionary monetary policy results in lower interest rates. Contractions in fiscal policy lower growth and inflation with lower interest rates, while contractions in monetary policy lead to higher interest rates. Monetary policy determines inflation rates, while fiscal policy does not. Long-run economic growth is determined by labor, capital, and productivity growth rates. Adjustments from fiscal and monetary policies have different time lags, with price effects taking about two years and employment effects occurring within two or three quarters due to price stickiness and expectations. In a fully employed economy, prices do not adjust quickly enough for output effects to be zero and inflation to rise immediately. Expansionary policy boosts growth but leads to unsustainable booms and higher inflation. Contractionary policy to combat high inflation initially reduces output and increases unemployment, with inflation slowing down later. The credibility of the central bank's anti-inflation plan determines how quickly inflation responds to contractionary policy. If the public doubts the policy's continuation, prices will not adjust, leading to prolonged inflation and heightened unemployment. The role of credibility, expectations, and the state of the economy result in variability in the policy lag and output response. Designing precise policies to counter economic pressures is difficult, leading to swings in economic activity. Attempts to avoid business cycles may worsen them, with some economists blaming recessions on monetary policy errors. Criticisms of the Fed's structure focus on its perceived independence from the public and the decision-making process for monetary and fiscal policies. Critics argue that the Fed lacks coordination between monetary and fiscal policy, is not transparent or accountable, and its decisions are made in secrecy. The debate centers on whether monetary policy should be controlled by a few officials or not, with differing views on its importance and effects in the short and long term. The Federal Reserve's influence over the economy is short-term, not long-term. Efforts to control interest rates based on its short-run influence can lead to inflation or deflation. Unlike fiscal policy, monetary policy is influenced indirectly and Fed governors are less responsive to public opinion due to their long terms and appointed positions. The Federal Reserve's independence in implementing monetary policy is delegated by Congress, similar to the appointment of federal judges. While not unique in government structure, the Fed's independence raises questions about its appropriateness for monetary policy. The Federal Reserve's independence in implementing monetary policy is delegated by Congress, similar to the appointment of federal judges. The short-term positive employment effects of an over-expansion of the money supply are temporary, while the higher rate of inflation comes later. Anti-inflation policy takes time to achieve results and may cause an increase in unemployment in the interim. Seeking short-term gain at the cost of long-term pain could bias policy towards inflation and lead to more business cycles. The Federal Reserve's independence in implementing monetary policy is crucial to avoid premature policy reversals that render unemployment costs pointless. Proponents argue that independence helps offset bias from public pressure and political influence, allowing the Fed to resist the temptation to manipulate the economy for short-term gains. Critics believe historical examples show political pressure leading to incorrect Fed decisions, suggesting a need for some level of insulation in decision-making. Political pressure can lead to incorrect decisions by the Fed, suggesting a need for outside judgment over a longer time horizon. Decreasing the Fed's independence by involving officials from the executive branch or subjecting the Fed's budget to congressional approval raises democratic and economic concerns. However, making the Fed more responsive to short-term public opinion could result in increased inflation and premature policy reversals, as supported by international evidence. The independence and credibility of central banks, like the Fed, play a crucial role in controlling inflation. People's expectations of the Fed's actions impact inflation rates, as seen in wage contracts and pricing decisions by firms. This can lead to temporary higher inflation if people doubt the Fed's commitment to anti-inflationary measures. Inflation may be higher than expected due to changes in monetary policy, leading to a rise in unemployment and output contraction. A less independent central bank pursuing anti-inflationary policies may lack credibility, making the policy more painful and persistent. The alternative to an independent central bank could impact government checks and balances, as legislative bodies are not equipped to set discretionary policy like the Fed. Eliminating Fed's independence would shift economic power to the executive branch, impacting checks and balances. Fed independence is crucial for economic benefits, similar to fiscal policy's short-term gains and long-term costs. The reluctance of lawmakers to tighten fiscal policy during overheating of aggregate demand has led to fiscal policy falling out of favor as a stabilization tool. Effective fiscal policy dictates balancing the budget over the business cycle, with deficits in recession years offset by surpluses in boom years. The lack of coordination between monetary and fiscal policy has been highlighted as a concern, as the Fed can pursue a policy that contradicts the fiscal stance of Congress and the President. When fiscal and monetary policies are directed in concert, they can produce more effective outcomes by influencing aggregate demand with minimal disruption to interest rates and the exchange rate. This coordination can help prevent economic imbalances and minimize output effects on specific sectors or regions in the short run. Coordination between fiscal and monetary policies can prevent economic imbalances and make long-term business planning more predictable. However, if not well-coordinated, they could lead to worse policy outcomes. Fiscal deficits often result from a deadlock on raising taxes or reducing spending, which can be exacerbated by monetary policy. The deadlock over raising taxes or reducing spending can lead to fiscal deficits, which can be worsened by monetary policy. In systems where coordination is possible, there may be a temptation to use expansionary monetary policy to lower interest rates raised by fiscal policy, leading to accelerating inflation. Studies on hyperinflations have shown that an independent central bank is crucial in ending such episodes. Coordination between fiscal and monetary policies is not always effective, as seen in the government's fiscal situation in the 1980s and early 1990s. The fiscal situation of the government in the 1980s and early 1990s highlighted the dilemma of coordinating fiscal and monetary policies. Large budget deficits kept interest rates high, and efforts to bring deficits down were slow until the late 1990s. Coordination between fiscal and monetary policies could be inflationary, emphasizing the importance of the current division of economic policy responsibilities as a check-and-balance arrangement. The debate over coordination between monetary and fiscal policy raises concerns about the balance of power and the trade-off between maximizing benefits and minimizing costs. Critics also question the secrecy of the Fed's operations, with transcripts and minutes of meetings not released promptly. The Federal Reserve's accountability is limited by restrictions on audits, with the Government Accountability Office unable to audit monetary policy activities. The issue of accountability is separate from democracy, with alternative methods like rules proposed to increase Fed accountability without compromising independence. Economic analysis has limited value in this debate. The analysis explores how greater public scrutiny can impact policy, focusing on the economic effects of secrecy and disclosure at the Federal Reserve. It questions the costs of secrecy on markets and the implications of more transparency on the Fed's behavior and Congress's oversight. The rational expectations literature emphasizes the importance of information for efficient decision-making, suggesting that Fed secrecy could lead to unnecessary uncertainty and reduce economic efficiency and welfare. Increasing disclosure of Fed deliberations may not necessarily reduce the need to predict Fed policy due to the use of discretion in monetary policymaking. While proposals for more transparency may not diminish Fed-watching, better policy outcomes could result from more complete disclosure. The Fed's ability to make informed decisions could be enhanced with increased transparency. Increased transparency in the Federal Reserve's policy-making process could lead to better policy outcomes by promoting more closely reasoned decisions based on clear economic indicators and logical reasoning. This fuller disclosure would force the Fed to specify its models of economic behavior and the rationale behind its policy decisions, ultimately enhancing the Fed's ability to make informed decisions. The view that fuller disclosure from the Federal Reserve would improve oversight and accountability, especially for Congress in assessing monetary policy. Some economists argue that qualitative explanations from the Fed limit the effectiveness of disclosure and oversight. Critics argue that the Federal Reserve's policymaking lacks objectivity due to qualitative decision-making and vague mandates from Congress. They believe that only rules linking hard data to policy decisions can be judged objectively. The opposition to Fed independence stems from unelected officials having significant discretion in pursuing mandates without sufficient oversight from voters and elected representatives. Most economists propose removing discretion from monetary policy by strengthening the Fed's mandate into a strict rule. This would eliminate the need for Fed decision-making, making policy changes predictable and automatic based on economic data. The drawback is that the Fed currently lacks precision in its policy decisions. The Fed's rule-based policy regime lacks precision in controlling key variables like inflation and aggregate demand, leading to ineffective and variable outcomes with long lags. Directing the Fed to control variables it can influence, such as money supply growth or interest rates, does not guarantee economic stability. The Fed's rule-based policy regime lacks precision in controlling key variables like inflation and aggregate demand, leading to ineffective outcomes with long lags. Fixing interest rates or the exchange rate may not provide economic stability due to the variability in credit demand. The Fed's limited policy tools and multiple policy goals explain the need for discretion in policymaking. Discretion exists because a simple relationship between the Fed's actions and their impact on inflation and unemployment does not exist. Most economists believe economic stability relies on using monetary policy to stabilize inflation and demand growth. Some advocate for the \"Taylor rule\" as an alternative to discretionary policy, which automatically adjusts interest rates based on changes in inflation and output growth. The use of a rule to respond to changes in inflation and output growth could potentially be destabilizing in times of crisis. An inflation target, adopted by some foreign central banks, mandates that monetary policy's sole goal is to keep the inflation rate within a predetermined range in the long run, allowing central bankers discretion to reach the target. In practice, foreign central banks have shown flexibility in responding to changes in demand growth, even when inflation is above its target. Critics argue that inflation targets have not significantly reduced central bankers' discretion, as they still have the freedom to make decisions based on their judgment. Overall, an inflation target strikes a balance between rules and discretion, offering some benefits but also facing criticism for not fully eliminating central bank discretion. Under an inflation target, accountability would be increased as central bankers could no longer justify policy stances by conflicting mandates. However, evaluating specific discretionary decisions remains a challenge. The debate between rule-based monetary policy and discretionary control by unelected officials is ongoing. Milton Friedman's perspective on this issue is not discussed in this report. Economist Milton Friedman believed in a more democratic approach to monetary policy, comparing the contrast between rules and discretion to the Bill of Rights. He questioned why each case of free speech couldn't be treated separately, similar to arguments in monetary policy. Friedman argued against the belief that interest rates could always be fixed, emphasizing the need for an economically valid argument against independence. An economically valid argument against independence is that interest rate reductions have positive effects on output and employment sooner than negative effects on inflation. Independence or insulating the Fed from short-term political pressures can make necessary policies more likely to occur, despite potential drawbacks like oversight difficulties and lack of coordination between monetary and fiscal policy. While disallowing coordination may limit maximizing benefits of good policy, it can also minimize the effects of bad policy. If reducing Fed independence is too costly, alternative reforms could be considered. Monetary policy rules offer immunity from short-term pressures and increase accountability, potentially being seen as more democratic. The tradeoff between rules and discretion in stabilizing a complex economy is a point of contention among economists. An inflation target could increase accountability for the FOMC without significantly reducing its independence in devising monetary policy for a complex economy. Congressional oversight is hindered by vague Fed goals, and an inflation target could tighten these goals. The debate over Fed independence applies only to its monetary policy responsibilities, not other duties like bank regulation. The debate over Fed independence focuses on monetary policy responsibilities, not other duties like bank regulation. Arguments for and against reassigning the Fed's other duties are not discussed in this report."
