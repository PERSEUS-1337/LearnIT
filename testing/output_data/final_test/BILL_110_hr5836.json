    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Students in Business Development in Africa Assistance Act of 2007\". Congress acknowledges the growing need in developing countries in Africa to educate and train future business leaders to adapt to leadership complexities. This need calls for the development of the next generation of leaders to propel Africa into a peaceful and prosperous new century, ensuring lasting democracy. Entrepreneurial education is highlighted as a crucial way to train these leaders, as it enhances economic productivity. Providing all youth with access to opportunities for skill development is essential. Business and management education is crucial in Africa to train future leaders for self-employment and economic growth, as there are limited job opportunities in both private and public sectors. It is important to assist youth in gaining access to the economy and entrepreneurship to drive internal economic activity. In Africa, there is a shortage of business schools compared to India and the United States, leading to a lack of practical training for graduates. Globalization presents challenges for education and enterprise development, with educational institutions slow to respond to the need for enhanced learning opportunities. Assistance is provided to establish partnerships between businesses and postsecondary educational institutions in developing countries in Africa. The President, through the Administrator of USAID, is authorized to provide assistance to establish partnerships between businesses and postsecondary educational institutions in Africa. This aims to enhance education and entrepreneurship skills, promote economic freedom, competitiveness, civil society, and improve the quality of life in developing countries. Assistance should be provided through nongovernmental organizations. Nongovernmental organizations with at least 30 years of experience are eligible for assistance to support entrepreneurship skills of students in postsecondary educational institutions in Africa. The assistance aims to enable students to gain practical experience, provide opportunities for those unable to receive formal education, and carry out other relevant activities. The President shall report to Congress on the implementation of assistance programs for entrepreneurship skills in African postsecondary institutions, including training students and faculty, promoting program sustainability, supporting new operations, investing in long-term sustainability, and sharing best practices. The President is authorized to appropriate up to $800,000 annually from 2008 to 2012 for providing assistance and analyzing its potential in other regions."
