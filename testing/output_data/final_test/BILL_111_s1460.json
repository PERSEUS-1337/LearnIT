    "content": "The \"Building Student Success Act of 2009\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress acknowledges the need to increase the percentage of workers with college degrees, particularly among 25- to 34-year-olds, in order to improve the United States' standing globally. Community colleges play a significant role in higher education, enrolling a large portion of students pursuing postsecondary degrees and credentials. Community colleges enroll low-income individuals, first-generation college students, and underrepresented minorities. Graduation rates can be improved with more resources. The Federal Government aims to support community colleges for student success. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section on College Retention Challenge Grants, aimed at supporting community colleges for student success. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to establish a grant program for states to support community colleges. Grants are awarded for a 5-year period to cover the Federal share of costs for specified activities. Definitions for \"community college\" and \"open enrollment institution\" are provided. The term 'open enrollment institution' refers to a community college or higher education institution that accepts all students who apply for admission. Grant payments to grantees are based on the number of residents in the area. The allotment for each state in a fiscal year is determined based on the number of residents living below the poverty line and enrolled in open enrollment institutions compared to the total number of such residents in all states. The allotment for each State in a fiscal year is not less than 0.5 percent of the total appropriation. States are limited to using 5 percent of their allotment for administrative expenses. To apply for a grant, a State must submit an application listing open enrollment institutions and enrolled students. The State must provide descriptions of data systems, performance accountability systems, and initiatives to improve retention and completion rates at institutions of higher education. They must also assure dissemination of findings and best practices, review policies based on grant outcomes, and develop or revise policies accordingly. The State must develop or revise policies to support institutional success improvements, describe how the non-Federal share will be provided, and outline selection criteria for participating institutions to ensure equitable distribution and target resources to underrepresented student groups in higher education. The State receiving a grant under this subsection must award a grant or contract to a nonprofit or public entity with expertise in improving student outcomes in higher education. This entity will carry out a program to improve college retention and completion at selected open enrollment institutions. The State must award a grant for external evaluation and report annually on student outcomes. States can collaborate with others to improve retention and completion. Federal and non-federal shares are specified for the grant. The Federal share for activities under the grant is 2/3 of the costs, while the non-Federal share is 1/3 and can be in cash or in-kind from State resources or private organizations. The Secretary may reduce grant payments if a State fails to provide the full non-Federal share required. The Secretary can waive or reduce the non-Federal share for states in extreme economic distress or recovering from a natural disaster. The Secretary may temporarily deem a grantee ineligible for future payments. The grantee may not receive payment if they fail to submit an annual report or if the Secretary determines they are not meeting grant conditions. A nonprofit or public entity awarded a grant must issue a competition for open enrollment institutions and coordinate activities with them. The curr_chunk discusses the responsibilities of managing data, providing expertise, facilitating improvement strategies, developing policies, supporting institutional experimentation, and maintaining a web portal for open enrollment institutions. The curr_chunk focuses on the distribution of funds for professional development and technical assistance to open enrollment institutions. Nonprofit or public entities awarded grants must allocate funds as specified and ensure that participating campuses have sufficient resources for the activities outlined. The curr_chunk outlines the requirements for open enrollment institutions to participate in a program for student retention and completion improvement. It includes maintaining open admission policies, board support for student success plans, and a core team of institutional leaders. The curr_chunk describes the composition of a data team that will analyze student outcomes by various demographics. It includes key institutional leaders and faculty representatives. The curr_chunk outlines the institution's efforts to improve retention and completion rates, including using data for strategies, involving stakeholders, reporting outcomes, and forming partnerships. The program aims to increase student success by utilizing data for strategies, monitoring progress, and evaluating outcomes. It also involves developing strategies to improve retention and completion rates. The program focuses on closing performance gaps, involving stakeholders in strategy development, reporting outcomes, forming partnerships, and institutionalizing effective policies. Performance indicators are used to evaluate the program's impact on increasing student success. The program aims to increase student success by improving completion rates, enrollment in key courses, course completion, re-enrollment rates, certificate and degree attainment, and transfer to higher education institutions. Data collection and reporting must be disaggregated by various demographics for open enrollment institutions participating in the program. The program aims to increase student success by improving completion rates, enrollment in key courses, course completion, re-enrollment rates, certificate and degree attainment, and transfer to higher education institutions. Authorization of $500,000,000 for fiscal year 2010 and the following 4 years is provided for this purpose."
