The \"Drunk Driving Repeat Offender Prevention Act of 2013\" requires the use of ignition interlock devices to prevent repeat intoxicated driving. Chapter 1 of title 23, United States Code, is amended to include a new section on the use of ignition interlock devices. The section defines terms like alcohol concentration, driving while intoxicated, and ignition interlock device. An ignition interlock device is described as a device in a vehicle that requires a breath sample before starting the motor vehicle. The \"Drunk Driving Repeat Offender Prevention Act of 2013\" mandates the use of ignition interlock devices to prevent repeat drunk driving. A motor vehicle must have this device installed, requiring the driver to provide a breath sample before starting the vehicle if their alcohol concentration is above the legal limit. The law mandates the installation of an ignition interlock device for 180 days on vehicles of individuals convicted of driving while intoxicated. The period can be reduced to 90 days if the driver's license is suspended for 180 days. Noncompliance may result in the withholding of funds. The Secretary will withhold a percentage of funds from states that do not meet the requirements for installing ignition interlock devices on vehicles of individuals convicted of driving while intoxicated. The percentage withheld increases each fiscal year, starting at 1% in 2016, 3% in 2017, and 5% in 2018 and beyond. The Secretary will withhold funds from states not meeting ignition interlock device requirements. Withheld funds remain available for 3 fiscal years. If a state complies before the end of the period, funds will be apportioned back to the state. The State will receive withheld funds if it meets requirements within the specified period. The apportioned funds will be available for expenditure for three fiscal years, after which they will lapse if not used. If the State fails to comply with the requirements, the funds will lapse. The funds will lapse if not used within three fiscal years. Sec. 160. Use of ignition interlock devices to prevent repeat intoxicated driving."
