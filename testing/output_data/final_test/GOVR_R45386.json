The House Committee on Appropriations reported a bill for FY2019 with approximately $1.2 billion for FSGG independent agencies and $255 million for the CFTC in the Agriculture appropriations bill. The total funding would have been $1.4 billion, $0.9 billion below the President's request, with the largest difference in funding for the GSA. Title IX of the bill included provisions related to financial regulation, such as bringing the CFPB into the fold. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 6147, which included H.R. 6258 as Division B, shifting funding among FSGG agencies.
