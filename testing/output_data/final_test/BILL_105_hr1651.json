    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new section in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, SEC. 1259, which deals with constructive sales treatment for appreciated financial positions. If there is a constructive sale of an appreciated financial position, the taxpayer must recognize gain as if the position were sold at fair market value on the date of the sale. Any gain is included in the taxable year of the sale. Adjustments are made for subsequent gains or losses, and the holding period is determined as if the position was acquired on the date of the constructive sale. The term 'appreciated financial position' refers to any position with potential gain upon sale, including interests in stock, debt instruments, or partnership interests. A 'position' encompasses various financial instruments like futures contracts, short sales, or options, excluding interests with a term of three years or less. Positions where gain or loss is recognized during the taxable year are not considered. For tax purposes, a taxpayer is considered to have made a constructive sale of an appreciated financial position if they engage in certain transactions like short selling, entering into offsetting contracts, or futures contracts, and the transaction remains open for more than a year. A constructive sale occurs when a taxpayer engages in transactions like short selling, entering into offsetting contracts, or futures contracts with substantially identical property. The sale is deemed to occur one year after the transaction is entered into. For tax purposes, a person is related to another person in a transaction if the relationship falls under specific criteria and the transaction aims to avoid tax regulations. Debt instruments are considered similar to interest rate positions. Definitions include forward contracts and offsetting notional principal contracts. An offsetting notional principal contract involves paying the investment yield on a property in exchange for reimbursement for any decline in its value. Special rules apply if a taxpayer or related person enters into a transaction with an appreciated financial position that is subsequently sold while the transaction remains open. For the purpose of determining a constructive sale, a taxpayer or related person will be treated as entering into such transaction immediately after a sale. An interest in a trust actively traded is treated as stock. When there is a constructive sale of a portion of property, the specific property deemed sold is determined as in an actual sale. The IRS will prescribe regulations for carrying out the purposes of this section regarding constructive sales. The amendments made by this section regarding constructive sales treatment for appreciated financial positions will apply to constructive sales after the date of the enactment of this Act."
