    "content": "The \"Emergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act of 2008\" includes provisions for Federal-State agreements, a temporary extended unemployment compensation account, payments to States, financing provisions, fraud and overpayments regulations, definitions, and applicability. Any State can enter into an agreement with the Secretary of Labor to provide temporary extended unemployment compensation to individuals who have exhausted their regular benefits under State or Federal law. The agreement can be terminated with a 30-day notice. Individuals eligible for temporary extended unemployment compensation must meet certain criteria, including not receiving compensation under any other state or federal law, not receiving compensation from Canada, and filing an initial claim for regular compensation within a year before the enactment of the Act. Exhaustion of benefits occurs when an individual has received all available regular compensation based on employment or wages during their base period. For temporary extended unemployment compensation, individuals must meet specific criteria and exhaust their regular compensation benefits. The weekly benefit amount includes regular compensation and an additional $50 per week. State laws regarding regular compensation claims apply to the payment of extended benefits. The maximum amount of temporary extended unemployment compensation payable to an individual shall not exceed the amount established in their account. Governors of states in an extended benefit period may choose to provide temporary extended unemployment compensation instead of extended compensation. The governors of states in an extended benefit period may choose to provide temporary extended unemployment compensation to individuals who meet the requirements, without requiring the state to trigger off an extended benefit period. SEC. 3. TEMPORARY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACCOUNT. The State will establish a temporary extended unemployment compensation account for eligible individuals, with the amount in the account being 20 times the individual's average weekly benefit amount. The weekly benefit amount is determined by the regular compensation payable for total unemployment. The State will establish a temporary extended unemployment compensation account for eligible individuals, with the amount in the account being 20 times the individual's average weekly benefit amount. If the individual's account is exhausted during an extended benefit period, it will be augmented by 13 times the average weekly benefit amount for the benefit year. The enactment of this act allows for extended unemployment compensation in states under certain conditions specified in the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970. SEC. 4. PAYMENTS TO STATES WITH AGREEMENTS FOR TEMPORARY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION. Payments to states with agreements for temporary extended unemployment compensation shall be made at 100 percent of the compensation paid, with limitations on reimbursement under other federal laws. Payments to states with agreements for temporary extended unemployment compensation shall be made in advance or by reimbursement, in amounts estimated by the Secretary for each month. The estimates can be based on statistical, sampling, or other methods agreed upon by the Secretary and the State agency. SEC. 5. FINANCING PROVISIONS. Funds from the extended unemployment compensation account in the Unemployment Trust Fund will be used to make payments to States with agreements under this Act. The Secretary will certify payments to each State, and the Secretary of the Treasury will make payments to the State accordingly. Appropriations from the Unemployment Trust Fund will assist States in meeting administration costs under the Social Security Act. Funds from the Treasury will be used for extended unemployment compensation payments under specific conditions. Compensation under chapter 85 of title 5, United States Code, and based on services under section 3309(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is not required to be repaid. SEC. 6. FRAUD AND OVERPAYMENTS. Individuals who knowingly make false statements or fail to disclose material facts to receive undeserved temporary extended unemployment compensation will be ineligible for further benefits and may face prosecution under section 1001 of title 18, United States Code. Repayment is required for those who have received such benefits. Repayment of temporary extended unemployment compensation is required for individuals who received amounts they were not entitled to, unless the State agency waives it due to no fault on the individual's part or if repayment would be unfair. The State agency can recover the repayment by deducting from future benefits. Individuals who received temporary extended unemployment compensation they were not entitled to may have to repay it within 3 years. Repayment can be recovered by deducting from future benefits, with no single deduction exceeding 50% of the weekly benefit amount. Repayment is only required after a fair hearing has been given to the individual. Any determination by a State agency under this section shall be subject to review in the same manner and to the same extent as determinations under the State unemployment compensation law. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines key terms such as compensation, benefit year, and week according to the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970. SEC. 8. APPLICABILITY. An agreement under this Act applies to weeks of unemployment starting after the agreement is made and ending within one year of the Act's enactment. Temporary extended unemployment compensation can continue for individuals with remaining amounts in their account after one year, as long as they meet eligibility requirements. No augmentation of individual's account after 1 year from enactment of the Act. Compensation not payable after 18 months from enactment."
