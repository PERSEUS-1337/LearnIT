    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"New Mothers' Breastfeeding Promotion and Protection Act of 1998\". It includes findings related to breastfeeding promotion and protection. The Congress finds that women with infants and toddlers are the fastest growing segment of the labor force, with many returning to work within 3 months of giving birth. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding for at least 12 months, as breastmilk contains essential nutrients and promotes bonding between mother and child. Breastmilk also provides important antibodies and immune cells for the child's development. Breastmilk is crucial for infants' health, boosting vaccine effectiveness and protecting against various diseases like meningitis, cancers, asthma, and obesity. It also lowers the risk of chronic conditions such as diabetes and Crohn's disease, and enhances children's IQ. Breastfeeding support is essential. Breastfeeding promotion and support are vital in the WIC program, reducing costs and benefiting infant health. In a cost-benefit study in Colorado, exclusively breastfeeding WIC infants saved $161 in the first 6 months compared to formula-fed infants, with Medicaid savings of $112 per infant. Breastfeeding also lowers the mother's risk of cancer and osteoporosis. Women who wish to continue breastfeeding after returning to work have relatively few needs: availability of suitable breast pumps, a clean and private location to express milk at the worksite. Despite the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, courts have not interpreted it to include breastfeeding. Many employers have seen positive results from facilitating lactation programs in the workplace, including low absenteeism, high productivity, high company loyalty, high employee morale, and lower health care costs. Worksite programs that aim to improve infant health may also bring about a reduction in parental absenteeism and health insurance costs. Many women do not have adequate facilities for expressing milk at their workplace, leading to pumping in uncomfortable and lacking privacy restrooms. Many women face challenges in expressing milk at work, lacking privacy and adequate facilities. Some employers deny women the opportunity to breastfeed or express milk, leading to harassment, discrimination, and even discharge. Ineffective breast pumps have been reported to cause breastfeeding failure. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 is amended to include breastfeeding as a protected right. Employers can now receive a tax credit for providing a suitable environment for employed mothers to breastfeed or express milk for their children.

Carryback of the section 45D credit is not allowed before January 1. No portion of the unused business credit attributable to the credit under section 45D can be carried back before January 1, 1999. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1998. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish performance standards for breast pumps, regardless of their classification under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The standards will identify pumps suitable for regular use in workplaces based on efficiency, effectiveness, and sanitation factors. A compliance policy guide will also be issued to provide complete information to women who want to breastfeed using breast pumps. SEC. 6. FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE FOR NURSING MOTHERS' BREAKS. Amendment to the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 allows nursing mothers up to one hour in each 8-hour work day to express milk for a child during the first 12-month period of leave entitlement. Time can be taken in 2 half-hour periods or 3 20-minute periods, with proportional adjustments for longer or shorter shifts. This time is not deducted from the employee's leave entitlement.

Additionally, regulations for the implementation of this amendment must be promulgated within 180 days. Federal Employees who are lactating mothers are entitled to one hour in each 8-hour workday to express milk for their child during the first 12-month period of leave entitlement.

This time is separate from leave entitlement and does not affect compensation. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a campaign promoting breastfeeding benefits for infants, mothers, and families. This includes educating health professionals under Federal programs. Additionally, increased support for breastfeeding promotion and support activities will be provided under the WIC program. Section 17(h)(3) of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 is amended to allow State agencies to use funds from food benefits for breastfeeding promotion and support activities."
