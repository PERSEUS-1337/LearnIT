FINDINGS.\" The Congress finds that Amtrak, created in 1970, has received significant federal subsidies despite carrying only .3 percent of intercity travelers. It has cost taxpayers over $15 billion since its inception and may require an additional $10 billion in subsidies over the next 5 years to remain viable. The General Accounting Office predicts that Amtrak's expenses will rise due to renegotiating agreements with freight railroads, labor unions, and investing in modern equipment. Amtrak's financial condition has worsened, making cost recovery challenging. Statutory requirements ensure costly, inefficient service that cannot generate profits. The Railway Labor Act also impacts Amtrak's operations. The Railway Labor Act and the Federal Employers' Liability Act's application to rail passenger service employees is deemed excessive, costly, and burdensome, needing reduction to a more realistic level. Section 24101 of title 49, United States Code, and related items in the table of sections of chapter 241 of such title, are recommended for repeal. Section 24102 of title 49, United States Code, is amended by removing and redesignating certain paragraphs. Section 24103 is amended by repealing subsection (b) and redesignating subsection (c) as subsection (b). Section 24104 is amended to authorize appropriations for Amtrak for fiscal years 1996-1999. Chapter 243 is also amended. SEC. 5. CHAPTER 243 AMENDMENTS. Amends Chapter 243 of title 49 by removing sections 24302 through 24315 and adding a new item after section 24301. Chapter 243 of title 49 is amended by removing sections 24302 through 25315 and adding a new section 24302, which relinquishes rights to stock, notes, and mortgages issued by or with Amtrak. Chapter 245 is also amended by exempting Amtrak Commuter instead of Amtrak and repealing section 24504(c). Chapters 247 and 249 of title 49 are repealed. Service discontinuance is addressed in section 8. The new section added to Chapter 241 of title 49 addresses service discontinuance for rail carriers providing rail passenger transportation. Employees terminated due to discontinuance of intercity rail passenger service are limited to 6 months of wage continuation or severance benefits. Rail carriers can require employees to transfer to vacant positions after discontinuance. The new section in Chapter 241 of title 49 allows employees terminated due to rail passenger service discontinuance to transfer to vacant positions within the rail carrier's system, with options to choose between transferring to a new position or voluntarily furloughing with protective benefits. A transfer requiring a change in residence is defined as a new employment location more than 30 miles away from the employee's residence. The Federal Employers' Liability Act is amended to exclude common carriers providing rail passenger transportation. SEC. 10. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS. Amends various sections of title 49, United States Code, related to rail services planning, authorizing abandonment and discontinuance, employee protective arrangements, and terminal facilities. SEC. 11. EFFECTIVE DATES. SEC. 11. EFFECTIVE DATES. This Act will take effect 1 year after enactment, with exceptions for Sections 4, 8, and 9 which will be effective immediately. The repeal of section 24909 of title 49, United States Code, will take effect on October 1, 1995."
