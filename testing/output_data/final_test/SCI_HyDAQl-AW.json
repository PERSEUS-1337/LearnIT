    "content": "In reinforcement learning, agents interact with the environment for a fixed time before resetting in episodes. The task is to maximize performance over a fixed time or an indefinite period. The paper explores handling time limits in both cases, suggesting including remaining time as input for fixed time tasks and not treating time limits as environmental terminations for indefinite tasks. The proposed method improves the performance and stability of existing reinforcement learning algorithms by bootstrapping at the end of each partial episode. Experiments were conducted on various environments, showing positive results. The reinforcement learning framework involves sequential interaction between an agent and its environment, with the agent receiving a state representation, selecting an action, and receiving a reward signal. The agent aims to learn a good policy by maximizing future rewards, using a discount factor to decay rewards. Episode terminations are considered as entering an absorbing state with zero rewards. Optimizing for the expectation of return is suitable for tasks with predefined time limits. Equation 2 is used for time-limited tasks where the agent aims to maximize expected return over a fixed episode length. A discount factor of \u03b3 = 1 can be used, but it is common to use a smaller value to prioritize short-term rewards. The agent should take riskier actions as the time limit approaches, and including the remaining time in the agent's input, known as time-awareness, is proposed. In time-limited tasks, Equation 2 is used to maximize expected return over a fixed episode length. It is common to use a discount factor less than 1 to prioritize short-term rewards. Time-awareness, including the remaining time in the agent's input, is proposed to help the agent take riskier actions as the time limit approaches. In contrast, for time-unlimited tasks, optimizing for the expectation of return over an indefinite period is relevant. Time limits can diversify the agent's experience and prevent convergence to suboptimal policies. Differentiating between terminations due to time limits and those from the environment is crucial for learning good policies that extend beyond the time limit. Partial-episode bootstrapping is proposed for value-based algorithms to continue learning at states where termination is due to time limits. This method aims to improve performance in scenarios where time limits can facilitate learning but the goal is to learn optimal policies for indefinite periods. The impact of this method is evaluated using the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm on various benchmark domains. The study implemented novel environments using OpenAI Gym and standard benchmark domains from MuJoCo Gym. Modifications were made to the TimeLimit wrapper for time-aware and partial-episode bootstrapping agents. Reproducibility was ensured by using 40 seeds for initialization. Evaluations were conducted every 5 training cycles, with performance values averaged across all runs and smoothed for generating plots.

Time-awareness significantly improves the performance and stability of PPO for time-limited tasks. For time-unlimited tasks, bootstrapping at the end of partial episodes allows significant outperformance of standard PPO. The source code for all task variants using PPO with and without proposed methods will be publicly available soon. A visual representation of learned behaviors can be found at sites.google.com/view/time-limits-in-rl. In time-limited tasks, the goal is to optimize the return expectation by terminating interactions at a fixed time step if no environmental termination occurs earlier. This time-wise termination transitions to a terminal state when the time limit is reached in a time-dependent MDP. A decision-making agent in a time-limited environment operates as a stack of time-independent MDPs, transitioning to a terminal state after a fixed time step. This leads to state-aliasing issues, causing suboptimal policies and credit assignment problems. The perceived stochasticity of transitioning to a terminal state from any state adds complexity to the decision-making process. In time-limited environments, the perceived stochasticity of transitioning to a terminal state from any state is influenced by the agent's behavioral policy. Time-awareness is proposed for reinforcement learning agents to include the remaining time in the state representation, addressing state-aliasing issues and improving decision-making processes. This notion of time has been overlooked in benchmark domains and evaluation of reinforcement learning agents, despite its importance demonstrated by previous research. The approach considers a general class of time-dependent MDPs with reward and transition distributions varying over time. Time-aware agents use the remaining time in decision-making, improving state-value estimation and addressing state-aliasing issues. Time-unaware agents lack this crucial information, impacting their performance in time-limited environments. The time-unaware agent updates its action probabilities without considering the remaining time, leading to inconsistent value estimates. This results in learning an approximate average of these updates instead of an accurate value function. Incorporating the remaining time T \u2212 t into the observations in the Gym environment allows for learning optimal time-dependent policies. An example scenario involves an MDP with states A and B, where the agent must choose between staying in place or jumping to state B with rewards and penalties. The goal is to jump at the last moment, which is impossible for a time-unaware agent. In a deterministic gridworld environment with two possible goals, a time-aware agent can learn to stay in place for T \u2212 1 steps and then jump, achieving a sum of rewards of +1. The agent has 5 actions and episodes terminate at T = 3 or upon reaching a goal. Training was done using tabular Q-learning with random actions until convergence. The time-aware agent in a gridworld environment learns to go for the closest goal when there is enough time, and to stay in place otherwise. The time-unaware agent's values converge based on penalties and time limits, leading to a learned value function for states non-adjacent to the goals. The learned value function in the gridworld environment leads to a policy that prioritizes the closest goal, even without time information. State-aliasing confusion during training can cause values to leak to unreachable states. Monte Carlo methods like REINFORCE are not affected by this leakage but still struggle without time awareness in certain scenarios. Time-aware agents can dynamically adapt to remaining time, correlating it with the agent's progress. In the \"Queue of Cars\" environment, an agent controls a vehicle stuck behind a moving queue of cars, aiming to reach an exit 9 slots away. The agent can choose a \"safe\" action to advance with 50% probability or a \"dangerous\" action with 80% probability but a 10% chance of collision. Rewards are only given upon reaching the destination, with the episode ending by reaching the exit, running out of time, or colliding during an overtake. In the \"Queue of Cars\" environment, an agent aims to reach an exit 9 slots away by choosing safe or dangerous actions. Time-aware agents adapt their actions based on remaining time, while time-unaware agents rely on position only. Performance of PPO with and without remaining time input is evaluated on various continuous control tasks. The performance of PPO in continuous control tasks from OpenAI's MuJoCo Gym benchmarks significantly improves with time-awareness, as shown in FIG1. Time-aware agents learn accurate decay of expected return with time, while time-unaware agents only learn a constant estimate due to state-aliasing. Performance comparisons in the Hopper-v1 domain also demonstrate the benefits of time-awareness. In the Hopper-v1 domain, time-aware PPO outperforms standard PPO with a discount rate of 0.99. As agents improve, time-unaware PPO faces more terminations, leading to inconsistent returns. Time-aware PPO excels with a discount rate of 1 by accurately assigning credits based on remaining time, avoiding conflicts seen in time-unaware PPO. Time-awareness proves beneficial in time-limited tasks for maximizing performance. In time-limited tasks, time-aware agents demonstrate unique strategies to maximize performance, such as jumping towards the end to achieve a \"photo finish\". Time-unaware agents struggle to accurately achieve this. Additionally, time-unaware agents may opt to stay in place to accumulate rewards, showcasing a different behavior. Including the notion of remaining time in the agent's observation can enhance performance in maximizing expected returns. Including the notion of remaining time in an agent's observation can enhance performance in maximizing expected returns. However, in tasks where the goal is to learn a policy for a time-unlimited task, having time limits can lead to suboptimal policies. One solution is to not have time limits during training but instead expose the agent to short interactions for diverse experiences. In tasks not time-limited, the goal is to optimize the return over an indefinite period. To increase diversity, time limits can be used to reset the environment. It is important not to mistake time limit terminations as environmental ones. Value-based algorithms can continue bootstrapping at states where termination is due to time limits. The state-value function can be rewritten in terms of the time-limited return and bootstrapped value. The text discusses the temporal-difference update rule for estimating state values in time-limited tasks. It introduces a partial-episode bootstrap method to address conflicting updates when estimating state values. This method aims to prevent falsely bootstrapping values from out-of-reach states. The text discusses the issue of bootstrapping values from out-of-reach states in time-limited tasks. It introduces a method to address this problem by continuing bootstrapping from non-terminal states at the time limit, allowing the agent to learn an optimal policy for an indefinite period. The text introduces modifications to the PPO algorithm to address the issue of bootstrapping values from out-of-reach states in time-limited tasks. It includes changes to the Gym's TimeLimit wrapper and PPO implementation to enable continuing bootstrapping when terminations are due to time limits only. The proposed approach modifies the PPO algorithm to address bootstrapping values from out-of-reach states in time-limited tasks, using GAEs for bootstrapping. The aim is to maximize the agent's expected return over a time-unlimited horizon in the Hopper-v1 environment. Reacher-v1 and InvertedPendulum-v1 environments are not revisited due to limited value in extending them to time-unlimited domains. The proposed partial-episode bootstrapping modification significantly outperforms the standard PPO in time-unlimited domains. The agents are trained on time-limited episodes but evaluated with a much longer time limit, showing impressive results with the proposed method reaching the evaluation time limit on 7 occasions. The proposed agent demonstrates the ability to learn non-cyclic policies in a novel MuJoCo environment with a torque-controlled ball pushing a cube to specified targets indefinitely. The environment consists of a cube pushed by a ball within walls, with the agent receiving rewards only when the cube reaches a target location. To prevent agents from getting stuck, a time limit of 50 is introduced during training. Performance comparisons between standard PPO and modified versions are shown in FIG4. The study compared the performance of standard PPO with a modified version using an entropy coefficient of 0.03 to encourage exploration. The modified version showed better performance, reaching 36 targets in a single evaluation episode compared to 21 for the standard PPO. Time-awareness was found to be crucial for correct credit assignment in time-limited domains. In time-limited domains, reinforcement learning agents can still perform well even without explicit knowledge of the remaining time. Complex architectures like recurrent neural networks are used to address scenarios with partial observations. However, including the remaining time as part of the agent's input allows for better diagnosis of learned policies and improved generalization in domains with varying time limits. The proposed partial-episode bootstrapping approach in reinforcement learning can be applied to domains with varying time limits. It allows for generalization as time approaches zero, especially in real-world applications like robotics. To ensure reliable predictions, sufficient exploration is needed, which can be achieved by randomizing initial states for appropriate exploration. This method is not limited to time constraints and can be applied in various scenarios. The proposed partial-episode bootstrapping approach in reinforcement learning can be applied to domains with varying time limits, allowing for generalization as time approaches zero. This method enables better optimization for time-limited and time-unlimited domains, potentially improving the performance and stability of existing reinforcement learning algorithms. It is suggested to consider expected returns rather than the undiscounted sum of rewards for performance evaluation. When learning policies for time-limited tasks, including the remaining time as part of the agent's input is crucial to avoid state-aliasing and achieve optimal policies. For time-unlimited tasks, continuing bootstrapping at the end of partial episodes can improve performance and stability. These methods significantly enhance the performance of PPO in optimizing for different optimality models."
