The Congress finds that the Nation's economy, education, and society rely on broadband networks for economic growth, job creation, and innovation. Access to broadband networks for content and services is crucial for global leadership in technology. The historic policies ensuring open access to telecommunications networks have enabled the Internet as a medium for worldwide use. The Internet's open architecture for global communication is at risk due to recent FCC interpretations and court decisions. Broadband network owners may control content and services, potentially harming the high-tech economy. Most residential consumers rely on just two wireline providers for broadband services. Broadband network operators have an economic interest in discriminating in favor of their own services and against other online providers. A network neutrality policy based on nondiscrimination is crucial to keep broadband networks open to independent service providers and content creators, providing certainty to entrepreneurs and investors who rely on the Internet for commercial purposes. Such a policy can also allow operators to maintain network reliability, combat spam, and prevent illegal activities. The United States should adopt a clear policy endorsing the open nature of Internet communications and freely accessible broadband networks to support economic growth and First Amendment rights.
