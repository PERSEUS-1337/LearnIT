    "content": "The \"Broadband Adoption Act of 2013\" may be cited as the Broadband Lifeline Assistance Program. Section 254(j) of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to establish a Broadband Lifeline Assistance Program with the purpose of promoting broadband adoption among all people in the United States, especially low-income households facing barriers due to the price of broadband service. The Commission is required to establish this program within 270 days of the enactment of the Broadband Adoption Act of 2013. The Broadband Lifeline Assistance Program, established under the Adoption Act of 2013, aims to provide reduced charges for broadband service to qualifying low-income customers in urban and rural areas. Providers participating in the program will be reimbursed for each customer served. The program structure is similar to the Lifeline program for basic telephone service. The Commission will consider the results of the Low-Income Broadband Pilot Program when finalizing the program rules. The Commission may consider providing a preference to broadband service providers that offer digital literacy programs as part of their services. The Commission, in consultation with the Federal-State Joint Board, may decide on State matching funds for low-income households. Lifeline support amount is based on market prices and broadband speeds. The Commission ensures technology neutrality in the Lifeline program to promote competition among service providers. Broadband service providers do not need to be eligible telecommunications carriers to participate. The Commission requires eligible telecommunications carriers to obtain authorization to participate in the Lifeline program. Regulations are in place to prevent duplicate subsidies and ensure accountability to prevent waste, fraud, or abuse. The Commission will establish rules to prevent waste, fraud, or abuse in the Lifeline program and create a national database for determining consumer eligibility for subsidies."
