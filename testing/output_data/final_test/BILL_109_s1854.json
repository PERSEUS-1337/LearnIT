    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Treat Emergency Victims Fairly Act of 2005\". It includes findings related to emergency situations. Congress finds that price gouging in emergencies, including natural disasters, is reprehensible and can strain commercial and consumer relationships. Some individuals take advantage of emergency situations by engaging in price gouging for goods and services. This activity can occur before, during, and after emergencies, affecting interstate commerce. Price gouging distorts markets across State lines, disrupts flow of commodities, and creates shortages. Prohibiting and deterring price gouging is in the interest of the United States. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"emergency\" refers to a natural disaster or event declared as such by authorities, \"goods or services\" include various types like food and housing, \"person\" encompasses individuals or entities, and \"price gouging\" is charging unreasonably high prices during an emergency. During an emergency, a price increase of at least 10 percent greater than the average price charged in the 30 days prior is considered unreasonable and unconscionable. During an emergency, a price increase of at least 10 percent greater than the average price charged in the 30 days prior is considered unreasonable and unconscionable. If the price is at least 25 percent greater within 30 days following the declaration of the emergency, it is presumed to be affected by the emergency. During an emergency, a price increase is considered unreasonable and unconscionable if it exceeds 10 percent of the average price charged in the 30 days prior.

Any action under this section must be brought within 3 years of the sale of the goods or services in question. SEC. 5. DAMAGES AND PENALTIES. A prevailing plaintiff in a price gouging case is entitled to damages, injunctive relief, and attorneys fees.
