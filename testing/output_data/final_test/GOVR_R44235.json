    "content": "The appointment of a Supreme Court Justice is a significant event in American politics due to the Court's judicial power. The process is outlined in the U.S. Constitution's Appointments Clause. The U.S. Constitution's Appointments Clause outlines the process for appointing Supreme Court Justices, involving nomination by the President, confirmation by the Senate, and consideration by the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Senate plays a crucial role in confirming Supreme Court Justices, acting as a safeguard on the President's judgment. Justices receive lifetime appointments, and the Senate traditionally applies a more exacting standard to Supreme Court nominations due to the Court's special importance. Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement from the Court on June 27, 2018. Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement from the Supreme Court on June 27, 2018, effective July 31, 2018. Justices on the Court hold lifetime appointments and can only be removed through impeachment by Congress. This job security is intended to ensure the independence of the judiciary from the President and Congress. Since 1954, only one Justice has been impeached in 1804 but remained in office after being acquitted. Justices often serve for 20 to 30 years, sometimes outlasting the President who nominated them. The prospect of lifetime tenure, interesting work, and prestige lead Justices to serve as long as possible. Historically, many Justices have died while in office, with a significant number of vacancies in the first half of the 20th century due to deaths. However, since 1954, only 2 out of 24 vacancies were due to a Justice's death while in office. Since 1954, most vacancies on the Court have been due to voluntary retirement, with retirement being the most common way for Justices to leave the bench. Resignation is rare, with only two recent instances of Justices resigning. When Justices retire or resign, the President is usually notified by formal letter. Justices can retire due to permanent disability by providing a certificate to the President. Prior to 1939, Congress had to pass legislation to grant retirement benefits to a Justice leaving due to disability. In 1910, Justice Moody received a pension after being ill for almost a year. When a Chief Justice vacancy occurs, the President can nominate an Associate Justice for the position. If confirmed, the nominee must resign as an Associate Justice. When a Supreme Court nominee is confirmed, they must resign as an Associate Justice to assume the new position. This scenario is rare, with Presidents attempting to elevate Associate Justices to Chief Justice four times from 1900-2009. In 1986, President Reagan nominated William H. Rehnquist as Chief Justice, leading to Antonin Scalia being nominated to fill the Associate Justice vacancy. Vacancies on the Court occur due to death, retirement, or resignation of a Justice. When a Supreme Court vacancy occurs, the President selects a successor and the Senate provides \"advice and consent.\" Scholars debate the Senate's role in advising the President before or after the nominee's selection. The Senate's role in advising the President on Supreme Court nominees varies historically. Presidents often consult with Senate leaders and Judiciary Committee members before choosing a nominee. Senators providing candid objections can help identify candidate shortcomings or potential confirmation battles. The Senate plays a crucial role in advising the President on Supreme Court nominees. Senators can provide input that may influence the President's choice or highlight potential confirmation challenges. \"Senatorial courtesy\" is a custom where Senators may support a colleague's opposition to a nominee from their state. This practice has sometimes led to the defeat of Supreme Court nominations. Additionally, Senators often give private advice to the President regarding nominees. Senators play a crucial role in advising the President on Supreme Court nominations, providing input that can influence the President's choice. They may publicly support or oppose potential nominees to attract the President's attention. Advice can also come from various sources like high-level advisers, House Members, party leaders, interest groups, and news media commentators. Presidents are free to consult with whomever they choose, and the criteria for selecting a nominee vary. While Senators play a crucial role in advising the President on Supreme Court nominations, the President's choices are primarily motivated by political interests and the search for a nominee with high professional qualifications. Presidents consider a wide range of political factors when selecting a nominee, often choosing someone whose views align with their own policy preferences. The President's considerations for Supreme Court nominations include aligning with policy preferences, pleasing key constituencies, maintaining balance among Court members, and assessing Senate confirmation prospects. Other factors such as party affiliation, geographic origin, ethnicity, religion, and gender may also be important. Presidents prioritize nominees with outstanding legal qualifications for the Supreme Court, meeting public expectations of excellence. Nominees typically have legal backgrounds as judges, scholars, or government officials. While not required by law, all Supreme Court Justices have been lawyers. After nomination, the Senate holds committee hearings. The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary evaluates Supreme Court nominees based on professional qualifications, not political beliefs. Data shows that most nominees have been federal appellate court judges at the time of nomination since 1945. Since 1945, most Supreme Court nominees have been federal appellate court judges at the time of nomination, with a smaller percentage coming from the executive branch. Recent presidencies have seen an even higher percentage of nominees serving as appellate judges prior to nomination. Professional qualifications are a key consideration for nominees, but political factors also play a role in the selection process. Professional qualifications, integrity, and impartiality are key considerations for Supreme Court nominees. Presidents aim to select individuals who share their vision of the nation and the Court, in addition to possessing judicial temperament. This criteria is based on historical expectations dating back to Alexander Hamilton's Federalist Papers. Presidents consider professional qualifications, integrity, and impartiality when selecting Supreme Court nominees. Judicial temperament, described as evenhandedness and dedication to the process, is also crucial. President Obama highlighted qualities like mastery of the law and commitment to impartial justice when nominating Judge Sonia Sotomayor in 2009. President Obama emphasized the importance of experience in addition to qualities like impartial justice when selecting a Supreme Court Justice. He highlighted how experience can provide a common touch, compassion, and an understanding of ordinary people's lives, making it a necessary ingredient for the kind of Justice needed on the Supreme Court. Additionally, when filling a vacancy for Chief Justice, a President must consider factors like political acceptability, legal qualifications, and integrity. When selecting a Chief Justice nominee, a President looks for proven leadership qualities, administrative and human relations skills, distinction, and an appropriate age to ensure maturity and experience. These qualities are essential for fostering collegiality among Court members, commanding respect, and maintaining public trust in the Court. The selection process for a Chief Justice nominee involves investigating the background of prospective nominees, including their public record, professional credentials, and private background. The FBI conducts the private background investigation, while the public record and professional abilities are examined by high Justice Department officials and White House aides. This investigative process helps identify potential candidates and evaluate their merits based on known information. The selection process for a Chief Justice nominee involves investigating potential candidates to assess their qualifications and compatibility with the President's requirements. This involves intensive investigations to flag any disqualifying factors and may include assistance from private lawyers, legal scholars, or the American Bar Association. The President may personally meet with candidates before making a final nomination decision. During the pre-nomination phase, Presidents vary in how they reveal potential Supreme Court nominees. Secrecy allows for reflection on qualifications and background investigations away from public scrutiny. Alternatively, some Presidents may openly disclose candidate names to gauge reactions and demonstrate a thorough search for the most qualified person. During the pre-nomination phase, Presidents may conduct a comprehensive search for potential Supreme Court nominees in advance. President George W. Bush's administration began background research on potential nominees immediately after taking office in 2001, anticipating a vacancy. White House staff assigned young lawyers to candidates for detailed reports, and interviews were conducted in preparation for a possible retirement by Chief Justice Rehnquist. President George W. Bush's administration began background research on potential Supreme Court nominees in advance, conducting interviews with prospective replacements to ensure preparedness for a Justice stepping down. The early research aimed to provide coolheaded advice and avoid external political pressure in selecting a nominee promptly. When a Justice steps down from the Court, Presidents sometimes quickly select their nominee. Presidents Reagan and George H. W. Bush chose their nominees within days of Justices announcing their retirements. President Clinton took more time in selecting his nominees, with Ruth Bader Ginsburg nominated nearly three months after a retirement announcement and Stephen G. Breyer nominated approximately five weeks after a retirement announcement. President George W. Bush's first two selections were not immediate, with John G. Roberts Jr. announced as a nominee. President Bush and President Obama both made swift Supreme Court nominee selections following retirements or deaths of Justices. President Bush chose John G. Roberts Jr. to succeed Sandra Day O'Connor and Harriet E. Miers to succeed Justice O'Connor. President Obama selected Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Merrick Garland within approximately one month of incumbent Justices departing the Court. Since 1975, there have been three vacancies on the Supreme Court that had multiple nominations by a President in order to be filled. The first instance was in 1987 when President Reagan first nominated Robert Bork, followed by Douglas H. Ginsburg, after the Bork nomination was rejected by the Senate. President Reagan's nomination of Douglas H. Ginsburg came shortly after the rejection of Robert Bork's nomination. Ginsburg later withdrew his name from consideration, leading to the nomination of Anthony Kennedy. The process took approximately 4.5 months from Justice Powell's retirement to Kennedy's nomination. Another instance of multiple nominations occurred with Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's retirement, where John Roberts Jr. was nominated by President G.W. Bush 18 days after O'Connor's announcement. President G.W. Bush's nomination of John Roberts Jr. to replace Justice O'Connor was later withdrawn, leading to the nomination of Harriet Miers, which was also withdrawn. Samuel Alito was then nominated and confirmed by the Senate, taking approximately 4 months from O'Connor's retirement announcement. The vacancy created by Justice Scalia's death also had multiple nominations before Neil Gorsuch was appointed. The vacancy created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in 2016 saw nominations by two different Presidents. President Obama nominated Merrick Garland, whose nomination was not acted upon by the Senate. President Trump later nominated Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacancy. The President may quickly announce a nominee for a Supreme Court vacancy, either with advance notice or from a prepared shortlist, to preempt other nominations and minimize vacancy time. The President may swiftly nominate a Supreme Court Justice to minimize vacancy time, especially in cases of unexpected vacancies or imminent retirements. The President can quickly nominate a Supreme Court Justice to reduce vacancy time, allowing the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senate up to three months to consider the nomination before the Court's term starts in October. Justices giving advance notice of retirement can give the President and Senate more time to nominate and confirm a successor. President Clinton announced Justice Blackmun's retirement, prompting a quick nomination of Stephen G. Breyer to avoid a lengthy selection process like the one with Ruth Bader Ginsburg. President Obama also had advance notice of a Court vacancy from Justice Souter. President Obama had considerable advance notice of Justice Souter's retirement, taking 25 days to nominate Sonia Sotomayor after seeking advice from Members of Congress. President Obama quickly nominated Sonia Sotomayor for the Supreme Court, with hopes for a swift confirmation before the Senate's August 2009 recess. This decision was influenced by the desire to allow the Senate to begin considering the nomination promptly. The timing of nominations can be crucial, as seen with Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's retirement announcement to President George W. Bush in 2005. Justice O'Connor announced her retirement in 2005, with a conditional timeline for her successor's confirmation. President Bush nominated John G. Roberts Jr. as her replacement, but Justice O'Connor remained on the Court until Samuel A. Alito Jr. was confirmed in January 2006. President Bush nominated John G. Roberts Jr. to succeed Justice O'Connor, but the nomination was withdrawn. After Chief Justice Rehnquist's death, Roberts was nominated as Chief Justice. Two more nominations followed, including Harriet E. Miers, before Samuel A. Alito Jr. was confirmed in January 2006. Selecting a Supreme Court nominee quickly may have drawbacks, such as accusations of not consulting adequately with the Senate or rushing the decision without proper vetting. Quick announcements may also not allow for a thorough background investigation by the FBI before nomination, potentially leading to unfavorable information about the nominee later on. Some nominees chosen swiftly by a President were not ultimately approved by the Senate. For example, President Reagan announced his intention to nominate Robert Bork just days after Justice Powell's retirement. President Reagan quickly nominated Robert Bork after Justice Powell's retirement, but the nomination failed in the Senate. Subsequently, Reagan intended to nominate Douglas H. Ginsburg, who later withdrew his name. Quick selection of nominees doesn't guarantee Senate approval. In history, Presidents made temporary recess appointments to the Supreme Court when the Senate was not in session. Recess appointments to the Supreme Court historically served to fill vacancies when the Senate was unavailable to confirm a President's appointees. These appointments were temporary, expiring at the end of the next session of Congress. Despite controversy for bypassing the Senate's role, most recess appointees later received permanent appointments after Senate confirmation. The last President to make a recess appointment to the Court was. The Senate adopted a resolution in 1960 stating that the President should not make recess appointments to the Supreme Court unless necessary to prevent a breakdown in the Court's business. This resolution was passed largely along party lines, with proponents arguing that judicial independence could be compromised by recess appointees. The Senate resolution in 1960 aimed to limit recess appointments to the Supreme Court to prevent interference with judicial independence. Supporters argued that appointees might be influenced by the President or Senate, while opponents believed it restricted the President's constitutional powers and hindered the Court's ability to handle its workload. Opponents of the 1960 Senate resolution argued that it exceeded Congress's powers and was a criticism of President Eisenhower and certain Supreme Court justices who were recess appointees. Due to criticisms of judicial recess appointments in recent decades and changes in Senate recesses, a President in the 21st century may be hesitant to make a recess appointment to the Court. Recent Supreme Court rulings on the Recess Appointments Clause could also limit a President's ability to make such appointments."
