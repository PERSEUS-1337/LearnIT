    "content": "Derivatives are financial instruments like futures, options, and swaps that derive their value from an underlying asset. Prices fluctuate based on the asset's rates, and firms use derivatives to manage risk, such as hedging against price increases. Southwest Airlines used derivatives to buy jet fuel at a low price in 2008 despite record high energy prices. Derivatives are used to hedge risk and speculate on price movements, adding liquidity to the market. Some believe speculative trading increases market instability, while others argue it enhances efficiency. Most derivatives today are linked to financial variables, with the market measured in trillions of dollars and billions of contracts traded. The derivatives market is valued in trillions of dollars with billions of contracts traded annually. There was significant growth in derivatives markets between 2000 and the 2008 financial crisis, with a slight decline after 2008. The total notional value of OTC derivatives globally fell post-2008 but has since increased. Overall, global notional values for OTC derivatives have decreased from $684 trillion in June 2008 to $493 trillion in December 2015, partly due to the shift of derivatives trading to exchanges. The financial crisis led to a debate on whether the rapid growth in derivatives markets had contributed to structural instability. Trade compression on exchanges has led to a gradual drop in notional value, with interest-rate swaps dominating the market. Derivatives exposures were a major factor behind the severe market turmoil during the crisis. The financial crisis raised concerns about derivatives exposures contributing to market turmoil and structural instability. The Dodd-Frank Act was passed in 2010 to require major financial institutions to back risk exposures with capital and collateralize large derivatives bets. Debate continues on the effectiveness of Dodd-Frank in reducing systemic risks, with some arguing it has imposed costs on U.S. financial institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act has imposed costs on U.S. financial institutions, affecting their competitiveness. This report discusses debates related to legislative proposals in the 114th Congress on regulating derivatives, including futures, options, and swaps. Swaps, futures, and options are different financial instruments but can achieve similar investment outcomes. Prior to Dodd-Frank, swaps were traded over-the-counter. The regulatory landscape for swaps, futures, and options changed with the Dodd-Frank Act. Swaps were unregulated before Dodd-Frank, while futures and options were overseen by the CFTC or SEC. Both agencies require fair trading rules and registration for market professionals and exchanges. Data on prices and trading volumes must be publicly available. Exchanges are centralized markets where buying and selling interests converge. Traders can take long positions (benefiting from price increases) or short positions (benefiting from price decreases). Deals are made and prices are reported throughout the day. In the OTC market, contracts are made bilaterally without the need for disclosure to regulators or the public. Exchange-traded derivatives differ from OTC derivatives in terms of transparency and regulation. Derivatives are volatile contracts with high leverage, leading to significant gains or losses for traders. Exchanges manage credit risk through clearinghouses that rely on margin payments. Traders must meet margin calls by posting additional collateral to cover losses before the next trading session. The margin call process requires traders to cover losses immediately to avoid position closure. This system prevents large paper losses that could harm the clearinghouse in case of default. Trading on futures exchanges involves pay-as-you-go basis to prevent significant losses. The trade is executed on the exchange floor or electronic network and then sent to the clearinghouse for payment guarantee. In the OTC market, dealers facilitate trades and charge fees on each transaction, absorbing credit risk from customer default. In the OTC market, dealers absorb credit risk from customer default, while customers face the risk of dealer default. Few dominant firms like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs control the market. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, collateral or margin was not always required for contracts. Derivatives played a role in transmitting financial shocks during the 2008 crisis, with regulators now mandating margin posting for uncleared OTC derivatives. Derivative finance played a role in transmitting financial shocks during the 2008 crisis due to complexity and opacity in structured financial instruments. Mortgage loans were packaged into complex securities with derivatives, leading to uncertainty in the real value of these securities. This uncertainty affected the financial condition of banks and interbank lending, creating conditions for panic. The nature of derivatives markets created a web of risk exposures among various markets and firms, amplifying fears of insolvency in financial institutions. The 2008 financial crisis was exacerbated by the use of leverage and excessive speculation in the derivatives market, leading to catastrophic losses at systemically important firms. The interconnected nature of derivatives trading magnified losses in U.S. mortgage lending, causing widespread impacts on the global financial system. The lack of information on potential losses from unregulated OTC derivatives added to the uncertainty and risk in the banking system. The 2008 financial crisis was worsened by systemically important firms like AIG with large speculative derivatives positions, leading to their rescue by the government to prevent massive losses. Derivatives, particularly credit-default swaps, played a significant role in fueling the housing bubble and creating synthetic CDOs, amplifying the crisis. The 2008 financial crisis was exacerbated by systemically important firms like AIG with large speculative derivatives positions, leading to government intervention to prevent massive losses. Derivatives, especially credit-default swaps, fueled the housing bubble and created synthetic CDOs, amplifying the crisis. The collapse of the housing bubble allowed multiple bets on the same securities, spreading losses throughout the financial system. Concerns about cascading losses and lack of transparency in the derivatives market added to uncertainty and panic in global financial markets. The AIG case highlights the need for mandatory clearing and margin requirements in OTC markets to prevent firms from running out of money due to large derivatives positions. The 2008 financial crisis was worsened by firms like AIG with large speculative derivatives positions, leading to government intervention. Lack of transparency in the derivatives market added to uncertainty and panic. Derivatives reform proposals aimed to make the OTC market more like the exchange-traded futures market for increased transparency and reduced counterparty risk. The Dodd-Frank Act aimed to bring the swaps market under a regulatory regime similar to futures markets by adding requirements for clearing swaps through a clearinghouse. Nonfinancial commercial firms were exempted from clearing and exchange-trading requirements, but the issue of which firms should clear derivatives and post margin remains a topic of discussion in Congress. Most swaps are required to be cleared through a clearinghouse and traded on a swap execution facility for price transparency. Swaps involving nonfinancial firms are exempt from these requirements. All swaps must be reported to a swap data repository, and financial firms heavily trading swaps must register with the CFTC or SEC as swap dealers or major swap participants for regulatory oversight. The Dodd-Frank Act requires most derivatives contracts to be cleared and traded on exchanges to prevent uncollateralized exposures. Margin and capital requirements are set by regulators for uncleared swaps. Some derivatives can still be traded OTC, but regulators have broader powers to impose requirements. The CFTC and SEC are working on implementing regulations for these provisions. Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act establishes clearing and exchange-trading requirements for swaps and security-based swaps. The CFTC oversees swaps, while the SEC regulates security-based swaps. Currently, 75% of swap transactions in the US are cleared through clearinghouses. The Act prohibits parties from entering into swaps or security-based swaps subject to clearing requirements without submitting them for clearing. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates clearing and exchange-trading requirements for swaps and security-based swaps. The CFTC oversees swaps, and the SEC regulates security-based swaps. Parties must submit swaps for clearing to comply with the Act. Swaps may become subject to clearing requirements through ongoing reviews or submission to the CFTC or SEC. The agencies have 90 days to determine if swaps are subject to clearing, considering notional exposures, trading liquidity, and pricing data. The agencies must consider various factors when determining if swaps are subject to clearing requirements, including notional exposures, trading liquidity, pricing data, systemic risk mitigation, competition, and legal certainty in case of insolvency. Public input is also allowed in this process. The trading requirement mandates that swaps and security-based swaps subject to clearing must be executed on regulated exchanges or trading platforms like SEFs or SBSEFs to promote pre-trade price transparency. As of Q1 2015, 54.5% of interest-rate and credit-related swaps were traded on SEFs globally, showing an increase post Dodd-Frank. The trading requirement under Dodd-Frank aims to enhance price transparency in the swaps market by allowing customers to access price information and shop for the best rates. SEFs and SBSEFs must adhere to core principles to prevent trading abuses and provide fair access to the trading facility, with regulatory responsibilities beyond those of OTC trading desks. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates that swap contracts are not easily manipulated, trading is monitored to prevent manipulation and price distortion, position limits are set, financial resources are maintained, audit trails are kept, data on prices and trading volume is published, emergency rules for liquidation and trading halts are adopted, and a chief compliance officer submits an annual report. Before Dodd-Frank, OTC trading practices varied from individual negotiations to electronic systems accessible to multiple participants. The Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee defined a SEF as an electronic trading system with transparency. The final legislation did not include the explicit reference to \"pre-trade\" transparency due to concerns about compatibility with certain business models. Dodd-Frank provides exceptions to the exchange-trading mandate, allowing swaps to be traded OTC if not available on an exchange, SEF, or SBSEF. SEF, or SBSEF allows trading swaps OTC if they meet the end-user clearing exception. SEFs provide pre-trade price transparency for certain trades, but not for block trades or contracts not available on an SEF. Dodd-Frank Act exceptions to clearing requirements apply to non-financial entities using swaps to hedge commercial risks. The end-user exception under the Dodd-Frank Act applies to transactions involving at least one non-financial entity, allowing them to engage in swaps trading to hedge commercial risks. Financial entities, such as swap dealers or major participants, are not eligible for this exception. Eligible counterparties, including affiliates, may also utilize this exception. The Dodd-Frank Act's end-user exception allows non-financial entities to use affiliates for swaps trading to hedge commercial risks. Financial entities controlled by the end user and small financial entities with $10 billion or less in assets may also qualify for this exception. The end-user exception under the Dodd-Frank Act allows non-financial entities, financial entities controlled by the end user, and small financial entities with $10 billion or less in assets to qualify for exemption from the clearing requirement for swaps trading. To qualify, the swaps must be for hedging or mitigating commercial risk, meeting specific criteria outlined by the CFTC's final rule. The Dodd-Frank Act requires systemically important financial institutions to maintain capital cushions to mitigate risks to the financial system and economy. Margin requirements and prudential regulations apply to derivatives markets participants. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, major participants in derivatives markets are subject to prudential regulation. Two categories of regulated market participants are swap dealers and MSPs. The definition of MSP was contentious, with questions about how many firms should be included. The CFTC and SEC released a joint final rule defining swap dealer and major swap participant terms, including what constitutes a \"substantial\" position in swaps for MSP designation. The regulators proposed a two-pronged test for a substantial position in swaps for MSP designation. The first test involves current exposure exceeding $1 billion or $3 billion for certain swaps, while the second test considers future exposure exceeding $2 billion or $6 billion for specific swaps. These quantitative tests aim to establish a threshold below which a swaps trader's default could threaten the financial system. The final rule defines a swap dealer as any person who holds himself out as a dealer in swaps, makes a market in swaps, regularly enters into swaps for his own account, or engages in activity causing himself to be known as a dealer in swaps. Certain swaps used to hedge risk are excluded, as well as swaps between majority-owned affiliates. A de minimis exception is included to determine swap dealer status based on aggregate gross notional amount. The CFTC defines a swap dealer as a person whose aggregate gross notional amount of swaps exceeds $8 billion during a phase-in period. The de minimis threshold may be reduced to $3 billion after a study. The CFTC published a preliminary study on the threshold, seeking public input without making a direct recommendation. The CFTC is examining the threshold amount for swaps reporting, with Chair Massad mentioning no decision has been made yet. All swaps must be reported to registered SDRs or the CFTC, while security-based swaps must be reported to registered security-based SDRs or the SEC. Currently, all swaps transactions are reported, whether cleared or uncleared. The CFTC is working on standardizing swap reporting forms and improving data analysis. Section 727 of Dodd-Frank addresses the public availability of swap transaction data, with the CFTC required to establish rules on data availability. Real-time reporting is required for swaps subject to the clearing requirement or cleared at registered derivatives clearing organizations. This includes reporting price and volume data immediately after execution. For swaps not cleared and reported before the clearing requirement, real-time reporting must protect business transactions and market positions. Swaps subject to the clearing requirement but not cleared also require real-time public reporting. The Dodd-Frank Act requires real-time public reporting for swaps subject to the clearing requirement or cleared at registered derivatives clearing organizations. Reporting obligations are also created for uncleared swaps and security-based swaps, including those that qualify for the end-user exception. The purpose is to provide regulators with a complete view of the derivatives market. The SEC proposed rules for reporting requirements for security-based swaps in December 2010. The SEC issued a final rule on February 11, 2015, for security-based swaps reporting. Regulation SBSR requires security-based SDRs to register with the SEC as securities information processors. Data from repositories would be categorized into public and nonpublic information. Public data includes asset class, underlying security, price, notional amount, execution time, and effective/expiration dates. Nonpublic data for the SEC includes swap counterparty, broker, trading desk, up-front payments, master agreement title, valuation methods description. The SEC proposed a narrow definition of real-time reporting for security-based swaps, with a focus on disclosing information as soon as technologically practicable after execution. Concerns were raised about the burden of real-time reporting for large or illiquid trades, but the requirement is qualified in certain circumstances to protect sensitive market information. The proposal does not directly address block trades. The SEC proposed a rule for reporting block trades at a later date, following the CFTC's final rule on swap data reporting obligations for swap dealers and MSPs. The final rule requires electronic reporting of swap data at key stages of a swap's existence to create an audit trail. Swap dealers and MSPs must maintain records of all activities related to their business. The 114th Congress enacted legislative provisions that made changes to swaps regulation, with broader changes introduced in other legislation. The CFTC reauthorization bill, H.R. 2289, passed the House and was referred to the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. The Senate Committee marked up a CFTC reauthorization bill, S. 2917, which was reported to the Senate without a written report on May 10, 2016. The CFTC reauthorization bill, S. 2917, was reported to the Senate without a written report on May 10, 2016. It shares provisions with H.R. 2289 and the reauthorization process has historically been used to make changes to the Commodity Exchange Act. Authorization typically lasts five years, but has often extended beyond expiration. The previous authorization expired on September 30, 2013. The report analyzes provisions enacted in the 114th Congress and other related legislation. The FAST Act, signed into law in 2015, removed a requirement for foreign regulators to indemnify U.S.-based swap data repositories and the CFTC for expenses related to market data requests. Instead, written agreements are now required to ensure confidentiality. This provision also applies to security-based swap data repositories and the SEC's information sharing with foreign regulators. Dodd-Frank mandated reporting of all swaps to SDRs and security-based swaps to SBSDRs to increase transparency in the swaps market. The Dodd-Frank Act initially required foreign regulators to indemnify U.S.-based SDRs and SBSDRs for expenses related to swaps data requests. However, this provision created barriers to information sharing with foreign regulators. In 2015, the FAST Act removed this requirement and instead implemented written agreements to ensure confidentiality in data sharing. The indemnification provision in legislation has been noted as a barrier to information sharing with foreign regulators. The SEC officials recommend removing this provision to facilitate cross-border information sharing. H.R. 1847 and H.R. 2289 both included provisions to repeal the indemnification requirement, with H.R. 1847 passing the House in 2015. Proponents argue that indemnification is not a concept in some foreign jurisdictions, hindering information sharing agreements. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 1317, a bill allowing corporate affiliates to use an exception from derivatives regulatory requirements in the Dodd-Frank Act. This bill provides a more specific exception compared to previous bills from past Congresses. The provision in H.R. 2289 and H.R. 1847 would repeal the indemnification requirement but maintain confidentiality agreements for information sharing. The Consolidated Appropriations Act 2016 also included a similar provision, signed into law by President Obama. Dodd-Frank's Title VII required swaps to be traded on exchange-like facilities and cleared by a clearinghouse. Clearinghouses monitor trades and require margin to be posted by traders. An exception was created for nonfinancial commercial companies, known as end users, to avoid imposing the cost of posting margin on them. Examples of end users include airlines, oil companies, and agriculture companies. H.R. 1317 and Section 705 of P.L. 114-113 addressed the CFTC's treatment of end users' derivatives trading affiliates. The CFTC's treatment of end users' derivatives trading affiliates, known as centralized treasury units (CTUs), is under scrutiny. A 2013 CFTC no-action letter defined CTUs as entities performing limited financial functions for conglomerates. The 2012 final rule stated that CTUs as separate legal entities primarily engaged in financial activities would not qualify for the end-user exception. This decision raised concerns about the eligibility of CTUs structured as separate legal entities or trading swaps as principals. The CFTC's treatment of end users' derivatives trading affiliates, known as centralized treasury units (CTUs), is under scrutiny. In a 2014 \"no-action\" letter, the CFTC addressed concerns about the application of the end-user exception to treasury affiliates. The letter outlined conditions for CTUs to meet, including not being affiliated with swap dealers or major swap participants, and having a non-financial entity as the ultimate parent. Some industry participants were not satisfied with the letter, suggesting a need for statutory changes. H.R. 1317 addresses concerns about the application of the end-user exception to treasury affiliates, similar to the 2014 CFTC no-action letter. The bill excludes affiliates of end users from clearing and trading requirements, with conditions to ensure only entities like CTUs qualify for the exception. Affiliates must be wholly owned by a nonfinancial entity that qualifies for the exception and hedge swaps to qualify. H.R. 1317 allows affiliates of end users to qualify for the end-user exception under certain conditions. The affiliate must be wholly owned by a nonfinancial entity that qualifies for the exception and must hedge or mitigate commercial risk. The affiliate cannot be majority-owned by a financial entity or provide services to nonbank financial companies supervised by the Federal Reserve. The bill does not restrict the location of the affiliate. H.R. 1317 does not restrict the location of the CTU, allowing for efficient risk aggregation and a single point of contact between companies and financial counterparties. Critics have raised concerns about potential loopholes in the wording of the bill that could be exploited to circumvent clearing and trading requirements. Americans for Financial Reform did not oppose the version of H.R. 1317 that passed the House in 2015 but objected to certain aspects. The Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) requires periodic reauthorization by Congress for appropriations. Despite the expiration of the authorization in 2013, the CFTC continues to function and administer the CEA. The 114th Congress is currently considering reauthorization. The 114th Congress is considering a new CFTC reauthorization bill, which historically has been used to modify the CFTC's regulatory authority and evaluate its programs. This reauthorization process is the first since the Dodd-Frank Act brought the U.S. swaps market under regulatory oversight. Some in Congress see this as an opportunity to reexamine Dodd-Frank provisions that may impose excessive regulatory burdens, while others are concerned about any weakening of derivatives oversight introduced after the financial crisis. The 114th Congress is considering a new CFTC reauthorization bill, with some seeking changes to futures regulation. The House passed H.R. 2289, reauthorizing appropriations for the CFTC, but the Obama Administration threatened to veto it. The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry marked up a CFTC reauthorization bill, S. 2917, in response. S. 2917 was reported to the Senate without a written report and placed on the legislative calendar. H.R. 2289 and S. 2917 would extend the authorization of appropriations through 2019. H.R. 2289 includes provisions for the CFTC to consider more factors in cost-benefit analysis, including quantitative analysis. The bill reported by the Senate Agriculture Committee, S. 2917, does not include a provision for cost-benefit analysis for the CFTC. The CFTC is required to consider costs and benefits before issuing regulations, evaluating factors such as market participant protection and market efficiency. The CFTC is mandated to consider factors like market participant protection, market efficiency, competitiveness, financial integrity, price discovery, and risk management in futures markets. Section 15(a) of the CEA applies to all CFTC rules, with guidance from OIRA on costs and benefits. The CFTC, guided by OIRA, considers factors like market participant protection, efficiency, competitiveness, and financial integrity in conducting cost-benefit analyses. H.R. 2289 expands the CEA's current provisions to include 12 considerations, some similar to E.O. 12866 requirements. The CFTC, guided by OIRA, considers factors like market participant protection, efficiency, competitiveness, and financial integrity in conducting cost-benefit analyses. H.R. 2289 expands the CEA's current provisions to include 12 considerations, such as market liquidity, price discovery, risk-management practices, and regulatory costs. The CFTC, guided by OIRA, considers factors like market participant protection, efficiency, competitiveness, and financial integrity in conducting cost-benefit analyses. H.R. 2289 expands the CEA's current provisions to include 12 considerations, such as market liquidity, price discovery, risk-management practices, and regulatory costs. Regulatory approaches aim to maximize net benefits, including economic benefits, distributive impacts, and equity. Section 202 adds a requirement for quantitative cost-benefit analysis, raising questions on accurately quantifying benefits involving economic externalities like pollution. In financial regulation, quantifying externalities like risks to the financial system or pollution can be challenging due to the intangible and speculative nature of the benefits. Critics argue that the widely dispersed and sometimes speculative benefits make it difficult to reliably measure, while compliance costs are more easily quantifiable. The CFTC, with guidance from OIRA, considers various factors in cost-benefit analyses, including market participant protection, efficiency, competitiveness, and financial integrity. H.R. 2289 expands provisions to include considerations such as market liquidity, price discovery, risk-management practices, and regulatory costs. Section 202 now requires quantitative cost-benefit analysis, raising concerns about accurately measuring benefits related to economic externalities like pollution. Cost-benefit analysis in financial rulemaking can help agencies clarify benefits and weigh costs, influencing outcomes. However, some argue that it has slowed down the rulemaking process and led to agencies issuing guidance documents instead of regulations to avoid requirements. Critics point out that quantifying costs is easier than measuring widely dispersed potential benefits in financial rulemakings. Critics argue that quantifying costs in financial rulemaking is easier than measuring potential benefits, leading to an overstatement of costs. The practice of cost-benefit analysis may open agency rules to court challenges by industry groups, tying up resources and sometimes invalidating regulations. The end-user exception in Section 723 of Dodd-Frank allows non-financial entities to hedge or mitigate commercial risk with swaps. The House bill H.R. 2289 aims to expand the end-user exception for non-financial entities to hedge commercial risk with swaps. It broadens the types of activities eligible affiliates can engage in using the exception. Other similar bills like H.R. 37 and S. 876 propose a broader exemption for affiliates compared to H.R. 1317, which applies to centralized treasury units. S. 2917 does not include provisions on trading by affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act restricts affiliates like swap dealers, hedge funds, and banks with over $50 billion in assets from using exceptions for derivatives trading. Policymakers must consider the extent of exceptions for nonfinancial affiliates and potential risks to the financial system. The CFTC's 2012 final rule on the end-user exception addressed which entities should be excluded as financial entities. Treasury units within nonfinancial corporations could be eligible for the exception, while those operating as separate financial entities would be precluded. Commenters suggested the exception should be tailored to businesses involved in commodities production, refining, processing, marketing, or consumption. The CFTC's 2012 final rule on the end-user exception excluded certain financial entities. In a no-action letter from November 26, 2014, the CFTC indicated it would not enforce against eligible treasury affiliates meeting specific conditions. These conditions include not being affiliated with swap dealers or MSPs and having a non-financial entity as the ultimate parent. The CFTC's no-action letter provided relief for treasury affiliates regarding swaps clearing requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act. However, some industry participants were not fully satisfied with the letter, leading to the argument for a statutory amendment for clarity and certainty. H.R. 2289's Sections 301 and 306 aim to address these concerns but may expand the exception beyond the CFTC's no-action coverage. The CFTC's no-action letter provided relief for treasury affiliates regarding swaps clearing requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act. H.R. 2289's Sections 301 and 306 aim to address concerns about derivatives trading between affiliates within the same umbrella organization, considering risks of losses and potential loopholes in regulatory requirements. Policymakers need to consider incentives for gains at the expense of other affiliates, control measures for excessive losses, and the possibility of overseas affiliates using legislative exemptions to avoid U.S. derivatives requirements. The provision in H.R. 2289 aims to address concerns about derivatives trading between affiliates within the same umbrella organization. Proponents argue that it would prevent redundant regulation, reduce costs, simplify financial dealings, and lower counterparty credit risk. However, opponents fear that it could allow financial firms to exploit loopholes and avoid U.S. derivatives requirements. Opponents of widening the exception for affiliates from Dodd-Frank requirements argue that it could lead to massive losses for parent companies, citing examples like AIG and JPMorgan. They propose restricting expansions to 100%-owned subsidiaries with strict risk-management controls. H.R. 2289 could potentially expand hedging activities for affiliates of nonfinancial entities under the end-user exception. Section 301 of H.R. 2289 aims to expand the end-user exception for affiliates, allowing them to engage in more hedging activities to mitigate commercial risks. This includes entering into swaps with swap dealers or major swap participants, with the requirement of utilizing appropriate credit support measures. The amendment removes the necessity for affiliates to act on behalf of nonfinancial entities. The end-user exception in H.R. 2289 aims to expand hedging activities for affiliates by allowing them to act independently in mitigating commercial risks. Affiliates of end users are restricted from using the exception if they are swap dealers, MSPs, hedge funds, or large bank holding companies with over $50 billion in assets. This limitation may not apply to affiliated financial firms with less than $50 billion in assets. The end-user exception in H.R. 2289 allows affiliates of nonfinancial firms to independently hedge commercial risks. Financial firms with less than $50 billion in assets may qualify for the exception. The affiliate must enter into swaps to hedge risks of the nonfinancial firm or other affiliates. The legislation does not specify that trades must occur within an umbrella organization. This raises questions about whether a financial affiliate can engage in swaps trading with a large financial firm and still use the end-user exception. The end-user exception in H.R. 2289 allows affiliates of nonfinancial firms to independently hedge commercial risks. Financial firms with less than $50 billion in assets may qualify for the exception. However, certain affiliates like large banks or swap dealers may be prohibited from using the exception. Section 306 of H.R. 2289 would modify the definition of a financial affiliate. Section 306 of H.R. 2289 would modify the definition of a financial entity, potentially allowing nonbank financial entities to use the end-user exception even when trading on behalf of another financial entity, as long as neither entity has a prudential regulator. This change would exclude certain entities from the definition of a financial entity, enabling them to hedge commercial risks through swaps and derivatives. Section 306 of H.R. 2289 would define a commercial market participant as any producer, processor, merchant, or commercial user of an exempt or agricultural commodity. Entities not supervised by a prudential regulator and not classified as financial entities can use the end-user exception to hedge commercial risks through swaps and derivatives. H.R. 2289 would create a broader exception from Dodd-Frank clearing and exchange-trading requirements for certain nonbank financial entities that do not have banking regulators. These entities could qualify for the exception by showing they are \"commercial market participants\" or meet requirements for trading on behalf of non-prudentially supervised affiliates. The bill leaves it to the CFTC to further clarify who qualifies as a commercial market participant. S. 2917 takes a different approach to modifying the definition of a financial entity by addressing the question of what it means to be \"predominantly engaged\" in financial activities for the end-user exception to the clearing requirement in the Dodd-Frank Act. Unlike H.R. 2289, S. 2917 does not delete any prongs in the Commodity Exchange Act but adds a requirement for the CFTC to issue a new rule defining the term \"predominantly engaged in financial activities.\" S. 2917 directs the CFTC to define \"predominantly engaged in financial activities\" with a threshold of 85% revenue from such activities. It excludes revenue from hedging commercial risks. Both H.R. 2289 and S. 2917 modify the definition of bona fide hedging in the CEA. The CFTC relies on established rules and guidance to determine swaps for registration as a swap dealer or MSP, position limits, and large trader reporting. Large trader reporting monitors trading party position sizes to prevent excessive market power. The CFTC can adjust reporting levels to balance oversight and minimize burdens on participants. Position limits set maximum positions for futures, options, or swaps. The limit broadly refers to the maximum position in any one type of future, option, or swap for one commodity that may be held or controlled by one person. The definition of a bona fide hedge in the CEA specifies factors for defining a hedging transaction or position. H.R. 2289 and S. 2917 propose changes to the definition of a bona fide hedge. The proposed changes to the definition of a bona fide hedge could potentially broaden the scope to include anticipated risks and trades needed for risk management. This could allow for more types of trades to be permitted, potentially impacting registration requirements and position size restrictions. The topic of cross-border swaps raises questions about the extent of CFTC's authority to regulate swaps that extend beyond U.S. borders. The Dodd-Frank Act's Section 722(d) exempts swaps reforms from applying to activities outside the U.S. unless they have a direct connection to U.S. commerce. Former CFTC chair Gary Gensler emphasized the importance of bringing swaps market reform to transactions with overseas branches and affiliates of U.S. entities to prevent risks from impacting the U.S. economy. Overseas derivatives trading by U.S. financial conglomerates has led to significant losses for U.S.-based entities, as seen with examples like AIG's London-based Financial Products Group and J.P. Morgan's London Whale trading losses. Industry participants warn that overly burdensome CFTC rules could drive swap business away from U.S. financial institutions to jurisdictions with less stringent regulations, potentially causing a permanent loss of business for U.S. companies. The CFTC issued proposed guidance on the cross-border application of Dodd-Frank, clarifying who would count as a U.S. person for meeting requirements. A temporary exemption was issued on December 21, 2012, extending the deadline for cross-border swaps requirements. The SEC proposed a rule on cross-border security-based swaps on May 1, 2013, with a narrower approach to defining U.S. persons, restricting the reach of Dodd-Frank. The CFTC issued final guidance on the cross-border application of Dodd-Frank, defining U.S. persons and setting out requirements for swap dealers and MSPs. They also issued rules on applying derivatives requirements to cross-border trades. The need for U.S. and foreign regulators to recognize each other's derivatives clearinghouses, trading exchanges, and data repositories as \"equivalent\" for reporting trades across jurisdictions is a current challenge. H.R. 2289, similar to H.R. 1256, mandates that foreign swaps markets align with U.S. regulatory requirements within 18 months, unless the CFTC intervenes. The CFTC must consider foreign jurisdictions comparable to the US unless a rule or order states otherwise. Selecting the largest jurisdictions is complex due to EU member countries and fluctuating swap values. Determining where a swap is traded is challenging with cross-border markets. This mirrors the issue of defining a US transaction. The bill H.R. 2289 proposes that non-U.S. persons or transactions between two non-U.S. persons would be exempt from U.S. swaps requirements if they comply with regulations from one of eight permitted foreign jurisdictions. The CFTC would determine the applicability of this provision to non-U.S. persons or transactions. The bill H.R. 2289 proposes exemptions for non-U.S. persons or transactions between two non-U.S. persons from U.S. swaps requirements if they comply with regulations from permitted foreign jurisdictions. The CFTC would interpret and clarify the provision's application, with some leeway in defining a U.S. person. The provision in H.R. 2289 aims to exempt non-U.S. persons or transactions between two non-U.S. persons from U.S. swaps requirements if they comply with regulations from permitted foreign jurisdictions. This requirement has faced criticism in congressional debate and appears to challenge CFTC Advisory 13-69, which has sparked industry opposition. The advisory stated that Dodd-Frank requirements would apply to swaps involving a non-U.S. swap dealer and a non-U.S. person if personnel in the U.S. were involved in arranging, negotiating, or executing the swap. H.R. 2289 aims to overturn the CFTC's delayed implementation of regulations regarding residual interest in futures commission merchants' accounts. The bill sets a deadline for FCMs to deposit capital to cover residual interest by 6:00 p.m. on the following business day, aligning with CFTC's final rule. CFTC's Regulation 1.22 establishes the deadline for posting residual interest, impacting when customers must post collateral for insufficient margin amounts. The CFTC's final rule on March 17, 2015, amended Regulation 1.22 to prevent the FCM's deadline for posting residual interest from changing earlier than 6:00 p.m. the following day without CFTC action. The rule aimed to ensure FCMs always had enough margin without using one customer's margin for another. The rule also included a plan for the CFTC to study the current rule's effectiveness, the feasibility of changing the deadline, and the costs and benefits of any changes."
