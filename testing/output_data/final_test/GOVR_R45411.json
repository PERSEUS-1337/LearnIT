    "content": "The federal government, a major energy consumer, aims to improve energy efficiency and increase renewable energy use. However, limited capital hinders agency projects to reduce energy consumption and costs. To overcome this challenge, Congress established alternative financing methods like energy savings performance contracts (ESPCs). Two alternative financing methods for federal agencies are energy savings performance contracts (ESPCs) and utility energy service contracts (UESCs). ESPCs involve a contract with an energy service company to pay for facility improvements over a fixed period, with guaranteed energy cost savings. UESCs, on the other hand, are contracts with the serving utility for energy services. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 authorized alternative financing methods for federal energy projects, including Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs) and Utility Energy Service Contracts (UESCs). UESCs involve a contract between a federal agency and a serving utility for financing efficiency and renewable energy projects, with costs repaid over the contract's duration. ESPCs and UESCs were created to help federal facilities improve energy efficiency and meet emissions reduction goals. Energy service companies (ESCOs) finance and install conservation measures in return for a share of cost savings. The ESCO guarantees fixed energy and cost savings, bearing the risk of failure to meet projections. Conservation measures include energy-saving equipment, better insulation, and renewable energy sources. UESCs involve federal agencies contracting with utilities to finance and install energy conservation measures without requiring savings guarantees. ESPCs and UESCs offer tangible benefits for ESCOs and utilities, with ESCOs guaranteeing specified annual energy and cost savings. Utilities benefit from efficiency improvements without needing to guarantee savings. The Department of Energy's Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) oversees ESPCs and UESCs for federal facilities, providing rules, training, and assistance to achieve energy goals. Federal agencies must report progress on energy savings annually to the President and Congress. In FY2017, federal agencies used 915 trillion Btu of energy, with 62% from vehicles and equipment. Federal facilities used over 347 trillion Btu of energy. FEMP compiles data on energy efficiency investments, showing nearly $21.7 billion invested in federal facility improvements between FY2005 and FY2017. In FY2017, federal agencies invested $21.7 billion in federal facility improvements, with $14.5 billion funded directly and $5.7 billion through ESPCs. Executive orders have supported investment in ESPCs, with goals set to improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Obama Administration directed agencies to complete $2 billion in ESPCs within two years in 2011. In 2018, the Trump Administration issued E.O. 13834, directing agencies to utilize performance contracting to achieve energy, water, building modernization, and infrastructure goals. Federal buildings accounted for nearly $1.1 billion in revenue for the ESCO industry in 2014. ESCOs with over $300 million in annual revenue in 2014 made up 66% of federal market revenues. 85% of industry revenue in 2014 came from government facilities, educational facilities, and healthcare facilities. Inconsistencies in documenting contracts make it challenging to report the number of contracts accurately. The Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) has initiated nearly 2,800 projects at covered facilities for energy and water savings. They have awarded approximately 400 projects through Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) ESPCs. FEMP has also collected data on more than 2,100 UESC projects dating back to 1992 to demonstrate the value of the utility energy service contract program. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviewed federal use of ESPCs, identifying over $12 billion in awards for more than 500 projects from 1995 to 2014. A separate report focused on energy projects for the Department of Defense, showing 245 UESC contracts and 201 ESPC contracts from FY2005 to FY2016. Energy and cost savings from ESPCs and UESCs are challenging to quantify, with FEMP stating a 19-20% reduction in energy use for ESPC projects on average. On average, comprehensive ESPC projects result in a 19-20% reduction in energy use and costs over a 17-year contract period with an average investment of $15 million. FEMP data shows a 19% decline in total site-delivered energy use from FY2003 to FY2017, including renewable electricity use increases and water savings. Renewable electricity use in the federal government increased from 3% in FY2008 to nearly 11% in FY2017. Potable water use decreased by over 25% between FY2007 and FY2017, with industrial, landscaping, and agricultural water use also declining by more than 33% from FY2010 to FY2017. Approximately 25% of energy and water conservation projects have been followed up on, resulting in annual energy savings of 14 trillion Btu. The 700 projects reported annual energy savings of 14 trillion Btu, water savings of nearly 2.8 billion gallons, renewable electricity output of 150 GWh, and renewable thermal output of 106 billion Btu. The performance of ESPCs has been assessed by various entities, with ORNL evaluating energy and cost savings from the DOE IDIQ ESPC program. During the FY2016 reporting period, M&V reports showed varied cost savings results. ESCOs guaranteed 92% of estimated cost savings on average, with projects achieving 99% of estimated cost savings and 108% of guaranteed cost savings. Energy savings were also significant, with projects achieving over 95% of estimated energy savings for site energy use and 98% for source energy use. ORNL states that cost savings from energy projects can come from reductions in demand, water use, operations, management costs, and improvements in power factor. The Government Accountability Office found that some reported savings from ESPCs may be overstated, with agencies failing to achieve up to half of the reported savings. ESCOs must accurately calculate and report annual savings according to measurement and verification. ESCOs must calculate and report annual savings according to measurement and verification plans in their ESPCs. The Government Accountability Office found that some reported savings from ESPCs may be overstated due to agencies not operating or maintaining equipment as agreed. GAO recommended actions to improve oversight of ESPC projects, including clearer reporting of savings and improved training. The Secretary of Energy's Advisory Board summarized GAO's recommendations as \"improved oversight of ESPC projects through clearer reporting of savings, improved training, and systematic evaluations of portfolios.\" Projects financed through ESPCs and UESCs were included in a 2016 study by GAO on how the Department of Defense determines costs and benefits of renewable energy projects. Of the 17 projects evaluated, one used an ESPC with a power purchase agreement for solar energy, and one used a UESC. Private developers can benefit from tax incentives, such as the federal energy-efficiency commercial buildings tax deduction, to lower costs. DOD did not emphasize alternative financing mechanisms in the report. The GAO report highlighted that the Department of Defense did not prioritize the use of alternative financing mechanisms like ESPCs and UESCs for renewable projects due to limitations on federal tax benefits. Army officials mentioned that ESPCs were initially structured to allow private developers to capture incentives by owning renewable energy projects, but this changed after a 2012 Office of Management and Budget memo required government ownership to avoid full project costs at contract signing. The GAO report found that alternative financing for energy projects in the Department of Defense, such as ESPCs and UESCs, achieved expected savings, but there were variations in measurement and verification of savings across military departments. Congressional Budget Office scoring policies for ESPCs and UESCs have changed over time, with the Budget Enforcement Act imposing limits on discretionary spending and requiring offsets for increases in mandatory spending. The Congressional Budget Office changed scoring policies for ESPCs and UESCs, now estimating provisions on a net present value basis with payments covering the contract period. This aims to capture long-term budgetary savings and costs resulting from these projects. The Congressional Budget Office changed scoring policies for ESPCs and UESCs to capture long-term budgetary savings and costs. The provision in H.Con.Res. 71 prohibits savings estimated by CBO as offsets for budget enforcement in the House, not the Senate. ESPCs and UESCs are part of federal energy efficiency efforts. Congress has revised policies enabling ESPCs and UESCs for energy and water efficiency improvements at federal facilities. CBO scores ESPCs as future commitments to appropriations, with savings offsetting budget enforcement differently for the House and Senate. GAO recommends federal agencies include additional information in measurement and verification for future projects. The guidance for future projects includes providing more information in measurement and verification reports for ESPCs and UESCs to better understand performance and financing mechanisms. It is uncertain if DOE will continue to provide annual comprehensive GHG inventory data after the revocation of E.O. 13693. Congress may need to consider whether agencies should still report on GHG emissions in their annual energy reporting. One challenge facing ESPCs is a lack of uniform legal interpretations, with GAO recommending clarification on energy-related savings for scoring ESPCs. Congress may need to define this further. Congress may need to define the allowable proportion of energy and energy-related cost savings, including savings from various sources like efficiency improvements in data centers and renewable energy credits. ESCOs have used energy-efficiency tax incentives to increase investment and savings for ESPC projects. Internal Revenue Code Section 179D offers a tax deduction for energy-efficiency improvements in commercial buildings, allowing the deduction to be assigned to the designer if the property is government-owned. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended this deduction through 2017, prompting Congress to consider its renewal. Bills in the 115th Congress aim to address issues related to ESPCs and UESCs, with H.R. 723 and S. 239 seeking to facilitate the use of these partnerships through changes to NECPA. The bills in the 115th Congress aim to require energy managers to bundle cost-effective energy- or water-saving measures into combined projects within two years of evaluation, replacing \"may\" with \"shall.\" Additionally, the bills expand reporting requirements on ESPCs and UESCs to include investment value and guaranteed energy savings compared to actual savings. The bills in the 115th Congress aim to require energy managers to bundle cost-effective energy- or water-saving measures into combined projects within two years of evaluation, replacing \"may\" with \"shall.\" The bills also expand reporting requirements on ESPCs and UESCs to include investment value, guaranteed energy savings, and definitional changes. The budgetary effects of H.R. 723 and S. 239 are the same according to CBO. However, H.Con.Res. 71 prohibits applying savings as an offset only in the House, affecting budget enforcement differently in the House and Senate. Similar bills have been introduced in previous Congresses, with provisions identical to S. 2012. In the 115th Congress, S. 1460 also aims to amend NECPA for the use of ESPCs and UESCs. S. 1460, introduced in the 115th Congress, aims to amend NECPA to facilitate the use of ESPCs and UESCs, requiring energy managers to implement cost-effective energy- or water-saving measures. It also modifies reporting requirements for federal agencies and authorizes a Federal Smart Building Program. Similar language is found in other bills related to energy efficiency and technology. S. 1460, introduced in the 115th Congress, aims to amend NECPA to facilitate the use of ESPCs and UESCs for energy and water-saving measures. It also authorizes a Federal Smart Building Program and a science laboratories infrastructure program utilizing existing financing mechanisms."
