These PHS agencies provide and support essential public health services with varying missions, such as research and regulatory responsibilities. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has designated eight of its 11 operating divisions as components of the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS), including agencies like CDC, FDA, and NIH. These PHS agencies provide and support essential public health services with varying missions, such as research and regulatory responsibilities. AHRQ, IHS, HRSA, and SAMHSA are among the agencies that support medical research and health care services for underserved populations. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) is part of the CDC and focuses on identifying health effects from hazardous substances. The FDA regulates food, drugs, and tobacco products to ensure safety. Five PHS agencies operate under the Public Health Service Act. The FDA's regulatory activities are authorized under the PHSA, but derive most authority from the FFDCA. HRSA's maternal and child health programs are authorized by the SSA, and IHS programs by the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. ATSDR was created by CERCLA. PHS agencies are funded through annual appropriations, with AHRQ, CDC, HRSA, NIH, and SAMHSA funded through Labor-HHS-ED appropriations act, and ATSDR and IHS funded through Interior/Environment appropriations. The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) provided $15.1 billion in supplemental FY2009 discretionary appropriations to five PHS agencies. These funds were designated as two-year funds, available until the end of FY2010. The HHS Secretary has limited authority to transfer funds within the department, with restrictions on the amount that can be transferred between accounts. The HHS Secretary has limited authority to transfer funds within the department, with restrictions on the amount that can be transferred between accounts. Recipient accounts may not be increased by more than 3%, and Congressional appropriators must be notified in advance of any transfer. In FY2013 and FY2014, NIH was the primary source of transfers to CMS for ACA implementation, offsetting funding losses for CDC and SAMHSA from the ACA's Prevention and Public Health Fund. Section 241 of the PHSA also authorizes transfer authority. The annual Labor-HHS-ED appropriations act authorizes the HHS Secretary to use a portion of funds for program evaluation under the PHS Program Evaluation Set-Aside. The set-aside is capped at 2.5% in recent years, and funds are transferred to recipient agencies after assessment. The HHS Secretary uses funds from the annual Labor-HHS-ED appropriations act for program evaluation through the PHS Program Evaluation Set-Aside. In FY2013, NIH was a significant net donor of set-aside funds, contributing $710 million out of $1.026 billion. Other agencies like HRSA also contributed more than they received, while AHRQ, CDC, and SAMHSA were net recipients of set-aside funding. In FY2013, NIH was a major contributor of set-aside funds, with other agencies like HRSA also contributing more than they received. In FY2014, CMS became a recipient of set-aside funds for the first time. In FY2015, congressional appropriators transferred most set-aside funding to NIH, resulting in AHRQ and CDC experiencing significant net losses. In FY2015, AHRQ experienced a significant net loss of set-aside funding and received a discretionary appropriation for the first time in over a decade. PHS agencies also receive funding from mandatory sources, user fees, and third-party collections, with the ACA providing billions in mandatory spending for grant programs and activities. The ACA provided billions in mandatory spending for grant programs and activities within PHS agencies. It established three multibillion dollar trust funds, including the Community Health Center Fund and the Prevention and Public Health Fund, to support federal health centers and public health programs. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) has allocated funds to CDC, AHRQ, HRSA, and SAMHSA, with a significant portion transferred to CMS for ACA implementation. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) supports comparative effectiveness research through a mix of appropriations and transfers from Medicare trust funds. Additionally, HRSA, CDC, and IHS receive mandatory funds from other sources. HRSA, CDC, and IHS receive mandatory funds from other sources, including Medicaid funding for CDC's Vaccines for Children program and funds for diabetes programs. PHS agencies also collect user fees to support their programs, with FDA's industry user fees playing a significant role in financing regulatory activities. FDA's Prescription Drug User Fee Act established the first user fee program almost 25 years ago. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) established the first user fee program at FDA, which has since been followed by several other user fee programs. These programs provide additional resources to FDA for hiring personnel and expediting the review process for new product applications. User fees also support information technology infrastructure and post-approval regulation. FDA's user fee programs cover regulation of prescription drugs, animal drugs, medical devices, tobacco products, and foods. The amount of user fees collected by FDA has steadily increased since PDUFA's enactment, accounting for 42% of the agency's budget in FY2015. More details on user fees can be found in the FDA section of this report and in Appendix E. IHS supplements its annual discretionary appropriation with third-party collections from public and private payers, mainly from Medicare, Medicaid, and private health insurers. Congress has taken steps to reduce federal spending, impacting funding for PHS agencies. SAMHSA was the only PHS agency funded in FY2015. In FY2015, SAMHSA received level funding compared to FY2010, while CDC, HRSA, and NIH received less discretionary funding. AHRQ's discretionary funding in FY2015 was lower than in FY2010, offset by mandatory ACA funds. FDA and IHS saw increased appropriations from other sources like user fees and third-party collections. In April 2011, lawmakers agreed to cuts in discretionary spending for various agencies and programs as part of negotiations to complete the FY2011 appropriations process. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established enforceable spending limits for defense and nondefense categories from FY2012 through FY2021, triggering annual spending reductions. All spending in this report falls within the nondefense category. The spending reductions are achieved through a combination of discretionary and nonexempt mandatory spending cuts. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established spending limits for defense and nondefense categories, leading to annual spending reductions through sequestration and lowered discretionary spending caps. The Office of Management and Budget calculates the required reductions each year, with exceptions for certain mandatory funding like the CDC-administered Vaccines for Children program funded through Medicaid. Children program funded through Medicaid and the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act are exempt from sequestration. Cuts in CHCF funding for community health centers and migrant health centers, as well as mandatory diabetes funding for IHS, are capped at 2%. Some nonexempt PHS programs avoided sequestration in FY2015 and/or FY2016 due to budgetary constraints. The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting program, funded through the ACA, also avoided sequestration in FY2015. Under the Budget Control Act (BCA), FY2013 discretionary spending was subject to sequestration, resulting in a dip in funding for PHS agencies. FDA user fees for FY2013 were also sequestrable, but IHS's third-party collections were exempt. Annual reductions in discretionary spending from FY2014 to FY2021 are achieved through BCA-mandated cuts. The Budget Control Act (BCA) mandated cuts in discretionary spending, with congressional appropriators deciding how to allocate the reductions within lowered spending caps. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (BBA) amended the BCA, setting new spending caps for FY2014 and FY2015, giving appropriators more funding for those years. The FY2014 NDD spending cap was set at $491.773 billion under the BBA, higher than the BCA-lowered cap and FY2013 post-sequestration funding level. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (BBA) set new spending caps for FY2014 and FY2015, providing more funding for those years. The FY2015 NDD spending cap is $492.356 billion, $9 billion higher than the BCA-lowered cap. In FY2016, discretionary spending levels revert to the original BCA requirements, with a cap of $493.491 billion for NDD spending. The report includes sections for each PHS agency, detailing statutory authority, activities, and funding levels from FY2010-FY2015. The funding tables in this report are based on departmental and agency budget documents submitted to appropriations committees. The tables show funding for agency budget accounts, programs, and activities, with total funding calculated. User fees and other non-discretionary amounts are subtracted to determine discretionary budget authority. Some tables include non-add entries. The tables for AHRQ, CDC, HRSA, and SAMHSA show funding from various sources, with italicized entries indicating non-agency funding. CDC accounts are funded by discretionary appropriations and other sources. A dash in the tables means \"not applicable,\" while a zero indicates no discretionary funds were appropriated or requested. Funding tables only show evaluation amounts. The funding tables in the report only display the amount of evaluation set-aside funds received, not the total funding assessed on agency accounts. This results in a distorted view of available budgetary resources for PHS agencies like CDC, HRSA, NIH, and SAMHSA. For example, NIH appears to have $700 million more than it actually does due to the assessment not being reflected in the funding tables. AHRQ's funding tables show post-sequestration amounts for FY2013-FY2015, with FY2016 request not reflecting sequestration. The agency supports research to improve healthcare quality, efficiency, and access. Research efforts focus on reducing care costs, promoting patient safety, measuring healthcare quality, and improving services, organization, and financing. AHRQ disseminates research findings and collects data on healthcare expenditures and utilization through MEPS and HCUP. The agency has evolved from agencies focused on health services research and healthcare technology assessment. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 established the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR), later renamed as the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Despite expired authorization of appropriations, AHRQ continues to receive annual funding and is organized into three program areas. AHRQ's funding sources have evolved over the years, with a shift towards receiving its own discretionary appropriation in FY2015 after relying on PHS evaluation set-aside and mandatory funds from PPHF and PCORTF. The agency's budget has increased steadily since FY2010, with transfers from PCORTF offsetting decreases in discretionary funding. CDC's funding has seen growth from PCORTF, reaching $101 million in FY2015. The agency's mission is to protect America from health threats. CDC is organized into various centers and institutes, with activities based on broad authorities in the PHSA. The CDC operates under broad, permanent authorities in the PHSA. Four CDC divisions are explicitly authorized, including NIOSH, NCBDDD, NCHS, and ATSDR. While authorizations for NCBDDD, NCHS, and ATSDR have expired, they still receive annual appropriations. CDC provides approximately $5 billion per year in grants to various government entities. The CDC provides about $5 billion annually in grants to government entities, academic, and non-profit organizations. Funding levels for CDC programs from FY2010 to FY2016 include discretionary appropriations and mandatory appropriations for programs like the Vaccines for Children program and the World Trade Center Health Program. CDC's budget authority for FY2015 is lower compared to FY2010, but its program level is higher. CDC's budget authority for FY2015 is lower, with higher program levels. ACA funding and the WTC Health Program have replaced discretionary funding for some activities. Sequestration affected funding levels in FY2013, with PPHF and WTC Health Program funds being sequestered annually since then. In 2014, CDC implemented the \"Working Capital Fund\" for agency-wide business services. CDC has adjusted its accounting to make budget lines comparable from FY2012 forward. In December 2014, Congress provided $1.771 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations to CDC for the Ebola outbreak, available through FY2019 for domestic and international activities. These funds are not included in CDC's general budget. The FDA regulates the safety of human foods, dietary supplements, cosmetics, and drugs. Congress granted FDA authority to oversee tobacco products in 2009. FDA has seven centers responsible for various program areas. The FDA, including the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) and the Center for Tobacco Products (CTP), operates under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) and other laws. Its budget is overseen by the Senate and House appropriations subcommittees on Agriculture, Rural Development, FDA, and Related Agencies. The FDA's budget has two funding streams: annual appropriations and industry user fees. Congress sets the total amount of appropriated funds and user fees for each fiscal year. User fees contribute to the Salaries and Expenses account, with the largest and oldest user fee linked to the Prescription Drug User Fee Act in 1992. User fees account for 42% of FDA's total FY2015 program level. In FY2015, user fees contributed significantly to the FDA's budget, accounting for 42% of the total program level. Congress added user fee authorities for various medical products, with each authority requiring reauthorization every five years. FDA's funding increased from $3.1 billion to $4.5 billion between FY2010 and FY2015, with user fee revenue more than doubling. In FY2015, user fees contributed significantly to FDA's budget, accounting for 42% of total funding. HRSA awards funding to over 3,000 grantees for health services projects. HRSA administers the health centers program, providing grants to non-profit entities for primary care services to those facing barriers to healthcare. It is organized into five bureaus and ten offices, focusing on specific populations or health issues. Majority of HRSA's programs are authorized by the PHSA or SSA, with additional funding from the Black Lung Program for retired coal miners. HRSA funding increased from $8.1 billion in FY2010 to $10.3 billion in FY2015 despite a reduction in discretionary appropriations. Discretionary appropriations declined by about 18%, primarily due to the loss of funding for the National Health Service Corps and the elimination of the congressional earmark program. The growth in funding was driven by increasing amounts from the CHCF, which offset the decline in discretionary funding. The CHCF funding has become the main source of funding for the NHSC program, with additional funding provided in the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015. The IHS provides healthcare for eligible American Indians/Alaska Natives. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides healthcare services to members of 566 federally recognized tribes, either directly or through facilities operated by Indian Tribes or Tribal Organizations. The IHS is authorized by the Snyder Act of 1921, the Indian Sanitation Facilities Act of 1959, and the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) to provide programs such as urban health, health professions recruitment, and substance abuse and mental health treatment. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides healthcare services to federally recognized tribes, funded through appropriations and reimbursements from various sources. Funding increased from $5.1 billion to $5.9 billion between FY2010 and FY2015, supporting clinical services and purchased/referred care. The Indian Health Service (IHS) funding has increased to support clinical services and purchased/referred care. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) conducts biomedical and behavioral research, with 27 research institutes and centers overseen by the NIH Director. The Office of the Director (OD) sets overall policy and coordinates programs across NIH components. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) consists of multiple institutes and centers (ICs) focusing on specific diseases and research areas. NIH allocates 83% of its budget to external research through grants and contracts, supporting over 300,000 non-federal scientists at various institutions. About 11% of the budget funds internal research programs, while the remaining 6% supports research management and facilities. NIH derives its authority from the PHSA, granting broad permanent authority for research. The FY2012 Consolidated Appropriations Act reorganized IC responsibilities, creating NCATS and eliminating NCRR. NIH's funding comes mostly from annual discretionary appropriations, with separate appropriations provided to 24 ICs, the OD, and Buildings and Facilities. Funding for NIH in FY2015 is 5% below the FY2010 level, part of a trend since FY2003 when Congress completed a five-year doubling of NIH's budget. The NIH's budget doubled from $13.6 billion in FY1998 to $27.2 billion in FY2003, with funding peaking at $31.2 billion in FY2010 before decreasing. Despite modest increases, NIH's budget has not kept up with the rising cost of biomedical research since then. In constant 2012 dollars, NIH funding in FY2015 is 22% lower than in FY2003. SAMHSA leads in increasing access to behavioral health services through grants to states, territories, and competitive programs. SAMHSA funds grant programs for states, territories, tribal organizations, and local communities. It operates under Title V of the PHSA, with three centers focusing on substance abuse treatment, prevention, and mental health services. These centers offer grant programs to address substance abuse and mental health needs at regional and national levels. The Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment block grant falls within CSAT, with a requirement that at least 20% of each state's grant must be used for prevention efforts. SAMHSA's budget includes a category for \"health surveillance and program support\" for various activities such as data collection, statistical support, public awareness, workforce development, and maintaining the National Registry of Evidence-based Programs and Practices. The last major reauthorization of SAMHSA occurred in 2000 under the Children's Health Act, which also introduced provisions allowing religious organizations to receive funding for substance abuse services without compromising their religious identity. Since 2000, Congress has expanded some of SAMHSA's programs and activities without comprehensive reauthorization. Authorizations for most grant programs expired in FY2003, but many programs still receive annual appropriations. SAMHSA's funding has been around $3.6 billion from FY2010 to FY2015, dropping to $3.4 billion in FY2013 due to sequestration and rebounding to $3.6 billion in FY2014. The current distribution of funding across CMHS, CSAT, CSAP, and Health Surveillance and Program Support overstates substance abuse treatment and understates prevention funding. The FY2016 request for the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment block grant would increase program-level funding by 1% while decreasing discretionary budget authority by 2%. This would be compensated by increased funding from the set-aside and PPHF transfers. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) provided $22.4 billion in supplemental FY2009 discretionary appropriations for health and human services programs, with $15.1 billion allocated for PHS agencies. The Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) was established to provide supplemental funding for health centers and the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) with $11 billion allocated over five years. Funds are awarded to various health centers including those serving the homeless and public housing residents. The CHCF funding for community health centers and migrant health centers is capped at 2%, while funding for health centers for the homeless and public housing residents, as well as the NHSC, is fully sequestrable. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 provided additional funding for the CHCF for FY2016 and FY2017. This mandatory funding has partially supplanted discretionary funding for health centers and entirely replaced discretionary funding for the NHSC. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) was established under ACA Section 4002 with a permanent annual appropriation. The PPHF's annual appropriation was initially set to increase from $500 million in FY2010 to $2 billion in FY2015 and beyond. However, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 reduced the PPHF appropriation to $1 billion through FY2017, with incremental increases to $2 billion starting in FY2022. The HHS Secretary is authorized to transfer funds from the PPHF to agencies for prevention, wellness, and public health activities. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) was established under ACA Section 4002 with a permanent annual appropriation. The Secretary determines the distribution of PPHF funds for each fiscal year. Congress directed the distribution of funds for FY2014 and FY2015, prohibiting further transfers. Sequestration is applied to the entire appropriation before funds are transferred to agencies. Distribution of PPHF funds to HHS agencies is detailed in the President's budget proposal. The Secretary distributed PPHF funds to various agencies for FY2013, with a significant portion going to CMS for ACA implementation. This transfer, along with sequestration, impacted CDC's budget that year. Congress allocated PPHF funds for FY2014 and FY2015 to existing programs. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) was established by the ACA to support comparative clinical effectiveness research. It received annual funding from various sources from FY2010 to FY2019, including appropriations, fees on health insurance plans, and transfers from Medicare Trust Funds. The ACA allocated specific amounts to the PCORTF for each fiscal year, with additional funding from new fees on health insurance policies and self-insured plans from FY2013 to FY2019. The ACA established the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) to support clinical effectiveness research. Funding sources included appropriations, health insurance plan fees, and transfers from Medicare Trust Funds. Fees on health insurance plans increased from $1 to $2 per covered life from FY2013 to FY2019. PCORTF funds are allocated to PCORI and HHS Secretary for PHSA Section 937. A portion of funds transferred to HHS is distributed to AHRQ."
