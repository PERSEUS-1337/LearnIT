    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Professional Sports Franchise Relocation Act of 1996\". The Congress recognizes the importance of professional sports teams in fostering local identity, providing employment opportunities, and promoting stability among member teams. It is in the public interest to support policies that encourage equitable resolution of disputes related to team relocations. Professional sports teams travel interstate to compete, use materials shipped interstate, and have games broadcast nationally. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"antitrust laws\" refer to laws in the Clayton Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act. \"Home territory\" is the area where a team operates and plays home games. An \"interested party\" includes local governments providing financial assistance to team facilities. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of terms related to professional sports teams, including member teams, local governments, and persons. It clarifies that member teams are part of major league football, basketball, or hockey, and are organized under a professional sports league. The term \"person\" encompasses individuals, partnerships, corporations, or unincorporated associations. The terms \"professional sports league\" and \"league\" refer to an association composed of 2 or more member teams that regulate contests and exhibitions, engaged in competition for more than 7 years. The terms \"stadium\" and \"arena\" denote the main facility where a member team plays most of its home games. SEC. 4. The antitrust laws do not apply to a professional sports league's decision on relocating a team. SEC. 5. Procedural requirements must be followed. Any person seeking to change the home territory of a member team must provide notice at least 210 days before the season starts. The notice must be in writing, delivered in person or by certified mail, made available to the news media, published in newspapers, and include the proposed new location and reasons for the change. Prior to approving or disapproving a team's relocation, a professional sports league must establish rules and procedures, including criteria like fan loyalty and support. The notice for changing a team's home territory must be provided at least 210 days before the season starts, including the proposed new location and reasons for the change. The criteria for evaluating a team's relocation include: \n- Demonstrated commitment to the community \n- Engagement in good faith negotiations \n- Contribution to circumstances necessitating relocation \n- Receipt of public financial support. The criteria for evaluating a team's relocation include the adequacy of the stadium, financial losses, location of other teams, and potential relocation to a new community. The professional sports league evaluates a team's relocation based on stadium adequacy, financial losses, location of other teams, potential relocation to a new community, and other appropriate criteria. Hearings are conducted where interested parties can submit written testimony and exhibits. SEC. 6. JUDICIAL REVIEW. Judicial review of professional sports league decisions on team relocations can be pursued in court within 14 days of the league's vote. The action must be filed in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, unless the team's territory is within 50 miles of the Southern District of New York. Judicial review of a professional sports league's decision on team relocation can be expedited and is limited to ensuring procedural compliance and evaluating if the decision was arbitrary or capricious. If the court finds non-compliance or an arbitrary decision, the matter is remanded for further league consideration, with the court only able to enjoin or approve enforcement of the decision. SEC. 7. MISCELLANEOUS. (a) Payment of Debts.-- Any team relocating to a new territory from a publicly owned facility with remaining debt must pay its share of the debt service based on facility usage. This does not affect the rights of the stadium authority or the club. Any community affected by a professional sports league franchise relocation must be given 180 days' notice and the opportunity to compete for an expansion franchise under fair conditions. SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE: This Act applies to league actions regarding team relocation after June 1, 1995, and lawsuits filed after that date."
