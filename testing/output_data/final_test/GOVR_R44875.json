    "content": "NAFTA aimed to eliminate trade barriers and facilitate cross-border movement of goods and services among member countries. It consisted of three separate agreements: CUSTA between Canada and the US, and agreements between Mexico and the US, and Canada and Mexico. The agreements, effective from 1989 and 1994, eliminated tariffs and addressed non-tariff barriers in agriculture. NAFTA provisions eliminated restrictions on bilateral agricultural trade over different phase-out periods, with sensitive products like sugar given the longest period. Tariff elimination for agricultural products under CUSTA was completed on January 1, 1998, but quotas for certain products in U.S.-Canada trade remained unchanged in NAFTA. Import quotas were converted to tariff-rate quotas in the WTO Uruguay Round, with within-quota trade at duty-free rates agreed in CUSTA, and over-quota trade at non-liberalized WTO bound tariff equivalents. Under CUSTA and NAFTA, Canada excluded dairy, poultry, and eggs from tariff elimination, allowing them to maintain a supply management system. Tariff elimination for agricultural products under NAFTA was completed on January 1, 2008, with most non-tariff trade barriers in U.S.-Mexico agricultural trade converted to tariffs or TRQs. Mexico's trade-weighted tariff on U.S. products averaged about 11%, with higher tariffs for certain agricultural products like fruits and vegetables averaging about 20%. Before NAFTA, Mexican tariffs for fruits and vegetables averaged about 20%. Certain agricultural products were subject to Mexican import licensing requirements, affecting 25% of U.S. agricultural exports. The U.S. had import quality requirements for Mexican products like tomatoes, onions, and avocados. Under NAFTA, reduced TRQs applied to U.S. agricultural imports such as sugar, beef, dairy products, and cotton. Additionally, NAFTA addressed SPS measures. NAFTA addressed SPS measures, which are laws and regulations aimed at protecting human, animal, and plant health in agricultural trade. These measures must be scientifically based, nondiscriminatory, and transparent to minimize trade disruptions. SPS regulations are a significant challenge for agricultural exporters, leading to increased costs and product loss. Technical barriers to trade (TBT) also impact both food and non-food products in agriculture. NAFTA addressed SPS measures in agricultural trade, including SPS provisions similar to the WTO's SPS Agreement. These measures aim to prevent disguised trade restrictions, be scientifically based, and align with international standards. NAFTA established a Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures to facilitate technical cooperation in the development, application, and enforcement involving SPS measures. The committee meets periodically to review and resolve SPS issues and hosts technical working groups to enhance regulatory cooperation and facilitate trade between NAFTA countries. Working groups address national regulatory and scientific review capacity, as well as coordination and harmonization of pesticide standards among the NAFTA partner countries. The most recent National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers (NTE) highlights ongoing trade concerns, including SPS issues and trade disputes with NAFTA partners. NAFTA has formal mechanisms to resolve disputes related to investment, services, antidumping, countervailing duties, and general agreement interpretation. These rules-based systems aim to strengthen trade relations among partner countries. The rules-based systems for resolving disputes under NAFTA aim to strengthen trade relations by providing a legal framework to protect the interests of partner countries. Examples of dispute resolution include AD and CVD actions, arbitration panels, negotiations, and technical assistance. Chapter 19 allows for agricultural AD and CVD investigations and duty assessments to address trade disputes. It provides exporters and domestic producers with a way to appeal trade-remedy investigations before an independent binational panel, offering an alternative to judicial review. Under NAFTA, countries can impose CVD duties on imports sold below fair value to offset subsidies and must pass an injury test. Each country can apply its own AD and CVD laws but must notify others. The NAFTA secretariat administers dispute settlement under Chapters 19 and 20, covering various products like sugar, lumber, wheat, and meat. Disputes involving U.S. agricultural markets with Canada or Mexico have included issues with milk products. Since NAFTA implementation, trade concerns in agricultural markets with Canada and Mexico have involved milk products, COOL for meat, and potatoes. These disputes have been addressed within the WTO framework. Canada and Mexico are significant U.S. agricultural trading partners, with a substantial share of U.S. agricultural exports and imports. Agricultural products covered include raw commodities, nursery products, wine, and cotton fiber products. Excluded are fish, distilled spirits, and tobacco products. Since NAFTA implementation, U.S. agricultural trade with Canada and Mexico has significantly increased over the past 25 years. Exports grew from $8.7 billion in 1992 to $38.1 billion in 2016, while imports rose from $6.5 billion to $44.5 billion during the same period. Despite a trade surplus in previous years, there was a $6.4 billion trade deficit for agricultural products in 2016. Trade balances fluctuate yearly due to various factors like market conditions, commodity prices, and consumer demand. Adjusted for inflation, U.S. agricultural exports and imports with NAFTA partners have tripled, growing at an average rate of 5-6% annually. Canada and Mexico are key trading partners, accounting for 28% of U.S. agricultural exports and 39% of imports in 2016. Leading traded products include meat, dairy, grains, fruits, vegetables, oilseeds, and sugar. USDA reports show that U.S. agricultural exports to NAFTA partners have increased significantly over the years, comprising 20% of total exports in 1991-1993 and rising to 28% in 2010-2012. Exports to China and Hong Kong also saw a sharp increase, from 3% to 18%. On the other hand, exports to other U.S. FTA partners only rose slightly, while exports to the rest of the world decreased. Additionally, Canada and Mexico accounted for 27% of U.S. agricultural imports in 1991-1993. In 2016, U.S. agricultural exports to Canada were valued at $20.2 billion, with leading exports being grains, animal products, fruits, and vegetables. U.S. agricultural imports from Canada in the same year were valued at $21.6 billion, including fish and seafood imports totaling $3.2 billion. Since NAFTA was implemented, the balance of agricultural trade between the United States and Canada has alternated between a trade surplus and a trade deficit. Over the past five years, the U.S. trade deficit with Canada has averaged about $0.7 billion per year. In 2016, U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico were valued at $17.8 billion, with leading exports being animal products, grains, and feed. In 2016, U.S. agricultural imports from Mexico were valued at $23.0 billion, including oilseeds, sugar, fruits, vegetables, and other products. The U.S. agricultural trade deficit with Mexico has averaged $1.1 billion per year over the past five years. Leading imports from Mexico were fruits, vegetables, beverages, animal products, and grains. In recent years, U.S. agricultural imports from Mexico have increased while exports to Mexico have decreased, leading to a trade deficit. California, Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, Minnesota, Texas, Indiana, Kansas, North Dakota, and Washington are the top agricultural exporting states. State-level data on agricultural exports to Mexico are limited, with California being one of the few states that compile and report such data. California's agricultural exports have grown significantly, reaching over $20.7 billion in 2015. NAFTA countries were the largest market for California's farm exports, with Canada and Mexico being key destinations for products like wine, lettuce, strawberries, almonds, and dairy products. Agricultural exports from California to Canada and Mexico include flowers, walnuts, pistachios, strawberries, rice, cotton, raisins, plums, oranges, lettuce, and kiwi fruit. These exports make up roughly 10% of total U.S. agricultural exports to NAFTA partners. Other states also have significant trade with Mexico and Canada, with Iowa exporting pork products and Northern Plains states exporting grain. However, state-level data on the economic impact of NAFTA on agriculture is limited and outdated. It is challenging to isolate the effects of NAFTA on U.S. agricultural trade from other influencing factors. Before NAFTA was implemented, U.S. tariffs and trade protections for food and agricultural products were already minimal. Trade liberalization and expansion had begun, along with increased foreign direct investment in the food and agricultural sectors. However, available data is often incomplete and may not accurately reflect the total economic effects of trade agreements. Benefits from trade agreements include greater market access and reduced barriers to economic activities. NAFTA has benefitted U.S. agriculture by lowering trade barriers, increasing consumer prices, and expanding product variety. It has led to higher product sales through exports, contributing to economic growth. Regional trade agreements have also provided market integration and economic linkages. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce credits NAFTA for a 350% increase in U.S. agricultural exports to Canada and Mexico. Since NAFTA's implementation, trilateral agricultural trade among member countries has increased sharply, with trade with Canada and Mexico making up a larger share of U.S. agricultural markets. Many U.S. food and agricultural industry groups believe NAFTA has positively impacted their markets, leading to lower consumer prices, improved variety, and increased market demand for some food products as Mexico's consumer incomes improve. Exporters could benefit from increased market demand for some food products under NAFTA. The agreement has resulted in both benefits and losses, with positive and negative impacts being overstated or mixed. Economic impacts depend on what is produced and where, affecting employment and wages. Some industries faced disruptions from increased competition, while others gained new market opportunities. NAFTA has also led to consolidation in North America's agriculture, resulting in fewer small farms, especially in Mexico. The extent to which NAFTA has benefitted the U.S. economy is not clear cut, as gains could be partly due to Mexico's unilateral liberalization or gains from the agreement. Other factors influencing regional agricultural trade post-NAFTA include changes in Mexico's agricultural policies, advances in technology, disruptions from economic downturns, and competition from countries outside of NAFTA. Market developments like alternative product uses, changes in crop mix, mechanization, and global economic integration have also impacted North American trade. The USDA's 20-year analysis of NAFTA's impact on U.S. agriculture found profound effects on North American agriculture, leading to increased market integration, cross-border investment, and changes in consumption and production. NAFTA significantly influenced the integration of North America's agricultural markets, visible in increased cross-border flows of goods, services, capital, and labor. Trade in goods expanded to include not only final consumer products but also intermediate inputs and raw materials as firms reorganized around regional markets. The USDA's analysis of NAFTA's impact on North American agriculture shows increased market integration, spurred by greater FDI. Most agricultural sectors within NAFTA exhibit high market integration, while some show medium integration, and others, like U.S. and Canadian dairy sectors, have low integration due to exemptions from NAFTA. Market integration has advanced in North America regional agriculture. NAFTA has advanced North America regional agriculture through increased market integration and foreign investment in processed food sectors. However, prices are still not fully integrated. Regionalization of SPS standards has facilitated trade in meat and produce markets. Mexico and Canada have clearly benefited from NAFTA, with only a small positive net effect on U.S. agricultural employment. According to USDA, Mexico is the third-largest host country for U.S. direct investment in the global food and beverage industries and has also attracted FDI in production agriculture\u2014much of it since NAFTA was implemented. Some claim that Mexican restrictions on corporate farming, acreage limits, and land investment restrictions have been a constraint to U.S. investment in some sectors. U.S. direct investment in Mexico on a historical-cost basis was about $3.6 billion. Since NAFTA, U.S. direct investment in Mexico's food and beverage industries has significantly increased, reaching about $8.7 billion in 2007 before declining to $7.5 billion in 2010. Most of the investment has been in the beverage industry. Canada has also received substantial U.S. direct investment, with $5.9 billion in the food industry and $7.8 billion in the beverage industry in 2010. NAFTA has led to significant foreign investment in processed food sectors, according to a retrospective analysis by USDA. Researchers at UC debunk common myths about competitive farm conditions between the US and Mexico in the fruit and vegetable production sector. Mexico's advantage lies in seasonal factors, not cost advantages, as capital, technology, and management play crucial roles. Mexican farm labor is less trained and efficient, offsetting wage rate advantages, with some areas experiencing labor shortages. Mexico's agricultural sector faces challenges such as labor shortages and higher production costs due to providing social services for workers. Mexican producers for export markets must meet quality standards and face disadvantages in marketing, perception, R&D, and infrastructure compared to the US. In contrast, the US benefits from federal R&D, public sector investments in infrastructure, and private sector research, giving them a competitive advantage in agricultural production. The agricultural sector in Mexico faces challenges such as labor shortages and higher production costs. Some believe that NAFTA has led to increased worker displacement in Mexico's agricultural sector, causing transitory poverty and social exclusion. Despite a rise in farm exports, rural poverty levels in Mexico have not improved, and wage and income convergence with the US has not occurred. Calls for NAFTA reform to address these concerns have been made. Calls for reform of NAFTA in Mexico's farming community have been made due to concerns about the impact on the agricultural sector. Stakeholders in the US agricultural industry oppose the Trump Administration's decisions regarding trade agreements, citing benefits and potential disruptions. Some in Congress and US agriculture cautiously support efforts to renegotiate NAFTA provisions related to agriculture. President Trump considered withdrawing from NAFTA but ultimately decided against it, causing uncertainty in the US agricultural community. Many in Congress and US agriculture oppose withdrawal and support efforts to renegotiate NAFTA provisions related to agriculture. Some recommend using TPP provisions as a model for renegotiation. Opposition to withdrawal is strong in Congress, with concerns raised about the Administration's trade policy intentions. Reactions from U.S. agricultural leaders to the nomination of Robert Lighthizer for USTR and concerns about NAFTA withdrawal were dire. The National Pork Producers Council warned of \"cataclysmic\" consequences for pork producers, while the National Corn Growers Association stated that withdrawal would be disastrous for American agriculture. The American Soybean Association and U.S. Grains Council also expressed concerns about the impact on trade with top partners like Mexico. The National Association of Wheat Growers emphasized Mexico's importance as the largest U.S. wheat buyer. Following concerns about NAFTA withdrawal, U.S. agricultural trade associations, including the National Association of Wheat Growers, emphasized Mexico's significance as the largest U.S. wheat buyer. Various industries, such as corn, soybean, dairy, pork, beef, and rice, sent representatives to Mexico to reassure buyers and maintain stable trade relations. Reports suggest Mexico is exploring alternative suppliers for products like rice, corn, soybeans, and dairy. On May 23, 2017, USTR formally notified Congress of the Administration's intent to renegotiate NAFTA. Some Members of Congress and farm interest groups support NAFTA renegotiation, with a focus on pressuring Canada to change dairy pricing policies. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady stated that while NAFTA has good provisions, some parts should be updated and improved. Some support NAFTA renegotiation to address trade disputes, concerns about potatoes, milk, cheese, and wine. Others want to ensure it does not harm existing U.S. export markets. The Administration reassures Congress it will protect U.S. agricultural export advantages. Major food companies caution against drastic changes to NAFTA and support modernizing it to preserve gains. The Administration is working to modernize NAFTA while preserving gains. The American Farm Bureau Federation and others support updating and reforming NAFTA, including improvements in agriculture like biotechnology and sanitary measures. Dairy industry seeks improvements in SPS commitments and geographical indications. Potato growers want concerns in U.S.-Mexico potato trade addressed. Calls for reforms in Canada's grain grading standards. U.S. textile industry also supports NAFTA renegotiation. The U.S. textile, apparel, and footwear industry supports NAFTA and urges no harm to supply chains. U.S. meat and livestock interests are divided on country-of-origin labeling. Farm interest groups look to TPP and T-TIP for renegotiation approaches. Canadian officials recommend provisions from EU-Canada trade negotiations. The Mexican government is considering using provisions from the EU-Canada trade agreement as a model for NAFTA negotiations. Mexican officials prioritize improving competitiveness in the NAFTA region, with concerns raised about potential risks to U.S. agricultural export markets if negotiations fail. Agricultural groups urge caution in renegotiating NAFTA to avoid destabilizing current markets. The National Association of State Departments of Agriculture supports \"prudent\" renegotiation of NAFTA to preserve gains and advantages. Concerns exist about potential backfire of renegotiation leading to tougher requirements and retaliation against the U.S. agriculture industry. Renegotiation may be complicated by the complex nature of agricultural issues. A coalition of sugar exporting countries (excluding Mexico) is urging the Administration to address concerns about Mexico's sugar shipments to the United States. Some in Congress argue that the U.S.-Mexico sugar case involves subsidized, dumped Mexican sugar. The United States and Mexico agreed to amendments in the case on June 6, 2017, potentially removing the issue from upcoming NAFTA talks. The Trump Administration withdrew from the TPP agreement in January 2017, despite support from agricultural groups for increased market access and exports. Some in the U.S. agricultural sector are disappointed at the decision to withdraw from TPP, citing the potential for expanded exports, especially for California agriculture. While there is support for rejoining TPP in Congress, not all agriculture groups were in favor due to concerns about competition from imports, lack of enforcement against currency manipulation, and potential job offshoring in the food processing sector. TPP aimed to liberalize agricultural trade through lower tariffs, expanded TRQs, and rules for reducing non-tariff barriers, which would have increased overseas markets for U.S. farm and food products. The 2016 ITC report found that TPP would benefit U.S. agriculture by increasing overseas market access. Some stakeholders suggest using TPP provisions as a framework for renegotiating NAFTA's agricultural provisions, as they address SPS and non-tariff barriers. U.S. trade groups recommend considering TPP's agricultural commitments to improve existing FTAs. This is discussed further in \"Options for Renegotiating NAFTA.\" The Trump Administration's objectives for U.S. agriculture in NAFTA renegotiations are not specified in the official notice to Congress. However, USTR's request for public comment on modernizing NAFTA addresses agricultural issues such as SPS measures and technical trade barriers. Potential gains for U.S. agricultural exporters include improving market access and updating SPS provisions beyond existing WTO rights and obligations. The Trump Administration's objectives for U.S. agriculture in NAFTA renegotiations include addressing agricultural trade disputes, concerns regarding GIs, and incorporating changes related to food and agriculture from the TPP agreement. Some farm interest groups are pushing for additional changes beyond those in the TPP, such as a \"mutual recognition agreement\" on biotech crops safety with Canada and Mexico. The U.S. aims to establish a \"mutual recognition agreement\" with Canada and Mexico on the safety of biotech crops for food and feed. They also seek to manage low-level presence of unauthorized biotech traits in agricultural shipments. NAFTA eliminated tariffs on most agricultural products, except for dairy, poultry, and eggs exported to Canada. Tariff rates for products above quota levels can be as high as 245% for cheese and 298% for butter. Canada uses supply-management systems for dairy, chicken, and turkey. The U.S. aims to renegotiate NAFTA to address trade liberalization of dairy, poultry, and eggs with Canada and Mexico. The Trump Administration has requested an investigation into the economic impact of providing duty-free treatment for imports from Canada and Mexico, including exempted agricultural products. USDA officials see opportunities to expand U.S. exports of dairy, poultry, and eggs to these countries. The potential economic effects of eliminating tariffs for over 380 import-sensitive agricultural products, currently under TRQs, are being assessed. Challenges exist in negotiating additional access for exempted products, particularly milk and dairy, due to Canada's domestic subsidy and pricing policies. U.S. dairy stakeholders argue that these policies violate trade agreements like NAFTA, WTO, and CETA. Renegotiating NAFTA to include updated provisions on SPS measures is seen as beneficial by some agricultural groups. The need for enforceable obligations beyond WTO standards in agricultural trade is a key objective. The TPP and T-TIP negotiations addressed SPS and TBT issues in agricultural trade, introducing \"SPS-Plus\" and \"TBT-Plus\" concepts to enhance WTO agreements. U.S. industry groups support SPS-Plus provisions in the TPP agreement, which included commitments on SPS and TBT rules addressing U.S. concerns. The TPP countries agreed to changes allowing public comment on proposed SPS measures. The curr_chunk discusses various measures in the TPP agreement related to SPS rules, import programs, information exchange, audits, and consultations between governments. However, there is opposition to these changes, with concerns that they may weaken global food safety standards. The TPP's SPS provisions are seen as beneficial for U.S. firms exporting food and agriculture products to all TPP members, despite some opposition. Industry representatives support the cooperative technical consultation process and dispute settlement mechanisms. Ongoing disputes between the U.S. and its NAFTA partners over trade in agricultural commodities have raised concerns about SPS and TBT measures. The SPS-Plus and TBT-Plus provisions aim to address concerns about domestic subsidy programs and improve transparency in trade agreements. Advocates are pushing for a \"rapid response mechanism\" to resolve disputes quickly and enforce SPS measures more effectively. The goal is to have self-contained enforcement mechanisms for SPS rules in trade agreements. Under TPP, there was agreement to improve information exchange and promote systems-based audits for regulatory controls. A mechanism for consultations between governments was established to rapidly resolve SPS matters. Some view RRM as a way to push potentially unsafe food into markets. NAFTA renegotiations aim to resolve trade disputes for agricultural products like beef, pork, poultry, dairy, rice, and fruits. Concerns include milk, cheese, potatoes, and wine. The 2017 NTE report highlights outstanding trade disputes involving SPS and TBT issues between the United States and Mexico, including Mexico's risk assessment requirements affecting milk, cheese, potatoes, and wine. The 2017 NTE report highlights trade disputes between the United States and Mexico, including Mexico's risk assessment requirements affecting unpasteurized commercial milk exports, pest quarantine of stone fruit growers, and administrative procedures and customs practices. For Canada, U.S. concerns include restrictions on seed varieties not registered in the prescribed manner. Canada's trade disputes with the United States include restrictions on seed varieties, cheese compositional standards limiting dry milk protein concentrate in cheese making, supply management systems for dairy, chicken, turkey, and egg industries, concessions to the EU affecting certain U.S. products, restrictions on U.S. grain exports, provincial restrictions on alcohol sales, and trade disputes involving softwood lumber. The United States has brought trade cases against Canada and Mexico within the WTO, including disputes over softwood lumber. NAFTA includes a dispute settlement mechanism (Chapter 19) for reviewing AD and CVD decisions. Some have called for the elimination of Chapter 19. Senator Ron Wyden has called for the elimination of Chapter 19 of NAFTA, which allows Canada and Mexico to challenge U.S. decisions on unfairly traded imports. Concerns stem from the U.S.-Canada softwood lumber dispute, where Chapter 19 panels often fault U.S. decisions. Some view Chapter 19 as unlawful and question if an extrajudicial body should review U.S. decisions. Senator Wyden has received assurances from the Trump Administration that NAFTA renegotiation will address concerns about Chapter 19. NAFTA renegotiation will address concerns about Chapter 19 and aim to improve on the TPP agreement. While FTA partners prefer resolving disputes through consultation, mediation, and negotiation, NAFTA has a formal dispute settlement mechanism (Chapter 20). This mechanism is rarely used, with most cases brought to WTO dispute settlement. Some believe that TPP could serve as a model for revising NAFTA's dispute resolution provisions, as TPP included additional disciplines such as transparency and cooperation. The TPP agreement included additional disciplines such as transparency, cooperation, and alternative mechanisms for resolving disputes. It also addressed panel report implementation and encouraged the use of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms for private commercial disputes. Geographical Indications (GIs) protect the quality and reputation of products from specific regions, providing commercial value and relief from infringement. Geographical Indications (GIs) protect the quality and reputation of products from specific regions, providing commercial value and relief from infringement. Examples of GIs include Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, Prosciutto di Parma ham, Roquefort cheese, Champagne, Irish Whiskey, Florida oranges, Idaho potatoes, Vidalia onions, Washington State apples, and Napa Valley Wines. The U.S. dairy industry is concerned about the protection of GIs in third-country markets due to recent trade agreements. Recent trade agreements may provide full protection of Geographical Indications (GIs) for products from specific regions, affecting U.S. exports to countries like the EU, Canada, and others. These agreements could limit the sale of U.S. products bearing generic names in these markets, regardless of past exports. Mexico and Canada do not have GIs registered under the EU's program but could offer protections to EU-registered GIs. The EU's GI program could restrict U.S. exports to Mexico and Canada, as seen in the EU-Canada CETA agreement. GIs have been a contentious issue in T-TIP negotiations between the U.S. and EU due to differences in laws and regulations. The EU has completed negotiations with Canada on CETA, which could block some U.S. dairy exports to Canada. Negotiations between the EU and Mexico could also impact trade rules. The EU-Mexico trade agreement, similar to CETA, could block U.S. dairy exports to Mexico. GIs were addressed in the TPP agreement, with obligations for recognition and cancellation processes. Interested parties can object to GIs before official recognition, citing reasons like confusion with trademarks or pending applications. The TPP agreement addresses Geographical Indications (GIs) by outlining obligations for recognition and cancellation processes. Interested parties can object to GIs before official recognition, citing reasons like confusion with trademarks or pending applications. GIs are a form of intellectual property rights (IPR) along with patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, and have become a contentious international trade issue. Geographical Indications (GIs) are a form of intellectual property rights protected by the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). GIs have become a contentious international trade issue, particularly for U.S. wine, cheese, and sausage makers. The current U.S. trade agenda includes GIs among other IPR issues. Following the Administration's notification to renegotiate NAFTA, negotiations could begin in mid-to-late August. The Administration is required to submit negotiating objectives to Congress by mid-to-late July for the modernization of NAFTA. USTR is seeking public input on various issues including economic impacts, trade barriers, and specific goods treatment. ITC's analysis on eliminating tariffs for import-sensitive agricultural products will also be released. The Administration is required to submit negotiating objectives to Congress by mid-to-late July for the modernization of NAFTA. USTR's review of public comments and ITC's forthcoming analysis will help inform the renegotiation process."
