    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act\" aims to prevent unconscionable pricing of gasoline and other petroleum distillates during emergencies. The Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act prohibits selling gasoline or petroleum distillates at unconscionably excessive prices during an international crisis affecting oil markets. The President can issue a proclamation designating areas where this applies. The President can issue a proclamation under the Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act to prohibit selling gasoline or petroleum distillates at excessive prices in designated areas of the United States for up to 30 days, renewable for additional 30-day periods. The proclamation must specify the geographic area, fuel type, and duration of the restriction. Factors considered in determining a violation of price gouging include whether the charged amount grossly exceeds the average price in the 30 days prior to a proclamation and the price of similar products. The determination of price gouging violations includes assessing if the price significantly surpasses the average in the 30 days before a proclamation and the cost of similar products, considering factors like availability, additional costs, and market conditions. The text discusses determining price gouging violations by comparing the quantity of gasoline or petroleum distillates produced, distributed, or sold in a specific area after a proclamation to the quantity before the proclamation, considering seasonal demand variations. The term \"wholesale\" refers to sales where title transfers at a product terminal or refinery, and dealer tank wagon sales priced on. Tank wagon sales of gasoline or petroleum distillates priced on a delivered basis to retail outlets, including sales to end users such as motorists and direct sales to agriculture, industry, residential, and commercial consumers. SEC. 3. ENFORCEMENT BY THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION. Enforcement of section 2 of the Act by the Federal Trade Commission includes treating violations as unfair or deceptive acts, with enforcement actions prioritizing companies with significant sales of gasoline and petroleum distillates. Civil penalties may be imposed on violators. Under the Federal Trade Commission Act, violators of section 2 may face civil penalties of up to 3 times the profits gained from the violation or a maximum of $100,000,000. Penalties are obtained similarly to those under section 5 of the Act. Each day of a continuing violation is considered a separate offense, and the court may consider mitigating factors when assessing penalties. When assessing penalties for violations under the Federal Trade Commission Act, the court considers factors such as the seriousness of the violation and the efforts made to remedy the harm caused in a timely manner. SEC. 4. CRIMINAL PENALTIES. Any person violating section 2 may be fined up to $500,000,000 under title 18, US Code. Enforcement is through criminal action by the Attorney General, prioritizing companies with over $10,000,000,000 in annual sales of gasoline and petroleum distillates. A State can bring a civil action in federal court to enforce the provisions of the Act or impose civil penalties for violations involving retail sales. The State must notify the Federal Trade Commission before initiating the action, providing a copy of the complaint if feasible. The Federal Trade Commission may intervene in a civil action brought by a State under the Act, allowing them to be heard on all matters and file petitions for appeal. The attorney general of a State can still exercise their powers to conduct investigations and compel witnesses in such actions. In a civil action under the Act, venue can be in a district where the defendant operates, was authorized to do business, or is found. Process serving is not limited by district or state boundaries. Individuals involved in the alleged violation can be joined in the action regardless of their residence. State actions are limited if the Federal Trade Commission has initiated a civil or administrative action for Act violations. State officials can enforce civil or criminal statutes in State court. No prohibition on State actions if Federal Trade Commission has initiated action for Act violations. The Act does not limit the Federal Trade Commission's authority to enforce laws or preempt State laws."
