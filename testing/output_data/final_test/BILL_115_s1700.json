The Water Efficiency Improvement Act of 2017 establishes a voluntary WaterSense program within the EPA to promote water-efficient products and conserve water resources for future generations. The Water Efficiency Improvement Act of 2017 establishes a voluntary WaterSense program within the EPA to promote water-efficient products and conserve water resources for future generations. The Administrator shall identify water-efficient products, buildings, facilities, processes, and services, including irrigation technologies, water treatment devices, plumbing products, recycling technologies, landscaping products, humidifiers, and water-efficient buildings. The Water Efficiency Improvement Act of 2017 establishes a voluntary WaterSense program within the EPA to promote water-efficient products and conserve water resources. The Administrator will establish a WaterSense label for certified items and enhance public awareness through outreach and education. The Water Efficiency Improvement Act of 2017 establishes a voluntary WaterSense program within the EPA to promote water-efficient products. The program aims to preserve the integrity of the WaterSense label by setting performance criteria, overseeing certifications, using testing protocols, and auditing label use. The Water Efficiency Improvement Act of 2017 establishes a voluntary WaterSense program within the EPA to promote water-efficient products. The program aims to preserve the integrity of the WaterSense label by auditing its use in the marketplace and preventing misuse. Additionally, the program requires a review and potential revision of WaterSense specifications every 6 to 10 years, with a transparent process involving public notice, comments solicitation, and appropriate transition times. The Water Efficiency Improvement Act of 2017 establishes a voluntary WaterSense program within the EPA to promote water-efficient products. It requires the use of the best available peer-reviewed science and data for decision-making, with appropriate transition times for changes. The Water Efficiency Improvement Act of 2017 establishes the voluntary WaterSense program within the EPA to promote water-efficient products. The Administrator is required to regularly estimate and make public the savings of water, energy, and costs attributed to WaterSense products. Coordination between Energy Star and WaterSense programs is necessary to avoid conflicting requirements. The Water Efficiency Improvement Act of 2017 establishes the voluntary WaterSense program within the EPA to promote water-efficient products. Coordination between Energy Star and WaterSense programs is necessary to prevent duplicative or conflicting requirements among the respective programs. A WaterSense label shall not create an express or implied warranty.
