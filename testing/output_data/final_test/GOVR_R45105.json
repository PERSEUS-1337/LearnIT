    "content": "In September 2017, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, both Category 5 storms, caused catastrophic damage to the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI). The hurricanes resulted in uninsured damage exceeding $7.5 billion, with 80-90% of the power transmission and distribution systems across the USVI being damaged. Despite this, the Estate Richmond and Krum Bay power plants provided uninterrupted electrical service to hospitals during the storms. Recovery efforts in the USVI focused on restoring power to hospitals, water treatment plants, and industries after Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Governor Kenneth Mapp announced on January 10, 2018, that 90% of eligible customers had power restored. As of January 31, power has been restored to 93% of total customers. VIWAPA faced fiscal challenges and outdated infrastructure even before the hurricanes. Policymakers are considering options for rebuilding the electricity grid in the USVI. The report discusses the financial challenges faced by VIWAPA and the USVI government in rebuilding the electricity grid after the hurricanes. It suggests possible options for restructuring the electric power system, including forming public-private partnerships for modernization. Congress may need to consider funding for grid resiliency and investment incentives. The U.S. Virgin Islands, located east of Puerto Rico, may need new investment and oversight from the federal government to modernize their grid. The islands consist of St. Croix, St. John, and St. Thomas, with St. Thomas being the main center for tourism and commerce. St. John is home to the Virgin Islands National Park, while St. Croix is situated south of St. Thomas. The U.S. Virgin Islands consist of St. Croix, St. John, and St. Thomas, with St. Croix being the agricultural and manufacturing center. The population was estimated at 103,700 in 2015, with a struggling economy due to the closure of a major refinery in 2012. Unemployment rose to 13.4% in 2013 but declined to 10.3% in April 2017, remaining above the mainland rate. Median household income was $37,254 in 2009. The U.S. Virgin Islands have a median household income of $37,254 in 2009, higher than Puerto Rico but lower than the U.S. overall. In 2015, per capita income was $22,653, also higher than Puerto Rico but below the U.S. average. The economy relies heavily on tourism, with 2.6 million visitors in 2015, mostly arriving on cruise ships. The manufacturing sector is now minor, with only two rum distilleries playing a significant role. The manufacturing sector in the U.S. Virgin Islands, once a significant part of the economy, has now dwindled to only two rum distilleries, heavily subsidized with public funds. The closure of the HOVENSA refinery in 2012, one of the world's largest petroleum refineries, further exacerbated economic challenges. The refinery, a joint venture between Hess Oil and Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, filed for bankruptcy in 2015. Some facilities were acquired by Limetree Bay, which now employs around 650 people. The closure of the HOVENSA refinery in 2012 led to economic challenges in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The government received $220 million to cover the budget deficit, but tax revenues decreased by $140 million annually. Despite some economic growth post-2015, data scarcity exists after the 2017 hurricanes. The USVI government faced fiscal challenges pre-hurricanes, with a $110 million deficit in FY2017 and long-term debt of $2 billion in FY2016. The US Virgin Islands faced fiscal challenges with a $2 billion long-term debt in FY2016, along with $3.4 billion in unfunded pension liability and VIWAPA debt. Concerns about debt sustainability led to credit rating downgrades in January 2017, which intensified after the 2017 hurricanes. Moody's suggested debt restructuring in January 2018 due to high debt levels compared to other subnational governments. The US Virgin Islands government is facing a financial crisis due to high debt levels and limited access to capital markets. Governor Mapp proposed measures to strengthen public finances, including tax increases and spending constraints. The government's plan to issue bonds to cover budget shortfalls was postponed and eventually cancelled. The Senate President described the situation as a crisis of great proportions. The US Virgin Islands government implemented tax increases on items like beer, liquor, sodas, and timeshare rentals to address financial challenges. A $40 million revenue anticipation note was issued to provide liquidity. Despite hurricane devastation, the government reassured bondholders of honoring financial commitments. The USVI faces fiscal challenges despite receiving $456 million in disaster assistance from FEMA. The territory is not covered by PROMESA like Puerto Rico. The Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority (VIWAPA) is an independent governmental agency of the USVI, providing water and electricity services to customers. It serves approximately 55,000 electric power customers and 13,000 water customers in St. Thomas, St. Croix, and St. John. Rates for both systems are regulated by the Public Services Commission (PSC) of the USVI. The USVI's water systems are regulated by the Public Services Commission (PSC) and independently financed. The region heavily relies on fuel oil for electricity generation, with 71% of installed capacity using fuel oil in 2010. However, by 2015, fuel oil accounted for less than 1% of electricity generation in the US. VIWAPA historically purchased fuel from HOVENSA refinery at below market prices, but price volatility still affected electricity prices. The closure of HOVENSA has increased VIWAPA's exposure to price volatility, leading to higher electricity prices in the USVI. VIWAPA's reliance on fuel oil for power generation leaves customer rates vulnerable to fuel price increases, resulting in electricity rates up to five times higher than the mainland average. The monthly utility bills include a levelized energy adjustment clause (LEAC) factor to address fuel price fluctuations, subject to approval by the Virgin Islands Public Service Commission. VIWAPA has faced cash flow challenges due to these factors. VIWAPA has faced cash flow challenges due to slow payment from the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands, hindering its ability to cover expenses and maintain equipment. This has led to delays in maintenance, inventory shortages, and increased equipment failures, impacting power generation efficiency and raising energy supply costs for customers. VIWAPA operates two electric power systems on the islands of St. Thomas and St. Croix. VIWAPA's generation facilities are located on the islands of St. Thomas and St. Croix. St. John receives power from St. Thomas via undersea cables. VIWAPA heavily relies on distillate fuel oil and heavy fuel oil for power and water production. VIWAPA has actively sought to improve energy efficiency and diversify its energy resources to reduce fossil fuel-based energy use by 60% by 2025. In 2014, solar power was introduced through power purchase agreements with independent producers, with the two largest solar facilities located on St. Thomas and St. Croix. By 2015, 8% of VIWAPA's peak demand generating capacity came from renewable sources, including solar and wind power development. Additionally, efforts have been made to diversify fuel sources by converting or adding generating units. VIWAPA has sought to diversify its fuel sources by converting or adding generating units that can consume propane. The conversion of main units on St. Croix was completed in 2016, but replacement of some units in St. Thomas is still ongoing. VIWAPA's propane supplier, Vitol, has withheld supplies due to outstanding balance, leading to an extension of the oil contract with Glencore. Despite efforts to reduce fossil fuel use by 40%, switching to propane may result in lower energy output compared to diesel fuel. VIWAPA operates separate transmission and distribution systems for St. Croix and St. Thomas/St. John. The US Virgin Islands (USVI) has two separate transmission and distribution (T&D) systems: one for St. Croix and one for St. Thomas and St. John. The T&D system on St. Croix includes 24.9 kV subtransmission lines and 13.8 kV distribution lines, while the system on St. Thomas and St. John consists of 34.5 kV primary lines and 13.8 kV distribution lines. The USVI T&D systems collectively have 737.8 miles of lines, with some underground lines. VIWAPA has implemented a customer education and energy conservation campaign to reduce fossil fuel use by 60% by 2025, including tips such as using ceiling fans instead of air conditioning units and washing clothes in cold water. VIWAPA is promoting energy conservation at home by washing clothes in cold water, air-drying dishes, and using solar water heaters. They are also replacing incandescent light bulbs with energy-efficient options. Additionally, the USVI government is working on restoring power after hurricanes, with 93% of customers having power restored as of January 29, 2018. About 3,900 customers (7%) are still without power. As of January 31, 2018, VIWAPA reported that approximately 3,900 customers (7%) were without power in the US Virgin Islands. St. Thomas had 2,900 customers (11%) without power, including Water Island (100% power restored) and Hassel Island (0% power restored). St. John had 160 customers (4%) without power, and St. Croix had 800 customers (3%) without power. Nearly 800 supplemental utility personnel were assisting in restoration efforts. The US Coast Guard reopened ports for petroleum product deliveries, and restoration work in the Virgin Islands National Park on St. John has begun. St. Croix is accepting hotel guests and received its first post-hurricanes cruise ship on November 11, 2017. VIWAPA is eligible for federal assistance from FEMA. FEMA provides grant assistance through the Public Assistance Grant Program for repair and replacement of public facilities in states and communities with disaster declarations under the Stafford Act. Eligible applicants can receive grants to repair or replace facilities to their predisaster design and function, including expenses required by current codes and standards due to the disaster. In 2009, the USVI enacted net metering safety standards following the federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005) via regulation, which referenced the IEEE standard 1547 for interconnecting distributed resources with electric power systems. FEMA may require documentation of prior application of standards for code-required improvements to be eligible. The FEMA minimum standards policy may not directly apply to power facilities as they do not fit the definition of \"building.\" The legal authority supporting the policy's expansion to power facilities is unclear. The 2017 hurricane season severely impacted the USVI, but hurricane damage is not unknown to the region. The 2017 hurricane season severely impacted the US Virgin Islands (USVI) and VIWAPA. VIWAPA had completed $29 million in hazard mitigation projects by 2010, with $18 million financed through FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. FEMA authorized DOE-WAPA to assist with power restoration efforts in the USVI after Hurricane Irma. Crews from DOE-WAPA completed electric power system restoration activities in November 2017. The government of the USVI estimated uninsured hurricane-related damages to exceed $7.5 million. The government of the US Virgin Islands estimated uninsured hurricane-related damages to exceed $7.5 billion. A total funding request of $7.49 billion includes $850 million for the energy sector to incorporate resiliency measures like burying utility lines and adding renewable generation capacity. Prior to the 2017 hurricane season, the USVI and VIWAPA engaged in energy planning efforts to assess future power needs and cost-effective options. Two power evaluation studies were conducted for VIWAPA to assess future power needs and options for the USVI's electric power systems. The study by R.W. Beck recommended four alternative approaches to electricity generation and water production, including wind power and liquefied natural gas, to reduce operating costs and dependence on fossil fuels. The US Virgin Islands (USVI) set a goal to reduce fossil fuel dependence by 60% by 2025. The Energy Development in Island Nations (EDIN) initiative, cosponsored by the DOE and others, aimed to demonstrate renewable energy technologies. VIWAPA collaborated with various entities to develop a plan to meet the 60% fossil fuel reduction goal. The Islands Energy Office (VIEO) collaborated with NREL and VIWAPA to develop a plan for reducing fossil fuel dependence by 60% by 2025. Strategies included enhancing production efficiency, converting to natural gas, developing grid interconnections, maximizing solar and wind resources, and pursuing biomass and ocean thermal energy. Congress authorized comprehensive energy planning and financial assistance for renewable energy projects in insular areas like the USVI. Two energy assessment reports were conducted in fulfillment of these requirements: a DOE report in 1982 and a DOI report in 2006. Both reports acknowledged cooperation with territorial governments and utilities. The DOE report in 1982 and the DOI report in 2006 assessed energy supply, demand, and potential technologies for insular areas like the USVI. Recommendations included reducing electricity and gasoline consumption, and exploring alternative resources like solar and wind energy. Despite large reserve margins, the electric power system faced reliability issues due to isolation and maintenance difficulties. Petroleum remained the primary energy source in the 2006 assessment. The report recommended alternative technologies for the energy system in insular areas like the USVI, suggesting reducing reliance on diesel fuel due to cost, reliability, and air quality concerns. Recommendations included developing power purchase agreements, installing efficient generation replacements, evaluating petroleum coke use, and assessing building energy efficiency standards to reduce energy demand. Electric system reliability is crucial for utility performance. Electric system reliability is a key measure of a utility's performance, ensuring the ability to meet customer demand. Utilities aim to balance power generation with customer needs, maintaining enough capacity and reserve margin to serve peak demand. The USVI's two grids are designed to independently meet demand on St. Thomas and St. Croix systems. Maintaining reliability for each grid is planned uniquely, potentially increasing complexity and costs. The Department of Energy (DOE) acknowledges the lack of standardized metrics for measuring grid resilience. To minimize power outages, electric power systems must quickly recover from weather-related events. Extreme weather events, like hurricanes, pose a significant risk to the reliability of isolated Caribbean electric utility systems. The US Virgin Islands face annual risks to their electric utility systems due to extreme weather events like hurricanes. VIWAPA has completed $29 million in hazard mitigation projects, with $18 million funded by FEMA. The USVI estimated a need for $300 million for energy sector resiliency post-2017 hurricanes, with severe damage to transmission and distribution systems. Power plants fared well, but the grid suffered significant damage. CEO of VIWAPA testified to extensive damage, especially to the transmission and distribution system. The US Virgin Islands faced extensive damage to their electric utility systems from hurricanes, with up to 90% damage on some islands. VIWAPA is currently engaged in a major restoration effort to rebuild transmission feeders and circuits. Hardening activities for energy infrastructure are crucial for resilience against extreme weather events. To protect energy infrastructure from extreme weather, measures include elevating substations and control rooms, upgrading poles, burying power lines underground, and deploying smart grid technologies. VIWAPA is planning efforts to further harden electric systems against severe weather. VIWAPA is replacing wooden poles with composite poles to withstand wind speeds of up to 200 mph. Approximately 4,300 composite poles are needed for St. Thomas-St. John and 5,900 for St. Croix. Key aerial facilities are being relocated underground, with critical infrastructure already underground. The focus is on underground facilities restoration. The Department of Energy (DOE) is focusing on restoring underground facilities that service key seaports and shipping companies to restore inbound cargo traffic to the islands after a hurricane or tropical storm. DOE also emphasizes improving electric system resiliency through utility preparedness programs and investments, such as conducting hurricane preparedness planning, managing vegetation, and securing fuel contracts for emergency vehicles. The Department of Energy is focusing on restoring underground facilities for key seaports and shipping companies after hurricanes. They are also improving electric system resiliency through utility preparedness programs, including securing fuel contracts for emergency vehicles. Additionally, WAPA is exploring the benefits of electric microgrids for power generation in storm-prone areas. The microgrid can function independently during power outages caused by severe storms in the Caribbean region. Recommendations include protecting infrastructure against wind speeds of 155 miles per hour and flooding based on observations from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. Resilience in power systems requires redundant capabilities in generation, transmission, and distribution functions to address perceived risks beyond cost-benefit analyses. The DOE's recommendations focus on managing potential costs and risks of extreme weather events for grid resilience. Key factors include risk awareness, cost-effective grid strengthening, and increasing system flexibility with new technologies. The USVI government has been prioritizing these strategies. The US Virgin Islands government is focused on improving the resilience of the island's grid by burying power lines, investing in a micro-grid system with renewable energy sources, and considering adding a microgrid for independent power generation during extreme weather events. WAPA is developing a microgrid at St. Croix's airport with 4MW of solar power and 2MW of battery storage. They plan to create more microgrids across the Territory. VIWAPA is in talks with PREPA for a potential 20-30 MW power purchase via submarine transmission lines, which could reduce costs and improve reliability. The Authority plans to prioritize discussions with PREPA regarding participation in non-oil fired generation in Puerto Rico and the development of larger generating units to take advantage of economies of scale. A proposed project involves a 45-mile underwater transmission cable connecting Fajardo, Puerto Rico, and Botany Bay in St. Thomas, with IAES owning the cable and developing the Transmission Project in consultation with the Authority. The Authority would also develop a new substation at Botany Bay. The Authority plans to develop a new substation at Botany Bay and purchase electric power from IAES. The estimated direct construction cost of the substation is not yet determined. VIWAPA is also considering a DC transmission intertie between St. Thomas and St. Croix, with a preferred water depth of no more than 6,000 feet. A potential route for a DC transmission intertie between St. Thomas and St. Croix, with a preferred depth of 6,000 feet, could be approximately 100 miles long. Operating at 150 kV, a DC circuit is more practical than AC due to transmission cable limitations. Benefits include the ability to use larger generators, smaller planning reserves, and lower capital costs per kW. An interconnection could reduce the planning reserve margin in the USVI, allowing for larger generating units and increased system reliability. The 2008 analysis found that the benefits of an interconnected system with larger generators on St. Thomas and St. Croix did not outweigh the costs at that time. However, VIWAPA may consider an interconnection in the future for new generation capacity. The USVI is transitioning to propane for power generation due to aging plants and EPA emissions decrees. VIWAPA in the US Virgin Islands is transitioning to propane for power generation to reduce petroleum use and fossil fuel consumption. The new combustion turbines are fuel flexible, burning LNG, propane, or fuel oil. The government aims to reduce petroleum use by 60% by 2025, with VIWAPA targeting a 40% reduction in fossil fuel use through increased efficiency and reduced power consumption. While propane is expected to lower emissions and fuel costs, it produces less power output compared to diesel fuel. Renewable resource development, including solar, wind, and bioenergy, has been studied with assistance from the DOE and national laboratories in the USVI. The US Virgin Islands government, with DOE and national laboratories, focuses on solar, wind, and bioenergy resources. A 2009 initiative mandated 30% renewable energy by 2025. Solar PV facilities, like the 450-kilowatt array at King Airport, provided most renewable capacity pre-2017 hurricanes. Estate Donoe and Estate Spanish Town are the largest solar facilities with over 4 megawatts capacity each. Independent power producers manage these projects. Since 1990, the USVI government has offered rebates for consumer-sited renewable facilities like solar PV panels, solar water heaters, and small wind turbines. Solar water heaters are mandatory in new construction. Limited information is available on the status of solar facilities post-hurricanes, with some damage reported at the AES Distributed Energy site on St. Thomas. Utility scale wind development potential has been noted, but siting and project costs have hindered progress. No large renewable energy projects have been built in the US Virgin Islands due to issues with siting and project costs. The largest wind turbine is a 100 kW turbine on St. Croix. A small landfill gas facility at the Bovoni landfill in St. Croix has operated for a few years but is scheduled to close in 2019 due to environmental violations. VIWAPA held public meetings in 2016 to gather input on an Integrated Resource Plan for future system options, including renewables. Hurricanes Irma and Maria damaged 80% to 90% of the transmission and distribution systems, with estimated uninsured damages exceeding $7.5 billion. Uninsured hurricane-related damages are estimated to exceed $7.5 billion, including electrical system damage. The Office of Management and Budget has requested $44 billion in funding for ongoing recovery efforts in states and territories affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Congress may need to appropriate additional funds as the requested amount may not be sufficient for Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Comprehensive energy planning is also recommended to develop resilient electric power systems. The US Virgin Islands (USVI) has requested $850 million for the energy sector, with $550 million from FEMA and $300 million from CDBG-DR program. The funds will be used for grid repairs, system resiliency, and backup generation to mitigate outages and damage to T&D systems. Routine maintenance and vegetation management are part of risk mitigation efforts. The proposed $850 million funding for the US Virgin Islands energy sector includes undergrounding electric distribution lines, replacing wooden poles with composite poles, and installing emergency power generation systems. Additionally, $250 million is allocated for emergency backup power systems, onsite generator improvements, and portable generators for noncritical areas. Several bills in the 115th Congress support these initiatives. Several bills in the 115th Congress provide disaster assistance for areas impacted by 2017 hurricanes. The House passed an $81 billion emergency aid bill, and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 allocated $89.3 billion for disaster relief. S. 2165 aims to provide specific assistance to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands affected by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Congress may consider additional legislative action for disaster recovery assistance in territories impacted by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorized DOE and DOI to provide technical and financial assistance for power line projects in insular areas to improve system resiliency. Congress may also consider providing appropriations for energy planning and modernizing electric power systems in these territories. Legislation may be needed for debt adjustments in territories not covered by the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Act. Legislation may be needed for debt adjustments in territories not covered by PROMESA."
