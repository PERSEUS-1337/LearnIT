    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 14548 of the Public Resources Code requires manufacturers of PET plastic packaging in California to report the amount of new PET plastic made, the amount of postfilled PET plastic used, and include a minimum of 10% postfilled PET plastic in their packaging. Section 14549 of the Public Resources Code now mandates that glass container manufacturers in California must report monthly to the department the total tons of new glass containers made and the tons of California postfilled glass used in manufacturing. Glass container manufacturers in California must use a minimum percentage of postfilled glass in the manufacturing of their glass food, drink, or beverage containers, with the percentage varying based on the type of cullet used. Glass container manufacturers in California may request a reduction or waiver of the minimum postfilled glass percentage required for their containers if it is technologically infeasible to meet the requirement or if there is a lack of available glass cullet. \"Mixed-color cullet\" refers to cullet that does not meet ASTM standard specifications for color mix. CHAPTER 5.9 outlines the PET Plastic Packaging Recycled Content Program in California. It defines terms like \"filled with food or drink\" and \"PET plastic packaging.\" Manufacturers of PET plastic packaging in the state must annually certify compliance with specific requirements starting from January 1, 2017. This includes reporting the total tons of new PET plastic packaging manufactured in the previous year. Starting January 1, 2017, importers of empty PET plastic packaging filled with food or drink in California must certify compliance with Section 42362 annually. This involves reporting the total tons of new PET plastic packaging used in the manufacturing of imported empty PET plastic packaging for sale in the state. Starting July 1, 2016, PET plastic packaging in California must contain a minimum of 10% postfilled PET plastic. Importers of empty PET plastic packaging filled with food or drink in the state must also ensure a minimum of 10% postfilled PET plastic. Manufacturers or importers may be audited to verify compliance with these requirements. If a PET plastic packaging manufacturer or importer provides false information about the percentage of postfilled PET plastic used, the department will refer the report to the Attorney General for prosecution. Violators may face fines up to $1,000 and civil penalties for each violation. A civil penalty or fine received under this section will be deposited in the Integrated Waste Management Account for department administration. No reimbursement is required by this act as it pertains to creating new crimes or infractions, changing penalties, or definitions of crimes."
