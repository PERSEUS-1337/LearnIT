    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area Natural Gas Pipeline Enlargement Act\" and includes definitions for clarity. SEC. 2 of the Act defines key terms such as Corporation, Pipeline, Recreation Area, Secretary, and Superintendent. The Secretary may grant an easement to the Corporation to enlarge the pipeline diameter to not more than 20 inches, with terms and conditions ensuring minimal disturbance to the Recreation Area's resources and compliance with National Park System laws and policies. The Superintendent may issue a permit to the Corporation for temporary construction in the Recreation Area for the enlarged pipeline, subject to consultation and identification of potential resource damage. The Corporation must submit a restoration and mitigation plan to the Superintendent for approval, detailing how the land subject to the easement will be maintained and outlining specific activities to mitigate damages or restore natural and cultural resources in the Recreation Area. The enlargement of the pipeline authorized under subsection (a) will meet pipeline replacement requirements. The Corporation must comply with FERC certification requirements for pipeline size increase. No further pipeline diameter or easement increases allowed within Recreation Area boundaries. No change to 50-foot right-of-way easement. Penalties for non-compliance may include civil action for damages and response costs. The Corporation may face penalties under applicable laws if it violates easement provisions or fails to implement an approved restoration plan, resulting in harm to park system resources."
