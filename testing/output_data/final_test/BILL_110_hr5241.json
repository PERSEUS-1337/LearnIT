    "content": "The Act titled \"Colorado Forest Insect Emergency Response Act of 2008\" addresses severe infestations of bark beetles and other insects on federal land in Colorado. The Congress acknowledges the natural role of fire and bark beetles in Colorado's forests but notes that large-scale infestations, combined with other factors, have led to severe wildfires threatening communities. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 was passed to reduce fuel levels and mitigate the risk of catastrophic wildfires. The modification of provisions in the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 aims to expedite action to reduce severe wildfire risks to Colorado communities, water supplies, and infrastructure in forested areas affected by bark beetles and insects. The definition of an insect-emergency area in Colorado is also included in the amendment. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 is amended to include an alternative analysis process for at-risk communities in insect-emergency areas. Additionally, a new section is added to address responses to insect emergencies. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 is amended to include an alternative analysis process for at-risk communities in insect-emergency areas, with a new section added to address responses to insect emergencies in Colorado. The Secretary has the authority to designate Federal land in Colorado as an insect-emergency area if there is a widespread infestation of bark beetles or other insects leading to tree mortality requiring immediate hazardous fuel reduction to mitigate wildfire risks to human life, property, or municipal water supply. The Secretary can designate Federal land in Colorado as an insect-emergency area based on the best available information, including insect infestations. The designation process can be initiated by the Secretary or in response to a request from the State or a political subdivision, with a deadline for the request initiation. The authority to designate an insect-emergency area on National Forest System lands can only be delegated to a Regional Forester. The Secretary must issue a decision on a request for designating an insect-emergency area within 90 days. Before making determinations, consultation with relevant agencies and public comments are required. Any review of the designation decision is subject to regulations and provisions. Authorized hazardous fuel reduction projects in designated areas within insect-emergency areas may be excluded from environmental impact statement documentation if they involve lands identified for treatment in a wildfire protection plan and the exclusion decision follows established procedures."
