The Board's proposals must be implemented by the Secretary of Health and Human Services unless Congress acts. This report provides an overview of the Board, discussing its rationale, structure, and the process triggering a proposal. The report provides an overview of the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to control Medicare spending growth. It discusses the process triggering a Board proposal, constraints on proposals, and parliamentary procedures for congressional consideration. Appendices detail key dates for IPAB implementation and compare IPAB with the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. The rising cost of the Medicare program has been a major impetus for health care reform. The rising cost of the Medicare program has been a significant concern, with annual medical inflation consistently exceeding overall inflation. Medicare spending has increased by 8.5% per year, outpacing total federal outlays. Per enrollee expenditures have risen by 6.3% per year, faster than overall medical inflation, leading to higher costs. The legislation aims to reduce the growth in Medicare expenditures by developing proposals for the Secretary to implement. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the Board's recommendations will save $15.5 billion from 2015 to 2019, with average spending per beneficiary increasing from $13,374 to $15,749. This represents a reduction of about $60 per year per Medicare beneficiary. Several proposals have been made to create an independent policy-making entity to limit the growth in Medicare expenditures, insulated from special interests and lobbyists. Senators Breaux and Frist introduced reform proposals in 2000 and 2001 to increase CMS's budget and create separate agencies to administer parts of the program. Several proposals have been made to create an independent policy-making entity to limit the growth in Medicare expenditures. This includes establishing a Medicare Board to manage competition among private plans and traditional Medicare, as well as creating separate agencies to administer parts of the program. Interest in an independent health care entity reemerged during early discussions of what became PPACA, with proposals such as the Federal Health Board modeled after the Federal Reserve Board. Senator Rockefeller also introduced the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) Reform Act of 2009 to alter MedPAC into an 11-member executive branch agency with authority over payment and coverage decisions. The Independent Medicare Advisory Council Act of 2009 proposed establishing a five-member council to advise on Medicare payment rates, with limited authority outside of payment policy. The Senate Finance Committee included a provision to establish an 11-member executive branch agency, MedPAC, with authority over payment and coverage decisions. The Senate Finance Committee included a provision in the PPACA to establish the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) to make recommendations to slow the growth in nonfederal programs. Some see the benefits of an independent board, while others are concerned about the lack of scrutiny from elected officials and potential tradeoffs between spending and quality. The PPACA established the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) to reduce the growth in nonfederal programs. Concerns exist about the lack of scrutiny from elected officials and potential tradeoffs between spending and quality. Efforts to control health care spending automatically have shown limitations in removing special interests or Congress from the process. Proponents advocate for focusing on spending, using automatic mechanisms, and removing short-term political influences to rationalize health care decision making. The Board's explicit charge is to reduce the per capita rate of growth in Medicare expenditures. Starting in 2013, the Chief Actuary calculates the Medicare per capita growth rate annually. The Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) was established by the PPACA to reduce the growth in nonfederal programs. Concerns exist about lack of scrutiny from elected officials and potential tradeoffs between spending and quality. Efforts to control health care spending automatically have limitations in removing special interests or Congress from the process. Proponents advocate for focusing on spending, using automatic mechanisms, and removing short-term political influences to rationalize health care decision making. The Chief Actuary calculates the Medicare per capita growth rate annually, and if it exceeds the target rate, the Board must propose reductions in Medicare expenditures. The Board, composed of 15 members appointed by the President, includes ex-officio nonvoting members. The Chairperson is appointed by the President from among the Board members. Members are selected for varied expertise in health finance and economics. The Board members are selected for their expertise in health finance, actuarial science, health facility management, and reimbursement. They come from diverse backgrounds including physicians, health professionals, experts in pharmaco-economics, employers, third-party payers, and individuals skilled in health economics research. Consumer and elderly representatives are also included. The Board members are appointed for two consecutive six-year terms with exceptions for initial members and vacancies. Appointed members must disclose financial interests and are prohibited from engaging in other business. Former members are restricted from lobbying for one year after leaving the Board. The Board members are appointed for two consecutive six-year terms with exceptions for initial members and vacancies. Appointed members must disclose financial interests and are prohibited from engaging in other business. Former members are restricted from lobbying for one year after leaving the Board. Appointed members of the Board will be compensated at a rate equal to Level III of the Executive Schedule ($165,300 for 2011), and the Chairperson will be compensated at a rate equal to Level II ($179,700 for 2011). The Chairperson will be the principal executive officer of the Board and supervise employees. The Board will elect its own vice Chairperson to act in the absence or disability of the Chairperson or in the event of a vacancy. The law provides that the Board can hire an executive director and a staff\u2014either detailed from other Federal agencies or direct hires\u2014to perform its duties. The budget for the Board for FY2012 is $15 million, with annual adjustments based on increases in the consumer price index (CPI). The Board will be funded out of the Medicare trust funds, with 60% from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and 40% from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. The Chief Actuary determines if projected per capita Medicare expenditures will exceed target levels, initiating a three-year sequence of events. Key calculations will be made starting in 2013, with an illustrative example provided. The Chief Actuary determines if projected per capita Medicare expenditures will exceed target levels, starting a three-year sequence of events. Key calculations are made based on a five-year analysis period, with the determination year (DY) as the midpoint. This includes calculating the Medicare per capita growth rate and target growth rate. The Chief Actuary calculates Medicare spending growth rates based on a five-year analysis period. Starting in 2018, the growth rate will be tied to the economy's growth. Prior to 2018, the growth rate is determined by averaging the Consumer Price Index for all items and services with the Consumer Price Index for medical inflation. The Chief Actuary calculates Medicare spending growth rates based on a five-year analysis period. The average annualized rate of growth is determined by using the simple average for each year. If the growth rate exceeds the target growth rate, adjustments are made to constrain future increases in Medicare expenditures more closely to the rate of growth in the economy. The Chief Actuary establishes an applicable savings target for the upcoming year if the growth rate exceeds the target rate. The savings target is calculated based on projected Medicare expenditures and a specified percentage, which is converted to a dollar amount for reducing Medicare program expenditures. For example, if the growth rate exceeds the target rate by 0.75% in a given year, recommendations must be made to reduce overall Medicare spending. The Chief Actuary sets a savings target for the next year if the growth rate surpasses the target rate. Recommendations to cut Medicare spending are required if the growth rate exceeds the target rate by 0.75%. In 2015, recommendations to reduce overall Medicare expenditures by 0.50% are needed. Alternatively, if the growth rate exceeds the target rate by 0.35%, recommendations to reduce expenditures by 0.35% are necessary. The calculations for these recommendations are based on projected Medicare expenditures and a specified percentage. The Chief Actuary must calculate the growth rate in per capita Medicare spending and the target growth rate for the current year. Columns A, B, and C present annual percentage changes in CPI u and CPI m. Column D provides the annual average percentage change in CPI u and CPI m. These calculations are made for an upcoming year to determine if recommendations to cut Medicare spending are necessary. The Chief Actuary calculates the growth rate in per capita Medicare spending for the upcoming year. If the growth rate exceeds the target rate, an applicable savings target is established based on projected data. In a hypothetical example, a savings target of $3 billion was determined. The Chief Actuary calculated the applicable savings target based on the growth rate in per capita Medicare spending. Historic data was used to understand the impact on Medicare spending. Actual Medicare cost growth per beneficiary was below the target level in only four of the last 25 years. The assumption of no other changes may not be realistic as it ignores the impact of other factors. The Chief Actuary calculates savings targets based on Medicare spending growth rates. If the growth rate exceeds the target, the Board must propose ways to reduce it. The proposal process involves submitting drafts for review and transmission to Congress and the President by January 15 of each year. If the Board fails to submit a proposal by this date, the Secretary must provide comments to Congress. The Secretary must develop and transmit a proposal to Congress and the President by January 25 of each year, as required by PPACA. The proposal should focus on reducing Medicare program expenditures without affecting care quality or increasing costs for beneficiaries. MedPAC's role after receiving the proposal is not specified. The recommendations aim to reduce Medicare payments under parts C and D by cutting direct subsidy payments to Medicare Advantage and prescription drug plans for administrative expenses, denying high bids for drug coverage, and reducing payments to Medicare Advantage plans for administrative expenses and performance bonuses. The proposals should help lower national health expenditures if growth exceeds the Medicare per capita growth rate. The Board's proposals aim to reduce national health expenditures while maintaining Medicare beneficiary access to quality care. The Board can request official data, hold hearings, and develop proposals that prioritize extending Medicare solvency, improving the healthcare delivery system, and protecting beneficiaries' access to necessary services. Board proposals require a majority vote of appointed members. The Board's proposals aim to reduce national health expenditures while maintaining Medicare beneficiary access to quality care. Proposals must target reductions in Medicare program spending, consider effects on beneficiaries, and promote efficient, high-quality care delivery. A proposal must include recommendations, explanations, and actuarial certification for net reduction in total Medicare program spending. The Chief Actuary's certification restricts the Board from making recommendations that may initially reduce spending but lead to increased spending over a 10-year period. Recommendations may focus on reducing payments to Part C and Part D plans, changing payment rates for services, and making adjustments to promote efficiency in Medicare spending. After 2018, if the Chief Actuary projects that national health expenditures growth exceeds Medicare growth, the Board's proposals must aim to reduce growth while maintaining quality care access. The Board may not need to submit a proposal if growth rates meet certain criteria. The Board is responsible for developing proposals to reduce Medicare spending growth, along with advisory reports and recommendations to slow national health expenditure growth. The Government Accountability Office will review the Board's initial recommendations and report to Congress by July 1, 2015. Starting January 15, 2014, the Board can submit advisory reports to Congress on related matters. The Board may develop and submit advisory reports to Congress on Medicare program matters, including recommendations for payment system improvements for providers and suppliers. An annual public report will include standardized health care information for comparison by region, services, providers, and payers. The Board will submit recommendations to Congress and the President every two years to slow the growth in national health expenditures while maintaining quality of care. These recommendations can include actions for federal agencies, legislation by Congress, state or local governments, or voluntary measures by the private sector. The Consumer Advisory Council, appointed by the Comptroller General, will advise the Board on healthcare policies. The Council will meet twice a year in Washington, DC. GAO is required to submit a report to Congress by July 1, 2015, analyzing the effects of Board recommendations on Medicare policies. The Board's recommendations impact access, affordability, and quality of care in the healthcare system. The Secretary must implement the proposals unless Congress acts to amend or block them within a specified time frame. PPACA requires the Board to submit proposals to Congress and the President, accompanied by implementing legislation. The Secretary must automatically implement the proposals unless legislation supersedes them before August 15 of the submission year. Legislation supersedes Board recommendations in the proposal submitted under the Social Security Act. Special \"fast track\" procedures ensure prompt congressional action on implementing legislation. The legislation introduced in Congress establishes strict deadlines and limits on amending the IPAB-implementing legislation. Congress can only amend the legislation to achieve the same level of targeted reductions in Medicare spending growth as the IPAB plan. The act also prohibits Congress from changing the IPAB fiscal targets in any other legislation and requires a super-majority vote in the Senate to waive this requirement. Additionally, \"fast track\" procedures are in place for timely consideration of a joint resolution discontinuing the automatic IPAB implementation process, which also requires a super-majority vote of both chambers. The House of Representatives adopted H.Res. 5 for the 113th Congress, which included a provision to eliminate restrictions on the House's ability to consider recommendations from the Independent Payment Advisory Board. This provision was part of the legislation aimed at establishing deadlines and limits on amending the IPAB-implementing legislation, with strict requirements for achieving targeted reductions in Medicare spending growth. The House of Representatives adopted H.Res. 5 for the 113th Congress, removing restrictions on considering recommendations from the Independent Payment Advisory Board. \"Fast track\" procedures are not in force in the House, but still apply in the Senate. IPAB legislation must be introduced promptly by majority leaders or designees, with a five-day deadline for introduction if leaders fail to act. After the proposal's submission, any Member may introduce the bill in their respective chamber. In the House, the bill is referred to House Committees on Energy and Commerce and on Ways and Means, while in the Senate, it goes to the Committee on Finance. The three committees may report the bill with committee amendments related to the Medicare program by April 1. The Senate's Rule XV does not apply to the IPAB legislation, allowing the Committee on Finance to include relevant matter in their amendments to the bill. The special parliamentary procedures established by the act aim to prevent Congress from considering any legislation that would repeal or change the recommendations of the IPAB if it does not achieve the same Medicare spending reductions. The act establishes procedural rules for congressional consideration of legislation related to the IPAB's recommendations, requiring fiscal targets to be met. It includes special parliamentary procedures that limit congressional action and can only be waived by a three-fifths vote in the Senate. The act establishes special procedures for Senate consideration of an IPAB-implementing bill, limiting debate to 30 hours and allowing for a motion to further limit debate. This deviates from Senate practice where debate is typically only limited by unanimous consent or cloture. Under the special procedures of the Senate, debate on amendments to the implementing bill is limited to one hour, with amendments being required to be germane. Second-degree amendments, debatable motions, and appeals are limited to 30 minutes each. Party leaders can allocate time during the 30-hour cap for debate on any amendment, motion, or appeal. Amendments must be germane, and any non-germane amendments are not considered under the act. The act prohibits amendments that would reduce Medicare spending below the savings target without a three-fifths Senate vote. After 30 hours of debate, the Senate votes on amendments and the bill itself. The act does not provide fast-track procedures for IPAB bills in the House. The U.S. House of Representatives may consider an IPAB-implementing bill under its usual procedures, potentially using special rules from the House Committee on Rules. The bill's parliamentary procedures aim to facilitate the exchange of legislation between the House and Senate, with limitations to prevent misuse of expedited Senate procedures. The act aims to prevent misuse of expedited Senate procedures by establishing \"hookup\" procedures to ensure both chambers act on the same measure. Special parliamentary procedures are also established for expedited consideration of conference reports or amendments between the chambers. The act establishes expedited procedures for resolving differences on an IPAB-implementing bill, limiting consideration to 10 hours in each chamber. Debate on amendments is limited to one hour, and on second-degree amendments, motions, and appeals to 30 minutes each. If the President vetoes the bill, debate on the veto message in the Senate is limited to one hour. The House of Representatives does not have a similar provision for veto messages as the Senate, which is limited to one hour. Section 3403 of P.L. 111-148 establishes a \"fast track\" mechanism for legislation discontinuing the automatic implementation process for the recommendations of the Independent Payment Advisory Board. To qualify for consideration under these procedures, a joint resolution must be introduced by February 1, 2017, without a preamble, and titled \"Joint resolution approving the discontinuation of the process for consideration and automatic implementation of the annual proposal of the Independent Medicare Advisory Board.\" The proposal seeks Congress approval to discontinue the automatic implementation process of the Independent Medicare Advisory Board's annual proposal under the Social Security Act. It allows for a joint resolution to be introduced by any Member in either chamber, with specific referral procedures to committees for consideration. In the Senate, if the Committee on Finance does not report the joint resolution within 20 days, it can be discharged upon petition by 30 Senators. The Senate committee can mark up and report a joint resolution introduced by any Member, with specific referral procedures. If the Committee on Finance does not report the resolution within 20 days, it can be discharged upon petition by 30 Senators. A non-debatable motion to proceed to its consideration can be made at any time after it is placed on the Senate's Calendar of Business. Points of order against the resolution are waived, and if the motion to proceed is agreed upon, the resolution remains the unfinished business of the Senate until disposed of. The Senate must resolve a joint resolution discontinuing the automatic IPAB process, with debate limited to 10 hours and a supermajority vote required for passage. No amendments or motions are allowed, and special parliamentary procedures do not apply to initial floor consideration. The House of Representatives follows special procedures for initial floor consideration of a joint resolution discontinuing the IPAB-implementing process. Passage requires a three-fifths super-majority vote, and \"hookup\" procedures are in place for consideration of resolutions passed by the other chamber. The joint resolution discontinuing the IPAB-implementing process in the House of Representatives requires a three-fifths super-majority vote. The resolution will not be referred to committee but will become the one on which the receiving chamber takes its final vote. Both the implementing bill and the joint resolution must be signed by the President or enacted over his veto to become law. If vetoed, a super-majority vote of two-thirds in both chambers is needed to override the veto. The procedures in the act aim to favor the continuation of the IPAB even in the face of opposition in Congress, shifting power balance to the executive. The disapproval mechanisms in the act shift power balance to the executive branch from Congress. The \"fast track\" procedures for IPAB legislation can be changed by Congress through unanimous consent, suspension of rules, or special rule adoption. The act attempts to entrench the procedures by requiring a super majority to amend them. The act aims to entrench procedures by requiring a super majority to amend them and restricts future Congresses from enacting certain policy changes related to Medicare. Questions arise on how these provisions will be enforced and how one Congress can regulate the actions of a future Congress. Under a special rule, the House of Representatives may consider IPAB-implementing legislation or bills related to Medicare spending rates. Special rules establish unique terms for legislation consideration and waive points of order. It is uncertain if there will be a parliamentary opportunity to challenge future bills violating the act's provisions. A \"rider\" could potentially halt the automatic IPAB process. The House of Representatives may consider IPAB-implementing legislation or Medicare spending rate bills under a special rule, which waives points of order. Questions about enforcement of the act's provisions exist in the Senate, where fast track procedures have traditionally been more binding. Changing statutory procedures in the Senate is challenging as unanimous consent or a super majority vote is required to amend rules. The act establishes wide-ranging procedures to regulate the consideration of legislation not meeting certain policy goals. The Senate may require additional clarification on how to interpret and apply these procedures. The Secretary implements the Board's proposals on August 15 of the PY, with exceptions for payment rate changes taking effect on October 1 of the PY. Medicare Parts C and D payment rate changes take effect on January 1 of the IY. Exceptions to implementing a Board proposal include federal legislation achieving the same spending reduction and not increasing spending over a ten-year period. Starting in IY 2020, the Secretary would not implement a Board proposal if a joint resolution was enacted to discontinue the Board before August 15, 2017. Additionally, if the Chief Actuary determines a projected growth rate in PY 2019, the Board's proposal may not be implemented. The Chief Actuary's determination of projected growth rates in national health expenditures compared to Medicare rates can impact the implementation of Board recommendations. The Secretary is directed not to implement recommendations if growth rates exceed Medicare rates, with exceptions and limitations outlined by statute. The Board composition includes members from various professions and backgrounds, with restrictions on direct involvement in Medicare delivery. The determination of a member's status in the provision of Medicare services is unclear, especially regarding retired executives from Medicare Advantage plans. The rationale for an independent board is to isolate health care payment decisions from special interests. The qualifications of Board members include nationally recognized expertise. The statute specifies qualifications for Board members, including nationally recognized expertise and representation from employers, third-party payers, and consumers. The legislation designates certain interests as worthy of representation, raising questions about potential conflicts of interest. Despite restrictions on outside business or employment, concerns remain about the representativeness of Board members. Recruiting highly qualified individuals for federal boards like IPAB may be challenging due to full-time commitment, modest salaries, constraints on members, and the potential for Congress to discontinue the Board. Funding constraints could limit the Board's ability to develop comprehensive payment recommendations. The Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) faces challenges in designing and testing new payment mechanisms due to funding constraints and limitations on its authority. However, it can collaborate with other entities like MedPAC and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to explore alternative payment models. Estimates suggest IPAB could generate cost savings of $15.5 billion to $24 billion through 2019. The Chief Actuary warns that achieving growth rate targets in IYs 2015-2019 may be a \"difficult challenge\" given historic growth in per capita Medicare expenditures. Total Medicare expenditures for 2015-2019 are forecast to be $3.9 trillion, with $24 billion in savings attributed to IPAB, amounting to just over 0.6% of total program expenditures. Further Advisory Board recommendations for growth rate reductions may not be required after 2019 if other savings provisions continue. The projected savings from the Board's recommendations represent a reduction of $89.00 per year per Medicare beneficiary over the period 2015 through 2019. The Board must balance short-term savings with longer-term program and payment design issues. Changes to reduce costs may require several years before savings occur, so the Board may focus on immediate savings through changes in payments. Working with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to design and test demonstrations may aid in longer-term initiatives. The Board is tasked with targeting reductions in Medicare program spending to sources of excess growth. The exemptions given to certain providers and suppliers of services subject to reductions in excess of a reduction due to productivity mean that other providers will bear the brunt of any proposals. Exempt providers represented 37% of all Medicare benefit payments in 2009. Board proposals can only target the remaining set of Medicare providers and suppliers, potentially caused by increased payments. The Board's proposals, which can only relate to the Medicare program, may have a broader impact on the healthcare system. Recommendations to reduce Medicare payments could affect payment rates for other payers. Several bills in Congress aim to repeal or amend the PPACA, including provisions related to IPAB. For example, H.R. 452 seeks to repeal specific IPAB provisions. The Health Care Bureaucrats Elimination Act, introduced by Senator Cornyn, aims to repeal Sections 3403 and 10320 of PPACA. The Simpson-Bowles Deficit Commission proposed recommendations 3.5 and 3.6 regarding IPAB, suggesting changes to provider payments and limiting federal health care spending growth. Several bills in Congress seek to repeal or amend PPACA provisions related to IPAB. The CBO revised its estimate of savings from IPAB, suggesting the need for intervention to reduce Medicare spending. The estimated savings over the 2012-2021 period were $14 billion, but the rate of growth in Medicare spending per beneficiary is projected to remain below levels requiring IPAB intervention. The CBO revised its estimate of savings from IPAB, indicating the need for intervention to reduce Medicare spending. President Obama proposed strengthening an independent commission to control unnecessary spending while protecting seniors' access to services. The current forecast suggests IPAB will not generate savings through 2021. The White House proposed modifying the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) to target Medicare cost growth to GDP per capita plus 0.5% starting in 2018. The President's FY2013 budget includes strengthening the IPAB with additional tools and lowering the target growth rate. H.R. 452, introduced in 2011, aims to repeal the IPAB. H.R. 452, introduced in 2011, aimed to repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB). The bill was combined with the HEALTH Act of 2011 (H.R. 5) which imposed caps on damages in malpractice lawsuits. The House passed the combined version of H.R. 5 on March 22, 2012. PPACA Section 3401 changed market basket updates for Medicare payments, incorporating productivity improvements. Section 3403(c)(2)(iii) prohibits further payment rate reductions for providers already facing reductions. Providers subject to productivity adjustments are listed in Table C-1. In rate year 2012, payments to long term care hospitals will be adjusted by changes in costs, changes in productivity in the broader economy, and then reduced by an additional 0.10 percentage point. Providers subject to this additional reduction in payments will receive a time-limited exemption from Board recommendations. In determining exemptions for providers from Board recommendations, the key factor is whether there was a reduction exceeding productivity in the relevant year. Approximately 37% of Medicare benefit payments in 2009 went to exempt providers. Proposals from the Board in 2018 could include provisions for the Secretary to implement. By 2020, all exemptions for providers from Board recommendations will have lapsed, potentially subjecting all providers of services and supplies to Board recommendations starting August 15, 2019."
