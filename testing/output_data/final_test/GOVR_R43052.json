    "content": "The global landscape for foreign direct investment (FDI) is evolving with increased investment flows and economic integration. Despite a dip during the 2008 financial crisis, FDI levels have rebounded and surpassed pre-crisis levels in 2011. The distinction between advanced and developing countries as sources and hosts for FDI is becoming less clear. The United States aims to promote investment by reducing restrictions and protecting investors while balancing other policy interests. The United States advances its investment policy through bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and free trade agreements (FTAs) to provide non-discriminatory treatment to private investment and promote market-oriented policies. Congress plays a role in shaping U.S. investment policy by setting trade policy negotiating objectives. U.S. BITs require two-thirds of Congress's advice and consent. This report provides an overview of U.S. international investment agreements, focusing on BITs and investment chapters in FTAs. It discusses key trends in investment flows, governance structures, goals of investment provisions, outcomes of the Model BIT review, and policy issues for Congress. Unlike international trade, there is no comprehensive agreement on investment promotion and protection rules. Efforts have been made through international organizations to develop investment rules, with the last major effort being the Multilateral Agreement on Investment proposed by the OECD in the 1990s. However, the negotiations were abandoned due to policy disagreements. Despite no comprehensive multilateral investment agreement being negotiated, there are limited scope agreements such as the Energy Charter Treaty. The World Trade Organization (WTO) addresses investment issues through various agreements, including the Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMS) Agreement, the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM), and the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA). Some WTO members wanted to include investment in the Doha Round of trade negotiations in 2001. The 2001 WTO Doha Declaration directed the WTO Working Group on the Relationship between Trade and Investment to focus on investment issues. However, opposition led to their omission from the WTO agenda in 2003. Investment is governed by bilateral and regional treaties, such as BITS and investment chapters in FTAs. Investment chapters in FTAs and BITs are key sources of international investment law, promoting and protecting global investment flows. These agreements establish basic protections for investors, including national treatment, most-favored nation treatment, profit transfer rights, prohibition on performance requirements, and compensation for expropriation. Advanced economies sign BITs primarily for investment purposes. Developing countries sign BITs primarily to promote inward FDI and protect foreign property rights. Concerns arise that weak domestic institutions may lead to changes in terms post-investment, such as expropriation. BITs can either improve or reduce the quality of local institutions, serving as a model for governance. After World War II, foreign investors sought protection under international investment law due to the lack of a comprehensive agreement. European countries began negotiating investment treaties in the late 1950s to safeguard their global investments. Germany signed the first two BITs in 1959 with Pakistan and the Dominican Republic, while Switzerland signed an agreement with Tunisia in 1961. The International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) was created in 1966, allowing aggrieved investors to directly bring claims against foreign governments. European countries initiated BIT programs in the mid-1960s, followed by Asian nations in the 1970s and the United States in 1977. Central and Eastern European countries began signing BITs in the late 1980s and Latin American countries entered the arena in the 1990s, leading to slow growth of the BIT network over the first three decades. By the end of 2011, 2,833 BITs had been concluded worldwide, with the total exceeding 3,000 when including FTAs with investment provisions, economic partnership agreements, and regional agreements. The proliferation of BITs occurred rapidly from the late 1980s through the mid-1990s, driven by the embrace of \"Washington Consensus\" reforms by many developing countries. The total number of partnership agreements and regional agreements worldwide exceeds 3,000, driven by the rapid growth of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in recent decades. FDI more than tripled between 1995 and 2011, reaching $1.3 trillion in 2012. Despite a decline in 2012, FDI remains strong in developing economies, which have become increasingly attractive destinations for FDI. Developing countries received more FDI inflows than developed countries for the first time in 2010. In 2012, FDI flows to developing countries exceeded those to developed countries by $130 billion for the first time. The trend of declining outward FDI from advanced economies and increasing FDI from developing countries has been driven by the demand for natural resources in China and other emerging markets. Investor-state dispute resolution procedures are a core component of the international investment regime, with forums like ICSID and UNCITRAL being widely used for arbitration. The rise in investment flows over the past two decades has led to an increase in investment disputes, with the number of known treaty-based investment disputes filed under international arbitration reaching a peak of 47 in 2011. These disputes have expanded in scope to challenge policies such as environmental regulations, emergency economic measures, and cultural protection laws. In November 2011, Philip-Morris filed an investment treaty claim against Australia over the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act, which banned graphics on tobacco packaging. Australia's opposition to investor-state arbitration in the Trans-Pacific Partnership FTA stems from this case. In June 2012, Vattenfall filed a claim against Germany over the phase-out of nuclear power after the Fukushima disaster. Vattenfall, a Swedish energy company, is challenging new German environmental regulations, claiming they violate Germany's commitments under the Energy Charter Treaty. Repsol, a Spanish oil firm, filed a complaint against Argentina for expropriating its stake in YPF. The United States has faced numerous investment claims under NAFTA, winning all three cases decided by arbitration panels. One notable case involved Metalclad, a U.S. firm awarded $16.7 million after being denied a construction permit in Mexico. The United States and other countries have re-evaluated their investment programs following cases like Metalclad being awarded $16.7 million for denial of a construction permit in Mexico. The US established its BIT program in 1977, using a \"Model BIT\" to negotiate BITs and investment chapters of FTAs. The United States established its BIT program in 1977, with the first BIT signed in 1982 with Panama. The U.S. Model BIT has been revised multiple times, most recently in 2004 and 2012. U.S. BITs offer benefits such as national treatment, limits on expropriation, quick fund transfers, restrictions on performance requirements, and the right to international arbitration for investment disputes. The United States' BIT program includes an \"escape clause\" for national security concerns, allowing restrictions on information disclosure and necessary measures for peace or security. BITs were initially based on the NAFTA investment chapter, with key elements like national treatment and fair treatment. The 2004 Model BIT changes aimed to address U.S. concerns about broad protections for foreign investors under NAFTA, ensuring that foreign investors do not receive more favorable treatment than U.S. investors. Congress mandated negotiating objectives to clarify investment protection scope, aiming to reduce barriers to investment while maintaining equality between foreign and U.S. investors. The 2004 Model BIT aimed to address U.S. concerns about foreign investor protections under NAFTA, ensuring equality between foreign and U.S. investors. The agreement includes provisions for investor-state dispute settlement, transparency of national laws, and preambular language on environmental and labor standards. The U.S. business community opposed changes that might weaken investor protections, as highlighted in a report by the Department of State's Advisory Committee on International Economic Policy. The draft Model BIT introduced in November 2004 aimed to address U.S. concerns about foreign investor protections under NAFTA. The U.S. business community opposed changes that might weaken investor protections, while environmental NGOs and labor groups raised concerns about regulatory authority. The Obama Administration suspended ongoing BIT negotiations to review investor protections for U.S. and foreign investors. The 2012 Model BIT was reviewed by the Administration to ensure consistency with the public interest and economic agenda, addressing issues like the international financial crisis and state-owned enterprises. Input was received from Congress, U.S. stakeholders, and an ACIEP subcommittee, leading to similar conclusions as in 2004. The Obama Administration concluded its three-year review, upholding substantive investor protections. The 2012 Model BIT maintains investor protections from the 2004 version. Changes are modest but significant, addressing labor and environmental issues. It serves as a basis for BIT negotiations with China and other state-led economies, as well as for the Trans-Pacific Partnership and a potential FTA with the EU. The U.S. government rejected calls for exhausting domestic remedies before arbitration and replacing investor-state arbitration with state-state dispute resolution. The 2012 Model BIT clarifies obligations regarding state-owned enterprises. The 2012 Model BIT clarifies obligations regarding state-owned enterprises, including defining the standard for delegated governmental authority to SOEs. It also prohibits performance requirements related to technology and expands obligations on environment and labor standards. The 2012 Model BIT emphasizes the importance of enforcing domestic environment and labor laws to encourage investment, recognizing environmental laws and multilateral agreements, and enhancing consultation procedures on environmental and labor standards. It also clarifies financial services provisions, strengthens transparency obligations, and emphasizes the importance of standards in investment. The 2012 Model BIT focuses on investment standards, dispute resolution, and the possibility of a future multilateral appellate mechanism. Congressional and stakeholder reactions to the Model BIT have been mixed. Reactions to the 2012 Model BIT have been mixed, with debate over its balance between investor protection and regulatory authority. The changes in the U.S. Model BIT may impact BIT negotiations with China, India, Pakistan, and other major emerging economies like Brazil. Despite differences on issues like national treatment, the U.S. and emerging economies' interests in investment protection are aligning. The United States, a major source and destination for FDI, aims to maximize benefits by removing restrictions on foreign investment through BITs and FTAs. The United States has concluded 47 BITs since 1982, with 41 in force. Current U.S. BIT negotiations focus on rising economic powers like China, India, Pakistan, and Mauritius. The 2012 Model BIT is guiding these negotiations, addressing areas like SOEs and technology transfer. Revisions to the Model BIT, including SOEs, technology transfer, and transparency, are important for negotiations with emerging economies. The US is working on a regional investment treaty with the East African Community and may start new BIT negotiations with countries like Brazil and Cambodia. The US has signed 14 FTAs with 20 countries, most containing investment chapters with core investor protections. The US has signed 14 FTAs with 20 countries, most containing investment chapters with core investor protections. The most recent FTAs implemented have investment provisions comparable to benefits under BITs. The US does not have BITs with some current TPP participants. The United States does not have BITs with some current TPP participants like Brunei, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Vietnam. BIT negotiations with Vietnam may not continue due to their involvement in the TPP. Investment will be a key issue in negotiations for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the US and Europe. The US has also advanced investment protection through mechanisms other than BITs and FTAs. The United States and the European Union reaffirmed their commitment to open, transparent, and non-discriminatory investment policies in April 2012. This led to the development of transatlantic principles that formed the basis for U.S. bilateral agreements with Morocco and Jordan on investment principles. Congress actively participates in developing and implementing U.S. policy on direct investment, including setting investment negotiating objectives and ratifying BITs. Policy issues related to new bilateral investment treaties are being considered by Congress amidst ongoing efforts to negotiate investment agreements. The presence of investment agreements is debated for their impact on facilitating investment abroad. Factors influencing a company's decision include market size, labor force, natural resources, exchange rates, taxes, trade protection, rule of law, political stability, infrastructure, and business facilitation measures. Studies on Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) show mixed results on their effect on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows. Some research suggests that signing and ratifying a BIT could increase investment under certain conditions. The presence of BIT or FTA provisions on investment may positively impact the investment climate, providing necessary protections for conducting business in foreign markets. FDI is crucial for developing countries, fostering rule of law, reducing corruption, and promoting respect for private property. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of U.S. investment negotiations in advancing trade, foreign policy, and development objectives. Congress plays a key role in prioritizing countries and policy objectives in these negotiations through legislation and oversight. One area of focus is prioritizing certain objectives in legislation to renew TPA and through oversight of current free trade negotiations like TPP. The current focus is on prioritizing countries in BIT negotiations, such as India and China, to benefit U.S. investors. Another area of interest is launching investment negotiations with new trading partners like Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East and North Africa to expand economic relations and potentially pave the way for bilateral or regional FTAs. In the MENA region, U.S. policymakers are supporting democratic transitions and economic development through BITs. This could lead to future FTAs. In Latin America, increased hostility towards foreign investment and state-led intervention pose challenges for U.S. investors. The withdrawal of countries like Argentina, Ecuador, and Venezuela from ICSID may challenge U.S. investors in the region. Brazil, the largest economy in the region, has not signed any investment treaties, which could be a focus for the United States. There is also a possibility of renegotiating existing U.S. BITs with countries like Egypt and Tunisia. The 2004 and 2012 U.S. model BIT templates have been revised in response to changes in the global investment landscape. The U.S. BIT with Egypt excludes many services from \"covered investments.\" Congress could examine the criteria for selecting countries to negotiate BITs with and identify negotiation priorities based on economic benefit, willingness to negotiate, feasibility, and foreign policy benefits. High-standard investment agreements with certain countries may be challenging to conclude. Negotiating high-standard investment agreements with certain countries may be difficult due to differing views on labor and environmental protections. Future considerations include negotiating a comprehensive multilateral framework on investment at the WTO or establishing an appellate body for investor-state arbitration."
