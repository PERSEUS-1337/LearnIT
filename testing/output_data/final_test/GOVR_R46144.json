    "content": "The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) (H.R. 2500, S. 1790, P.L. 116-92) authorizes funding for Department of Defense activities and reflects congressional sentiment on defense programs. It covers military compensation, DOD acquisition process, and policy towards other countries. The Trump Administration requested $761.8 billion for National Defense-related purposes. The Trump Administration requested $761.8 billion for National Defense-related activities in FY2020, with $750.0 billion being discretionary spending. Approximately $741.9 billion falls within the scope of the annual NDAA, including $718.4 billion for DOD operations and $23.2 billion for defense-related work by the Energy Department involving nuclear energy. Funding for defense-related activities like counter-intelligence work of the FBI falls under other congressional committees. The FY2020 NDAA authorizes $729.9 billion for national defense activities, $12.0 billion less than requested. $568.1 billion is for base budget funds, while $173.8 billion is for Overseas Contingency Operations. OCO funds are exempt from defense spending caps. The FY2020 NDAA authorized $729.9 billion for national defense activities, with $568.1 billion for base budget funds. The House and Senate passed their versions of the bill, which were later combined into a conference report agreed upon by both chambers. The FY2020 budget request for DOD reflects a strategic shift towards countering threats from China and Russia, marking a departure from past national security policies focused on regional aggressors. This change aligns with the 2018 National Defense Strategy's emphasis on competition between nuclear-armed superpowers. The FY2020 DOD budget reflects a strategic shift towards countering threats from China and Russia, moving away from past policies focused on regional aggressors like Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. The 2018 National Defense Strategy emphasizes competition between nuclear-armed superpowers, with concerns raised by events such as the Russian invasion of Crimea and China's militarization of the South China Sea. The U.S. national security agenda is focused on dealing with great powers like China and Russia, who are willing to use military force to achieve their objectives. Challenges from the end of the Cold War, such as fragile states, terrorism, and nuclear proliferation, continue to pose serious threats. Adversaries may collaborate to advance their agendas, using social and economic tools, non-state proxies, and blurring the lines between conventional and irregular conflict. This complex security environment presents new difficulties. The Trump Administration's national security strategy focuses on great power competition with China and Russia, aiming to bolster the competitive advantage of U.S. forces against these threats. The strategy acknowledges the erosion of U.S. forces' advantage in recent decades and emphasizes the need to counter the military capabilities of China and Russia. The Trump Administration's national security strategy prioritizes countering China and Russia as the main threats, shifting focus from countering violent extremist organizations. This new strategy, known as the \"2+3\" strategy, aims to address two primary challenges (China and Russia) and three additional challenges (North Korea, Iran, and terrorist groups). Since the end of U.S. military involvement in Vietnam, federal spending has increased significantly, with the fastest growing segment being mandatory spending for entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. The Budget Control Act of 2011 aimed to reduce spending by $2.1 trillion over a ten-year period, with annual caps on discretionary federal spending enforced through sequestration. The Budget Control Act of 2011 aimed to reduce discretionary spending to the BCA cap for defense-related activities, requiring DOD to cut planned spending by billions annually. Congress raised spending caps to mitigate impact, but the Trump Administration designated $97.9 billion as OCO funding in FY2020 to avoid breaking the defense cap. The FY2020 NDAA approved a modest increase in active-duty military personnel, following a trend of rising DOD funding since FY2016. This increase comes after the defense spending cap was raised by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019. The FY2020 NDAA authorizes an increase in active-duty military personnel and a reduction in the end-strength of the Selected Reserve. It also includes a 3.1% increase in military basic pay, in line with the Administration's request. The FY2020 NDAA included a 3.1% raise in military basic pay. Section 622 of the bill phased out the DIC offset for surviving spouses over three years. Critics call this offset the \"widows' tax.\" The FY2020 NDAA included a 3.1% raise in military basic pay and phased out the DIC offset for surviving spouses over three years. The enacted version of the bill does not challenge the Administration's policy on transgender individuals in the military, but requires DOD to report on denied waivers to the transgender ban. The House-passed version had provisions to nullify the transgender ban and extend legal protection against discrimination based on gender identity. Section 731 of the NDAA conference report authorizes the Secretary of Defense to pay claims for death or injury of servicemembers due to medical malpractice by DOD health care providers, addressing the Feres doctrine that limits liability for injuries during military service. The House version of the NDAA bill aimed to overturn the Feres doctrine by allowing servicemembers to pursue tort claims for medical malpractice in Military Treatment Facilities. The conference report supported the Trump Administration's budget request for nuclear and long-range strike weapons, including modernizing the nuclear triad. The report did not include provisions from the House bill limiting efforts to diversify the arsenal of nuclear weapons. The NDAA conference report authorizes $29.6 million for deploying low-yield nuclear warheads on Trident II submarine-launched missiles, with less explosive power than current warheads. The new warheads have a reported yield of about 10 kilotons, compared to the 100 kiloton yield of current warheads. $10 million is allocated for modifying existing warheads and $19.6 million for installation. The Trump Administration believes low-yield warheads will deter adversaries. The FY2020 NDAA authorizes funds for deploying low-yield nuclear warheads on Trident II submarine-launched missiles to deter adversaries. Critics argue that this could increase the risk of nuclear war by making it easier for U.S. officials to consider their use in a limited conflict. The House bill initially denied funds for the program but was later rejected in a near-party-line vote. The NDAA authorizes funding for the development of a new fleet of ICBMs to replace the current Minuteman missiles. This includes funds for the Ground Based Strategic Defense (GBSD) missile and a new warhead (W87-1). The bill prohibits any reduction in the number of deployed U.S. ICBMs. The Senate version would have authorized more funds for GBSD and prohibited any reduction in ICBMs. The House bill would have imposed a reduction in funding. The House bill proposed a $140.0 million reduction in R&D funding for a new ICBM, with cuts for GBSD and warhead development. An amendment to delay the GBSD program was rejected. The NDAA conference report authorizes $712.4 million for expanding plutonium pit manufacturing capacity, including construction of a new facility at the Savannah River Site. The House bill proposed a reduction in funding for a new ICBM and warhead development. An amendment to delay the GBSD program was rejected. The NDAA conference report authorizes funding for expanding plutonium pit manufacturing capacity at the Savannah River Site, in line with the Energy Department's goal to produce 80 pits per year by 2030. The report also supports the Administration's request to expand the U.S. arsenal of guided missiles for accurate strikes at long ranges. The FY2020 NDAA authorizes $14.1 billion for National Security Space operations, including funds for DOD's satellite acquisition and space launches. It establishes the U.S. Space Force as a separate armed service within the Department of the Air Force. The bill also authorizes funding for DOD's most expensive acquisition programs for space systems. The FY2020 NDAA authorizes $72.4 million for the new U.S. Space Force, headed by a Chief of Space Operations reporting directly to the Secretary of the Air Force. The Chief of Space Operations will join the Joint Chiefs of Staff after a year, providing advice to the President and Congress. Military personnel from the Air Force Space Command will be transferred to the new organization. The FY2020 NDAA authorizes funding for the new U.S. Space Force, transferring Air Force Space Command personnel. The House and Senate versions approved elements of the consolidation but differed on bureaucratic independence. The Senate bill allocated $72.4 million for a Space Force overseen by a civilian appointee, while the House bill designated a Space Corps with no civilian overseer. The enacted NDAA largely aligns with the Administration's anti-missile defense budget. The FY2020 NDAA authorizes funding for the new U.S. Space Force, transferring Air Force Space Command personnel. The enacted bill largely aligns with the Administration's anti-missile defense budget, reflecting the results of the Missile Defense Review. Delays in the development of the Redesigned Kill Vehicle led to differences with the budget request, resulting in the cancellation of the RKV project. The FY2020 NDAA authorized funding for the U.S. Space Force and reflected the results of the Missile Defense Review. The RKV project was cancelled, with $602.7 million allocated for missile defense improvements. $140.0 million was transferred to enhance the homeland defense system, and $173.4 million was authorized for a new radar in Hawaii. $53.8 million was allocated for testing the Navy's Standard missile against an ICBM. The Navy's Standard missile, part of the Aegis anti-missile system, was tested against an ICBM. New versions of the Standard could potentially intercept ICBMs. The FY2020 budget request for weapons acquisition by the Army aimed to address threats from Russia and China. The FY2020 FYDP would reduce spending on many systems compared to the FY2019 budget request. The FY2020 FYDP aims to reduce spending on current systems to fund development of successor weapons for \"peer competitors.\" The Army's modernization plan includes reconstituting short-range anti-aircraft defenses. The FY2020 NDAA largely supports the Army's revised spending plans for ground combat vehicles, anti-aircraft defenses, and long-range precision strike weapons. The DOD has shifted focus to short-range aerial threats like rockets, drones, and cruise missiles. The bill supports anti-aircraft defense systems like M-SHORAD and IFPC. The Navy's shipbuilding budget request for FY2020 aims to increase the fleet size to 355 ships. The enacted NDAA supports the Navy program, authorizing funding for two nuclear-powered aircraft carriers at $2.35 billion each. The FY2020 NDAA allows incremental funding for high-priced items like carriers, spreading costs across fiscal years. It aims to rein in spending on the Navy's plan for large unmanned surface ships and submarines. The budget includes $628.8 million for development, with $372.5 million for Large Unmanned Surface Vehicles (LUSVs) based on commercial designs. The FY2020 NDAA authorizes funding for Large Unmanned Surface Vehicles (LUSVs) based on commercial ship designs, capable of carrying various missiles. The budget allocates $196.5 million for the LUSV project, funding one of the two vessels requested. The rationale for the funding cut was not discussed in the conference report. The Senate Armed Services Committee questioned the Navy's plan to accelerate the development of new ships. The FY2020 budget request includes funding for 385 aircraft, an increase from previous projections. The enacted version of the bill authorizes the Administration's requests with minor changes. One major change is an increase in F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. The Trump Administration used various budget sources to construct a border barrier not explicitly authorized by Congress. The Trump Administration utilized budget transfer authorities to allocate $6.1 billion for border barrier construction, with an additional $7.2 billion requested in the FY2020 budget. The FY2020 NDAA reduced the total DOD funding transfer amount to $5.5 billion and did not authorize any funds for the border barrier project. The House bill prohibited the use of defense funds for barrier construction between FY2015 and FY2020. PFAS are fluorinated compounds used in various applications, including AFFF. The FY2020 NDAA included provisions related to PFAS to address potential risks under existing laws or new authorities. The conference agreement includes PFAS provisions related to drinking water and agricultural water sources, reporting of releases on the Toxics Release Inventory, data calls and significant new use notices under the Toxic Substances Control Act, environmental remediation at military installations, DOD use and disposal of AFFF. It does not include provisions regarding PFAS standards under the Clean Water Act or Safe Drinking Water Act, or liability for PFAS releases under CERCLA. The bill would have increased paid leave entitlement to 16 weeks for employees covered by FMLA and CAA, including situations like serious health conditions, family-related needs, and military family needs. Conforming amendments would extend benefits to GAO and certain TSA employees. The enacted bill provides federal employees with 12 weeks of paid parental leave for birth, adoption, or fostering of a child. Eligibility requirements differ for federal civil service employees compared to Legislative Branch employees. Employees must agree to return to work for 12 weeks after the leave, or the agency may recoup health care premium contributions. The employing agency may recoup its contributions to the employee's health care premiums made during the period of leave. No such requirement is provided for Legislative Branch employees covered by the CAA nor for GAO employees.
