    "title": "AB 2147",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 22659.7 of the Vehicle Code allows for the seizure and impoundment of a motor vehicle for up to 30 days if it is used in the commission of buying sexual services, by a person with a prior conviction for the same offense within the past three years. The vehicle can only be impounded if the driver is arrested for the offense. Within two working days of impoundment, the impounding agency must notify the legal owner of the vehicle by certified mail, including information on a poststorage hearing. The agency cannot charge for more than five days' storage if the owner is not notified promptly. A published telephone number must be available for information on impoundment rights. The agency providing the notice must include their contact information, the vehicle's location and description, the reason for removal, and instructions for requesting a poststorage hearing within 10 days. The hearing must be held within 48 hours of the request by a different officer than the one who seized the vehicle. Failure to request or attend a scheduled poststorage hearing satisfies the requirement. The agency responsible for directing the vehicle's storage covers towing and storage costs if no reasonable grounds are established. The impoundment period includes any storage time. The vehicle can be released before the end of the impoundment period if the driver was arrested without probable cause or if the vehicle is stolen. The vehicle is stolen and subject to bailment, driven by an unlicensed driver. The driver is not the sole registered owner and the vehicle can be released to another owner who agrees not to let the driver use it. The registered owner was not present during the violation or unaware of the driver's activities. If a spouse, registered domestic partner, or affected third party objects to vehicle impoundment due to hardship as the vehicle is the only one in the household, the hearing officer may release it. If a vehicle is released early due to an arrest without probable cause, neither the arrested person nor the owner is responsible for towing and storage charges. The registered owner or their agent is responsible for towing and storage charges for impounded vehicles, except in certain cases. A vehicle can be released early if the legal owner, such as a financial institution, pays all related fees. No lien sale processing fees will be charged to the legal owner who redeems the vehicle before the 15th day of impoundment. Administrative charges will not be collected from the legal owner unless a poststorage hearing is requested voluntarily. A storage facility must accept payment by valid bank credit card, debit card, or cash from the legal owner or their agent claiming a vehicle. The person in charge who violates this rule may be liable for four times the fees, up to $500, to the owner or fee payer. A storage facility must have sufficient funds on-site during business hours for monetary transactions. Credit charges for towing and storage services must comply with the Civil Code. Failure to comply with these conditions does not affect the legal owner's right to retrieve the vehicle if all requirements are met. The legal owner or their agent must provide specific documents and identification to retrieve a vehicle from law enforcement or impounding agencies. The documents can be originals, photocopies, or electronic copies. The legal owner or their agent may need to provide a photocopy or facsimile copy of their repossession agency license or registration when retrieving a vehicle from law enforcement or impounding agencies. Administrative costs for vehicle redemption are not charged to the legal owner unless they request a poststorage hearing. Legal owners cannot be required to request a hearing for vehicle release. Only specified documents are required for release, and the legal owner must be given copies to sign. The legal owner or their agent may photocopy and retain documents presented for vehicle release. The legal owner is responsible for any claims or damages after the vehicle is released from the storage facility. A legal owner or their agent can release a vehicle without requesting a poststorage hearing. The vehicle cannot be released to the registered owner until after the impoundment period, and the legal owner may require payment of towing and storage charges before relinquishing the vehicle. A vehicle seized under this section can be released to a rental car agency before the end of the impoundment period if the agency is the legal or registered owner and pays all related fees. The rental agency can then rent out the vehicle and may require the renter to cover towing and storage charges."
