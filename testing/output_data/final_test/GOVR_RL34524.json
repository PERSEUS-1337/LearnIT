This process can impact how imported products are treated under U.S. trade programs and policies, such as restrictions on imports from countries like Cuba, Iran, and North Korea. U.S. trade policy also aims to support economic growth in developing countries through trade preference programs like the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) are trade preference programs that require accurate country of origin determinations for preferential tariff treatment. Globalized manufacturing complexities, such as intricate value chains and fast movement of goods, can make Rules of Origin (ROO) implementation challenging and potentially misleading. The report provides an overview of the U.S. ROO system, discussing its advantages, disadvantages, and policy options for Congress. Rules of Origin (ROO) determine the country of origin of imported products, with two types: Non-preferential ROO for goods from MFN countries and preferential ROO for trade preference programs like GSP and AGOA. The U.S. ROO system determines the origin of imported goods for government procurement and trade sanctions. Preferential ROO are used to assess eligibility for duty-free benefits under trade preference programs. U.S. laws align with WTO rules on ROO application. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection relies on court decisions and regulations to determine the country of origin for imported products. The importer of record is responsible for complying with customs laws and regulations, including understanding preferential rules of origin schemes. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection relies on court decisions and regulations to determine the country of origin for imported products. Importers must properly classify merchandise to assess duties and meet legal requirements. Advance ROO rulings can be sought to expedite the import process. Non-preferential rules of origin are crucial for various trade-related measures and enforcement actions. Under non-preferential rules of origin, goods are attributed to a country based on the wholly obtained principle or substantial transformation. The origin is determined by the last place of substantial transformation, considering factors like character, name, and manufacturing process. CBP considers these factors when making origin rulings, which can be complex. The article discusses the importance of determining the origin of products based on the manufacturing process and value added, highlighting the subjective nature of these determinations. Participating countries in the Uruguay Round of trade talks aimed for objective, understandable, and transparent rules of origin. The WTO Agreement on Rules of Origin emphasizes the need for objective, predictable, and transparent rules. Members agreed not to use rules for trade policy objectives that disrupt trade, but each member can determine its own regime. All members must notify others about preferential rules. The Harmonization Work Program aims to develop uniform non-preferential rules for all members. Negotiations for harmonized rules of origin began in 1998 and a general agreement was reached in 1999. The Trade Act of 2002 aimed for a WTO agreement on harmonized rules of origin, but negotiations have been complex. The WTO Committee on Rules of Origin and the World Customs Organization Technical Committee on Rules of Origin are involved in ongoing negotiations. CBP has proposed simplifications since 1991. CBP has proposed simplifications to standardize non-preferential rules of origin since 1991, aiming to expand regulations like the NAFTA Marking Rules. Experience with implementing these rules has shown that codified rules lead to more objective and predictable determinations. CBP proposed extending standardized rules of origin to all trade to increase objectivity and predictability in determinations. The public response to the proposal was largely negative, with many opposing it due to concerns about its potential impact. Some opposed a proposed rule due to increased costs, burdens on small businesses, and complexity in importing. Industry organizations questioned the effectiveness of a tariff shift method. CBP issued a final rule in September 2011 applying NAFTA marking rules to certain products. CBP officials announced changes to non-preferential rules of origin for various products, including pipe fittings, flanges, greeting cards, glass optical fiber, rice preparations, and textile and apparel products. They did not finalize proposed amendments for establishing uniform rules on determining the country of origin of imported merchandise. Preferential rules of origin are crucial for verifying eligibility for duty-free status under U.S. trade preference programs and free trade agreements. Rules of origin specific to trade preference programs or free trade agreements determine the eligibility of goods for benefits. Most U.S. FTAs use methods like tariff shift to establish origin. The NAFTA agreement utilizes this methodology. The \"yarn forward\" principle is a tariff shift test used in FTAs for textile and apparel products to determine origin. Specific rules of origin for products are detailed in an annex to the FTA, listing goods by HTS tariff lines. Technical tests may be used to verify origin. In FTAs, technical tests like critical process criteria or local content tests are used to determine origin for products listed by HTS tariff lines. These tests require specific processing operations to occur in the originating country to confer origin status. For example, in the U.S.-South Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS), certain chemicals must undergo manufacturing processes like purification, chemical reaction, or controlled mixing in one or both FTA parties to qualify as originating. In FTAs, local content requirements vary among U.S. free trade agreements and product categories. For example, under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), the materials and processing operations from the beneficiary country must make up at least 35% of the product's value to qualify for duty-free treatment. The ROO in regional FTAs require at least 35% of the appraised value of the product to be from the region. Cumulation allows combining inputs from multiple countries to qualify as an import. This stimulates regional integration through increased intra-regional trade. Different methods are used to calculate regional value content (RVC) in U.S. FTAs, especially for products like autos and auto parts. Manufacturers and importers may have multiple options for calculating RVC to benefit them. Three common types of RVC calculations are: Build-down method subtracts the value of non-originating merchandise from the adjusted value of the finished product. Build-up method adds the value of all regional inputs. Net cost method is another option for calculating RVC. The net cost method for calculating RVC captures only manufacturing costs, excluding other expenses like sales promotion and royalties. Rules of origin frameworks play a central role in international trade, ensuring benefits of FTAs go to participating countries. Rules of origin (ROO) are crucial in trade agreements to prevent goods from non-eligible countries from benefiting from preferential tariffs. However, some argue that the proliferation of complex ROO frameworks in global trade agreements creates inefficiencies. Additionally, there are concerns that the current U.S. systems for determining country of origin may conflict with overall trade policy goals. Negotiating specific ROO can also allow countries to protect import-sensitive industries. Some experts argue that rules of origin (ROO) in trade agreements can be complex and subjective, leading to economic inefficiencies. The proliferation of bilateral and regional trade agreements with their own ROO schemes adds complexity for importers and manufacturers. Assembling the proper documentation for preferential ROO can be a costly and challenging process. Some in the business community argue that navigating complex rules of origin (ROO) in trade agreements can be costly and inefficient. The proliferation of free trade agreements (FTAs) has led to a \"spaghetti bowl\" approach to trade policy with varying ROO requirements. Concerns also exist about the lack of transparency and potential protectionism in preferential ROO. For example, the \"triple-transformation rule\" in NAFTA requires all stages of apparel production to occur within the FTA region. Despite criticisms, some believe FTAs offer importers flexibility in sourcing goods and benefit exporters. FTAs provide importers with flexibility in sourcing goods and exporters with access to foreign markets. Importers can choose between preferential or non-preferential rules of origin. They can weigh compliance costs and tariff rates to decide whether to import under the FTA or MFN status. Studies show that importers may opt for MFN tariff rates if they are more favorable than FTA rates. Importers may choose to import under the MFN rate to avoid compliance costs, but if the NAFTA rate is more favorable, they opt for NAFTA. Utilizing trade preferences under preferential rules of origin can be costly and complex, hindering their use. The challenges in constructing ROO in preferential trading relationships include balancing effectiveness and efficiency, and simplifying and making ROO more transparent. Critics argue that negotiating preferential ROO product by product and industry by industry is cumbersome. Some critics argue that industries can insulate themselves from the effects of free trade agreements (FTAs) by manipulating rules of origin (ROO), potentially reducing the trade liberalizing effects of the FTA. More restrictive ROO may be implemented to compensate domestic manufacturers impacted by FTAs. These measures can help soften opposition from import-competing groups and increase the political feasibility of FTA implementation. Studies suggest that stricter rules, like higher local content requirements, may encourage producers to shift to higher-cost suppliers within an FTA region to qualify for benefits. More restrictive rules of origin (ROO) within free trade agreements (FTAs) can protect regional suppliers and maintain existing barriers against outsiders. These requirements can incentivize FTA producers to source more inputs within the region, spreading benefits to manufacturers of intermediate products. For example, the U.S. automobile sector aimed for high ROO in NAFTA negotiations to deter European and Japanese competitors from setting up assembly plants in Canada or Mexico. GM, Ford, and Chrysler had differing preferences on the rule of origin in NAFTA negotiations. GM, due to its joint venture with Isuzu in Canada, favored a lower rule of origin at around 60 percent, while Ford and Chrysler preferred a higher rule at approximately 70 percent. Auto parts makers pushed for higher percentages to protect themselves from foreign competitors. Determining country of origin can be complex, especially under non-preferential origin rules, often requiring case-by-case assessments. Some importers criticized CBP for subjective determinations in these cases. In the United States, importers can request a binding ruling from CBP on rules of origin. CBP offers a Customs Rulings Online Search System for guidance. WTO members agreed to issue advance rulings on rules of origin in a timely manner for transparency. Increased transparency in rules of origin interpretation worldwide will benefit U.S. exporters. Rapid advancements in science and technology since World War II have transformed modern manufacturing, allowing for the production of higher quality products with less waste. The development of faster communication and transportation technology has made it possible to source components from multiple locations for final assembly, making the manufacturing process more complex. This globalized environment calls for consistent rules of origin interpretation to provide assurance for exporters worldwide. The manufacturing process has become more complex and intricate due to sourcing components from multiple nations for final assembly. This has led to the restructuring of manufacturing towards subcontracting and outsourcing production to globally-integrated contract manufacturers, creating global value chains. \"Full-package\" production companies in China and other countries integrate specialized producers worldwide to manufacture components and assemble final products. This modern manufacturing trend impacts international trade by blurring the \"nationality\" of retailers, producers, and assemblers. Countries now specialize in tasks within the value chain rather than specific product manufacturing, competing on economic roles rather than end-use goods production. The global value chains (GVCs) involve various industries like electronics, motor vehicles, agriculture, fashion, and services. An analysis of Apple's iPhone 4 production in China by Foxconn illustrates how products are made in the global manufacturing environment. The value-added in the attributed country of origin is often a small percentage of the total product value. Retailers may have limited knowledge of the product's origin. The product's factory gate price was $194.04, with value-added inputs from various countries including Korea, the United States, Germany, France, Japan, and China. Despite China's small contribution, the product is considered of Chinese origin due to being substantially transformed there. Global manufacturing complexities arise from differences in assembly points and components' origins. The complexities in determining the country of origin for import purposes can lead to inconsistencies. CBP officials may consider the assembly process as the \"last place of substantial transformation\" in some cases, while in others, they may find it insufficient. CBP has the flexibility to assess the processing in each country on a case-by-case basis, taking into account factors like product design, development, and inspection procedures. Rules of origin are crucial in trade policy, with preferential rules ensuring only qualified goods receive benefits under FTAs. Non-preferential rules are essential for assessing proper tariffs on goods from countries with MFN status. CBP has flexibility in determining country of origin based on factors like product design, development, and inspection procedures. CBP determines country of origin for imports based on regulatory precedents and importer input. Businesses criticize the process for lacking clarity and consistency, especially with preferential rules of origin becoming more important. FTAs and determining country of origin can be burdensome for importers, especially smaller firms. The United States is involved in ongoing negotiations for harmonization of rules of origin, which are complex and expected to continue. Congress could encourage leadership to reach a resolution. Some argue that preferential rules of origin are inefficient and lack transparency, but negotiators may make incremental changes. Since October 2009, NAFTA partners have made four sets of changes to the rules of origin, with the latest in January 2011 covering products exceeding $90 million in trilateral trade. Congress could push for liberalizing rules of origin to gain better market access. Globalization will likely complicate origin determinations, prompting the need for additional legislative guidance for CBP. Some trade policy analysts suggest providing CBP with more legislative guidance, particularly in non-preferential rules. The determination process involves examining the entire manufacturing process, including design, sources of components, labor costs, and assembly. There are calls for liberalizing or revising industry-specific rules of origin, while others propose abolishing them altogether due to inefficiencies and protectionist effects. Multilateral elimination of tariffs is also advocated to enhance the world trading system. Analysts argue for multilateral elimination of tariffs to eliminate the need for Rules of Origin (ROO). However, this would also end preference programs for developing countries and tariff benefits of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). Eliminating ROO entirely could create challenges for trade policy objectives such as trade statistics, country of origin labeling, trade sanctions, and enforcing trade remedies."
