    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Arctic Climate Preservation Act\" and includes findings related to the preservation of the Arctic climate. The Congress finds that black carbon is a significant contributor to Earth's climate warming, especially in the Arctic, where it accelerates melting by reducing surface reflectivity. Immediate policy action is crucial to mitigate its adverse effects. The United States has made progress in reducing black carbon pollution through clean air programs, but more efforts are needed globally to promote technological innovation and energy deployment. In countries with major black carbon pollution from industrial activities, agriculture, and residential cooking, reducing black carbon will have immediate public health benefits. While regulated under the Clean Air Act, black carbon is not explicitly regulated as a global warming agent by US law or international agreements. US foreign policies and assistance programs, along with multilateral lending organizations like the World Bank, need to prioritize innovation and energy technology deployment to address this issue. Multilateral lending organizations like the World Bank have the potential to reduce global black carbon pollution. Immediate action to protect the Arctic by reducing black carbon will help combat the threat of global warming. The purposes of this Act are to identify cost-effective ways to reduce black carbon pollution to combat global warming and protect the Arctic environment. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Administrator\" refers to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. \"Black carbon\" is the light-absorbing component of carbonaceous aerosols. \"Organic carbon\" is the non-light-absorbing components of carbonaceous aerosols. The term \"person\" includes individuals, corporations, partnerships, and government entities. The Administrator will conduct a study on black carbon and organic carbon emissions, in collaboration with various agencies. The study will include an inventory of major emission sources in the US and globally, estimating current and future emissions and their climate effects. The study on black carbon and organic carbon emissions will explore effective control technologies for reducing emissions from various sources, including on-road and off-road engines, residential cookstoves, forest burning, and agriculture-based burning. It will also consider metrics for quantifying the climate impacts of these emissions. The Administrator will submit a report to Congress within 180 days of the enactment of the Act, detailing the findings of a study on black carbon and organic carbon emissions. The study will assess control technologies for reducing emissions from various sources and explore metrics for quantifying their climate impacts. Recommendations will be provided on areas for additional research and actions the Federal Government could take to encourage emission reductions beyond those already identified. SEC. 6. The Administrator must propose and finalize regulations within specified timelines to reduce black carbon emissions, considering health, environmental impacts, and global warming effects. These regulations will be under the Clean Air Act. Within 9 months of enactment, the Secretary of State, along with other federal agencies, must report to Congress on US financial assistance to reduce black carbon pollution. The report will also highlight opportunities for promoting clean and efficient stoves in developing countries reliant on solid fuels for cooking and heating. The curr_chunk discusses measures to reduce black carbon pollution, including improving diesel engines, reducing biomass burning, and decreasing fossil fuel burning. SEC. 8. INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATIONS. It is the policy of the United States to engage in international agreements to accelerate reductions in black carbon emissions, protect the Arctic environment, and further the goals of the Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears. The United States aims to work with other countries to address the threat of global warming to polar bears, uphold human rights, collaborate on reducing black carbon pollution, and decrease shipping pollution through domestic and international efforts. The Secretary of State is required to report to Congress on progress by January 1, 2010. SEC. 9. EFFECT ON OTHER LAW.\n\nStates have the right to enforce stricter greenhouse gas emission standards than those required by this Act.\n\nSEC. 10. APPROPRIATIONS.\n\nFunding necessary for implementing this Act can be appropriated.\n\nSEC. 11. SEPARABILITY.\n\nIf any part of this Act is deemed invalid, it will not affect the rest of the Act."
