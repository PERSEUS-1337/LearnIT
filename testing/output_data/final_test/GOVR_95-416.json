    "content": "The federal estate, gift, and generation-skipping transfer taxes underwent changes in 2010 and 2012, with the top tax rate increasing from 35% to 40%. These taxes are unified with the same rate structure and share a lifetime transfer credit. The federal estate and gift taxes have a unified credit of $5,340,000 per individual for 2014. The tax laws are complex, focusing on IRC and IRS provisions for estate, gift, and generation-skipping transfer tax liability for US citizens and resident aliens. Nonresident aliens have different rules. The federal estate tax is levied on the estate of a decedent, while the inheritance tax is paid by the heirs. The federal estate tax is imposed on the estate of a decedent, while the inheritance tax is paid by the heirs based on the money or property they receive. The tax liability involves adjustments to the gross estate, deductions, and computation of the tax with allowable credits. The gross estate includes all property owned by the decedent. The gross estate of a decedent includes all property owned by the individual at the time of death, including interests in property transferred prior to death. Specific conditions under the IRC determine which types of property are included. Life insurance proceeds may be part of the gross estate if certain criteria are met, such as if the decedent had incidents of ownership in the policy. An incident of ownership includes economic rights like the ability to cancel the policy or change beneficiaries. The gross estate of a decedent includes all property owned at the time of death, including life insurance proceeds if certain criteria are met. The value of property owned jointly with a right of survivorship may also qualify as part of the gross estate. Contributions towards acquiring the property by someone other than the decedent can reduce its value in the gross estate. The decedent's gross estate includes property not owned on the date of death, such as lifetime gifts with retained interests or powers. Gifts taking effect at death are also included, except for property sold during the decedent's lifetime for full consideration. Additionally, property subject to a general power of appointment is part of the gross estate. A power of appointment is a right held by someone other than the property owner to determine who will benefit from the property. It is considered \"general\" if it can be exercised in favor of the holder, their estate, creditors, or the creditors of their estate. The property in the decedent's gross estate is valued at fair market value on the date of death or the alternate valuation date, chosen by the executor. The alternate valuation date is either the date of distribution or disposition of the property or six months after the date of death. The fair market value of property is the price at which it would change hands between a willing buyer and seller, without compulsion. IRS regulations outline valuation rules for different types of property. A decedent's taxable estate is determined by reducing the gross estate with allowable deductions. The estate is entitled to deductions for funeral expenses, administration expenses, claims against the estate, unpaid mortgages, casualty or theft losses, and property passing to the surviving spouse. Only non-terminable interests passing to the surviving spouse qualify for the marital deduction. The estate tax marital deduction allows for certain exceptions to the terminable interest rule, such as transfers in trust of a lifetime income interest and life estates with a general power of appointment. Charitable bequests and devises to qualified charitable organizations also qualify for deductions, functioning similarly to the estate tax charitable deduction. The estate tax charitable deduction functions similarly to its income tax counterpart, encouraging charitable contributions by reducing the gross estate. Computation of estate tax liability involves a combination of lifetime taxable gifts and taxable estate, with credits applied to determine the actual tax liability. The estate rate schedule includes three major estate tax credits: the unified transfer tax credit, credit for foreign death taxes, and credit for federal estate taxes. The unified transfer tax credit, credit for foreign death taxes, and credit for federal estate taxes are dollar-for-dollar offsets against an estate's federal estate tax liability. The applicable exclusion amount in 2014 is $5,340,000. Estates can also use credits for foreign death taxes paid on property included in the federal gross estate, limited to the amount of U.S. estate taxes paid on the same property. The previously taxed property (PTP) credit is a relief provided when an individual inherits property on which federal estate tax has already been paid. The credit is based on the value of the foreign taxed property in relation to the total U.S. taxable estate. It can be claimed for federal estate taxes paid on property transferred to the decedent within the past ten years, with the amount of credit graduated based on the time elapsed since the transfer. The maximum credit is 100% if the property was received within two years of death, and the minimum is 20%. The federal gift tax is imposed on gratuitous transfers of property made during life to prevent reducing estate tax liability at death. The donor's tax liability depends on the value of the taxable gift, which is determined by deductions and exclusions. The gift tax liability can be reduced by the unified transfer tax credit. The gift tax is divided into two components: the taxable gift and the computation of the gift tax. The gift tax liability is determined by the fair market value of the gift, with deductions and exclusions such as the annual per donee exclusion, gift tax marital deduction, and gift tax charitable deduction. The annual exclusion allows donors to exclude the first $14,000 of cash or property given to each donee annually. Unlimited exclusions are available for direct payments to educational institutions or medical providers. The present interest rule limits the annual exclusion for gifts of future interests. Complicated drafting techniques can be used to obtain the annual exclusion for gifts, including gift-splitting for married couples to double the exclusion. Deductions are available for interspousal gifts, but not for terminable interests. The gift tax liability is determined by the fair market value of the gift, with various exclusions and deductions in place. The marital deduction is not allowed for most gifts of terminable interests. Charitable gifts may be deducted if the charity meets certain criteria. Interspousal transfers of property in a divorce settlement may not be considered taxable gifts under certain conditions outlined in the IRC. The gift tax liability is determined by the value of the transferred property and follows progressive rates similar to the estate tax. A disclaimer before the donee benefits from the gift can nullify the tax liability. Taxable gifts are cumulatively taxed over the donor's lifetime, with the computation done in three steps each calendar year. The gift tax liability is calculated based on the value of transferred property using progressive rates. Taxable gifts are cumulatively taxed over the donor's lifetime in three steps each calendar year. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 replaced the original generation-skipping transfer tax with a simplified flat-rate tax to prevent loopholes in the estate and gift tax system. The traditional generation-skipping transfers involve trusts set up by parents for the benefit of their children, with the remainder passing to grandchildren. Properly drafted trusts can avoid estate or gift taxes when passing from children to grandchildren. The generation-skipping transfer tax is divided into two components: transfers and tax computation. The GST tax is a flat-rate tax set at 40%, applied to direct skips, taxable terminations, or distributions to skip persons. A transfer to a trust is considered a direct skip if all interests in the trust are held by skip persons. A taxable termination occurs through death, lapse of time, release of power, or other means in a trust. The GST tax calculation involves assigning individuals to specific generation levels as per the IRC guidelines. Family members related to the transferor or spouse are grouped into generations, determining their tax implications. The GST tax calculation involves assigning individuals to specific generation levels based on their relationship to the transferor or spouse. Lineal descendants and non-relatives are grouped into generations, with adjustments made for age differences and deceased parents. The taxable amount for direct skips is determined by the value of the property received by the transferee, with the GST tax being tax-exclusive. The GST tax calculation involves assigning individuals to specific generation levels based on their relationship to the transferor or spouse. The taxable amount for direct skips is determined by the value of the property received by the transferee, with the GST tax being tax-exclusive. The taxable amount for taxable terminations and distributions is tax-inclusive, calculated by including the tax value with the property value before applying the tax rate. The applicable rate for the GST tax is the maximum Federal estate tax rate (40% for 2014) multiplied by the inclusion ratio of the transfer. Exemptions and exclusions are provided by the IRC for the GST tax. The GST tax exempts certain transfers and provides a $5,340,000 exemption per individual for generation-skipping transfers. Married couples can double this exemption by electing to split transfers. Indirect skip property transfers trigger the exemption when the next generation receives benefits before passing to subsequent generations. Exclusions for tuition and medical expenses from the gift tax also apply to the GST tax. The $14,000 per donee annual exclusion from the gift tax is recognized for direct skips only. The GST tax exempts certain transfers and provides a $5,340,000 exemption per individual for generation-skipping transfers. Direct skips are taxed based on the type of transfer, with the tax liability falling on the transferee for taxable distributions, the trustee for taxable terminations or direct skips from a trust, and the transferor for direct skips not from a trust."
