    "content": "The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities, including in public accommodations like movie theaters. The Department of Justice has proposed rules for closed captioning and video description in movie theaters under Title III of the ADA. The court of appeals case addressed the ADA requirement for closed captioning and descriptive narration in movie theaters, unless it would be a fundamental alteration or an undue burden. Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination in public accommodations, including movie theaters, by providing equal services to individuals with disabilities. Public accommodations must ensure that individuals with disabilities are not excluded or denied services. The ADA requires that individuals with disabilities are not excluded or treated differently in public accommodations, such as movie theaters, without auxiliary aids and services. These aids include interpreters for hearing impairments and readers for visual impairments. Undue burden is defined as significant difficulty or expense in providing these aids. The ADA, enacted in 1990, did not specifically discuss closed captions but encouraged open captioned versions of films. The House Education and Labor Committee report emphasized that technological advances may change ADA requirements for providing auxiliary aids and services to individuals with disabilities. On July 26, 2010, the DOJ issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding movie captioning and video description under the ADA. The DOJ found that captioning and video description requirements align with the ADA's statutory language. Public comments were sought on new issues and technical questions, including the implications of digital cinema conversion for potential regulations. The DOJ issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on movie captioning and video description under the ADA, seeking public comments on various issues such as compliance schedules, calculation of captioned movies, open captioning options, digital cinema conversion, notification systems for individuals with disabilities, training requirements for theater personnel, and economic impact considerations. The Ninth Circuit in Arizona v. Harkins Amusement Enterprises addressed the ADA's requirements. The Ninth Circuit in Arizona v. Harkins Amusement Enterprises became the first court of appeals to address the ADA's requirements for closed captioning and video descriptions. The court held that these may be required by the ADA, subject to exceptions for fundamental alteration and undue burden. The case involved discrimination allegations by two patrons, one with a hearing impairment and one with impaired vision, against a theater for not providing captioning and descriptive narration. The court emphasized the ADA's requirement for auxiliary aids and services, stating that movie captioning and audio descriptions are clearly considered as such. The defendant's argument that these services fall outside the ADA's scope was rejected by the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit ruled that closed captioning and descriptive narration are required under the ADA as auxiliary aids and services, rejecting the defendant's argument that they were not covered. The court also noted that the defendant could raise defenses such as fundamental alteration or undue burden. The Ninth Circuit's decision on closed captioning and descriptive narration under the ADA provided impetus to DOJ's consideration of regulations in the area."
