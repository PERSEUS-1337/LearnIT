    "content": "Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in programs receiving federal financial assistance. The core requirement is that no qualified individual with a disability can be excluded from participation or denied benefits solely due to their disability. The act aims to empower individuals with disabilities to be independent and fully participate in society. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 aims to empower individuals with disabilities to fully participate in society by ensuring equal opportunity in employment, economic self-sufficiency, independence, and inclusion. To prove a violation of Section 504, a plaintiff must show program involvement with federal funds, disability within the Act's definition, qualification, and discrimination. Defendants can claim accommodating the disability would be an undue burden as a defense. In 1985, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Alexander v. Choate that denying qualified individuals with disabilities \"meaningful access\" to programs or benefits constitutes discrimination under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. This may require federal agencies or grantees to make reasonable accommodations, although the Court ruled against the plaintiffs in this case. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Alexander v. Choate that denying Medicaid recipients with disabilities meaningful access to Medicaid and hospital services does not violate Section 504. The Court emphasized that Section 504 does not require federal agencies and grantees to compromise program integrity for the sake of providing access to individuals with disabilities. The U.S. Supreme Court ruling in College v. Davis established that Section 504 does not mandate significant modifications for the handicapped, only reasonable ones. Department of Treasury regulations reflect this by stating compliance is not required if it results in fundamental alterations or undue burdens. A 1995 study found over 3.7 million Americans with low vision struggle to identify U.S. banknotes, hindering their participation in society. The American Council of the Blind sued the Secretary of the Treasury for violating the Rehabilitation Act by issuing banknotes not easily identifiable for visually impaired individuals. They sought relief to stop manufacturing notes over $1 in their current format and implement a corrective action plan. The American Council of the Blind sued the Treasury Department for not providing visually impaired individuals with meaningful access to U.S. currency. The district court ruled in favor of the Council, stating that the Treasury failed to show that accommodations couldn't be made without undue burden. The court did not order the Treasury Department to follow a specific plan to comply with the Rehabilitation Act. Instead, a status conference was ordered to discuss the appropriate remedy. The Department of Treasury appealed the ruling to the D.C. Court of Appeals, which accepted the appeal to review the case before injunctive relief was issued. The D.C. Circuit Court affirmed the district court's decision. The D.C. Circuit Court affirmed the district court's decision on the Department of Treasury discriminating against visually impaired individuals under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The focus was on whether visually impaired individuals are denied meaningful access to U.S. paper currency. The D.C. Circuit Court ruled against the Treasury Department, stating that visually impaired individuals are not denied meaningful access to U.S. currency solely based on their inability to identify paper money without assistance. This decision was made under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The D.C. Circuit Court ruled against the Treasury Department, stating that visually impaired individuals are denied meaningful access to U.S. currency if their access to banknotes is impeded. The court rejected the department's arguments that visually impaired individuals have meaningful access to cash transactions. The D.C. Circuit Court ruled against the Treasury Department, stating that visually impaired individuals are denied meaningful access to U.S. currency if their access to banknotes is impeded. The court disagreed with the department's arguments and found that dependence on third parties or expensive technological devices for identifying bills placed visually impaired individuals at a distinct disadvantage. The D.C. Circuit Court ruled that visually impaired individuals are denied meaningful access to U.S. currency due to obstacles in identifying banknotes, such as reliance on third parties or costly devices. The court rejected the argument that using credit cards or personal interpreters provided sufficient access, concluding that the Department of Treasury violated the nondiscrimination provision of the Rehabilitation Act. The D.C. Circuit Court ruled that the Treasury Department's noncompliance with the Rehabilitation Act was not justified by the argument of undue burden in accommodating visually impaired individuals in identifying banknotes. The court rejected the department's claim that the proposed accommodations would impose an undue burden, stating that each accommodation should have been assessed individually. The D.C. Circuit Court found that the Department of Treasury's argument of undue burden in accommodating visually impaired individuals was a misstatement of the law under Section 504. The court required that accommodations should be assessed individually and not assumed to be unduly burdensome. The Department of Treasury did not appeal the court's decision, leading to the granting of injunctive relief to the American Council of the Blind. The Department of Treasury is required to make changes to currency denominations by the next redesign approval. The Bureau of Engraving and Printing plans to include a raised tactile feature, large numerals, distinct colors, and a Currency Reader Program for the visually impaired. The American Council of the Blind expressed satisfaction with these proposals. The American Council of the Blind expressed overall satisfaction with the Bureau of Engraving and Printing's plan to incorporate raised tactile features into U.S. currency. However, they had concerns about the currency reader distribution program, stating that distributing currency readers may not make currency denominations readily distinguishable to visually impaired individuals. The Council highlighted issues such as the need to operate the currency readers with both hands, which could prevent users from safely holding their wallet while denominating. The American Council of the Blind expressed satisfaction with the plan to add tactile features to U.S. currency but raised concerns about the currency reader program. They highlighted issues such as the need to operate the readers with both hands, potentially revealing the user's money amount in public. The Council urged the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to provide timelines for implementing accessible features on currency and establish performance specifications for the devices. They also opposed the proposed eligibility requirements for the reader program. The American Council of the Blind raised concerns about the currency reader program, urging the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to broaden the definition of \"competent authority\" to include a wider range of sources for verification."
