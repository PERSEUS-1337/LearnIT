The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) officially declares recessions based on economic indicators like employment and income trends. There is no simple measure to determine when recessions begin or end. The 2007-2009 recession in the U.S. was the longest and deepest since World War II, lasting 18 months. GDP fell before employment, both deteriorated significantly in 2008, and the economy began to grow again in 2009. Recession frequency has varied over the years, with the recent one being comparable in length to those from 1945 to 1981. The 2007-2009 recession in the U.S. was the longest and deepest since World War II, lasting 18 months. Recessions end due to monetary and fiscal stimulus, and market adjustments. The recent recession had two distinct phases, with a deepening in the third quarter of 2008. GDP fell by 4.1%, the deepest post-war decline. The 2007-2009 recession in the U.S. was the longest and deepest since World War II, lasting 18 months with a 4.1% decline in GDP. The 1981 recession featured consecutive quarters of steep declines in GDP, with the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates high. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates to reduce inflation during the 1970s and 1980s recessions, with inflation peaking at 12.8% and 11.1% respectively. Some economists argue that these recessions were \"made in Washington\" due to the high rates. In contrast, the recent recession saw lower interest rates peaking at 5.25% before falling to almost zero, with inflation peaking at 4.2%. In the 1970s and 1980s, inflation peaked at 12.8% and 11.1% respectively, leading to high interest rates. In contrast, recent inflation peaked at 4.2% in 2007. Rising energy prices briefly pushed inflation up in 2008, but deflation occurred at the end of the year. The Fed's interventions in financial markets, including direct lending and asset purchases, have exceeded $1 trillion, potentially leading to higher inflation as the economy recovers. The recession drove down aggregate demand, putting pressure on inflation. Some fear deflation is a greater threat than inflation. The Fed's intervention in financial markets was necessary to avoid a \"liquidity trap.\" The Fed's scope for easing monetary policy was limited compared to previous recessions. Unemployment rose in all post-war recessions, with deeper declines in output leading to larger increases in unemployment. The 1973 and 1981 recessions saw significant increases in unemployment rates, with the 1981 recession being the only other post-war recession where unemployment topped 10%. Unemployment peaked at 10.1% in October 2009 during the recent recession. The rise in unemployment during this recession was comparable to previous recessions for the first 10 months but increased significantly after that period. The recent recession saw a pattern of rising unemployment for 22 months, the longest period since World War II. It featured the largest increase in unemployment in the post-war period, surpassing the 1973 and 1981 recessions. Unemployment continued to rise for over a year after the recession had ended in the 1991 and 2001 recessions. The recent recession saw a pattern of rising unemployment for 22 months, the longest period since World War II. Unemployment continued to rise for over a year after the recession had ended, leading to \"jobless recoveries\" in 1991 and 2001. It is uncertain if this trend will continue in future recessions. Job growth following the recent recession began in January 2010, but subsequent employment growth has been weak. Subsequent employment growth has been weak following the recent recession, with a significant decrease in consumption and private fixed investment spending. Consumption spending did not weaken as much as GDP in previous post-war recessions, with households preferring to \"smooth\" consumption over time. Fixed investment spending fell more sharply than GDP in all recessions. In post-war recessions, fixed investment spending fell more sharply than GDP, casting doubt on the popular explanation that recessions are caused by declines in consumption. The primary driver of the business cycle is cyclical changes in investment demand, with business and residential investment both affected. Residential investment saw a larger percentage decline than business investment in eight out of 10 recessions, influenced heavily by changes in housing demand and credit conditions. The recent recession saw a significant decline in residential investment, with a more pronounced drop compared to business investment. This decline in residential investment often precedes a decrease in GDP growth, leading some economists to argue that the housing crash was a root cause of the recession. Tightening credit conditions may be a common factor in causing recessions, with residential investment being the sector most affected. The recent recession saw a sharp decline in residential investment, with national house prices falling 15% and residential investment dropping by over half. Unlike previous recessions, housing may have been a cause rather than a symptom of the recession. Oil prices also played a role in past recessions, with disruptions in oil supply preceding most post-war recessions. Oil prices have historically influenced economic downturns, with disruptions in oil supply preceding most post-war recessions. In the recent recession, crude oil prices peaked at $129 per barrel in 2008 before dropping in 2009. Despite the global financial turmoil, world GDP contracted in 2009, with developed economies experiencing a -3.2% growth. The recent recession saw a -0.6% overall contraction in GDP, with developed economies experiencing a -3.2% decline. The recession was global in nature, potentially prolonging and deepening it due to decreased demand for exports. Historically, synchronized international recessions lasted longer and saw a greater GDP fall. The recent recession was longer and deeper than normal due to the severity of the financial downturn that began in August 2007 and worsened in September 2008. There was a breakdown in activity in certain financial markets, such as asset-backed securities and interbank lending, leading to the failure of several large financial firms. Financial conditions have improved since then, but disruptions in financial markets resulted in significant declines in business investment starting in the fourth quarter of 2008. The recession was longer than average due to the financial crisis, with declines in business investment. Financial crises lead to longer recessions, but the severity of the recent downturn is different from the Great Depression. Policy errors, not just the stock market crash, caused the economic downturn. The Great Depression was caused by policy errors such as the Fed's failure to counteract the money supply contraction and bank runs. In contrast, policymakers have aggressively responded to the current crisis with measures like reducing interest rates and providing financial assistance. The severity of the recent downturn is different from the Great Depression, which was also caused by policy errors. During the Great Depression, policymakers were reluctant to stimulate the economy through fiscal expansion. However, the budget deficit increased significantly from 2007 to 2009. Some policymakers believed recessions were healthy processes, but this view changed as the Depression worsened. Prudent policy changes were eventually seen as a way to avoid wasting resources during recessions. Prudent policy changes can prevent resource wastage during recessions. The Great Depression had two recessions, the first lasting 3\u00bd years and the second lasting another year. The recent recession, though deep, was milder compared to the Great Depression's first contraction. GDP, prices, and unemployment changes in the recent recession were more similar to other post-war recessions than the Great Depression."
