Prior to the 2000 Presidential election, Florida counties purged voting rolls of 58,000 people labeled as felons without notification or chance to appeal. Many were mistakenly included on the list and denied their right to vote. Purging felons from voter rolls is challenging for State officials due to lack of comprehensive data sets. The lack of comprehensive data sets of convicted felons has led to instances where innocent Americans were mistakenly denied their right to vote, risking the legitimacy of future elections. SEC. 3. Notice and review requirements for removal of individuals from official list of eligible voters by reason of criminal conviction or mental incapacity. Section 8 of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 is amended to include new notice and review requirements for the removal of individuals from the list of eligible voters due to criminal conviction or mental incapacity. States must provide registrants with a notice meeting specific requirements before removing them from the official list for an election for Federal office. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 is amended to include new notice and review requirements for the removal of individuals from the list of eligible voters due to criminal conviction or mental incapacity. States must provide registrants with a notice meeting specific requirements not later than 30 days before the date of the election. The notice must be sent by forwardable mail and include a statement of intent to remove the registrant, reasons for removal, and identifying information on the alleged criminal conviction. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 is amended to include new notice and review requirements for the removal of individuals from the list of eligible voters due to criminal conviction or mental incapacity. Registrants must receive a notice with details on the intent to remove them, reasons for removal, and information on the alleged criminal conviction. The notice must also include instructions on how to obtain a review of the removal from a State election official. A registrant who receives a notice of removal may request to withdraw the notice and remain on the list of eligible voters by providing evidence to show they are not subject to removal under State law, including proof of no criminal conviction. The State must respond within 10 days. The State must review a registrant's request to withdraw a removal notice within 10 days and notify the registrant of its decision. If a registrant believes the removal was in error, they can cast a provisional ballot in a Federal election. Additionally, a conforming amendment requires State law to be consistent with specific requirements. The amendments made by this Act will apply to the general election in November 2004 and all future Federal elections. The Act and its amendments do not affect the right to cast provisional ballots or prevent states from offering additional voter protections."
