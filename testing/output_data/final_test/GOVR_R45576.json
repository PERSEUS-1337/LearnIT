    "content": "During World War II and the Korean War, Congress recognized the threat to small businesses from material shortages and lack of defense contracts. In 1953, the Small Business Act was passed to establish the Small Business Administration (SBA) with the goal of promoting small business interests and ensuring they receive a fair share of federal contracts. The Small Business Act was passed by Congress to aid and protect small-business concerns, ensuring they receive a fair share of government contracts and sales. The intent is to support small businesses without favoring them over larger competitors, aiming to maintain the overall economy of the nation. The Small Business Act aims to support small businesses by ensuring they receive government contracts and sales. Small business contracting programs provide economic benefits by increasing competition, expanding the supplier base, and lowering barriers to market entry for small firms, leading to job creation and positive macroeconomic effects. Access to federal programs is crucial for small businesses to benefit from job creation, wage growth, and income distribution. Congress has approved legislation supporting small businesses through various programs administered by the SBA, including loan guaranty, venture capital, contracting, direct loan, and management assistance programs. Congressional interest in these programs has grown as they are seen as a way to stimulate economic activity and create jobs. This report outlines federal programs and requirements for promoting contracting and subcontracting with small businesses, including SDBs, HUBZone small businesses, WOSBs, and SDVOSBs. The SBA administers many of these programs, which aim to reserve contracts for small businesses. The federal government promotes contracting with small businesses by setting procurement goals, requiring contracts to be set aside for small businesses, and allowing sole source awards when necessary. The authority provided federal agencies to set aside contracts for specific types of small businesses is discussed, along with the SBA's oversight and responsibilities in promoting small business contracting opportunities. The role of the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) in each federal agency is also examined. The report discusses bipartisan support for small business contracting programs but notes opposition and issues raised. Advocates want policies to reduce exclusions in regulations that limit small business contracting preferences. Critics question the effectiveness of these programs in promoting small businesses. Some critics question the effectiveness of small business contracting programs in promoting opportunities and a diversified economy. Businesses interested in federal contracts need a DUNS number and must register with SAM. They must also match their products and services to a NAICS code. Small businesses in SAM must meet specific criteria to qualify. To qualify for Small Business Administration (SBA) assistance, businesses in SAM must meet the Small Business Act's definition of a small business and adhere to size standards set by the SBA. The Act defines a small business as one that is organized for profit, operates primarily in the U.S., is independently owned and not dominant in its field. SBA uses industry-specific and alternative size standards to determine program eligibility. The SBA uses industry-specific size standards to determine eligibility for federal small business contracting purposes. The size standards are based on the applicant's maximum tangible net worth and average net income after federal taxes. The SBA's Table of Small Business Size Standards lists size standards for 1,036 industrial classifications. Businesses exceeding the size standard for their industry are not considered small and do not qualify for SBA assistance. The size standards aim to promote competition within industries and ensure assistance goes to non-dominant firms. The SBA uses industry-specific size standards to determine eligibility for federal small business contracting. Size standards are based on factors like firm size, assets, industry competition, and size distribution. The SBA also considers secondary factors like technological change and industry growth trends. Historically, the number of employees has been used to determine small business status for manufacturing and mining companies. The SBA uses industry-specific size standards based on factors like firm size, assets, and industry competition to determine small business eligibility for federal contracting. Prior to soliciting bids, federal agencies must classify a product or service in one NAICS code industry that best describes it. If a product or service could be classified in multiple industries with different size standards, the contracting officer must apply the size standard for the industry accounting for the greatest percentage of the contract price. When submitting offers for multiple items in a solicitation, an offeror must meet the size standard for each item offered. If offers are required on all or none of the items, an offeror can qualify as a small business by meeting the size standard for the item with the highest contract price percentage. Businesses typically self-certify as small when registering in the SAM database, except for specific programs like HUBZone, SBA 8(a), and veteran-owned small businesses. The contracting officer must accept a small business representation in a bid unless certain conditions apply. When an offeror's small business status is challenged, the contracting officer cannot award the contract until the SBA determines the size status within 15 business days. The SBA's Area Office reviews the protest and must make a determination within the specified time frame. If no determination is made, the contracting officer may proceed with the award. If the SBA does not make a determination within the required time, the contracting officer may award the contract after determining in writing that there is an immediate need to do so. An appeal can be filed with the SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals. If the protested concern is found ineligible for award, the contracting officer must terminate the contract unless it is not in the best interests of the government. Options or further orders cannot be awarded if a concern is determined not to be a small business by the SBA. The SBA can suspend or debar firms from government contracts for misrepresenting their size status, with civil and criminal penalties for individuals involved. Federal regulations aim to maximize small business participation in contracts. Contracting officers must divide acquisitions into small lots to promote this goal. The government aims to maximize small business participation in contracts by dividing acquisitions into small lots, encouraging multiple small businesses to perform the work, establishing realistic delivery schedules, and promoting subcontracting with small businesses by prime contractors. The government aims to maximize small business participation in contracts by dividing acquisitions into small lots, encouraging multiple small businesses to perform the work, establishing realistic delivery schedules, and promoting subcontracting with small businesses by prime contractors. Provide a copy of the proposed acquisition package to the SBA procurement center representative for review and recommendation at least 30 days prior to the solicitation issuance for contracts exceeding $700,000 or $1.5 million for construction contracts. The contracting officer must justify the consolidation or bundling of requirements, provide relevant information, and explain why the acquisition cannot be divided into smaller lots to encourage small business participation. The SBA may assign procurement center representatives to contracting activities to implement policies and programs. The contracting officer must justify consolidation or bundling of requirements and document rejections of SBA recommendations. The SBA assigns procurement center representatives to contracting activities to implement policies and programs. PCRs review proposed acquisitions, recommend setting aside selected acquisitions for small businesses, assess new small business sources, and evaluate the feasibility of competitive acquisitions. They can also suggest alternate contracting methods if small businesses may struggle to compete for the prime contract. The PCR can recommend alternate contracting methods to increase small business opportunities, suggest small businesses for inclusion in acquisition lists, appeal contracting officer decisions, conduct reviews of agency contracting activities, and participate in events to boost small business participation. The Office of Small Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) ensures fair treatment and opportunities for small businesses in federal contracting. They identify bundling of contract requirements and work to revise procurement strategies to increase small business participation. The Small Business Administration assists small businesses in obtaining payments and provides technical advisors to support Procurement Center Representatives. They also advise the agency's Chief Acquisition Officer on acquisition strategies and market research. The Small Business Administration provides advice on acquisition strategies, market research, and justifications related to limitations on contract consolidation to support small businesses. Training is offered to small businesses and contract specialists without interfering with the director's responsibilities. Small businesses notifying the PCR of restrictive provisions in solicitations are informed of available resources. Subcontracting plans are reviewed to ensure compliance. The DOD renamed its OSDBU to the Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP) in accordance with P.L. 109-163. Procurement department heads are responsible for implementing small business programs at their agencies, with small business specialists coordinating with OSDBU directors. Chief acquisition officers provide a focal point for small business program goals. The SBA assigns breakout procurement center representatives to major procurement centers to advocate for full and open competition and the breakout of items when appropriate. The SBA assigns breakout procurement center representatives to major procurement centers to advocate for full and open competition and the breakout of items when appropriate. When a breakout PCR is assigned, the SBA must assign at least two co-located small business technical advisors who comply with contracting agency directives and obtain necessary security clearances. Commercial market representatives assist prime contractors in finding small businesses for subcontracts and provide counseling on maximizing subcontracting opportunities for small businesses. The SBA's business opportunity specialists provide guidance, counseling, and referrals for small businesses participating in the 8(a) program to improve their competitive viability. They conduct periodic reviews of contractors with subcontracting plans to ensure small businesses have opportunities to participate in contract performance. The Small Business Procurement Advisory Council (SBPAC) oversees compliance with mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreements and represents the SBA Administrator's interests in 8(a) program contracts. They also report fraud or abuse in the program and develop positions on procurement regulations affecting small businesses.

They also report fraud or abuse in the program and develop positions on procurement regulations affecting small businesses. The Defense Logistic Agency's Procurement Technical Assistance Program (PTAC) helps businesses pursue and perform under contracts with the Department of Defense and other federal agencies. PTAC provides free assistance to businesses for registration in various systems. The Small Business Procurement Advisory Council oversees compliance with mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreements and represents the SBA Administrator's interests in 8(a) program contracts. The Defense Logistic Agency's Procurement Technical Assistance Program (PTAC) provides free support to businesses for registration in systems like the System for Award Management (SAM), identifying contract opportunities, and assisting in bid preparation. Federal agencies may use competitive procedures for contracting with small businesses, including reserving contracts valued between the micro-purchase threshold and the simplified acquisition threshold exclusively for small businesses. Federal agencies are required to set aside contracts exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold exclusively for small businesses when competitive offers can be obtained from at least two responsible small businesses. Contracts may also be reserved for specific types of small businesses, such as 8(a) small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, WOSBs, and SDVOSBs. Additionally, negotiations can be directly entered into with certain types of small businesses for sole source awards. Several SBA programs assist small businesses in obtaining federal contracts, including prime contracting programs, subcontracting programs, and other assistance like technical training. These programs allow small businesses to compete with similar firms or receive sole source awards in specific circumstances. Small businesses are granted a price evaluation preference of up to 10% in open competitions. The 8(a) Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development Program provides business development assistance to socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, including African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, Asian-Pacific Americans, and Subcontinent Asian Americans. Other individuals can also qualify on a case-by-case basis. The 8(a) Program sets financial limits for ownership interest and personal residence equity. Federal agencies can award contracts to the SBA for subcontracting to 8(a) firms. Contracts can be set-aside or awarded on a sole source basis based on the contract amount. Sole source awards are typically for contracts under $4 million ($7 million for manufacturing). In FY2017, the federal government awarded $27.2 billion to 8(a) firms, with $16.4 billion awarded through an 8(a) preference. Firms can participate in the 8(a) Program for up to nine years, with contracts awarded via set-asides or sole source based on the contract amount. The HUBZone program provides assistance to small businesses in designated areas through set-asides, sole source awards, and price evaluation preferences. To be certified, a small business must have at least 35% of employees residing in a HUBZone. In FY2017, $7.53 billion was awarded to HUBZone-certified small businesses. In FY2017, $7.53 billion was awarded to HUBZone-certified small businesses. The program allows agencies to set aside contracts for SDVOSBs and award sole source contracts to SDVOSBs under certain conditions. Veterans and service-related disabilities are defined as under the statutes governing veterans affairs. In FY2017, the federal government awarded $18.2 billion to SDVOSBs, with $6.8 billion through set-aside awards, $4.3 billion in open competition, and $7.1 billion with other small business preferences. Contracts can be set aside for economically disadvantaged WOSBs in underrepresented industries, and sole source contracts can be awarded if the price is fair and reasonable. In the same year, $21.3 billion was awarded to WOSBs, with $648.9 million in sole source contracts. In FY2017, the federal government awarded $21.3 billion to WOSBs, with $648.9 million through a WOSB preference. Federal contracting officers must allow the SBA's PCR to review small business subcontracting plans before issuance. The SBA's commercial market representatives assist prime contractors in finding small businesses for subcontracts and counsel them on maximizing subcontracting opportunities. Federal agencies may set aside contracts or make sole source awards to small businesses. The DOT's Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program began in 1980 as a minority/women's business enterprise program under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program, established in 1980 under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, requires that a minimum of 10% of funds for certain DOT programs be spent with DBEs. This includes federal-aid highways, public transportation, and airport concessions. DBEs are for-profit small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Eligibility for the DBE program differs from the 8(a) program, with women being presumed to be eligible under the DBE program. The DBE program under the DOT has specific criteria for eligibility, including a personal net worth limit of $1.32 million and size criteria. The program aims to ensure nondiscrimination, create a fair competition environment, and comply with applicable laws. The DBE program under the DOT has eligibility criteria to promote fair competition and compliance with laws. It aims to assist firms in competing successfully and provide flexibility to recipients of federal financial assistance. Other federal programs promote subcontracting with small disadvantaged businesses, including 8(a) participants and other SDBs with specific ownership criteria. SDBs, including non-8(a) SDBs, must meet eligibility requirements and may have a net worth limit. Federal agencies must negotiate subcontracting plans with successful bidders to allocate subcontract dollars to SDBs. Consideration of subcontracting with SDBs may influence contract awards. The SBA's Dynamic Small Business Search database includes 2,538 SBA-certified SDBs and 100,595 self-certified SDBs. The 7(j) Management and Technical Assistance program offers counseling and training to eligible individuals and businesses, including 8(a) certified firms, SDBs, and businesses in areas of high unemployment. In FY2017, the program assisted 4,100 small businesses. The Bond Guarantee program increases small businesses' access to government and private contracts by guaranteeing bid, performance, and payment bonds. The program guarantees contracts up to $6.5 million, or up to $10 million with federal certification. SBA guarantees up to 80-90% of surety's loss in case of default. In FY2017, SBA guaranteed 10,397 bonds worth over $6.3 billion. Surety bonds involve a surety, contractor, and project owner, binding the contractor to contract terms. Surety bonds ensure that contractors comply with contract terms. If a contractor fails, the surety takes over to complete the project, reducing contracting risks. Small businesses benefit as they may lack credit history or experience. Federal contracts over $150,000 require a performance bond from a satisfactory surety. The federal government has various mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs to assist small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. These programs pair new businesses with experienced ones to provide financial, technical, or management assistance in obtaining and performing federal contracts. Mentors may receive incentives such as credit toward subcontracting goals or reimbursement of expenses. The SBA's Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development Program, also known as the 8(a) program, helps small businesses obtain and perform federal contracts. Mentors can form joint ventures, make equity investments, lend/subcontract, and provide assistance to prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. The SBA's All Small Business Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program is government-wide, while the Department of Defense Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program is agency-specific, assisting small businesses in obtaining and performing DOD subcontracts. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) also has a mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 program where mentors can provide various forms of assistance to prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firms, such as rent-free facilities, equipment, personnel, property, loans, and other support. These programs, unlike the SBA and DOD programs, do not have a statutory basis and rely on preexisting authorities or publicity for implementation. Since 1978, federal agencies have been required to set procurement goals for small businesses, with over 1,200 mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreements in place. Some agencies rely on preexisting authorities or publicity to incentivize mentor participation. Congress authorized the President to establish government-wide minimum participation goals for small businesses in 1988. The government set minimum participation goals for small businesses owned by disadvantaged individuals in 1988. Each federal agency must have an annual goal to maximize opportunities for these businesses in contracts. The Small Business Administration reports annually on goal attainment to the President and Congress. The Small Business Administration negotiates annual goals with federal agencies to maximize opportunities for small businesses in contracts. If goals cannot be agreed upon, the agency may seek resolution from the Office of Management and Budget. Certain contracts are excluded from the small business eligible baseline. The Small Business Administration negotiates annual goals with federal agencies to maximize opportunities for small businesses in contracts. Exclusions from the small business eligible baseline include contracts not covered by the FAR, acquisitions for foreign governments, and contracts not reported in FPDS-NG. The SBA evaluates agencies' performance annually using FPDS-NG data and releases the Small Business Goaling Report. Agencies failing to meet goals must submit justifications and corrective action plans to the SBA. Federal agencies can take credit in various categories for contracts awarded to small businesses, including service-disabled Veteran-Owned Woman-Owned Small Businesses. These category counts do not sum to triple the total count. Government-wide procurement goals have been established for small businesses, socially disadvantaged individuals, and women. The federal small business procurement goals include targets for small businesses, socially disadvantaged individuals, women, HUBZone small businesses, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. The goals aim for a percentage of total contract awards to each category for each fiscal year. The Small Business Goaling Report, based on FPDS-NG data, shows federal agencies meeting procurement goals for small businesses, disadvantaged businesses, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses in FY2017. The report is widely distributed, receives media attention, and raises public awareness of small business contracting issues. In FY2017, federal agencies met procurement goals for small businesses, disadvantaged businesses, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. Before awarding a federal contract, the contracting officer must affirmatively determine the business's responsibility. If the officer finds a small business offeror lacking certain elements of responsibility, they must refer the matter to the SBA for review and a possible Certificate of Competency. The COC program certifies small businesses for government contracts, ensuring all required elements of responsibility are met. SBA conducts compliance reviews for awarded contracts with small business subcontracting plans. Federal agencies must pay contractors promptly and may pay early under certain circumstances. Federal agencies may pay contractors before the contract's payment due date. Compliance reviews can be on-site, at the agency, or virtual. Materials reviewed include contract files, correspondence, IT systems, subcontracting methods. SBA may partner with other agencies for assessments. Compliance report shows compliant/non-compliant items and a rating from unsatisfactory to outstanding. Contractors must submit a corrective action plan within 30 days of the review rating. The SBA requires contractors to submit a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) within 30 days of a compliance review. The CAP is sent to the SBA Area Office for review, and a follow-up report is conducted within six months to a year to ensure deficiencies are addressed. If the contractor fails to comply with the CAP, a delinquent letter is issued, and the case may be escalated to the SBA's subcontracting program manager. Federal agencies must pay interest to prime contractors for late payments, as specified in the contract. Similar requirements apply to prime contractors paying subcontractors in construction contracts. Small businesses in construction must be paid promptly, with clauses obligating prime contractors to pay subcontractors within seven days of receiving payment from the agency. Interest must be paid on any overdue amounts. The contract must obligate the prime contractor to pay subcontractors promptly within seven days of receiving payment from the agency and include interest penalties for late payments. Subcontracting plans must also require notification to the agency if a subcontractor is paid late or at a reduced price, with reasons provided for any payment delays. The contracting officer for a covered contract must record a prime contractor's identity if they have a history of unjustified, untimely payments to subcontractors. This information is made publicly available to evaluate business ethics and quality of contractors competing for federal contracts. Federal agencies can make accelerated payments up to seven days before the required payment date. The Secretary of Defense is required to establish accelerated payment dates for small business prime contractors and subcontractors, aiming for payment within 15 days of receiving a proper invoice. This applies to payments under $2,500, to small businesses, or for emergency, disaster, or military deployment situations. Small business contracting programs aim for accelerated payment within 15 days of receiving a proper invoice. There is bipartisan support for these programs, but some issues have been raised, such as the need to reduce exclusions in contracting preferences and improve the methodology for awarding performance. Critics urge the SBA to improve methodology for awarding performance grades in small business contracting goals. Federal agencies have had mixed success in meeting procurement goals, particularly for WOSBs and HUBZone small businesses. The Small Business Goaling Report is used to compare federal small business contracting performance, but it has limitations. It does not include all federal contracts and does not evaluate the impact on small businesses, industry competitiveness, or the economy. Critics argue that the goal-setting process focuses on dollars awarded to small businesses and overlooks the effects on business growth and wealth generation. The Small Business Goaling Report has limitations in evaluating the impact on small businesses, industry competitiveness, and the economy. Comprehensive studies on small business contracting preferences may be useful for congressional oversight. The SBA is focusing on promoting the HUBZone program to federal contracting officials to meet the 3% goal for HUBZone small businesses."
