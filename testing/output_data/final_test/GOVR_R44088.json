    "content": "The Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) provides educational assistance payments to eligible individuals from the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Department of Education's Federal Pell Grants offer grant aid payments to eligible undergraduate students based on financial need. Efficient administration is crucial for both programs to achieve their policy objectives. The administration of Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits and Pell Grant payments has been compared and criticized for delays and penalties. The House Veterans' Affairs Committee has conducted oversight hearings to ensure timely and accurate administration of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Differences in processing are attributed to the programs' purposes. This report aims to improve the administration of Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits by adopting practices from the administration of Title IV aid, focusing on statutory and regulatory provisions and operational practices. The report reviews guidance materials, manuals, and conducts interviews to describe administrative practices for educational assistance programs. It aims to identify differences in practices and suggests ways to enhance existing practices. The report also discusses how adopting Title IV practices could improve Post-9/11 GI Bill benefit administration. It seeks to inform dialogue on streamlining and enhancing program administration. The report compares administrative practices of the Post-9/11 GI Bill and Pell Grant programs, focusing on their commonalities and key differences. Both programs are significant in terms of participants and funding, with no repayment required for recipients. The analysis aims to inform ways to streamline and enhance program administration. The report compares administrative practices of the Post-9/11 GI Bill and Pell Grant programs, highlighting key differences in their independent statutory authorizations and processes. It delves into the application process, benefit calculation, fund disbursement, and resolution of overpayments. The final section addresses issues for improvement. The federal government supports veterans through education and training programs like the Post-9/11 GI Bill and Pell Grant. These programs offer monetary assistance to eligible individuals independently. For more details on each program, refer to specific CRS reports. The federal government provides assistance to veterans and servicemembers through various GI Bill programs, including the Post-9/11 GI Bill. In FY2014, around $12 billion in GI Bill benefits were paid on behalf of approximately 1 million individuals. The Post-9/11 GI Bill aims to support qualifying individuals who served on active duty after September 10, 2001, in their transition to civilian life and retention in the uniformed services by providing educational assistance payments for approved programs. The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides educational assistance payments for approved programs of education or training, including secondary school, non-college degree programs, postsecondary degree programs, vocational flight training, apprenticeship, and licensure/certification tests. Dependents of qualifying individuals may also be eligible for benefits, including a transfer of entitlement or entitlement through the Fry Scholarship program for those who died in the line of duty after September 11, 2001. Program benefit levels were designed to cover the full cost of public undergraduate education as a reward for service during times of conflict. The Post-9/11 GI Bill covers the full cost of public undergraduate education for in-state students during times of conflict. Eligible individuals may receive various payments including tuition, fees, housing allowance, books stipend, and more. Maximum amounts are set for most payments, and individuals are entitled to 36 months of benefits. The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides 36 months of benefits that must be used within a specified period. Entitlement is charged based on pursuit of education, and individuals apply to the VA for certification of eligibility. Once certified, benefits are paid to the individual and institution. In FY2013, over $10 billion in benefits were distributed to over three-quarters of a million individuals. In FY2013, individuals received over $10 billion in Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. Educational institutions receive reporting fees for each GI Bill participant, with the VA paying over $10 million in fees that year. The federal government supports access to postsecondary education through programs authorized by the Higher Education Act. Title IV of the Higher Education Act (HEA) authorizes federal student aid programs to help students and families finance postsecondary education. Programs include Pell Grants, Stafford Loans, FSEOG, TEACH Grants, Perkins Loans, and Work-Study programs. In FY2014, almost $134 billion in aid was provided to nearly 13 million students, with the Pell Grant program being the largest source of grant aid. Eligible individuals can receive grants while enrolled in eligible programs at higher education institutions. Pell Grants are designed to help high school graduates with financial need pursue higher education. Eligibility criteria include completion of secondary school, citizenship status, Selective Service registration, and enrollment in an eligible program at a Title IV-participating institution. Certain situations like drug convictions or defaulting on student loans may disqualify individuals from receiving Pell Grants. Eligible programs at Title IV-participating institutions include undergraduate courses, teacher certification programs, remedial coursework, correspondence programs, flight school, ESL courses, and cooperative education. Pell Grant recipients are limited to six awards or 12 full-time semesters. The maximum award amount in 2014-2015 was $5,730, subject to reduction based on financial need. The Pell Grant amount is determined based on financial need, educational expenses, and enrollment status. Students apply through FAFSA, with eligibility and expected family contribution calculated by ED systems. Over $35.7 billion was provided to 9.7 million undergraduates in FY2011. Approximately 41% of undergraduates in Title IV-participating institutions received Pell Grants in 2011-2012. On average, over 1,000 Pell Grant recipients were at each institution. About 15% of institutions had fewer than 60 recipients. The Pell Grant program provides an administrative cost allowance of $5 per recipient to participating institutions. There are differences in the administration of the Post-9/11 GI Bill and Pell Grant programs, possibly due to the age and complexity of the programs. The Post-9/11 GI Bill was enacted in 2009, while the Pell Grant program was enacted in 1973. This difference in time has allowed for more resources and experience in managing the programs. The Pell Grant program, enacted in 1973, has evolved with fully automated systems to administer aid efficiently. In contrast, the Post-9/11 GI Bill has complex benefit structures not compatible with legacy systems. The Pell Grant program has fully automated systems for efficient aid administration, while the Post-9/11 GI Bill has complex benefit structures that are not compatible with legacy systems. Additional payment types for educational costs require different information for certification and payment, with differences in automation crucial for processing speed and accuracy. Despite initial FAFSA automation, manual processing is required for applications for veterans education benefits due to the inability to fully automate qualifying active duty service calculations. Both programs allow online applications, with the Post-9/11 GI Bill requiring applicants to choose the most advantageous GI Bill and the Pell Grant application requiring more. The Pell Grant application requires more personal financial information, confusing some applicants. Veterans can apply for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits at any time within their entitlement period. The VA processes the initial benefit application to determine eligibility and issues a certificate of eligibility summarizing the individual's qualifying service and benefit level. The COE also includes remaining entitlement and delimiting date. The Pell Grant application process involves verifying basic eligibility through CPS and receiving a SAR with EFC and potential Pell Grant amount. VA and educational institutions share processing responsibility for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, while Pell Grant processes are primarily handled by IHEs. This difference may impact the time required to pay benefits and responsibility for processing. The differences in processing responsibility for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits can impact the time required to pay benefits and raise concerns about overpayments. Educational institutions may handle secondary processing to inform students of their aid package, while the VA completes processing to award payments. The VA calculates and makes payments based on enrollment reported by the educational institution. The federal government encourages educational institutions to counsel GI Bill participants on higher education and financial aid complexities. In special circumstances, institutions may adjust data elements for Pell Grant payments and report them to ED. Differences in handling overpayments between Post-9/11 GI Bill and Pell Grant programs relate to the total amount and program specifics. Pell Grant overpayment occurs when a student receives more aid than eligible, while Post-9/11 GI Bill payments can exceed $20,000. VA sends debt notification letters to participants for Post-9/11 GI Bill payments. The VA sends debt notification letters to participants for Post-9/11 GI Bill payments, while for Pell Grants, the FAA adjusts a student's aid package to eliminate overpayment before referring the debt to ED's Debt Resolution Services. The onus is on the participant for Post-9/11 GI Bill purposes and on the IHE for Pell Grant purposes. Transparency is greater in the Post-9/11 GI Bill program, making it easier for veterans to assess their eligibility and payment amounts compared to Pell Grants. The first step in benefit administration is notification from the individual of a desire to take advantage of a benefit. Individuals must apply for the Post-9/11 GI Bill and Pell Grant programs. Eligible individuals apply for most GI Bill benefits, including Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, by mail or by completing the Veteran's Online Application (VONAPP). VONAPP allows servicemembers and veterans, and their families, to apply for various VA benefits. VONAPP allows servicemembers, veterans, and their families to apply for VA benefits like education, burial, or pension benefits. The application must be submitted within one year of eligibility for the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The VA provides assistance and guarantees responses to emailed questions within five to seven working days. The application form requires identifying information and service records for eligibility determination. Dependents and Fry scholarship applicants also need to provide qualifying individual information and other VA benefit records. Individuals applying for VA benefits must choose an education benefit program and may expedite processing by providing proof of service record and eligibility for supplemental benefits. Applicants can track their application and benefits through eBenefits, a portal for veterans and their families to manage their benefits. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is used to apply for Pell Grants and other forms of financial aid. It can be completed online or by mail, with assistance available from educational institutions. The application must be submitted before June 30 of the award year. The FAFSA form has over 100 questions, but applicants don't need to answer all of them. FAFSA on the Web uses skip logic based on prior responses. Students complete the form in about 20 minutes. The form requests identity and financial information, including contact details, eligibility for aid, state aid, dependency status, and school preferences. The FAFSA form requires financial information from the applicant, spouse, and/or parents, including income, assets, and benefits. The online form can retrieve tax data directly from the IRS. GI Bill applications are processed at VA Regional Processing Offices based on the applicant's or institution's address. The VA processes GI Bill applications at Regional Processing Offices based on the applicant's or institution's address. Claim information is entered into TIMS for VCE review to verify eligibility and issue a COE or explain ineligibility. The VA processes GI Bill applications at Regional Processing Offices based on the applicant's or institution's address. Claim information is entered into TIMS for VCE review to verify eligibility by checking DOD records through VADIR and other sources. The VCE may conduct additional research to confirm service record, education-related obligations, and benefits. Dependents' eligibility is also reviewed, including dependency and transfer of entitlement data in VIS. The VCE reviews the Benefits Delivery Network for GI Bill usage, verifies irrevocable election, validates bank deposit routing number, updates contact information, notes $1,200 contribution for MGIB-AD benefits, and may review program eligibility. Information sources are recorded in TIMS for audits. The VCE reviews and updates information in the Benefits Delivery Network for GI Bill benefits. If a claimant is ineligible, LTS generates a letter with reasons and next steps. If eligible, LTS generates a Certificate of Eligibility after verification. The VCE ensures LTS is accurate, adjudicates the claim in BDN, and VA has additional processes for accurate claims processing. After processing the COE in LTS, a second VCE or Senior VCE must authorize the original claim to ensure accuracy. The authorizer reviews records in TIMS and LTS to verify research was done in accordance with policy. Each RPO checks a certain number of claims per VCE monthly for accuracy. Once authorized, the VCE can print and mail the COE letter, stating entitlement to benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The COE describes the individual's benefit level, remaining entitlement, delimiting date, and Kicker entitlement. VA processed original claims in an average of 17 days in FY2014, improved technology systems have reduced processing time from 39 days in 2010. Data submitted on FAFSA or through FAA Access is processed by the ED Central Processing System (CPS). The Central Processing System (CPS) is crucial for Pell Grant processing, verifying eligibility, calculating Expected Family Contribution (EFC), and determining student eligibility for HEA Title IV aid programs. CPS matches and edits FAFSA data, checks for inconsistencies, and collaborates with federal agencies for verification. Financial information on FAFSA is used to calculate the applicant's family EFC. The EFC is calculated by CPS based on the applicant's family financial information provided on the FAFSA. It determines the amount expected to be contributed by the family towards the student's education costs. The calculation considers income and assets, with different formulas for dependent and independent students. The Expected Family Contribution (EFC) is calculated based on income and assets, using various assumptions and adjusted for family size. Certain criteria can exempt asset contribution for families with income below $50,000. Some individuals may qualify for an automatic zero EFC, including Pell Grant-eligible students with low family income. Individuals may qualify for an automatic zero Expected Family Contribution (EFC) if they are Pell Grant-eligible with low family income, or if they had a parent or guardian die in military service in Iraq or Afghanistan after September 11, 2001. The FAFSA is checked by CPS, which then provides a Student Aid Report (SAR) to the applicant and an Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) to the designated institution. The SAR and ISIR contain application data, data matches, EFC, and eligibility for federal aid. SAR informs students of next steps and financial aid process. FAFSAs processed within 3-10 days. SAR also shows school rates and federal student loans owed. Once initial claim and application processing determine eligibility for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, intervention by the educational institution is crucial for secondary processing leading to benefit disbursement. Payments are processed by VA after enrollment certification, consisting of lump sum and periodic payments. The educational institution must certify enrollment for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, which include up-front lump sum and periodic payments. The School Certifying Official (SCO) is notified by the individual, who may provide a copy of the Certificate of Eligibility (COE) to expedite the process. The SCO certifies the student's enrollment by completing a certificate of enrollment in VA-ONCE, an internet-based application for VA education benefits. The Cert includes identifying information, type of training, program of education, educational objective, training credits, clock hours per week, and residential remedial credits. The SCO certifies student enrollment by providing details such as clock hours per week, residential remedial credits, full-time credits for graduate training, academic term dates, net in-state tuition and fees, out-of-state charges, and Yellow Ribbon payment availability. The applicable charges are reduced for DOD tuition assistance and other designated assistance, excluding optional fees. The SCO may only certify applicable courses. The SCO certifies student enrollment by providing details such as clock hours per week, residential remedial credits, full-time credits for graduate training, academic term dates, net in-state tuition and fees, out-of-state charges, and Yellow Ribbon payment availability. Only courses and subjects relevant to the student's program may be certified, including institutionally required remedial and deficiency courses. SCOs may need to include various remarks in VA-ONCE for special circumstances, such as cooperative programs, felony convictions, or practical training. Students can request certification for fewer credits than enrolled to preserve entitlement. Enrollment in multiple institutions for credit transfer must be verified by the primary institution. Secondary institutions can certify enrollment and courses for the primary institution. It is encouraged to submit Certs early for timely benefit payments. SCOs can certify multiple terms at once. If a Post-9/11 GI Bill participant fails to inform the institution in time, the SCO may certify. The SCO can certify education and training up to one year after completion for GI Bill benefits. Certifications include vocational flight training, apprenticeships, on-the-job training, and more. These certifications are supported through various methods like VA-ONCE and paper forms. Administrative processes for these certifications are detailed in Appendix C. The VA requires educational institutions to maintain detailed records of students' progress and paperwork for the Post-9/11 GI Bill program. This includes transcripts, academic records, tuition charges, disciplinary actions, and other relevant information. The VA requires educational institutions to maintain detailed records for the Post-9/11 GI Bill program, including transcripts, academic records, tuition charges, and disciplinary actions. Once certified, the RPO verifies eligibility and processes payments for Certs, some of which require VCE intervention. Certs entered in VA-ONCE are automatically populated into LTS and TIMS for processing, including payment calculations and notification letter printing. Manual processes still include mailing payment notification letters. The VCE ensures accurate processing of payments by verifying claimant eligibility, resolving discrepancies, and updating necessary information. They also review educational objectives, prior education, and professional licenses to ensure program compliance and approval. The VCE verifies program approval in WEAMS and sends award or denial letters to GI Bill participants for each Cert processed. The award letter includes payment details, remaining benefits, contact information, qualifying service, enrollment charges, payment amounts, and appeal rights. Contact information is provided for questions and appeals. The VCE verifies program approval and sends award or denial letters to GI Bill participants. The audit ensures compliance with GI Bill laws, which may impact Cert processing. Post-9/11 GI Bill payments are calculated by LTS based on statutory rules. Payments cover tuition, fees, housing allowance, books stipend, tutorial assistance, test fees, relocation assistance, and Kickers. Kickers are additional benefit amounts that supplement the housing allowance of eligible Post-9/11 GI Bill participants. Payment eligibility and amounts depend on various factors such as benefit level, program of education, rate of pursuit, institutional control, location, type of institution, tuition and fees benefits, educational delivery mechanism, duty status, days in education/training, tutorial assistance, test fee, Kicker contract, Yellow Ribbon agreement, residence, and relationship to the educational institution. See Table 3 for maximum amounts for tuition and fees, housing, and books and supplies for the academic year beginning August 1, 2014. The VA's call center may review SHARE to determine recent benefit information. Tuition and fees and YR payments are typically sent to the institution by check or Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) up to two weeks before the start of the academic term or once the Cert has been processed. Post-9/11 GI Bill entitlement is charged one day for each day the individual is enrolled full-time. The VA sends tuition and fees payments to institutions before the start of the academic term. Post-9/11 GI Bill-eligible individuals receive various payments directly, including a monthly housing allowance, books and supplies stipend, tutorial assistance, test fees, and relocation/travel assistance. The VA provides various payments directly to Post-9/11 GI Bill-eligible individuals, including monthly housing allowance, books and supplies stipend, tutorial assistance, test fees, and relocation/travel assistance. The LTS processed over 50% of supplemental claims electronically within one day. In FY2014, the VA processed supplemental claims for returning students in an average of six days. Educational institutions submitted certifications for Post-9/11 GI Bill recipients, with some certifying fewer than three recipients. After FAFSA processing, Pell Grants are administered concurrently with other aid by institutions. Institutions administering HEA Title IV aid must have policies for verification consistent with federal regulations. Financial aid administrators are the point of contact for students and may begin processing SAR or ISIR. Eligibility reviews are required for critical inconsistencies, which must be corrected on the FAFSA or with adequate documentation. Ultimately, the institution is responsible for ensuring compliance. The FAA can override CPS error codes, and the IHE is responsible for resolving discrepancies before disbursing federal aid and ensuring accurate Pell Grant payments. Applications selected for verification require supporting documentation. Pell Grant awards are determined based on EFC, COA, enrollment status, and award rules. COA measures educational expenses for a full academic year. The Cost of Attendance (COA) includes various expenses such as tuition, fees, books, supplies, transportation, room and board, and dependent care. The maximum Pell Grant award for 2014-2015 is $5,730, with the minimum award being 10% of the maximum. The Financial Aid Administrator (FAA) may adjust COA and Expected Family Contribution (EFC) based on individual circumstances using professional judgment and documentation. The Financial Aid Administrator (FAA) can adjust the Cost of Attendance (COA) and Expected Family Contribution (EFC) based on individual circumstances using professional judgment and documentation. To calculate the Pell Grant award amount for the full award year, the FAA can enter the COA, EFC, and expected enrollment status in a software program or access payment schedules published by ED. Pell Grants must be paid in installments over the award year based on the student's attendance pattern. The Pell Grant must be paid in installments over the award year based on the student's enrollment status. For example, a full-time student for two semesters will receive two disbursements, while a full-time student for one semester will receive one disbursement. The FAA will calculate the Pell Grant award and package the remainder of the student's Title IV aid. The FAA will package the remainder of the student's Title IV aid, combining various sources of aid to meet financial need and cover educational costs. The Pell Grant or IASG award is considered the foundation of the aid package, with federal components determined by HEA Title IV statute and regulations. Aid packaging is facilitated by software like EDExpress. The full aid package is presented to students in an award letter, excluding educational funds like GI Bill benefits and ROTC scholarships. The student and parents must choose which aid to accept from the aid package, which includes vocational rehabilitation assistance, ROTC scholarships, and non-Title IV aid. The IHE must provide information on aid programs, sources, disbursement methods, student rights, and Title IV disclosures. Pell Grant and IASG funds are disbursed by the FAA through the COD system. The IHE has flexibility in disbursing Pell Grant funds, which can occur up to 10 days before the payment period starts. Disbursements can be made in multiple installments if beneficial to the student, deposited in the student's account, or paid directly to the student or family. Most IHEs deposit Pell Grant funds into the student's account and deduct unpaid tuition, fees, and room and board. Any remaining funds can be paid directly to the student within 14 days. IHEs are responsible for managing Pell Grant funds and can receive funds upfront or be reimbursed by ED. Grant funding in COD is based on actual disbursement records accepted by the COD system. IHEs must make payments to students within three business days of receiving funds from ED. IHEs may receive funds through Reimbursement or Cash Monitoring if there are concerns about meeting Title IV requirements. Pell Grant funds and other Title IV funds are received through electronic funds transfer using ED's G5 payment system. The school awards Pell Grant funds to students and returns any remainder to ED. Proper management of HEA Title IV funds is required, with information sharing within the IHE. A coordinating official must oversee Title IV aid administration, and notifications to students and parents must be made throughout the financial aid process. Electronic notifications and authorizations are allowed unless regulations mandate U.S. mail. Consent for electronic transactions is necessary for all notices and authorizations to HEA Title IV aid recipients. In award year 2011-2012, there were 1,653 Pell Grant recipients for each IHE. Subsequent payments for aid recipients are processed based on availability of FAAs and IHE internal systems. Both the Post-9/11 GI Bill and Pell Grant programs ensure proper payments and adjustments to match student circumstances. Enrollment or pursuit certification is required every academic term, month, year, or program. LTS automatically approves and initiates subsequent payments for approved supplemental claims. LTS automatically approves and initiates subsequent payments for housing allowance, books and supplies stipend, and tutorial assistance. Changes to certification, rate of pursuit, academic progress, conduct, enrollment status, or incomplete grades should be reported within 30 days. SCO may adjust hours, term dates, or charges accordingly. The SCO may adjust hours, term dates, or charges, or terminate attendance, maintaining a change record. VA recalculates benefits based on adjustments, amendments, or terminations, reflecting changes in the next payment. Educational institutions must notify VA of GI Bill participants on academic probation or not making satisfactory progress. Placement on academic probation is reported through the VA's \"Ask a Question\" system. Individuals on academic probation may continue to receive GI Bill benefits, but those not making satisfactory progress cannot receive benefits until the issue is resolved with the educational institution. Educational institutions are responsible for defining and enforcing their standards of academic progress, attendance, and conduct. The VA encourages institutions to offer counseling and tutorial assistance to GI Bill participants and will reach out to offer assistance as well. Participants must be pursuing an approved program of education to be eligible for benefits. Individuals on academic probation may continue to receive GI Bill benefits, but those not making satisfactory progress cannot receive benefits until the issue is resolved with the educational institution. To resume receiving benefits, the individual may re-enroll in the same program at the same institution or submit a Request for Change of Program or Place of Training to the VA for approval. Changes in educational institutions or training establishments must be recorded and approved by the VA. To maintain eligibility for GI Bill benefits, individuals on academic probation must resolve issues with the educational institution. They can re-enroll in the same program or submit a Request for Change of Program to the VA. Changes in programs must be recorded in the student's file and updated in VA-ONCE. To receive Pell Grants in subsequent academic years, students must complete a FAFSA annually. Renewal FAFSA can prefill prior-year information for simplification. Students must maintain satisfactory academic progress and can renew FAFSA online by correcting any changes. Most students receive renewal reminders for financial aid in January or February. After submitting FAFSA for the next academic year, eligibility is verified, aid is calculated and disbursed. Additional Pell Grant funds may be released during the academic term, with disbursements for subsequent payment periods. To receive a second Pell Grant disbursement, students must maintain satisfactory academic progress. Disbursements for subsequent payment periods may occur after 10 days prior to the start of the period. Disbursements for the second payment period in an academic year occur after 10 days prior to the start of the period, once the student completes the prior payment period. For certain programs, disbursement happens after completing 50% of instructional time or credit hours. Adjustments and disbursements must be recorded in COD. Pell awards may need to be recalculated if the EFC is corrected mid-period or if the student misses classes. If a student's enrollment rate changes between payment periods in the same award year, Pell Grant disbursements are recalculated based on the new enrollment rate. Institutions may have policies for recalculating Pell Grants in other situations. The financial aid administrator may need to adjust the rest of the aid package if the student's circumstances change, such as becoming ineligible or receiving more aid than allowed. An overaward occurs when a student receives more financial aid than they are eligible for according to HEA. Pell Grants are not adjusted in an overawarded package, adjustments must come from other forms of aid. If the overaward cannot be resolved, it becomes an overpayment. Satisfactory academic progress policies must meet federal standards. Students must maintain a minimum GPA and complete courses within a specified timeframe to remain eligible for Pell Grants. Failure to make satisfactory academic progress can result in ineligibility for Pell Grants, but students can regain eligibility by improving their academic performance. Special circumstances may be considered for students who fail to make satisfactory academic progress. Students who fail to make satisfactory academic progress due to special circumstances may appeal to be placed on financial aid probation for Pell Grant eligibility in the next payment period. Overpayments are a concern for Post-9/11 GI Bill participants and educational institutions, often occurring when the VA reduces benefits after overpaying tuition and fees. Participants may reduce course enrollment rates after the VA pays tuition and fees as a lump sum, leading to overpayments that individuals are responsible for resolving. Educational institutions may be liable for overpayments if they received funds directly from the VA, especially in cases where GI Bill participants fail to attend classes, withdraw early, pass away, receive incorrect payments, or submit amended enrollment certifications. The law holds educational institutions liable for overpayments caused by improper certification. If an overpayment occurs, LTS calculates the debt, notifies the VA's Debt Management Center, and sends a Notice of Indebtedness to the institution for resolution within 30 days. The institution must resolve or dispute the debt within 30 days. If not resolved, DMC will send additional notices, and if the debt remains unresolved after 60 days, it will be referred to the Treasury Offset Program for collection. TOP deducts the debt and an administrative fee from federal payments to the institution, remitting the funds to DMC for debt resolution. The collected funds are remitted to DMC for debt resolution. DMC reviews disputed debts with assistance from RPO, updates LTS, BDN, and TIMS. VA sends monthly reports listing school debts to SCOs. GI Bill participants are responsible for overpayments and are notified by LTS. Participants can repay the debt or request a payment agreement with the VA. The VA provides options for resolving debts, including requesting a payment agreement or waiver within specific timeframes. If no action is taken, DMC will send a demand letter, and the debt must be resolved with DMC within 30 days. If the debt is not resolved within 30 days, DMC sends a demand letter, followed by a warning letter after 30 days. If the debt remains unresolved after 60 days, DMC notifies credit agencies and refers the debt to TOP. If still not resolved within 60 days, the debt is sent to private collection agencies. Educational institutions also calculate any refunds or amounts owed by the GI Bill participant. In 2013, VA identified $870,000 in improper payments for various educational assistance programs. Overpayments of Pell Grant funds may include student debt and institution debt, which must be returned to ED. Schools are liable for incorrect payments and may face fines or prison sentences for errors. If school officials knowingly make false statements, they may face fines or prison sentences. The Return of Title IV funds must be initiated if an overpayment occurs, and the amount does not include the student's responsibility. Schools must have cash reserves to return funds within 45 days if a student withdraws. Funds can be returned through various methods, and must be returned within 30 days if the student fails to attend. Returned funds must be recorded in COD, and schools may seek to recover funds from the student. The IHE may seek to recover returned funds from students, but this debt does not impact future HEA Title IV aid eligibility. Students are responsible for overpayments not covered by the IHE, such as errors on FAFSA or incorrect EFC calculations. The school may assist in repayment for overpayments under $25. The school may assist in repayment for overpayments under $25, while the student is responsible for overpayments not covered by the school. If the student fails to resolve the repayment within 45 days, the overpayment is referred to ED's Debt Resolution Service. The service helps students resolve defaulted HEA Title IV aid debt and offers a centralized web portal for the process. The rate of errors requiring extra funds decreased from 3.7% in 2008 to 3.1% in 2010, with the dollar amount nearly doubling from $17 billion to $32 billion during the same period. The section discusses issues and concerns related to the administration of benefit payments under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, including challenges, consequences, and potential solutions. Concerns have been raised about individuals maximizing the assistance available through the Post-9/11 GI Bill and Pell Grants. In 2008, Congress excluded GI Bill benefits from being counted in determining eligibility for HEA Title IV aid to maximize veteran eligibility for federal educational assistance. In 2012, legislation was enacted to support the best use of education benefits by veterans. Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits are administered by the SCO using VA systems, while Pell Grants are administered by the FAA using ED systems. Coordination between the two programs is not required, raising concerns among participants and advocacy organizations. Some participants and advocacy organizations are concerned about Post-9/11 GI Bill participants not being counseled on maximizing program benefits and minimizing future loan liability, especially in relation to Pell Grants and HEA Title IV loans. Combined SCO/FAA counseling may involve advising students to use HEA Title IV aid for an associate's degree at a community college and then combining Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits with HEA Title IV aid for higher education. It is important for recipients to be informed about accepting less HEA Title IV loan to align with their GI Bill benefits. The issue at hand is whether benefit recipients understand the best way to use GI Bill benefits and HEA Title IV aid. Options to maximize benefits include requiring joint review of educational objectives and benefits eligibility by the SCO, FAA, and student. Consideration of both benefits may be lost if the SCO and FAA are the same person, but merging administrative processes could help. In 2008, Congress excluded GI Bill benefits from certain calculations. In 2008, Congress excluded GI Bill benefits from HEA Title IV aid calculations to support veterans and military families. It is important for beneficiaries to receive financial counseling to understand coordination of benefits and make informed decisions. Key actions include selecting the Post-9/11 GI Bill and irrevocably relinquishing another GI Bill. The application process for the Post-9/11 GI Bill involves choosing the most advantageous GI Bill, with tools available for assistance. Some suggest mandatory benefit counseling, but this may be resource-intensive and unwelcome to eligible individuals. The application form for the Post-9/11 GI Bill requires individuals to choose between different GI Bill options, which some find confusing. Many veterans are unsure of their eligibility for specific GI Bills, leading to delays in receiving benefits. Suggesting benefit counseling before making a decision could help address this issue. Some servicemembers fail to transfer Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to eligible family members, causing disappointment for those who cannot transfer benefits after retirement. DOD and service branches provide outreach, but more education during the Transition Assistance Program could help address this issue. Pell Grant applicants do not need to make decisions on program eligibility. Applicants and recipients do not need to decide on program eligibility. LTS or the VCE may default on selecting a GI Bill or relinquishing it. Congress could consolidate or eliminate some GI Bills to prevent multiple eligibility. Pell Grant eligible students may choose not to accept the award for future use. FAAs are not required to help students decline Pell awards. Post-9/11 GI Bill claimants and SCOs seek real-time claim status information. The VA call center is not easily accessible for real-time claim status information. eBenefits provides details on entitlement and school enrollment but lacks real-time access to claim status and payment amounts. The HEA Title IV aid process offers more immediate information on FAFSA status and Pell Grant applicants must contact their FAA for real-time updates on secondary school processing. The VA has improved claim processing speeds since 2009, but complaints persist about the time it takes to process original claims. Additional funds for IT improvements could streamline initial claims processing. System issues, errors on applications, and missing information require extra time to resolve. For example, VADIR lacks some service information, and interfaces like VONAPP and LTS are not currently connected. The VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) has identified issues with delayed processing due to inaccurate and incomplete applications, particularly with irrevocable election selection. Errors in RPO and LTS systems have also been noted, such as miscalculations of qualifying service length and payment errors. Similar audit findings in HEA Title IV aid processing include incorrect Pell Grant calculations. Suggestions for improvement include better education for veterans on application forms and enhancing internal controls and training for processing accuracy. The VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) has identified issues with delayed processing due to inaccurate and incomplete applications, particularly with irrevocable election selection. Errors in RPO and LTS systems have also been noted, such as miscalculations of qualifying service length and payment errors. Suggestions for expediting processing and improving calculation accuracy include IT systems improvements, simplification of eligibility requirements, and enhanced training for processing accuracy. Despite mature HEA Title IV aid IT systems, FAFSA data entry errors must be corrected manually, leading to an administrative burden on educational institutions and training establishments. The VA OIG found issues with delayed processing of Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits due to inaccurate and incomplete applications. Educational institutions have developed their own systems to track data and administer benefits. SCOs and FAAs face additional burdens in administering these benefits, similar to the challenges with Pell Grants. Some IHEs struggle with accurately reporting changes in student enrollment status and monitoring academic progress, leading to students receiving aid they are not eligible for. Both GI Bill and Pell Grant programs pay institutions to offset administrative costs. It is challenging for federal agencies to adapt to the various tracking systems used by educational institutions. A single interface or system could streamline benefit calculations for both VA and ED. The VA implemented short-term solutions to reduce processing times for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, with average processing time decreasing to 17 days for initial claims and six days for supplemental claims in FY2014. Late payments were a long-standing issue, but improvements were made through an automated processing system. In 2014, the VA Office of Inspector General found delays in processing when Certs are submitted late, recommending improved education for veterans and SCOs on responsibilities. Some educational institutions make allowances for late tuition payments by Post-9/11 GI Bill recipients. There are reports of participants having to change housing arrangements due to payment delays. Anecdotal evidence suggests that Post-9/11 GI Bill participants have faced housing and school issues due to delayed payments. Expediting payments through automation and system integration could help reduce processing times. Additional training and outreach by VA, State Approving Agencies, and VA Education Liaison Representatives may improve the accuracy and timeliness of certifications. Timing of housing allowance payments has been problematic for some individuals. Some individuals face issues with housing allowance payments. Pell Grant awards provide a lump sum payment before the start of the payment period, which could help with housing costs. Consideration for a similar lump sum payment for Post-9/11 GI Bill recipients may lead to overpayments and debts. Variation in tuition and fees payment amounts from term to term is also a concern. The VA allows individuals attending private educational institutions to receive the maximum annual tuition and fees benefit in the first academic term of the academic year if eligible. Subsequent terms may have lower or $0 benefits unless eligible for Yellow Ribbon payment. For example, a student in academic year 2014-2015 could receive Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits for tuition and fees. The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides varying tuition and fees benefits for different academic terms, with a maximum cap for the academic year. Pell Grant disbursement methodology aims to avoid payment inconsistencies by prorating the award amount based on expected payment periods. Implementing a similar methodology for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits at private and foreign institutions could help reduce payment variations. However, there are potential issues that may arise with this change. Pell Grant recipients may not receive the full award if they miss payment periods, impacting Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits and attendance decisions. Issues with overpayments and debt resolution have caused difficulties for educational institutions and participants. Educational institutions and participants face confusion and punitive processes in resolving overpayments and debts, leading to students dropping out, debt reassignment, and credit rating reductions. To address this, the VA could enhance communication by improving explanations in notification letters, providing real-time information on overpayment status, and offering online resolution options. The VA could improve communication by providing VCEs with access to claimant information and consider alternate forms of communication. They could also change the process for mitigating adverse consequences, such as implementing monthly enrollment certification to reduce overpayments. The VA could implement various strategies to address overpayments, such as inducing or penalizing SCOs for timely adjustments, initiating minimal collections from future benefits, offsetting future payments until overpayments are resolved, and improving coordination between RPO, DMC, and Treasury to prevent penalties for sending payments to the wrong entity. Issues arise when assigning responsibility for HEA Title IV overpayments, with IHEs determining whether the student or institution is accountable. Errors in calculating Return of Title IV Funds by IHEs, such as using incorrect dates or making mathematical mistakes, are a major concern for ED. IHEs often make errors in calculating the amount of funds due to incorrect dates or mathematical mistakes. They also fail to adhere to ED regulations and policies on returning funds in a timely manner. Request for a simplified process and more time to process returns has been made. Failure to resolve GI Bill or Pell Grant overpayments within specified timeframes results in loss of future benefits and debts being referred to VA DMC, ED's Debt Resolution Services, and Treasury. The administration of Post-9/11 GI Bill vocational flight training, apprenticeships, tutorial assistance, and certification tests differs significantly from other education programs. Certification for flight training involves completing VA-ONCE or VA FORM 22-1999 to indicate eligibility and the training plan. The form for Post-9/11 GI Bill vocational flight training requires identifying information, program name, pilot's license certification, medical certificate confirmation, credit for previous education, training hours, dates, charges, and signatures. Flight schools not IHLs must certify monthly training hours using VA-ONCE or VA FORM 22-6553c. The form also includes course details, instruction type, horsepower, charges, total costs, medical certification, completion/interruption status, remarks, and student/SCO signatures. The completed form is signed by the student and SCO and then mailed. The Certification of Apprenticeships or On-the-Job Training Certs is completed on paper or via email, using VA Form 22-1999 or training establishment letterhead. It certifies training completed in the previous month, must be submitted by the last calendar day of that month, and signed by the individual and certifying official. It includes details like program of education, training dates, hours worked, and must be accompanied by a signed training agreement. The training agreement, completed using VA Form 22-8864 or a similar method, outlines the training program, wage scale, trainee details, previous experience, planned training period, skills to be achieved, and educational curriculum. It must be signed by the VA Education Liaison Representative, trainee, and training establishment representative. The ELR facilitates program approval, ensures compliance with laws and policies, and liaises with educational institutions and training establishments. Individuals pursuing OJT or apprenticeship programs may also enroll in NCD programs. For example, those seeking permanent employment as police officers may attend a NCD program at a law enforcement academy and pursue OJT through a field training program. Certification of Tutorial Assistance (VA Form 22-1990t) is used to certify tutorial assistance received in the previous month(s). The individual must need tutoring to pass a required course and be enrolled at least half-time in a postsecondary program. The form requires identifying information, credit hour load, educational objective, course needing tutoring, and tutor's information. Certification of Correspondence Training is done by mail on VA Form 22-1999, requiring identifying information, type of training, program name, previous credits, and lesson details. The form must be signed by the SCO. Enrollment agreement for courses must be completed using VA Form 22-1999c, affirming suitability to student's abilities and interests. It includes student, course, date, institution, and credit details. The agreement must be signed and mailed to the institution for submission to the RPO. Reimbursement for licensing and certification tests requires certification by the individual. Application for reimbursement of approved tests must be completed for eligibility. To request reimbursement for approved licensing or certification tests, eligible individuals must complete VA Form 22-0803 or a self-prepared request. The form includes identifying information, test details, and proof of payment or test results. National tests require a signed request with test information and results submitted to the appropriate RPO within one year of taking the test. Eligible individuals seeking reimbursement for rural relocation expenses must complete VA Form 22-0848 with identifying information, addresses, relocation details, and proof of rural address. Flight certifications for non-IHL training are processed by verifying eligibility, medical certification, and program approval in TIMS. The VCE ensures program approval in WEAMS, reviews prior flight training Certs, calculates payment amounts, and verifies program pursuit. Apprenticeship, OJT, and correspondence training agreements are imaged into TIMS for verification of eligibility. The VCE also manually populates LTS and BDN, verifies program approval in WEAMS and COOL, and ensures compliance with training requirements. The VCE ensures program approval in WEAMS, reviews prior flight training Certs, calculates payment amounts, and verifies program pursuit. Licensing, certification, and national test Certs are imaged into TIMS. The VCE re-verifies the claimant's eligibility as if issuing a COE and manually populates LTS and BDN. The VCE verifies that the program of education is approved. The VCE verifies program approval in WEAMS and COOL, ensuring claimant eligibility and entitlement. Payments are typically processed within two to three days of VCE authorization."
