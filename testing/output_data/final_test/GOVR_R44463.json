    "content": "The Department of Defense announced awarding a contract to Northrop Grumman to build the new Long Range Strike-Bomber (LRS-B), designated as the B-21 \"Raider.\" The B-21 is designed for conventional and nuclear roles, capable of operating with an onboard crew or remotely piloted. It is expected to enter service in the 2020s with an initial fleet of 100 aircraft, being one of the Air Force's top procurement priorities. The B-21 originated from the Air Force's Next-Generation Bomber program initiated in 2004. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review accelerated Air Force plans for a new bomber to enter service by 2018, leading to the development of the Next-Generation Bomber program. Northrop Grumman and a team of Boeing and Lockheed Martin competed in the program, with experience in modern bomber design. After the cancellation of the Next-Generation Bomber program in 2009, unresolved issues included whether it should be capable of unmanned operations and deliver nuclear weapons, adding complexity and cost. Following the cancellation of the Next-Generation Bomber program in 2009, the Air Force and DOD officials conducted a front-end analysis to consider different concepts for the long-range strike mission. Secretary Gates approved the development of an optionally manned penetrating bomber in 2011, which differs from the NGB in concept and cost. The NGB was more ambitious and expensive due to the assumption of operating independently, while the LRS-B will leverage support from existing Air Force platforms for intelligence and other functions. The cancellation of the Next-Generation Bomber program led to the development of the Long Range Strike (Bomber) program, also known as LRS-B. This program is part of a family of systems aimed at enabling the bomber in its long-range strike role. The Long Range Strike (Bomber) program, part of a family of systems, aims to support the bomber in its long-range strike role. Two LRS-B designs were submitted, with Northrop Grumman winning the contract. The B-21 bomber was designed with a large payload bay, classified range, and a target cost of $550 million per plane to encourage competition among manufacturers. The B-21 bomber, designed with a large payload bay and classified range, aims to achieve a $550 million cost target. Northrop's winning bid was estimated at $511 million per plane. The design resembles the B-2 with potential for unmanned operation in the future. Initial B-21s will be manned, with nuclear qualification expected two years after initial operational capability. Few technical details have been disclosed. The B-21 bomber's details such as size, stealth, structure, engines, weapons, and sensors remain classified, making cost evaluation difficult. Development progress prior to contract award was significant, with both competing designs at a high level of detail. Low-observable characteristics were thoroughly examined against current and future threats, with final designs complete down to individual access panels. The B-21 bomber's final designs were completed down to individual access panels, showing a high level of technical readiness. This readiness may explain the Air Force's anticipation of IOC approximately 10 years from contract award, compared to other complex aircraft like the F-22 and F-35 taking over 20 years. Major subsystem risk reduction was achieved, with both competitors incorporating existing subsystems with B-21-specific refinements. This effort reduces technological risk and shortens the time needed for the engineering and manufacturing development phase before production. Program officials stated that no further technology development is required to move B-21 to production, with the most challenging part being the integration of technologies in the EMD phase. The B-21 bomber is designed to be part of a larger network of sensors and communications systems, with open systems architecture allowing for easy integration of new technologies. The main challenge lies in integrating these technologies during the EMD phase, with potential adaptations needed in the future as external systems evolve. The B-21 bomber program is managed by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office, using nontraditional acquisition methods. Despite being one of the Air Force's largest programs, it has a smaller program office and will be subject to Nunn-McCurdy requirements. Initial acquisition of B-21s will occur in five low-rate production lots. Plans call for initial acquisition of B-21s to take place in five low-rate production lots totaling 21 aircraft. The development program began in 2015 with Northrop Grumman as the prime contractor. The Air Force announced the B-21 had passed its preliminary design review. DOD proposes to acquire the B-21 through a cost-plus-incentive-fee development contract followed by firm-fixed-price procurement. Projected annual funding for the B-21 has started to decline after increasing in recent years. The FY2017 budget proposal cut $3.5 billion from the previous projection while maintaining a similar growth rate. This revision was due to lower actual bids for the B-21 compared to budget estimates. The program is now expected to grow at a steady pace. The budget revision for the B-21 program maintains a steady growth rate from a lower baseline. Northrop Grumman plans to build the B-21 at Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale, CA, alongside other projects. The delivery schedule is undisclosed, but preparations for production are ongoing. Major subcontractors for the B-21 have been announced. Lockheed Martin will remain the principal supplier of purpose-built combat aircraft to the DOD, with a plan to procure a minimum of 100 B-21s to ensure sustained dominance well into the century and reduce lifecycle ownership costs. The Air Force confirmed the intention to acquire at least 100 B-21s and is studying the right size of the total future bomber force. The Air Force confirmed the procurement of a minimum of 100 B-21 Raider aircraft to replace existing strategic bombers. Initially, plans called for 132 B-2 bombers, but only 21 were ultimately procured. The B-21 fleet size was established as a minimum of 100, with a mix of legacy bombers to meet future combatant commander requirements. The Air Force plans to retire its B-2s and B-1s by 2040, with the full planned buy of 100 B-21s increasing the bomber fleet from 159 to 176. Some argue for a larger bomber force of 150 to 160 combat-coded bombers, requiring 200 B-21s. Secretary of the Air Force aims to increase the bomber fleet by seven squadrons. Observers note that the decision to acquire 75 additional B-21 bombers may be necessary, considering the trade-off between cost and effectiveness of new aircraft versus extending the service lives of existing B-52s, B-1s, and B-2s. The B-52s are scheduled to remain in service for 80 years, posing challenges in operating such an old aircraft. Despite upgrades, the actual maturity of the B-52 may not align with its age. Budget documents indicate the expected procurement of the B-21. The B-21 bomber is progressing well, with a potential initial operating capability in the late 2020s. Global Strike Command chief Gen. Robin Rand recommends the purchase of at least 100 bombers by the late '30s, with production expected to be around five per year. The move to a potential late 2020s IOC is not clear if it is due to program issues, budget constraints, or other factors. The Air Force remains committed to B-21 affordability. The Air Force Vice-Chief of Staff reaffirmed the commitment to B-21 affordability, citing an average procurement cost of $564 million in base year 2016 dollars. Many aspects of the B-21's design are classified, making cost validation challenging. The unclassified budget for the B-21 is only a portion of the total funding, with additional (presumably classified) funding likely. The B-21 is part of a family of systems, with ongoing work on enabling technologies. It is unclear how dependent the B-21 is on these systems for its missions, which could impact overall costs. The cost of the B-21 includes enabling systems, with the decision to make it nuclear-capable. Congress may need to consider the trade-off between this cost and other nuclear delivery methods. The contribution of each leg of the nuclear triad to deterrence is a longstanding debate. The debate over cost-effectiveness between penetrating platforms and standoff weapons, including the Long-Range Standoff Missile (LRSO) and the Arsenal Plane, is a key consideration for Congress in nuclear modernization programs like the B-21. Senator John McCain criticized the cost-plus-incentive-fee development contract for the B-21, advocating for a fixed-price contract instead. Senator John McCain criticized the cost-plus contract for the B-21 program, advocating for a fixed-price contract instead. Congress may need to evaluate the acquisition strategy to determine if subsystem risk reduction has reduced overall technology risk. They may also need to decide between fixing development costs or technology requirements. The DOD has found no correlation between contract type and cost or schedule growth. The winning bid for the B-21 was below DOD's estimates, raising concerns about contractors bidding low to later request higher appropriations. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts shift cost risk to the government, while firm-fixed-price contracts place more risk on the contractor. Congress may need to review DOD's cost estimation process to understand discrepancies between estimated and actual costs. The B-21 contract bid was lower than DOD's estimates, prompting concerns about contractors underbidding. Congress may need to review the cost estimation process to address discrepancies. The acquisition of B-21 through nontraditional means raises oversight challenges for Congress due to the program's size and rapid acquisition process. The B-21 program, designated as a Special Access Program, poses oversight challenges for Congress due to its rapid acquisition process. Congress may need to revise acquisition regulations to align with this process. Primary oversight responsibility lies with House and Senate committees with jurisdiction over national security classified information. The B-21 program, a Special Access Program, presents oversight challenges for Congress due to its rapid acquisition process. Congress may need to consider granting greater access to program data for Members not typically involved in defense issues. The FY2017 Consolidated Appropriations Act mandated a review of the secrecy surrounding B-21 development, with a report due by November 2017. Congress also authorized funding for the Ohio Replacement Program, SSBN(X), through a National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund in 2015. The National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund was established to fund U.S. strategic forces outside of service budgets, with the goal of separating nuclear deterrence funding from military service budgets to focus on modernization and recapitalization efforts. This move allows services to enhance their unique missions without the financial burden of deterrence forces. The National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund aims to separate nuclear deterrence funding from military service budgets to focus on modernization efforts. Reallocating funds to a DOD-wide deterrence fund may reduce overall amounts available for all services."
