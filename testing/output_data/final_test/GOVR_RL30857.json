Data on Speaker votes from 1913 to 2019 is shown in Table 1. The Speaker of the House is traditionally elected by roll call vote after a general election. Elections have also been held during a Congress due to the death or resignation of a sitting Speaker, occurring five times from 1936 to 2015. The data covers the period when the House has had a permanent size of 435 Members. The House has a permanent size of 435 Members since 1912. An absolute majority of Members present and voting is required to elect a Speaker, not a majority of the full membership. During certain elections for Speaker of the House, candidates have been elected with a bare majority of votes. This has occurred five times in history, with the most recent being in 2015 when John Boehner was elected with 216 votes. In 1931, John Nance Garner received 218 votes, a bare majority. The table does not consider vacancies in the House at the time of the election. During elections for Speaker of the House, candidates can be elected with a bare majority of votes. In 1923, a closely divided House failed to elect on the first roll call, with both major party nominees initially failing to gain a majority. Ultimately, the Republican candidate was elected after procedural reforms were agreed upon. During the period from 1913 to 1943, candidates other than those from the two major parties received votes in 11 out of 16 Congresses. This was influenced by the progressive movement, with additional nominations reflecting changing views of Members. The nominations displayed in the table reflect changing views of Members identifying themselves as \"progressives\" about whether to constitute themselves in the House as a separate Progressive Party caucus or as a wing of the Republican Party. The last formal Progressive Party nominee appeared in 1937, and by 1947, the last standard-bearer of the tendency accepted the Republican label. This marked the demise of the Progressive Party movement in the House, representing the final stage in the establishment of a two-party system at the national level. From 1945 through 1995, only the official nominees of the two major parties received votes for Speaker. Since 1997, there have been instances where Members voted for candidates other than the two major party nominees for Speaker, breaking the tradition that had been in place since 1943. This shift marks a departure from the established pattern of party loyalty in Speaker elections. In recent instances, votes for Speaker have reflected action by political factions or groupings. Only in the 2015 election were candidates other than those from party conferences formally nominated. Notable ballots in 1997, 2013, 2015, and 2019 included votes for non-Members of the House. While the Constitution doesn't require the Speaker to be a Member, they always have been. In 2001, a Member from one major party voted differently. In 2001, a Member from one major party voted for the nominee of the other, which was a rare occurrence in the history of the House. No such action had occurred for at least the previous half century."
