    "content": "This report provides technical and logistical information on the construction and reporting of the Chained Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (C-CPI-U) by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), highlighting differences from the standard Consumer Price Index (CPI) and discussing potential impacts on the federal budget deficit. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is crucial for adjusting Social Security benefits and income tax brackets. Changing the basis for indexing these programs could impact the budget deficit. Alan Greenspan suggested considering replacing the standard CPI with the Chained CPI in 2004. In 2004, Alan Greenspan suggested replacing the standard CPI with the C-CPI-U for federal programs to reduce the federal debt. Various reports and proposals have recommended this change, including the Simpson-Bowles report and the \"Gang of Six\" plan. The idea was also considered by the \"super committee\" created by the Budget Control Act of 2011. An amendment to the House's FY2013 budget resolution proposed using the Simpson-Bowles recommendations. In 2012, a bipartisan amendment based on the Simpson-Bowles report to switch to the C-CPI-U for budgeting failed. However, interest in this change remains among some Members of Congress. In 2013, a modified version of the Chained CPI-U proposal was included in President Obama's budget for Fiscal Year 2014. The reason for considering the C-CPI-U is to address criticisms of the standard CPI as a measure of cost of living changes. A true cost-of-living index would measure the income change needed for consumers to maintain satisfaction, but practical complications make it challenging to construct. Consumers allocate income based on satisfaction from goods and services within budget constraints. Cost of living indicators rely on actual consumer spending as utility is not directly measurable. Estimating changes is challenging due to evolving spending patterns driven by preferences and price fluctuations. Consumers adjust purchases based on price changes, buying more of cheaper goods and less of pricier ones. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has worked to improve the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to better reflect changes in the cost of living. A panel of experts recommended using the CPI for tax indexation and suggested adjusting poverty thresholds based on median income or consumption levels. The panel recommended adjusting poverty thresholds based on median income or consumption levels and supported using the Chained Consumer Price Index for more accurate adjustments to federal payments. However, switching to the C-CPI-U poses challenges despite its ability to better account for substitution bias in reflecting changes in the cost of living. The C-CPI-U is constructed to better account for substitution bias in consumer spending patterns, unlike the standard CPI which overestimates the increase in the cost of living. It measures changes in retail prices of a fixed mix of goods and services, while consumers can adjust their spending to mitigate inflation effects. The fixed-weight index calculates prices of goods and services purchased by consumers using weighted sums. The standard CPI is a modified version that updates the market basket periodically to reflect current spending patterns. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) updates the market basket every two years to reflect current spending patterns. Despite this, the standard CPI is still subject to substitution bias. To address this, the Bureau of Labor Statistics introduced a supplemental measure called the Chained Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers. The Chained Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (C-CPI-U) was introduced to produce a measure of change in consumer prices free of upper-level substitution bias. It uses a T\u00f6rnqvist index formula based on actual consumer behavior to account for any substitution across categories in response to price changes. The final version of the C-CPI-U is calculated based on actual consumer behavior, not assumptions about substitution. BLS estimated a 0.3 percentage point decrease in cost-of-living growth due to upper-level substitution. The T\u00f6rnqvist index requires expenditure data with a long lag time, so the final C-CPI-U cannot be published concurrently with the standard CPI. However, an initial estimate is released each month using a geometric mean formula. In February, the initial estimates for the previous year are revised using the same formula, known as the \"interim\" release. The final C-CPI-U estimates based on the T\u00f6rnqvist formula are released the following February. The final C-CPI-U estimates based on the T\u00f6rnqvist formula are released in February. The geometric mean formula assumes consumer response to price changes, potentially overstating substitution bias. The C-CPI-U index may overstate substitution bias by assuming consumers respond more to price changes than they actually do. The index is calculated using a geometric mean formula and adjusted based on historical differences with the T\u00f6rnqvist index to improve accuracy. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is working to reduce the lag between preliminary and final index numbers, although final data remains untimely. For example, data for January 2009 was released in February 2011. The final release of C-CPI-U data has a significant lag, with data for January 2009 not being released until February 2011. The final release for any January C-CPI-U is 25 months, while for December it is 14 months. The C-CPI-U data is available from December 1999 onwards, and there have been instances where the final C-CPI-U increase is smaller than the standard CPI increase. The final release of C-CPI-U data has a significant lag, with a delay of 25 months for January data and 14 months for December data. Revisions between interim and final releases have shown significant changes in some years, with smaller increases in the C-CPI-U compared to the standard CPI. The C-CPI-U has implications for budget indexing of tax provisions and federal programs. If it better reflects changes in the cost of living, adjustments could be based on it. However, final data are delayed up to two years. The Social Security cost of living adjustment for 2013 was 1.7%, based on the average CPI-W for the third quarter of 2011. The final C-CPI-U data for the third quarter of 2012 will not be available until February 2014, causing a potential delay in using it for automatic adjustments. Using preliminary C-CPI-U estimates as an alternative may face opposition from Social Security beneficiaries and taxpayers due to its tendency to rise less than other indexes. The elderly and their advocates opposed changing the current basis for indexation, as it may not enable them to maintain their standard of living if prices increase at an above-average rate. The CPI-E for those aged 62 and older has increased faster than the CPI-W, but it is unclear if the cost of living for the elderly rises more quickly due to rising healthcare prices. The CPI-E for those aged 62 and older increases faster than the CPI-W, potentially due to rising healthcare prices. The U.S. Congressional Budget Office estimated that switching to the C-CPI-U could result in a $99.5 billion increase in revenues between FY2014 and FY2023. Switching from the CPI-W to the C-CPI-U for Social Security COLAs and federal pensions could result in a cumulative decline in outlays of $111 billion between FY2014 and FY2024. This change would decrease the federal deficit by $232.7 billion, with $142.9 billion considered \"on-budget\"."
