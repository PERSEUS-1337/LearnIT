    "content": "FATCA requires FFIs to report information about U.S. account holders and comply with IRS agreements. Failure to comply results in a 30% tax withholding on payments from U.S. sources. This affects foreign banks, investment funds, broker-dealers, and insurance companies. Compliance is crucial due to the global importance of U.S. banks. The global financial community must comply with reporting and withholding requirements under FATCA to avoid being prevented from conducting business. The United States has bilateral agreements with many countries to implement these requirements. Criticism has been raised about the unilateral approach of FATCA and its impact on entities outside the U.S. Questions have been raised about potential conflicts with existing U.S. treaty obligations. The concerns surrounding FATCA include potential conflicts with existing U.S. treaty obligations, handling conflict of law issues, and intrusion into other countries' sovereignty. The Treasury Department and IRS developed IGAs to involve other countries in implementing FFI reporting requirements. Two model IGAs serve as the basis for all current agreements. As of August 1, 2016, there are 63 IGAs in force, with different versions of Model 1 and Model 2 agreements depending on existing tax treaties or TIEAs. Model 1 IGAs may use existing treaties as authority, while Model 2 does not have a reciprocal exchange provision. As of August 1, 2016, there are 63 IGAs in force, with different versions of Model 1 and Model 2 agreements depending on existing tax treaties or TIEAs. Model 2 does not have a reciprocal exchange provision. Some countries are treated as having an IGA in effect even if the agreement is not fully enforced, based on certain conditions outlined by the Treasury Department and IRS. In July 2016, the IRS announced that countries without an IGA in force will no longer be treated as having one in effect in 2017 unless they meet specific requirements by December 31, 2016. Countries in the final two columns of Table 3 must provide a detailed explanation and plan to the Treasury Department to continue being treated as having an IGA in effect. The Treasury Department will decide based on the country's explanation, plan, and prior conduct. If deemed inappropriate, affected FFIs will have at least 60 days to comply. The IRS announced in July 2016 that countries without an IGA in force will no longer be treated as having one in effect in 2017 unless they meet specific requirements by December 31, 2016. The Treasury Department will monitor the country's progress towards bringing the IGA into force and will reconsider the country's treatment if it fails to comply with the step-by-step plan. FATCA provides confidentiality protections to the information obtained under the FFI reporting requirements. The FFI reporting provisions under FATCA provide confidentiality protections to the information obtained, allowing disclosure only for FATCA compliance or as permitted under IRC Section 6103. Violations of these protections may result in civil damages in U.S. district court, with potential punitive damages, court costs, and attorney's fees. Any lawsuit must be filed within two years of discovering the unlawful activity. The IGAs provide confidentiality protections for exchanged information, referencing existing tax treaties or TIEAs. Competent Authorities must ensure confidentiality safeguards are in place before sharing information. The IGAs provide confidentiality protections for exchanged tax information, ensuring that information received is kept confidential and only disclosed as necessary for fulfilling obligations under the agreement. This includes restrictions on disclosure to third parties unless required for legal proceedings related to the agreement. The curr_chunk states that information related to U.S. federal taxes can only be disclosed to specific authorities for tax assessment, collection, enforcement, and legal proceedings. Disclosure is limited to authorized purposes, such as public court proceedings or with prior consent for mutual legal assistance treaty purposes. Confidentiality is required by U.S. law for tax treaty information. The law requires that tax treaty information be kept confidential, with limited exceptions for disclosure, such as for law enforcement purposes. Unauthorized disclosure can result in penalties and imprisonment. Some argue that using IGAs can have benefits, while others have concerns, as seen in recent lawsuits. The lawsuit Crawford v. Department of the Treasury challenges the constitutionality of IGAs, arguing they override statutory provisions and fall outside the President's authority. The lawsuit Crawford v. Department of the Treasury challenges the constitutionality of IGAs, arguing they override statutory provisions passed by Congress in FATCA. In April 2016, a U.S. district court in Ohio dismissed the case after determining that the plaintiffs lacked standing, as required by Article III of the U.S. Constitution. The court in Crawford ruled that none of the plaintiffs had met all three requirements to challenge the constitutionality of IGAs under FATCA. Plaintiffs have appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, awaiting a decision that could potentially affect the administration of FATCA. FATCA's reporting and enforcement provisions would still apply even if IGAs were found unconstitutional. Congress may need to consider authorizing these agreements or reevaluating FATCA without IGAs. The Treasury Department and IRS could potentially implement agreements through the regular treaty process if IGAs are deemed useful. The Canadian litigation on FATCA concerns the validity of the country's IGA. In the case, dual U.S.-Canadian citizens argue that the IGA conflicts with tax treaties and Canadian law. The Federal Court of Canada ruled in 2015 that the IGA could be implemented under existing laws, allowing information exchange. The constitutional claim is still pending, with potential implications if the IGA is found invalid. If the Canadian court deems the IGA invalid under the constitution, it may not change FATCA's requirements for Canadian financial entities. This could lead to conflicts of law and potential solutions like amending the income tax treaty. U.S. expatriates in other countries might challenge their IGAs, similar to the Canadian case. Bills in Congress aim to address FATCA, such as S. 663 to repeal violations of sovereign nations. The Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act (H.R. 297 and S. 174) aims to strengthen FATCA by expanding reporting requirements and definitions. The Commission on Americans Living Abroad Act (H.R. 3078) proposes establishing a commission to study the impact of federal laws and policies, including FATCA. The Commission on Americans Living Abroad Act (H.R. 3078) aims to establish a commission to study how federal laws and policies, including FATCA, impact U.S. citizens living in foreign countries. The countries with IGAs in effect are listed in Table A-1, along with information on whether they use Model 1 or Model 2 IGA and relevant dates."
