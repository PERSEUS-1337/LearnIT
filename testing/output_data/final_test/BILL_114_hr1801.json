This includes an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code to establish excellence in economic education. The Act \"Promoting Financial Literacy and Economic Opportunity Act of 2015\" introduces a tax credit for eligible for-profit organizations that promote economic education. The credit is 50% of expenses incurred for purposes specified in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The credit is limited to 20 organizations per year, determined by the Secretary in consultation with the Secretary of Education. The Act \"Promoting Financial Literacy and Economic Opportunity Act of 2015\" introduces a tax credit for eligible for-profit organizations that promote economic education. The credit is available for a taxable year as determined by the Secretary. The majority of recipients must be socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns, small business concerns owned by veterans, or entities that meet an asset test. The Act \"Promoting Financial Literacy and Economic Opportunity Act of 2015\" introduces a tax credit for eligible for-profit organizations that promote economic education. The credit is available for a taxable year as determined by the Secretary. Priority is given to taxpayers with qualified programs serving socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns, small business concerns owned by veterans, or entities meeting an asset test. Taxpayers with qualified programs serving urban or rural underserved areas can receive a tax credit. 25% of the credit is for direct activities, and 75% is for subgrants. The section defines a \"qualified program\" as one that promotes economic and financial literacy, meeting specific requirements. An \"eligible for profit organization\" is defined as an organization with a qualified program in effect for a taxable year. The organization must have a qualified program in effect for the taxable year and be determined by the Secretary to be eligible for the credit. Assets are determined using the same method as the Federal Reserve. Taxpayers can elect not to claim the credit, and the section coordinates with other deductions or credits. The amount of any deduction or credit allowable under this chapter for amounts in subsection (a) is reduced by the credit allowed in this section. The Secretary will issue regulations to implement this section. The credit is included in the general business credit under section 38 of the Internal Revenue Code. The table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding a new item. The amendments made by this section regarding excellence in economic education will apply to taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act."
