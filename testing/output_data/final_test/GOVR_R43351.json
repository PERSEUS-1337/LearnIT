The Department of Education administers these programs, with Title IV programs being the most prominent, providing financial assistance to students and families. The Higher Education Act (HEA) provides financial assistance to students and institutions. In FY2017, $122.5 billion was given to 12.9 million students. The HEA was first enacted in 1965 and has been reauthorized multiple times. The most recent reauthorization was in 2008 under the Higher Education Opportunity Act. The SAFRA Act made changes to the HEA in 2010. Authorization for appropriations for many HEA programs expired in FY2014. The Higher Education Act (HEA) provides financial assistance to students and institutions. Appropriations for many HEA programs expired in FY2014 but were extended through FY2015. Congress provided appropriations beyond 2015 under various legislation. The HEA is organized into eight titles, each covering different aspects of education programs. The Higher Education Act (HEA) is organized into eight titles, with Title I laying out definitions and provisions for most programs authorized by the HEA. Appendix A provides appropriations figures from FY2015 to FY2018, Appendix B covers the General Education Provisions Act, and Appendix C details the eight comprehensive reauthorizations of the HEA. Other CRS reports offer more in-depth analysis of HEA provisions. Participation in HEA programs, including Title IV FSA programs, is defined in Section 102 of the Higher Education Act. This includes various types of institutions such as proprietary, vocational, and foreign institutions.

The Strengthening Institutions Program (SIP) is the foundational program under Title III-A, offering competitive grants to eligible institutions with low educational expenditures and a high percentage of students receiving need-based aid. The Strengthening Institutions Program (SIP) provides grants to eligible institutions with low educational expenditures and high student need. Authorized uses for grant funds include facilities improvement, faculty development, curriculum development, and student services. Grantees can also establish endowments with SIP grants, but must provide matching funds and limit endowment use to 20% of grant monies. The Strengthening American Indian and Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities (TCCUs) program provides formula grants to TCCUs that meet specific criteria and qualify for funding under certain acts. The Strengthening Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions (ANNHs) program offers competitive grants to institutions with a certain percentage of Alaska Native or Native Hawaiian students.

The Strengthening Predominantly Black Institutions (PBIs) program provides grants to institutions meeting specific criteria, including being accredited, enrolling at least 1,000 undergraduates with 40% Black American students, and having a significant number of needy students. PBIs cannot be designated as Historically Black Colleges or Hispanic-serving institutions. Needy student enrollment requires at least 50% of degree-seeking undergraduates to be Pell Grant recipients. The Pell Grant recipients, students from families receiving federal benefits, those from eligible Title I schools, and first-generation college students, who are mostly low-income, receive formula-based grants. These grants are distributed based on the institution's percentage of Pell Grant recipients, graduates, and those pursuing higher degrees.

No need-based qualification is necessary, but other eligibility criteria must be met. The FFEL program provided federal student loans, including Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, PLUS Loans, and Consolidation Loans. It was the main source of federal student loans until the SAFRA Act terminated new loans after June 30, 2010. The program offered similar loans as the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program. The FFEL program differed from the Direct Loan program in administration. Loans were originated by private lenders, funded with nonfederal capital, and guaranteed by the government. Lenders were responsible for servicing the loans, and borrowers remain responsible for payments despite the program's termination. The FFEL program loans have been terminated, but borrowers are still responsible for payments. Loan holders service the loans, and guaranty agencies administer the federal loan insurance program. Approximately $305.8 billion in outstanding FFEL program loans are due to be repaid. Part C of Title IV authorizes the Federal Work-Study programs (FWS) to provide part-time employment to students in need of earnings for their studies and community service activities. The Federal Work-Study program provides part-time employment to students with financial need. Awards are based on factors like financial need, availability of funds, and willingness to work. Students receive compensation for hours worked, with a federal share of 75% and a nonfederal share of at least 25%. Employers can be institutions, nonprofits, government agencies, or for-profit entities. Institutions must allocate funds for community service jobs and tutoring projects. The Federal Work-Study program supports work-learning-service programs at select institutions known as \"work colleges.\" The program includes an Off-Campus Community Service Employment program, which provides grants to institutions for off-campus community service employment activities. Funding for this program was only provided in FY2010 and has not received appropriations since. The Direct Loan program, authorized under Part D of Title IV, provides federal student loans directly to students using federal capital. Loan origination and servicing are handled by federal contractors, offering various types of loans such as Direct Subsidized, Unsubsidized, PLUS, and Direct loans. The Direct Loan program offers various types of federal student loans, including Direct Subsidized, Unsubsidized, PLUS, and Consolidation Loans. The terms and conditions of these loans are determined by statutory provisions, and the program is classified as a federal credit program for budgeting purposes. Costs associated with the program are accounted for on an accrual basis according to the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. The Direct Loan program offers various types of federal student loans, including Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans. Subsidized loans are for undergraduates with financial need, with the government paying the interest during certain periods. Unsubsidized loans are available to undergraduates, graduates, and professionals without the need for financial need demonstration. Interest rates are set by statute, with loans disbursed after July 1, 2013, having fixed rates indexed to the market. Direct PLUS Loans are available to parents of dependent undergraduate students and to graduate and professional students. Borrowers do not need to demonstrate financial need to obtain these loans. However, borrowers with an adverse credit history are ineligible to borrow PLUS Loans unless another individual agrees to serve as an endorser. Interest rates are set by statute, and loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2013, are made with market-indexed fixed interest rates. Consolidation Loans allow borrowers to combine loans. Consolidation Loans allow borrowers to combine multiple federal loans into a single loan, simplifying repayment and potentially extending the repayment period. Interest rates are determined by averaging the rates of the loans being consolidated. Part E of Title IV authorizes the Federal Perkins Loan program, which provides low-interest loans to students with exceptional financial need. The Federal Perkins Loan program provided low-interest loans to undergraduate and graduate students with exceptional financial need, funded by federal and institutional capital contributions. The program offered a fixed 5% interest rate, no interest accrual before repayment, and loan cancellation for public service. New Perkins Loans were no longer authorized after September 30, 2017, and institutions were required to return federal funds. The Federal Perkins Loan program has ended new loan authorizations, with institutions now responsible for repayments on outstanding loans. Institutions can retain remaining funds after remitting the federal share, and borrowers are still required to make payments. Approximately $7.4 billion in outstanding Perkins Loans is due for repayment. Part F of Title IV establishes the need analysis methodology for student eligibility for need-based aid. Part F of Title IV establishes three EFC formulas for determining student eligibility for need-based aid based on the difference between the institution's cost of attendance and the student's expected family contribution. Dependency status is determined by age and other factors, with formulas considering the financial resources of the student, parents, and spouse. EFC is calculated using information from the FAFSA, including tax information. Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) uses tax information from two years prior to the award year to calculate the Expected Family Contribution (EFC). The EFC formulas consider income and assets of the student and family members. Those with an AGI below $50,000 may qualify for a Simplified Needs Test (SNT), requiring less financial information on the FAFSA. Applicants with an AGI below $25,000 in AY2018-2019 may be eligible for additional aid. Students with an AGI at or below $25,000 in AY2018-2019 may qualify for an automatic zero EFC, bypassing the EFC formula. Those who do not qualify can still receive a calculated zero EFC based on financial characteristics. A zero EFC allows students to receive the maximum amount of need-based federal aid, such as the Pell Grant. Part G of Title IV outlines institutional requirements for participation, including program participation agreements and a master calendar requirement. Part G of Title IV outlines requirements for student aid administration, including eligibility criteria, citizenship requirements, academic progress standards, fund return procedures, and information dissemination obligations for institutions. Part G of Title IV covers various aspects of student aid administration, such as graduation rates, financial aid counseling, campus crime statistics, credit transfer policies, and the National Student Loan Data System. It also includes provisions for wage garnishment, penalties for fraud, support for members of the Armed Forces and veterans, and authorization for income-based repayment plans. The Committee on Student Financial Assistance was authorized under Part G until FY2015. Part H of Title IV outlines the program integrity triad, consisting of state authorization, accreditation by ED-recognized agencies, and certification by ED. IHEs must meet all three requirements to participate in Title IV FSA programs. States are responsible for authorizing IHEs to operate postsecondary programs within their boundaries and must notify ED of any fraud or revocation of an IHE's authorization. The curr_chunk discusses the criteria for recognizing accrediting agencies as reliable authorities for determining education quality, as well as the eligibility and certification procedures administered by ED for institutions participating in Title IV FSA programs. It also mentions the Secretary's authorization to implement a pilot student loan auction program for lenders. The Secretary has authorized a pilot student loan auction program for lenders to obtain rights to disburse FFEL program parent PLUS loans, although this program is currently inapplicable. Title V provides institutional support to Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs) under the HEA, offering competitive grants for facilities improvement, faculty development, curriculum development, and student services.
