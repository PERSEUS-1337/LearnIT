    "content": "The Ethics Reform Act of 1989 establishes provisions for setting pay rates for federal officials, including a quadrennial review by a Citizens' Commission on Public Service and Compensation. Recommendations are made to equalize salaries for various positions, such as the Speaker of the House, Vice President, and Chief Justice of the United States. The salary parity for various federal officials, including Members of the House, Judges, and Executive Schedule Level II, is established by the Ethics Reform Act. The provision for quadrennial review by a Citizens' Commission has not been activated since its funding was rescinded in 1994. Another provision in the Act allows for annual salary adjustments based on changes in wages and salaries. The adjustment in judges' pay is based on the percentage change in wages and salaries for private industry workers, minus 0.5%. It cannot be less than zero or greater than 5%, and is tied to the annual base pay rate adjustment for federal white-collar civilian employees. Any salary increase for Justices and judges must be specifically authorized by Congress. The pay adjustment for federal officials under the EX takes effect automatically unless Congress intervenes. Congressional action has historically occurred during the appropriations bill for the Department of the Treasury and General Government. Instances of pay parity being maintained or broken have occurred in past Congresses. For example, in the 103rd Congress, legislation was passed to forgo a pay adjustment in 1994, resulting in no pay raise for Members and federal officials. In January 1994, executive and judicial officials did not receive a pay raise. Pay parity would have been broken if Members had received a pay adjustment. A provision to cut spending in FY2000 included Member pay reduction but not for federal officials. In the 109th Congress, Members were denied a pay adjustment in January 2006. On October 18, 2005, the Senate agreed to an amendment denying Members a pay raise in H.R. 3058. In January 2007, Members of Congress and Justices did not receive a pay increase as authorized by Congress in P.L. 110-5. Justices and judges also did not receive a pay adjustment in 2007. In January 2007, Members of Congress and Justices did not receive a pay increase as authorized by Congress in P.L. 110-5. In January 2010, federal officials on the EX schedule received a 1.5% pay increase, while Members of Congress and Justices did not. Section 103 of Division J of P.L. 111-8 denied Members a pay adjustment in 2010. Justices and judges also did not receive a pay adjustment in 2010. S. 1432 was introduced to provide the 2010 authorization but no further action occurred. In January 2011, federal civilian white-collar employees paid under the General Schedule (GS) did not receive a pay adjustment, in line with the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990. Members of Congress, the Vice President, federal officials on the EX schedule, and Justices and judges also did not receive a pay adjustment. President Obama's budget included a freeze on pay for senior political officials. The budget in January 2011 froze pay for senior political officials, including Members of Congress, federal officials on the EX schedule, and Justices and judges. The pay adjustment for these officials was limited to 1.1%, in line with the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990. Additionally, GS base pay was frozen through December 31, 2012, as per P.L. 111-322. In January 2012, the Vice President, federal officials on the EX schedule, and Justices and judges will not receive a pay adjustment. Recommendations have been made to determine salary adjustments for these officials separately from federal white-collar civilian employees under the GS. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist emphasized that judicial compensation should not be tied to non-career public servants' pay increases. The National Commission on the Public Service recommended separate salary adjustments for executive branch officials and federal judiciary to recruit and retain the best people. Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. reiterated the need for immediate and substantial increase in judicial salaries due to inadequate pay adjustments. Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. expressed concerns about the decline in quality of federal judges due to inadequate compensation. He highlighted the shift in where judges come from, with more now coming from the private sector than the practicing bar. This change threatens the viability of life tenure and the independence judges need to uphold the rule of law. The Federal Judicial Fairness Act of 2009, S. 2725, aimed to address concerns about declining quality of federal judges due to inadequate compensation. The bill, introduced by Senator Dianne Feinstein, sought to repeal the provision requiring Congress to authorize salary increases for Justices and judges. This was in response to Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.'s worries about the judiciary being limited to wealthy individuals or those seeking a pay increase. The Federal Judicial Fairness Act of 2009 aimed to address concerns about declining quality of federal judges by repealing the provision requiring Congress to authorize salary increases for Justices and judges. It would have aligned their pay adjustments with those of federal white-collar civilian employees."
