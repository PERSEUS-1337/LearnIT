Section 101 is also amended to include findings, purposes, and policy. The Congress finds that in 1993, there are over 3,000,000 individuals with developmental disabilities in the United States. Disability is a natural part of the human experience and individuals with developmental disabilities have the right to live independently, make choices, and contribute to society. However, they face discrimination and lack public awareness of their capabilities. Individuals with developmental disabilities often have severe and lifelong needs for specialized services, but many lack access to appropriate support. Individuals with developmental disabilities require specialized services and support, but many are underserved. Family, friends, and the community can enhance their lives with necessary services. The nation's goals should include providing opportunities for individuals with developmental disabilities to make informed choices, live independently, pursue meaningful lives, and contribute to society. The purpose of this Act is to ensure individuals with developmental disabilities have access to culturally competent services that promote independence, productivity, and integration into the community. This includes support for State Developmental Disabilities Councils to facilitate systemic change and advocacy. The Act aims to provide a comprehensive system of services and supports for individuals with developmental disabilities and their families. This includes support for protection and advocacy systems, university programs for student preparation and research dissemination, and national initiatives for data collection and technical assistance. The Act aims to support individuals with developmental disabilities and their families through various programs and activities. It is the policy of the United States that all assistance provided under this Act should promote independence, productivity, and integration for individuals with developmental disabilities. Individuals with developmental disabilities and their families are the primary decision-makers for services and supports, which should be provided with respect for personal dignity and cultural differences. Individuals with developmental disabilities should be accepted and supported by communities, enriching them through active participation. They should have opportunities for inclusion, support, interdependent relationships, and the ability to make contributions to their families, communities, states, and nation. Technical amendments are made to the Protection and Advocacy of the Rights of Individuals with Developmental Disabilities under the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act. The heading of part C is amended to focus on the protection and advocacy of the rights of individuals with developmental disabilities.
