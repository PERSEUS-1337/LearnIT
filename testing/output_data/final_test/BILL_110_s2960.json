The \"National Improvised Explosive Device Prevention and Preparedness Act of 2008\" acknowledges the threat posed by various forms of improvised explosive devices, including radio-controlled, suicide, vehicle-borne, waterborne, and underwater devices. The United States has experienced numerous attacks involving improvised explosive devices over the past 25 years, such as the 1983 bombings in Beirut and the Senate bombing. The 1983 United States Senate bombing, 1984 United States embassy annex bombing in Beirut, 1986 TWA Flight 840 bombing, 1986 LaBelle Discotheque bombing in Berlin, 1988 Pan Am Flight 103 bombing, 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York City, 1995 Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building bombing in Oklahoma City, 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, 1996 Centennial Olympic Park bombing in Atlanta, 1998 health clinic bombing in Birmingham. The 1998 health clinic bombing in Birmingham, Alabama; the 1998 United States embassy bombings in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and Nairobi, Kenya; the 2000 USS Cole bombing in Aden, Yemen; and the 2008 military recruiting office bombing in New York City. Improvised explosive devices cause a majority of US combat casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan. Knowledge to make and detonate these devices is easily spread due to global communication networks. The United States lacks adequate capabilities and federal funding for responding to domestic improvised explosive device attacks. State and local bomb squads, dive teams, canine units, and SWAT teams are often the first to respond but face funding shortfalls. Funding shortfalls are identified based on threats from Federal, State, and local government sources. SEC. 3. BOMBING PREVENTION. Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to include an Office for Bombing Prevention. The term 'IED first responder' refers to specific teams operated by State or local governments.

Additionally, it assists State and local officials in developing multijurisdictional bombing prevention plans. The Office for Bombing Prevention coordinates national prevention activities, assesses IED first responders' equipment requirements, maintains an information portal for sharing critical information, promotes awareness programs, liaises with the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization, and assists in developing multijurisdictional bombing prevention plans. The Office for Bombing Prevention coordinates national prevention activities, assesses equipment requirements, maintains an information portal, promotes awareness programs, liaises with organizations, and assists in developing bombing prevention plans.
