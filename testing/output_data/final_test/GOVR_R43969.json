Currently, 21 states and Puerto Rico have plans covering private and public sectors, while 5 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands cover only state and local government employers. Maine and New Jersey are in the process of establishing or extending state plans. OSHA enforces workplace safety standards, but states can have approved plans to take over jurisdiction. Currently, 21 states and Puerto Rico cover private and public sectors, while 5 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands cover only state and local government employers. Maine and New Jersey are extending their state plans to cover all employers. OSHA estimates that 40% of American workers are covered by state occupational safety and health plans, which must be \"at least as effective\" as OSHA standards. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for states to have occupational safety and health programs that are at least as effective as OSHA standards. It includes provisions for right of entry, inspection, legal authority, qualified personnel, adequate funds, and a comprehensive program. The curr_chunk discusses the process for states to submit a state plan to OSHA for approval, including the required elements such as legislation, regulations, enforcement systems, and staffing. The state plan must include legislation, regulations, enforcement systems, and staffing. A developmental plan must show infrastructure readiness within three years for Certification. OSHA certifies states with necessary infrastructure, without judging plan effectiveness or preempting federal jurisdiction. An Operational Status Agreement can be made between OSHA and states meeting statutory requirements. Employers under state jurisdiction may receive Final Approval from OSHA after at least one year. Final approval means the state plan meets statutory requirements and is as effective as the federal system. Once approved, all employers, except those under federal jurisdiction, fall under state jurisdiction. States dissatisfied with OSHA's decision can request a hearing before an administrative law judge. State plans can operate indefinitely under an operational status agreement, which can be modified by agreement between the state and OSHA. The California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) operates the largest state plan since 1977 under an operational status agreement without final approval from OSHA. Seven states and territories also operate under operational status agreements. OSHA monitors state plans through the Federal Annual Monitoring Evaluation (FAME) process to ensure effectiveness in providing occupational safety and health. Monitoring includes reviewing laws, operations, and progress towards goals. OSHA issues FAME reports annually for each state plan and can require changes if deficiencies are found. OSHA can require changes to state plans and reconsider approval, with grants covering up to 50% of costs. FY2016 saw $100.850 million for state plan grants, with $104.377 million requested for FY2017. Detailed state plan info is on the OSHA website. This section focuses on two state plans amidst current controversies. The California state plan exceeds OSHA's standards with specific requirements for outdoor work in high temperatures, administered by Cal/OSHA. Arizona's plan includes a fall protection standard for residential construction deemed insufficient by OSHA. This may lead to OSHA reconsidering its approval of the state plan. The California state plan goes beyond OSHA's standards by addressing hazards of working outdoors in high temperatures, while OSHA lacks specific federal standards for this issue. OSHA relies on the General Duty Clause to reduce heat-related illnesses and injuries. The OSHA standards require employers to assess hazards, provide PPE, access to water, and safety training for employees. OSHA has developed a smartphone app for heat illness prevention and launched a safety campaign with materials developed by Cal/OSHA. The Cal/OSHA standard, part of California's state occupational safety and health plan, mandates training on heat illness prevention for outdoor employees. It requires access to shade or cooling systems in temperatures over 80 degrees Fahrenheit and breaks for employees in high heat conditions. Specific rules apply to industries like agriculture, construction, landscaping, oil and gas extraction, and transportation. The Arizona state occupational safety and health plan, administered by ADOSH, requires employers in industries like agriculture, construction, landscaping, oil and gas extraction, and transportation to provide shade, breaks, and communication with employees in high heat conditions. Agricultural employers must also give workers a 10-minute rest period every two hours when temperatures reach 95 degrees. In February 2015, OSHA rejected Arizona's residential construction fall protection standard, leading Arizona to adopt the OSHA standard. The standard requires fall protection for employees working at heights of 6 feet or more. Initially issued in August 1994, OSHA allowed non-conventional fall protection systems until December 2010 when they cancelled the interim guidance. On June 16, 2011, ADOSH adopted the federal residential fall protection standard, which was later enforced on January 1, 2012. In March 2012, SB 1441 was enacted into law in Arizona, requiring conventional fall protection for employees working at heights of at least 15 feet or on steep roofs. ADOSH incorporated SB 1441's provisions into its safety plan. Arizona responded to OSHA's show-cause letter by enacting SB 1307 on April 22, 2014, which made minor changes to the residential construction fall protection standard, including maintaining a minimum height of 15 feet for conventional fall protection. This new legislation also included a provision to repeal certain provisions if OSHA rejects the standard. On February 6, 2015, OSHA rejected Arizona's residential construction fall protection standard, leading to its automatic repeal under SB 1307. Arizona was expected to adopt the federal standard into its state plan, with OSHA deferring final approval of the state plan pending action. Effective February 7, 2015, all Arizona employers must comply with the OSHA fall protection standard."
