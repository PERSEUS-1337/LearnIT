    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Congressional Medal of Honor Memorial Coin Act of 2003\". Congress finds that the Congressional Medal of Honor is the highest award for valor in the US Armed Forces, recipients have shown gallantry and intrepidity, and the National Medal of Honor Memorial at Riverside National Cemetery honors their service and sacrifice. The $1,700,000 needed for the memorial was raised solely for this purpose. The Honor Memorial at Riverside National Cemetery was funded through donations to the Congressional Medal of Honor Memorial Committee. There is substantial support for minting coins in honor of recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor, allowing people to keep them as a personal memorial to these heroes. SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS. The Secretary of the Treasury will mint $5 gold coins and $1 silver coins in limited quantities to honor Congressional Medal of Honor recipients. The coins will have specific weights, diameters, and compositions. These coins will be legal tender and considered numismatic items. Coins minted under this Act will be considered numismatic items for purposes of section 5136 of title 31, United States Code. The design of coins minted under this Act will symbolize the values and qualities needed to earn the Congressional Medal of Honor. Each coin will feature the coin's value, the year \"2005\", and inscriptions of \"Liberty\", \"In God We Trust\", \"United States of America\", and \"E Pluribus Unum\". The design will be chosen by the Secretary in consultation with the Commission of Fine Arts and reviewed by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee. SEC. 5. ISSUANCE OF COINS. Coins minted under this Act will be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities at a single designated Mint facility during the period of January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2005. SEC. 6. SALE OF COINS. The coins will be sold by the Secretary at a price including face value, surcharges, and costs. Bulk sales will be offered at a discount, and prepaid orders will be accepted with a reasonable discount. SEC. 7. SURCHARGES. The Secretary will add a $35 surcharge per $5 coin and a $10 surcharge per $1 coin. Proceeds from these surcharges will go to the Riverside National Cemetery Support Committee for maintaining memorials."
