Expansion of tax refund reduction provision to include past-due, legally enforceable local government tax obligations. Upon notice from a State regarding a person's debt to a local government, the Secretary of the Treasury can reduce Federal tax refunds by the amount owed, paying it to the State for payment to the local government. The State can submit a notice to reduce Federal tax refunds for past-due tax obligations, including internal revenue tax, past-due support, debts to Federal agencies, and local government tax obligations. The refund will be reduced by the amount owed before being paid to the State for payment to the local government. The State can submit a notice to reduce Federal tax refunds for past-due tax obligations, including internal revenue tax, past-due support, debts to Federal agencies, and local government tax obligations. Any overpayment by the person owing tax debts will be applied against those debts in the order of filing notices from States or local governments. No State can take action on behalf of a local government until the local government certifies the debt owed. The State can notify individuals with past-due tax obligations by certified mail, allowing them 60 days to dispute the debt. After considering any evidence presented, the State must determine the amount owed is past-due and legally enforceable. The Secretary may set additional conditions to validate the determination and ensure reasonable efforts have been made to collect the tax debt. In this subsection, a past-due, legally enforceable tax obligation refers to a tax debt resulting from a court judgment or administrative determination that is no longer subject to review, or from an assessed but uncollected tax that has not been delinquent for more than 10 years. The Secretary will issue regulations for States on how to handle these obligations. The regulations will specify the types of taxes and minimum debt amounts for reduction procedures. States must submit notices of past-due tax obligations. States may need to pay a fee to the Secretary for applying the reduction procedure. Any erroneous payments made to a State will be notified by the Secretary. The Secretary will notify a State of any erroneous payments made on behalf of a local government, and the State must promptly repay the amount. The payment withheld for overpayment may be treated as a payment to the person or persons owed. Additionally, there are amendments regarding the disclosure of information to agencies of States requesting refund offsets for past-due tax obligations. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include subsection (j) of section 3720A of title 31, United States Code for obligations related to payments."
