    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Prison Work and Victim Restitution Act of 1996\". Congress finds that work is essential for society, promotes values like responsibility and respect, and should be expanded for prisoners to reduce recidivism and provide restitution to victims and communities. Taxpayers expect prisoners to reimburse the cost of their incarceration and make restitution to crime victims. Prisoners should make monetary restitution to a fund benefiting crime victims, be prohibited from certain unhealthy activities, and not have access to unnecessary amenities. They should not be guaranteed the same wages as law-abiding Americans, and barriers to prisoner labor should be removed. Federal laws should be strengthened to ensure restitution to victims and society. Prisoners, victims, taxpayers, and society benefit from work. SEC. 3. WORK REQUIREMENT FOR FEDERAL PRISONERS. Federal prisoners must work for a minimum of 50 hours weekly, participate in job-training, and educational programs. If work opportunities are insufficient, prisoners can work for nonprofit entities. Authorities making grants to nonprofits must inform them of this option. The Attorney General will establish rules for inmate services to nonprofits. The Attorney General will establish rules for the provision of services by inmates to private entities, including for-profit American entities located abroad or considering relocation due to high domestic labor costs. Incentives may be provided, such as the use of Federal prison space and facilities at a reduced rate. The Attorney General will establish rules for prisoners providing services to private for-profit entities, governing wages and proceeds. Revenues from prison labor will go into a Fund, with guidelines set by the Attorney General for costs of incarceration, victim restitution, and a non-interest bearing portion. One tenth of the funds will be held for the individual prisoner, to be paid upon release or used if not eligible for release. The remainder will go to States with similar prison work requirements and conditions for programs benefiting prisoners' dependents. SEC. 4. PRISONERS UNDER THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT OF 1938 AND THE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ACT OF 1970. SEC. 5. PRISON CONDITIONS. The definition of 'employee' in the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 is amended to exclude prisoners in federal or state prisons. SEC. 5. PRISON CONDITIONS. Federal prisoners are prohibited from smoking, using tobacco, possessing pornographic materials, drugs, illegal substances, certain appliances, inappropriate music, non-educational cable TV, and engaging in sexual activity. SEC. 6. CONVICT PILOT PROJECTS. Amendment to Section 1761(c)(1) of title 18, United States Code by removing the limit of not more than 50."
