Section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to require the inclusion of women and minority groups in clinical investigations for new drugs, with guidelines set by the Secretary to ensure their participation without considering costs as a factor. Phase three clinical investigations submitted for new drug applications must include women and minority groups, unless scientific data shows no significant difference in effects compared to other subjects. The design should allow for valid analysis of any differential effects on these groups. The investigation may affect women or minority groups differently than other drug users, and if deemed appropriate by the Secretary, other phases of the investigation should be designed accordingly. SEC. 3. DEVICE CLINICAL INVESTIGATIONS.

Clinical investigations must be designed for valid analysis. The Secretary will designate which clinical investigations in device applications must analyze if the device affects women or minority groups differently. SEC. 5.
