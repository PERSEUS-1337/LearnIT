    "content": "In the 1950s, reports of reproductive failure in migratory birds exposed to DDT raised concerns about chemical pollutants affecting wildlife. In 1996, the endocrine disruptor hypothesis gained public attention with the release of \"Our Stolen Future.\" Congress directed the EPA to screen pesticides for endocrine-disrupting potential, but the program was delayed. In 2008, the National Toxicology Program expressed concern about fetal and child exposure to certain chemicals. In 2008, a report raised scientific concern about fetal and child exposure to chemicals with endocrine-disrupting potential. Congress then enacted legislation banning these chemicals in children's toys and child care articles. Legislation in the 111th Congress aimed to regulate the use of bisphenol A, another potential endocrine disruptor. The report summarizes the science behind the endocrine disruptor hypothesis, congressional actions, EPA's implementation efforts, and policy issues. It aims to support Congress in controlling potential endocrine disruptors and overseeing EPA programs. Endocrine disruptors are chemical compounds that can interfere with biological processes regulated by hormones in animals, affecting physical development, growth, reproduction, and metabolism. They can be found in drugs, food, consumer products, or the environment, either naturally or as products of human industry. Some endocrine disruptors mimic natural hormones and are known as \"hormone mimics.\" Exposure to environmental estrogens or xenoestrogens, which mimic female sex hormones, can harm wildlife by affecting hormone activities. Other endocrine disruptors can block or modify hormone actions. Some prefer the term \"endocrine modulators\" over \"endocrine disruptors.\" Low environmental levels of certain chemicals can harm the endocrine systems of fish and wildlife, especially when concentrations are continuous or bioaccumulate. Some scientists suggest that these chemicals may also impact human health, but others believe current levels are too low to cause significant effects. Congress began investigating the effects of endocrine disruptors in 1993, with researchers later publishing findings in the book \"Our Stolen Future.\" The book \"Our Stolen Future\" summarized studies on endocrine disruption by environmental pollutants, linking them to deformities in amphibians, declining human fertility, and increased rates of certain cancers. Congress acknowledged the need to screen pesticide chemicals and drinking water contaminants for their potential to disrupt endocrine systems, leading to the establishment of screening programs under the Food Quality Protection Act and Safe Drinking Water Act in 1996. The Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) Section 408(p) requires EPA to mandate validated tests for pesticides' potential endocrine effects in humans. This includes all registered pesticide ingredients and other substances that may have a cumulative effect with pesticides. The Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments authorize screening for endocrine disruption potential in drinking water contaminants. Manufacturers of suspect chemicals are responsible for conducting toxic effects screening following EPA-approved protocols. EPA is authorized to take appropriate action based on screening results. EPA established the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP) with the help of the Endocrine Disruptors Screening and Testing Advisory Committee (EDSTAC), which consisted of scientists and stakeholders. The committee's recommendations were reviewed and accepted by EPA to protect public health from substances with endocrine effects. The Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP) was established in 1998 by EPA to screen pesticides and chemicals for endocrine disruption using Tier 1 and Tier 2 assays. Testing includes effects on estrogen, androgen, and thyroid systems. However, screening has not started due to pending toxicity assay selection and validation. The Endocrine Disruptor Method Validation Subcommittee (EDMVS) was formed in 2001 to advise EPA on selecting and evaluating screens and tests. Controversy arose over the role of animal experimentation and validation of tests involving live animals. The Endocrine Disruptor Methods Validation Advisory Committee (EDMVAC) replaced EDMVS three years later to assist EPA in identifying, developing, and validating methods for detecting potential endocrine disruptors. In 2004 and 2005, the EDSP was reviewed by the independent Board of Scientific Counselors (BOSC) for EPA's Office of Research and Development, with a subcommittee preparing a final report. The BOSC subcommittee found the endocrine disruptor screening program's goals and science questions appropriate, with good progress in implementation despite remaining challenges. Recommendations included strengthening expertise in wildlife toxicology, expediting test validation, utilizing \"omics\" technologies, maintaining funding, and supporting multidisciplinary research collaborations. The program exceeded expectations in addressing concerns from previous reviews, considering all recommendations and holding off on unimplemented ones due to budget constraints. The BOSC noted budget cuts affecting the program, with a 20% reduction since 2003 and a proposed 4% cut for the current year. Funds for EDC research grants were eliminated in 2005. Wildlife toxicology and epidemiology are identified as areas of weakness in EPA's EDSP due to budget constraints. EPA collaborated with organizations to validate alternative test methods. EPA's Science Advisory Panel completed peer review of test assays and approved EPA's initial test battery. In July 2008, objections were raised by the Center for Regulatory Effectiveness and Crop Life America regarding EPA's Tier 1 assays. EPA delayed issuing orders until 2009 due to petitions. In April 2009, EPA denied the Crop Life petition and announced the issuance of orders for toxicity assays. EPA also established a process for prioritizing chemicals for screening in 2007. In April 2009, EPA published the final list of 67 chemicals for screening, including pesticide active ingredients and other chemicals produced in large amounts. The list was selected based on potential human exposure and inert pesticide ingredients. EPA also finalized procedures for issuing orders to manufacturers for initial screening and compliance oversight. The House Committee on Government Reform held a hearing in October 2006 to discuss the discovery of egg-bearing male bass in the Potomac River and the implications for human and ecological health. Members of the committee later requested information from EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson on expediting the screening of chemicals for endocrine effects and implementing the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP). EPA's responses, including the completion of procedures and peer review for Tier 1 tests, were expected before mid-2008. More information on the EDSP program development is available on EPA's website. The EPA website provides information on the development of the EDSP program, which aims to screen chemicals for endocrine effects. Research interest is growing in the potential harm of chemical pollutants on human health, particularly in prenatal and infant development. Chemicals like phthalates and certain pesticides are of concern due to their presence in various consumer products. Recent studies have focused on the health effects of exposure to various chemicals like pesticides, medicinal drugs, synthetic compounds, and metals. Research efforts are being sponsored by governmental organizations to understand the potential impacts of endocrine disruptors. The EPA has an inventory of endocrine research and coordination among federal agencies is ongoing. In the 111th Congress, H.R. 1145 proposed research on prevention of contaminants like endocrine disruptors in water resources. This bill also aimed to establish a national committee for water-related research. Increases in rates of certain cancers, declines in sperm counts, and rising rates of type II diabetes, obesity, and birth defects have been reported. Some of these trends may be due to improved diagnostic tools or reporting rates, while others may be linked to factors like medication use or smoking. However, in some cases, increasing exposure to environmental chemicals is considered a possible explanation for the rise in disease rates. Many health conditions in humans mirror effects seen in wildlife and fish exposed to endocrine disruptors. Congress has shown interest in recent health trends such as declines in semen quality, increasing rates of deformities in male reproductive organs, and a rise in testicular cancer. Researchers suggest that exposure to phthalates and other endocrine disruptors may be affecting the development of baby boys, leading to \"testicular dysgenesis syndrome.\" The effects of chemical exposures on humans are challenging to determine. The effects of chemical exposures on humans are difficult to demonstrate scientifically due to ethical constraints and limited natural experiments. Studying low-level exposures is problematic as expected effects are subtle and affected by various conditions. Scientific studies have shown that hormones and certain chemicals can harm human health, especially during fetal or infant development. For example, exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy increases the risk of vaginal cancer and reproductive abnormalities in daughters. Additionally, male babies exposed to DES in utero may have genital tract abnormalities. Some chemicals affecting hormone systems have therapeutic uses, such as sex hormones for cancer treatment. Some scientists argue that plant-derived endocrine disruptors like phytoestrogens in soy beans may have therapeutic value, potentially protecting against disease. Epidemiologic studies have found associations between environmental endocrine disruptors and effects on human health, such as male urogenital malformations in newborns linked to bioaccumulated estrogenic substances in the placenta. Causality for adverse health effects from these disruptors remains unclear. Exposure to endocrine disruptors at typical environmental levels has not clearly shown adverse health effects. Studies mainly focus on specific chemicals, like phthalates, which have been linked to developmental effects in humans and animals. Some research suggests low phthalate exposure may have health impacts, similar to findings in animal studies. Recent research has shown that high exposure to a breakdown product of phthalates can alter the development of human fetal testes and reduce germ cells. While the effects of environmental phthalate exposure on human health are not yet conclusive, scientists recommend considering the combined effects of chemical exposures. Studies suggest additive effects of multiple phthalate exposures, prompting further exploration into the combined effects of exposure to these chemicals. The review calls for more systematic investigations of combinations of endocrine disruptors, including the effects of bisphenol A (BPA) on adiponectin release and its possible link to diabetes. PCBs, despite being regulated since 1976, are still widespread in the environment. PCBs, regulated since 1976, are found in the environment due to their persistence and bioaccumulation. Some PCBs are estrogenic and may impact thyroid function and cognitive development in fetuses. Human exposure to PCBs has been linked to various reproductive and growth issues. Congress is concerned about perchlorate's effects on thyroid function, a common pollutant in water and soil. Perchlorate, commonly found in explosives and rocket fuel, can disrupt iodine uptake by the thyroid, leading to thyroid hormone production decrease. This can impact brain development in fetuses and infants, causing attention deficit disorder and learning difficulties. Studies show thyroid changes in humans at high perchlorate exposure levels. Environmental exposure to perchlorate can affect thyroid hormone levels in women deficient in iodine, with no effect on men. Fish studies show endocrine disruption due to contaminants, with male fish feminization being a concern. Fish can serve as sentinels for endocrine-disrupting chemicals in aquatic environments. Fish are important indicators of environmental contamination in aquatic environments. They are exposed to contaminants through various pathways and can bioaccumulate toxins due to the length of aquatic food chains. The feminization of male fish near wastewater treatment plants raised concerns about endocrine-disrupting chemicals in the environment. The feminization of male fish due to exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals has been observed in various locations, including the English Channel, Tokyo Bay, and the United States. Evidence of feminization includes the presence of eggs in the testes and vitellogenin in the blood of male fish. Reports have documented complete sex reversal in male salmon, intersex trout, hornyhead turbot, and white sucker in different regions. In 2004, feminized smallmouth bass were found in the South Branch of the Potomac River. In the South Branch of the Potomac River in West Virginia, water samples detected endocrine disruptors with estrogenic activity affecting fish. Research shows that a combination of contaminants likely caused observed effects on fish. Other rural sites in West Virginia had lower rates of feminized bass compared to more populated and agriculturally intense areas. In a heavily populated and intensely agricultural part of Virginia, 80 to 100% of male bass from the Shenandoah River were feminized due to estrogenic and androgenic substances in the environment. Estrogenic activity is more widespread and well-studied, especially near wastewater treatment plants. The impact of feminized male fish on wild populations was previously unknown. The sustainability of wild fish populations may be adversely affected by endocrine-disrupting chemicals, such as the synthetic estrogen 17\u03b1-ethynylestradiol (EE2). A study in Canada showed that chronic exposure to low concentrations of EE2 nearly wiped out a population of fathead minnows in just two years. EE2, commonly found in birth control pills and wastewater effluent, has been detected in U.S. surface water. Scientists have established a predicted safe concentration for aquatic life, but reproductive issues from hormone exposure have been observed in other wild vertebrates. Reproductive issues from hormone exposure have been observed in various wild vertebrate species, including birds, polar bears, Florida panthers, alligators, river otters, and mink. Endocrine disruptors in marine mammals, such as seals and dolphins, have been linked to thyroid hormone system disruption by PCBs. Research on beluga whales shows that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor binds strongly to dioxins and PCBs, increasing the risk of toxic responses to environmental contaminants. Marine mammals, like seals and dolphins, are affected by endocrine disruptors, leading to reproductive issues. Evidence shows that chemicals like tributyltin can cause imposex in snails, resulting in severe population declines. Toxicity testing on marine mammals is challenging due to logistical, legal, and ethical constraints. Exposure to endocrine disruptors like tributyltin can affect reproductive organ development and cause tumors in rodents. For example, genistein exposure in newborn mice at levels found in soy-based infant formulas impaired fertility and led to uterine cancer in some mice. The use of TBT in anti-fouling paints is restricted in the US and Europe but remains in use elsewhere. The Evaluation of Risks to Human Reproduction in 2006 concluded that genistein can cause reproductive and developmental toxicity in rodents. Some studies have shown developmental effects in rats from exposure to substances like DES and bisphenol-A, while others found no effects. Controversy exists due to conflicting study results and the lack of statistical measures in laboratory studies. An expert workshop in 2001 confirmed that biological effects can occur at low doses of endocrine disruptors. The effects of endocrine disruptors at low doses have been shown to occur, raising concerns about potential harm to rodents. Limited information on the levels of these disruptors in the environment has fueled worries about their impact on human and wildlife health. Some common sources of endocrine disruptors include banned pesticides like DDT and dieldrin, synthetic hormones in wastewater effluent, and contamination from concentrated animal feeding lots. Concentrated animal feeding lots and soy-based milk substitutes containing phytoestrogens are potential sources of environmental contamination. There is debate over whether phytoestrogen concentrations in food exceed those of endocrine disruptors in the environment. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey suggests that most. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey shows widespread exposure to endocrine disruptors in the US population, with Bisphenol A and common phthalates detected in over 90% of people. Women and children, especially babies, are most exposed to these chemicals through various sources like food, breast milk, and prenatal exposure. Studies have also found multiple phthalates in human fetuses and amniotic fluid. Some chemicals known to disrupt hormones are present in the environment at low levels, with concerns about long-term effects and potential additive effects from continual exposure. Synthetic hormones, like birth control compounds and synthetic estrogen, are examples of biologically active chemicals released into the environment. Birth control compounds, synthetic estrogen, and synthetic thyroid hormone are common contaminants in wastewater. PCBs and dioxins are persistent in the environment and bioconcentrate in the food chain. Understanding the potential health effects on wildlife and humans, as well as actual exposure measurements, is crucial for accurate risk assessment. Controversies exist regarding the extent of exposure to endocrine modulators and the effects of low levels of chemicals on human health and reproduction. The National Academy of Sciences panel in 1999 concluded that hormonally active agents have likely contributed to declines in wildlife populations, diseases, and deformities in various species. Environmental groups criticize the EPA for delays in implementing the Food Quality Protection Act, including establishing an endocrine disruptor screening program. The NRDC and other public interest groups filed a lawsuit in 1999 regarding this issue. Six California-based public interest groups filed a lawsuit in 1999 against the EPA for missing FQPA deadlines. A settlement agreement in 2001 with NRDC stated that endocrine disruptor screening would start by spring 2004, which did not happen. Stakeholders raised concerns about delays and the lack of validation for test protocols in the screening program. Chemical producers wanted cost-effective screening requirements from the EPA to identify hazardous pesticides. Chemical producers prefer cost-effective screening by EPA to identify hazardous pesticides, while public health advocates advocate for thorough testing of more chemicals. Some scientists are hesitant due to the new and rapidly evolving field of endocrine disruptor screening. Most scientists are optimistic about screening chemicals with new methods, as long as they are validated. Traditional toxicity testing involves administering chemicals to animals and observing health effects. The flexibility of the testing program and quick adaptation to new knowledge are key questions. Animal welfare advocates are concerned about the use of a large number of animals for testing in the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program. They argue for the development of alternatives to animal tests to improve predictive value for human health and protect animals. Some argue for the development of alternative test methods to improve predictive value for human health and protect animals used in toxicity testing. Federal agencies have been evaluating alternative methods to screen chemicals for toxicity, aiming to use fewer laboratory animals. However, the results of alternative toxicity testing methods are challenging to interpret in terms of human health implications. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences established the Applied Toxicological Research and Testing Program to develop alternative methods for safety testing and reduce the use of animals. The program includes the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods, with EPA as a member. The EPA has legal authorities to protect public health from toxic chemicals, including the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, FIFRA, and the Toxic Substances Control Act. They may also refer substances to other agencies like the FDA or OSHA for regulation. Multiple agencies may be involved in regulating chemicals that are endocrine disruptors due to their various uses and environmental release. Multiple agencies may have a stake in regulating chemicals, leading to potential controversies due to overlapping risk assessments and guidelines. Coordination among agencies could lead to more cost-effective regulation and prevent underestimation of risks. Cumulative risk assessments are crucial for evaluating the combined effects of exposure to chemicals over time, especially when health effects are not immediate. Concerns over phthalates prompted regulatory action after scientists highlighted the potential consequences of exposure from multiple sources. Congress may need to assess if agencies are adequately conducting cumulative risk assessments. The Kid-Safe Chemicals Act in Congress aimed to expand cumulative risk assessments beyond pesticides to other chemicals. Endocrine disruption poses challenges for regulators due to its varying effects on populations and the timing of exposure. Determining when to intervene and under what authority remains a key question for regulators. Regulators face challenges in determining when to intervene and under what authority regarding endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Congress may need to assess if agencies have the necessary authority and funding for research and regulatory activities. H.R. 1145 in the 111th Congress proposed technical research on prevention and removal of contaminants by water resources research institutes. The Research Act of 1984 aims to conduct technical research on contaminants of emerging concern, establish a national interagency coordinating committee for water-related research, and evaluate funding levels. It authorizes $10 million to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for coordination and outreach activities. Chemicals disrupting endocrine systems are found in the environment and consumer products, harming wildlife and aquatic life. Some chemicals harm wildlife and aquatic life by disrupting their endocrine systems, leading to reproductive and developmental issues. This has been observed in fish, birds, polar bears, Florida panthers, alligators, river otters, mink, and marine invertebrates. Scientists suggest that these pollutants may also be affecting human health by interfering with endocrine functions. Some scientists suggest that environmental pollutants may be impacting human health by disrupting endocrine functions. Studies have shown associations between exposure to potential endocrine disruptors and various health problems such as diabetes, malformations, sexual function issues, cognitive development, and thyroid function. However, the environmental endocrine disruptor hypothesis is criticized by some scientists due to the low levels of these chemicals in the environment compared to naturally occurring hormones in the human body. Some scientists suggest that environmental pollutants may be impacting human health by disrupting endocrine functions. Congress is urged to consider issues related to the endocrine disruptor hypothesis, including the delayed launch of a mandated chemical screening program. Concerns exist about potential reliance on animal testing and the need for adequate authority and direction in statutes and regulations. Statutes and regulations should address the influence of findings of endocrine disruption on the regulation of specific chemicals, chemical groups, uses, or products."
