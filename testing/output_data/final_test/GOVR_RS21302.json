    "content": "During the 1990s, state and local governments faced budget shortfalls and increased responsibilities, leading to calls for federal financial support for firefighters. While some federally funded training programs existed, there was no dedicated program providing direct federal funding to local fire departments for equipment, training, and other needs. This issue was raised during the 106th Congress by the fire community. During the 106th Congress, the FIRE Act was introduced to provide federal grants to fire departments for public and firefighter safety against fire hazards. The Act was included in the FY2001 National Defense Authorization Act, amending the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act to establish a new office in FEMA. The Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act (P.L. 93-498) established a new office in FEMA to administer grants to fire departments for various purposes, including personnel hiring and training, prevention programs, equipment, and public education. Volunteer departments receive a proportion of grant funding based on the population they protect. FEMA conducted a study with the National Fire Protection Association on the need for federal assistance in funding firefighting and emergency response activities, revealing shortfalls in facilities, equipment, and training for many fire departments, especially in rural communities. The Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act established FEMA's office to administer grants for fire departments, revealing shortfalls in facilities, equipment, and training. P.L. 106-398 authorized $100 million for firefighter assistance in FY2001 and $300 million for FY2002. After 9/11, the Assistance to Firefighters Program was increased to $900 million per year through FY2004, including equipment and training for responding to terrorist attacks. The program was authorized under P.L. 107-107 on December 28, 2001. In 2004, the 108th Congress considered reauthorizing the fire grant program with H.R. 4107 seeking to extend authorization through FY2007. The bill aimed to increase award caps for grant recipients and reduce cost-sharing nonfederal matches. Controversially, it included a provision prohibiting discrimination against firefighters engaging in volunteer firefighting activities in other jurisdictions during off-duty hours. The House Committee on Science held a hearing on H.R. 4107 in May 2004. The Senate introduced S. 2411, the Assistance to Firefighters Act of 2004, to reauthorize the fire grant program through FY2010. The bill designated the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security as the program's administering authority. Unlike the House bill, S. 2411 did not include a provision on volunteer firefighter discrimination. The text of S. 2411 was adopted as an amendment to the FY2005 National Defense Authorization Act. The Senate passed S. 2400, which was incorporated into the House Defense Authorization bill. The Conference Agreement on H.R. 4200 was approved by the House and Senate, including Title XXXVI on Assistance to Firefighters. Title XXXVI of H.R. 4200 reauthorized the fire grant program with increased funding for FY2005 through FY2009. Changes included higher award caps, lower matching requirements, expanded eligibility to include nonaffiliated EMS, and grants for firefighter safety R&D. The bill did not address volunteer firefighter discrimination and designated the USFA Administrator as the program's authority. H.R. 4200 was signed into law (P.L. 108-375) on October 28, 2004. Section 3603 of P.L. 108-375 directed USFA to assess fire needs with the NFPA. In October 2006, the USFA released two studies in conjunction with the National Fire Protection Association to assess fire department needs and the impact of the fire grant program. The SAFER Act authorizes federal grants for hiring firefighters and retaining volunteer firefighters. The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program received its primary appropriation through the VA-HUD-Independent Agencies Appropriation Act. The Assistance to Firefighters Program received varying annual appropriations from FY2001 to FY2008, with proposed cuts in funding for fire grants in FY2008. The budget proposal aimed to eliminate grants for wellness/fitness activities and facility modifications for firefighter safety. The budget justification for firefighter assistance in FY2008 requested funding for critical capabilities in response to fire-related hazards, stating that other DHS grant programs are better coordinated with state and local strategies. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 allocated $750 million for firefighter assistance, with $560 million for fire grants and $190 million for SAFER grants. In P.L. 110-161, $3 million was allocated for foam firefighter equipment in remote areas. GAO was tasked to review fire and SAFER grant processes, while FEMA was directed to peer review grant applications meeting criteria. The Administration proposed $300 million for fire grants in FY2009, a 46% decrease from FY2008. No funding was proposed for SAFER grants, resulting in a 60% reduction in total firefighter assistance funding. The Administration justified the $287 million funding level by citing other DHS grant programs for first responder preparedness missions. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $750 million for firefighter assistance in the FY2009 appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security. This includes $560 million for fire grants and $190 million for SAFER grants, with priority given to enhancing capabilities for terrorism response and major incidents. Funding is limited to critical response equipment, training, and personal protective gear, not for wellness/fitness activities or facility modifications for firefighter safety. Funding will be allocated based on local priorities and U.S. Fire Administration guidelines. The House Appropriations Committee approved $800 million for firefighter assistance in the FY2009 appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security. This includes $570 million for fire grants and $230 million for SAFER grants. FEMA is directed to continue granting funds directly to local fire departments, include the U.S. Fire Administration in the grant administration process, and maintain an all-hazards focus. $3 million was also made available for foam firefighter equipment used in remote areas. In the 110th Congress, the House Appropriations Committee approved $800 million for firefighter assistance in the FY2009 appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security. This includes $570 million for fire grants and $230 million for SAFER grants. FEMA is directed to peer review grant applications, rank order them, fund according to rank, and provide official notification for applications that do not meet criteria. The Administration's budget proposals have recommended cuts for fire grants, with opponents arguing that reduced levels are inadequate for fire departments. The focus of the fire grant program has been an ongoing issue, with proposed shifts towards terrorism preparedness. Firefighting groups argue that the original purpose of enhancing basic firefighting needs should not be compromised. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees have directed the program to maintain a broad all-hazards focus. S. 608, the Risk-Based Homeland Security Grants Act of 2007, would analyze the distribution of fire grant awards and unmet firefighting equipment needs. The role of the U.S. Fire Administration in administering the program is also a related issue. The fire grant program was initially administered by USFA/FEMA to enhance basic needs of fire departments. In FY2004, the program was relocated to ODP under the DHS Appropriations Act. The program continued with peer review processes, direct funding to fire departments, and involvement of the United States Fire Administration. The fire grant program was initially administered by USFA/FEMA to enhance basic needs of fire departments. In FY2004, the program was relocated to ODP under the DHS Appropriations Act. The program continued with peer review processes, direct funding to fire departments, and involvement of the United States Fire Administration. The FY2005 Homeland Security appropriations act placed the fire grant program within OSLGCP, but the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program Reauthorization Act of 2004 designated administration to USFA. DHS Secretary Chertoff announced a restructuring in 2005, with fire grants to be administered by the Office of Grants and Training. The fire grant program, initially administered by USFA/FEMA, was relocated to ODP under the DHS Appropriations Act. Legislation in the 109th Congress sought to transfer fire and SAFER grant programs back to FEMA, resulting in most of the Preparedness Directorate being transferred back to an enhanced FEMA under the Post Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006."
