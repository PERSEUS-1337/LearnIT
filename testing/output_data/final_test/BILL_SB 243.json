    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature aims to revamp the Medi-Cal inpatient hospital reimbursement method to prioritize access for patients with serious conditions, incentivize efficiency, enhance transparency, and ensure fair payments to hospitals. The Legislature aims to revamp the Medi-Cal inpatient hospital reimbursement method to prioritize access for patients with serious conditions, incentivize efficiency, enhance transparency, and ensure fair payments to hospitals. This includes encouraging administrative efficiency, ensuring data credibility for payments, simplifying payment processes, improving quality and outcomes, implementing provisions for hospital acquired conditions, and supporting provider compliance with state and federal requirements. The department will develop a payment methodology based on diagnosis-related groups for general acute care hospitals, excluding certain types of hospitals, to reflect costs and staffing levels associated with quality care. The methodology will be implemented on July 1, 2012, or upon federal approval. Claims for payments under the payment methodology based on diagnosis-related groups will increase by 16 percent for the 2015\u201316 fiscal year. Managed care rates to Medi-Cal plans will also increase proportionately for hospital services. Starting July 1, 2016, and annually thereafter, payment claim amounts will increase based on the California Consumer Price Index. Managed care rates will also increase annually for hospital services. The new payment methodology based on diagnosis-related groups will apply to all claims except for certain types of inpatient stays. The implementation of this new payment system will be coordinated with the development of the replacement Medicaid Management Information System. The department will evaluate alternative diagnosis-related group algorithms for the new Medi-Cal reimbursement system for applicable hospitals. Factors considered include determining base prices, patient classification, hospital case mix, regional cost differences, payment models from other states, and frequency of grouper updates. The evaluation of diagnosis-related group algorithms for the new Medi-Cal reimbursement system includes factors such as frequency of grouper updates, accommodation of ICD-10 codes, basis for calculating relative weights, use of policy adjusters, and budget neutrality of the payment system. The department will report to the Legislature on the implementation of the new payment system, including factors like add-on payments, outlier payments, and payments based on performance and quality of care. Alternatives for the new system will be developed in consultation with experts in hospital reimbursement, economists, and federal agencies. The department may contract for professional consulting services from higher education and research institutions with expertise in hospital reimbursement systems to develop a rate setting system. Contracts under this section are exempt from certain public contract code requirements. The department may adopt emergency regulations under the Administrative Procedure Act to implement provisions related to public peace, health, and safety. These regulations are exempt from review by the Office of Administrative Law and must be filed with the Secretary of State for publication in the California Code of Regulations. The department may implement and administer Section 14105.194 of the Welfare and Institutions Code through provider bulletins, letters, manuals, or similar instructions without regulatory action. Notification to legislative committees is required before issuing such instructions. Section 14105.194 of the Welfare and Institutions Code states that payments to providers after June 1, 2011, will not be subject to certain reductions, limitations, and adjustments. Managed care health plans contracting with the department will also be exempt from these reductions and adjustments. The department can implement this section through provider instructions without regulatory action, with notification to legislative committees required beforehand. The director will implement Section 14105.196 to maintain increased reimbursement rates for primary care providers in the Medi-Cal program. The intent is to ensure adequate access to these providers beyond the temporary increase provided in 2012. Increase reimbursement rates for Medi-Cal providers to match federal Medicare rates to ensure access to necessary health care services and comply with Medicaid requirements. Increase rates for Denti-Cal providers to the same level as other Medi-Cal providers. Starting January 1, 2016, payments for medical care services by fee-for-service Medi-Cal will be adjusted. Starting January 1, 2016, reimbursement rates for Medi-Cal managed care plans and Denti-Cal providers will be aligned with Medicare payment rates. This adjustment aims to ensure access to healthcare services and comply with Medicaid regulations. The increase in rates for Denti-Cal providers will be equivalent to the percentage increase required for Medi-Cal providers, subject to federal law and regulations. (c) Payments for medical care services under this section are exempt from payment reductions under Sections 14105.191 and 14105.192. Payment increases do not apply to provider rates for services provided to individuals not eligible for Medi-Cal or the Family PACT Program. \"Medical care services\" include specified services and adult dental benefits. The department shall implement payment increases to managed care health plans and contracts with specific organizations in a manner that increases payments by the actuarially equivalent amount of the payment increases pursuant to contract amendments or change orders effective on or after January 1, 2016. The department will implement regulations by July 1, 2018, through provider bulletins or similar instructions. A status report will be provided to the Legislature semiannually until regulations are adopted. Implementation is contingent on federal financial participation and approvals. SEC. 4. This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of public peace, health, or safety under the Constitution, ensuring timely access to medically necessary care for Medi-Cal beneficiaries."
