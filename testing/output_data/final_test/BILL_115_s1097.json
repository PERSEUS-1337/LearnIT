    "content": "The Act titled \"Armed Forces Reserve and National Guard Dual-Status Review and Modernization Act\" postpones the deadline for converting certain military technician positions to civilian employment by the federal government. The Act postpones the deadline for converting military technician positions to civilian employment. A study found that 21% of these positions are administrative and recommends investigating potential conversions to federal civilian positions without compromising readiness. Section 1053 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 initially required the conversion of 20% of military technician positions to Federal civilian employment by January 1, 2017. However, Section 1084 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 extended the deadline to October 1, 2017. A report in December 2016 recommended converting 4.8% of administrative military technician positions to Federal civilian roles. The Chief of the National Guard Bureau testified before Congress in April 2017 that converting 20% of military technician positions to Federal civilian roles would degrade readiness, but a lower number could be converted with minimal impact. The Department of Defense had not analyzed the costs and benefits of this conversion. In 2016, a deadline of 180 days after the Secretary of Defense transmits a report to Congress is set for the completion of converting military technician positions. A working group on Full Time Support of the Reserve Components is established in the Department of Defense, with co-chairs being the Directors of the Army and Air National Guard. The working group on Full Time Support of the Reserve Components in the Department of Defense includes key personnel such as the Director of the Air National Guard, the Chief of the Army Reserve, and the Chief of the Air Force Reserve. Members also consist of individuals appointed by the Secretary from relevant organizations within the Department. Their duties involve reviewing the full-time support of reserve components, including identifying the missions and objectives of military technicians. The working group on Full Time Support of the Reserve Components in the Department of Defense, led by key personnel, reviews the role and objectives of military technicians (dual status) in supporting an operational reserve force. This includes analyzing current technician positions and potential workforce restructuring to align with objectives for full-time support of reserve components. Additionally, it identifies positions that could convert to Federal civilian employment under title 5. The working group will assess the impact on National Guard readiness for domestic operations and the costs associated with converting identified positions to Federal civilian employment under title 5. A report will be submitted to the Secretary of Defense within 180 days. The group will submit a report to the Secretary of Defense on the comprehensive review, including a description of the review, results, percentage of military technician positions for conversion to Federal civilian employment, and a transition plan for implementing a new force structure for full-time support of reserve components. Recommendations for reforming personnel management policy and compensation/benefits policies for military technician (dual status) positions to address eligibility for civilian retirement and appeal processes. The Secretary will transmit a report to Congress from a working group regarding military technician (dual status) positions' compensation and benefits parity with other Federal civilian employees of the Department of Defense. The report, along with recommendations, will be published in the Federal Register. The term is defined in section 101(a)(16) of title 10, United States Code."
