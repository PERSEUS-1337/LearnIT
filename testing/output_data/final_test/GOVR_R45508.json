    "content": "U.S. insurers and Congress are facing new policy issues related to the growth in the international insurance market. The McCarran-Ferguson Act gives states regulatory primacy, but the business of insurance is becoming more international. Various entities and measures have been created to facilitate the trade and regulation of insurance services. The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) was established over 20 years ago to promote cooperation among insurance supervisors and develop regulatory standards. The 2007-2009 financial crisis led to the creation of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) by the G-20 nations. The Dodd-Frank Act in 2010 changed the U.S. insurance regulatory system, with the Federal Reserve overseeing holding companies. Following Dodd-Frank, the Federal Reserve oversaw insurers with bank subsidiaries or designated as systemically important financial institutions. The Federal Reserve became a significant insurance supervisor and joined the IAIS. Dodd-Frank also established the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) to represent the U.S. in international insurance matters. The Federal Insurance Office (FIO) can negotiate international covered agreements related to insurance prudential measures and is a member of the IAIS. Frictions have arisen among federal entities and between states and federal entities due to new federal involvement in insurance issues. This report discusses trade in insurance services, international entities and agreements, U.S.-EU and U.S.-UK covered agreements, and international insurance standards. Total U.S. services accounted for $798 billion in 2017. In 2017, total U.S. services accounted for $798 billion of U.S. exports and $542 billion of U.S. imports, creating a surplus of $255 billion. The United States runs a substantial trade surplus in financial services, with a surplus of $81 billion. However, there is a deficit in insurance services trade, with the U.S. importing $51 billion and exporting $18 billion in 2017. Global performance by insurance brokers and agencies is concentrated in Europe, North America, and North Asia, accounting for 88.6% of total written premiums. The North American and European domestic insurance markets are highly competitive, while there is less competition in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2017, U.S. insurance services exports to Asia-Pacific accounted for a third, with Japan representing 14%. Bermuda and the United Kingdom each contributed 15% of U.S. international insurance exports. Trade in property casualty and direct insurance is increasing as companies explore new markets for growth and risk diversification. The property casualty market declined from 2013 to 2018 due to natural disasters but is expected to grow in emerging markets. Financial and insurance services are traded internationally under USTR-negotiated trade agreements, similar to goods trade. The United States, as a member of the WTO, played a key role in negotiating the GATS in 1994, establishing rules for trade in services among WTO countries. Core GATS principles include MFN, transparency, and national treatment. Market access commitments were agreed upon, with the U.S. submitting its commitments for insurance services. The GATS Financial Services Annex allows foreign companies to compete in the United States in insurance and financial services. It defines insurance services and excludes services provided by governmental authority. The U.S. Schedule of Specific Commitments lists limitations on market access for foreign companies. The GATS and U.S. FTAs protect foreign companies' market access in the U.S. by clarifying state laws, including licensing requirements and board citizenship. The prudential exception allows for measures to protect investors and ensure financial system stability, even if they don't comply with the agreement. U.S. FTAs have chapters on financial services that go beyond GATS commitments. The U.S. FTAs, like GATS, protect foreign companies' market access and include WTO-plus obligations for financial services. The proposed USMCA aims to update NAFTA with differences in regulations and provisions. The proposed USMCA, subject to congressional approval, differs from NAFTA and reflects the Trump Administration's trade approach. It shares similarities with the TPP negotiated under the Obama Administration. The financial services chapter in the USMCA mirrors the TPP's commitments, clarifying insurance services coverage and introducing new provisions for expedited availability and transparency requirements. The proposed USMCA includes transparency requirements for regulatory practices to facilitate U.S. firms' business in foreign markets. It applies national treatment and market access obligations to insurance services, with stronger provisions on cross-border data flows compared to previous FTAs. Canada has one year to comply with the ban on data localization requirements, benefiting U.S. firms. The Digital Trade chapter of the USMCA is relevant to the insurance industry, allowing electronic signatures, protecting source code, promoting cybersecurity, and enabling cross-border data flows. The proposed USMCA includes changes in the investor-state dispute settlement system, with narrower scope than TPP or NAFTA. ISDS would apply only to certain U.S. or Mexican covered investments, excluding Canada completely. Concerns have been raised among insurance companies about the effectiveness of the state-to-state dispute settlement system for the insurance sector. The USMCA would establish a Committee on Financial Services and provide for consultations between the parties on ongoing implementation and other issues of interest. A covered agreement, a new form of international agreement, is defined as an international insurance or reinsurance agreement for recognition of prudential measures. The Federal Insurance Office (FIO) negotiates international insurance agreements with the USTR, but lacks regulatory authority over the insurance industry, which is regulated by individual states. State laws may be preempted if they conflict with a covered agreement determined by the FIO director. The Federal Insurance Office (FIO) negotiates international insurance agreements with the USTR, but lacks regulatory authority over the insurance industry, which is regulated by individual states. State laws may be preempted if they conflict with a covered agreement determined by the FIO director. The statute limits preemption by not preempting certain state insurance measures that govern rates, premiums, underwriting, sales practices, coverage requirements, antitrust laws, or insurer capital/solvency, unless they result in less favorable treatment for foreign insurers. Additional restrictions are placed on FIO determinations, including notice to states and congressional committees, public notice and comment in the Federal Register, and adherence to the Administrative Procedure Act. The covered agreement statute narrows the scope of international agreements compared to other agreements reached by federal financial regulators. While FIO and USTR consult with Congress on covered agreement negotiations, specific authorization or approval is not required, but a 90-day layover period is mandated. The statute also requires adherence to the Administrative Procedure Act, including public comment in the Federal Register and potential de novo determination by courts in judicial review. The covered agreement statute mandates a 90-day layover period and involves consultation with Congress. Congress has direct constitutional authority over foreign commerce, while trade agreements are approved by majority vote rather than as treaties. The covered agreements require a 90-day layover and consultation with Congress. Congressional-executive agreements do not require congressional action for implementation. International agreements by financial regulators do not have specific congressional notification requirements but must go through the rulemaking process. Trade agreements are conducted under Trade Promotion Authority, which sets trade negotiating objectives and consultation requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act requires notification and consultation with Congress for covered agreements, with a 90-day layover period. Legislation implementing FTAs must be approved by Congress, while under Trade Promotion Authority, the President must fulfill notification and consultation requirements before and during negotiations. Congressional approval is not required for covered agreements, but it is for FTAs. The U.S. International Trade Commission's economic assessment of agreements must be disclosed, with a 90-legislative-day period for congressional consideration. The USTR leads negotiations for international trade agreements, consulting with state governments and regulators. If notification and consultation procedures are not met, expedited treatment can be removed from implementing legislation. The USTR consults with state governments and regulators through IGPAC for trade negotiations. USTR cannot commit on behalf of states, leading to frustration for negotiating partners seeking market openings at the state level. USTR may persuade states for regulatory changes, but state laws and insurance regulations are exempt from trade negotiations. In the proposed USMCA agreement, the U.S. listed exempt measures. In the proposed USMCA agreement, the United States listed exempt measures where FTA obligations would not apply. International trade agreements are binding, and parties can initiate dispute settlement proceedings if they believe another party violates the agreement. Compliance with dispute resolution rulings is mandatory to avoid losing benefits under the agreement. Dodd-Frank does not specify this process. The USMCA agreement includes exempt measures where FTA obligations do not apply. Dispute resolution processes in covered agreements need clarification as Dodd-Frank does not specify them. U.S. FTAs have market access commitments and rules for financial services, but regulatory cooperation commitments are currently excluded. The Trump Administration notified Congress of intent to negotiate a trade agreement with the EU. The U.S. is negotiating with the EU to expand market opportunities for U.S. financial service suppliers and improve transparency in financial services trade. EU member states are discussing the scope of the negotiating mandate, with ongoing preparatory talks between the U.S. and EU. In prior negotiations, the EU sought regulatory cooperation issues, supported by some Members of Congress but opposed by U.S. financial regulators. Financial regulators opposed the inclusion at that time. The United States and the EU established the Joint U.S.-EU Financial Regulatory Forum, with regular meetings discussing financial regulatory reforms and cooperation efforts. On September 22, 2017, the first bilateral insurance covered agreement was signed between the United States and the European Union. The Obama Administration notified Congress in November 2015 about plans to negotiate a covered agreement with the EU to address concerns of U.S. insurance firms regarding limited market access. Goals included achieving recognition of the U.S. regulatory system by the EU and obtaining uniform regulatory treatment for U.S. insurers and reinsurers in the EU. The covered agreement negotiations aimed to address concerns of U.S. insurance firms regarding limited market access in the EU. Key goals included achieving recognition of the U.S. regulatory system and obtaining uniform regulatory treatment for U.S. insurers and reinsurers in the EU, particularly with respect to collateral requirements. The agreement also aimed to facilitate the exchange of confidential information among supervisors across borders. The proposal for a covered agreement addresses collateral and local presence requirements for reinsurers, encourages information sharing between insurance supervisors, and sets timelines for necessary changes. It does not explicitly call for equivalency recognition of the U.S. insurance regulatory system by the EU but aims to reduce regulatory burden on U.S. insurers in the EU. The agreement goes beyond previous state-level proposals on reinsurance collateral requirements and allows for federal preemption if states are not compliant. U.S. industry groups have welcomed the agreement. Several U.S. industry groups, including the AIA, the Reinsurance Association of America, and the ACLI, welcomed the agreement, citing the removal of barriers for U.S. insurance and reinsurance groups in Europe. State regulators and lawmakers expressed concerns about limited state involvement in the negotiation process and potential federal preemption of state laws. NCOIL was disappointed with the final signing of the agreement. The covered agreement aims to address EU concerns regarding U.S. state regulatory requirements for reinsurance issued by non-U.S. reinsurers. NCOIL expressed disappointment with the final signing, citing intrusion by federal and international regulatory authorities into state-based insurance regulation. Insurers question the utility of the agreement, foreseeing confusion and endless negotiations with Europe. The agreement includes a review after an initial implementation period, allowing either the United States or EU to withdraw. In the past, U.S. reinsurers required a 100% collateral deposit from non-U.S. reinsurers, who argued against this citing lack of reciprocity. However, in recent years, the NAIC has approved recommendations to reduce collateral requirements based on the reinsurer's financial strength and recognition of their domiciliary regulator. This change was adopted as a model law and regulation in 2011. The NAIC has approved changes to reduce collateral requirements for reinsurers based on financial strength and domiciliary regulator recognition. 49 states have adopted the model law and 42 have adopted the accompanying regulation. 29 reinsurers have been approved for reduced collateral requirements, with 7 jurisdictions approved as of January 2019. However, concerns of foreign insurers regarding reinsurance collateral requirements have not been fully addressed. Foreign insurers have concerns about reinsurance collateral requirements not being fully met. They seek a single standard in the US to eliminate, not just reduce, collateral requirements. The EU's motivation for covered agreement negotiations includes facilitating trade in reinsurance and recognizing each other's prudential rules. The agreement also aims to assist US insurers with regulatory burdens related to EU market requirements. Solvency II is part of the EU's project to create a single market for financial services, including insurance. Solvency II is an EU project to harmonize insurance laws. New equivalency determinations may impact US insurers operating in EU markets. EU regulatory changes could improve access for European reinsurers in foreign markets. The EU granted provisional equivalence to the United States under Solvency II, impacting U.S. insurers with operations in EU countries. Brexit may leave the UK outside of EU regulations, creating uncertainty for UK withdrawal terms. The UK's withdrawal from the EU may impact insurance trade with the US, as the UK could be excluded from existing EU international agreements. To address this, the US and UK negotiated a separate agreement mirroring the U.S.-EU covered agreement, aiming to provide regulatory certainty and market continuity for firms operating in both markets. The U.S. and UK negotiated a covered agreement to address the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, with Congress reviewing the final text before signature. The agreement will not take effect until both parties complete their internal procedures, specifically considering obligations under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. Most insurance stakeholders welcome the agreement for providing regulatory certainty and market continuity for firms operating in both markets. On October 16, 2018, the US notified Congress of intent to negotiate a bilateral free trade agreement with the UK. Uncertainty remains on including financial services cooperation. Formal trade talks cannot start until the UK exits the EU. US engages in significant insurance trade with other countries. Changes to state insurance laws could impact foreign reinsurers like Bermuda and Japan. EU reinsurers may have an advantage without collateral requirements. The EU reinsurers are not subject to collateral requirements, giving them an advantage. Policy approaches are being considered to address the uneven playing field between European and non-European reinsurers. Negotiating additional covered agreements with non-European jurisdictions, like the UK, is one option. State laws enacted in response to the U.S.-EU covered agreement could also remove reinsurance collateral requirements for some non-EU jurisdictions. The NAIC is updating a model law to remove collateral requirements for qualified jurisdictions such as Japan, Bermuda, and Switzerland. The Financial Stability Board and the International Association of have a significant impact on international insurance issues in the United States. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) was established in 2009 by G-20 nations to strengthen the global financial system post-2008 crisis. It assesses vulnerabilities, coordinates with member nations, and recommends measures. U.S. FSB members include the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and the SEC. The FSB's recommendations are not legally binding but operate through moral suasion and peer pressure to set internationally agreed policies and standards. The IAIS, established in 1994, sets international standards for the insurance sector. It is composed of insurance regulators globally, including U.S. members such as individual states, NAIC, Federal Reserve, and Federal Insurance Office. U.S. members hold various positions in IAIS committees and working groups, with an NAIC representative chairing the Policy Development Committee. The NAIC coordinates state participation in IAIS committees, with NAIC members holding key positions in IAIS committees. NAIC's 56 members have 15 votes in IAIS meetings, with designated members exercising their votes. The FSB designates globally systemically important financial institutions for monitoring global financial stability. The FSB designates globally systemically important financial institutions, including banks, insurers, and nonbank financial institutions like asset managers and hedge funds. These designated institutions must meet higher regulatory and capital standards to ensure stability during a crisis. The FSB's designations are separate from those done under the FSOC in the United States and in 2016, nine G-SIIs were designated, including three U.S. insurers. The FSB designates globally systemically important financial institutions, including insurers like AIG, MetLife, and Prudential Financial. In 2018, the FSB decided not to identify G-SIIs and may suspend or discontinue the identification depending on a new IAIS \"holistic framework\" to address systemic risk. IAIS is developing a Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (ComFrame) which includes capital standards for IAIGs. The ComFrame process for IAIGs began in 2010, with a draft framework and version 2.0 of insurance capital standards currently under review. International actions, like FSB designations of G-SIIs, do not immediately impact US regulations and must be adopted by US regulators or enacted into law. International bodies are expected to adopt agreed-upon standards, as seen with the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision. The implementation of international standards in domestic jurisdictions can be straightforward when the same agencies have the authority to do so. However, in the United States, the mix of federal and state authorities over insurance can complicate the adoption of standards like IAIS's capital standards. The U.S. representation at IAIS includes the NAIC, representing U.S. state regulators collectively, and 56 different states and territories regulating the U.S. insurance market individually. The U.S. insurance market is regulated by various entities including the NAIC representing state regulators, the Federal Reserve overseeing designated insurers, and the FIO monitoring without regulatory authority. This complex regulatory structure can lead to challenges in implementing international standards like IAIS's capital standards. International standards may not be self-executing, but countries may still feel pressure to comply, as seen in the IMF's FSAP assessments every five years. The latest FSAPs from 2010 and 2015 compared U.S. insurance laws to IAIS core principles. While U.S. regulators generally accept these principles, state regulators disagree with some ratings and proposed reforms. Pressure for regulatory harmonization comes from internationally active market participants to minimize costs of adapting to different rules. The possibility of adopting U.S. regulations similar to international standards for simplifying business operations, even if U.S. regulations are generally preferable, is considered by companies operating in multiple countries. Concerns about potential international insurance standards being \"bank-like\" and unsuitable for insurers are raised, particularly regarding the treatment of financial groups. Group holding companies in banking regulation are expected to provide financial assistance to subsidiaries if needed, with safety and soundness regulations applied at a group-wide level. Since the financial crisis, U.S. insurance regulators have increased oversight at the group level, focusing on capital movement between subsidiaries to ensure financial stability. The NAIC emphasizes the importance of maintaining the financial strength of insurers within a group by allowing capital flow without jeopardizing individual entities. The 116th Congress is facing an immediate issue regarding the U.S.-UK covered agreement, currently in its statutory 90-day layover period. Congress could enact legislation directly affecting the agreement, conduct hearings, or allow it to take effect. Movement of capital within insurance groups can impact financial stability and policyholder protection. The U.S.-UK covered agreement is currently in its statutory 90-day layover period. Congress may address international insurance issues by amending Dodd-Frank, increasing the role of states in U.S. representation, endorsing international insurance standards, and encouraging additional covered agreements. Legislation addressing international insurance issues in the 115th Congress includes the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (P.L. 115-174/S. 2155). Introduced by Senator Michael Crapo, the bill covers a broad range of financial services provisions and passed the Senate in March 2018. The House passed S. 2155 without amendment on May 22, 2018, and the President signed the bill into P.L. 115-174 on May 24, 2018. Section 211 of P.L. 115-174 establishes transparency in international insurance fora and creates an \"Insurance Policy Advisory Committee on International Capital Standards and Other Insurance Issues\" at the Federal Reserve. Annual reports and studies on ongoing discussions at the IAIS are required through 2022. The enacted law does not have specific requirements on the final text of any international capital standard. The President will consider Congress's preferences in section 211(a) and consult with State officials as appropriate regarding international negotiations. Representative Sean Duffy introduced H.R. 4537 on December 4, 2017. H.R. 4537, introduced by Representative Sean Duffy on December 4, 2017, was marked up and reported by the House Committee on Financial Services. The House passed a further amended version on July 10, 2018. S. 488, originally introduced by Senator Pat Toomey, focused on securities regulation after being amended in the House. Title XIV of the amended version of S. 488 and H.R. 4537 focused on international insurance standards and covered agreements. U.S. federal representatives would have been required to consult with state insurance regulators and Congress, provide access to negotiating texts, and submit reports before entering into agreements. The bill would have required U.S. negotiators to provide congressional access to negotiating texts and consult with State insurance commissioners. Future covered agreements were to be submitted to Congress for possible disapproval under \"fast track\" legislative provisions. The Congressional Budget Office's cost estimate found that the cost of consultations would be less than $500,000 per year. S. 1360, introduced by Heller and cosponsor Senator Jon Tester, aimed to create an \"Insurance Policy Advisory Committee on International Capital Standards and Other Insurance Issues\" at the Federal Reserve. It required annual reports and testimony on ongoing discussions at the IAIS through 2020. The Federal Reserve and FIO would conduct a study on the impact of international capital standards, with public comment and review by GAO. Final international capital standards would need to be published in the Federal Register for comment. The International Insurance Standards Act of 2017 (H.R. 3762) was introduced by Representative Sean Duffy and cosponsor Representative Denny Heck on September 13, 2017. It was discussed in a hearing by the House Financial Services' Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance on October 24, 2017, but did not progress further in committee action. Another bill, H.R. 4537, with similar provisions, was later introduced and ordered reported by the House Committee on Financial Services on December 13, 2017. H.R. 3861, introduced by Sean Duffy and cosponsor Representative Denny Heck, aimed to amend Dodd-Frank Act provisions related to the Federal Insurance Office. The bill sought to limit FIO's focus, place it within the Office of International Affairs, require consensus with states on international matters, and remove its authority to collect information from insurers. It also proposed that the Secretary of the Treasury would have the authority to preempt state laws under covered agreements. The Secretary of the Treasury would have authority over covered agreements, limiting FIO to five employees."
