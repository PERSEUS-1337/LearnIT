This study proves the local stability of optimizing SGP $\\mu$-WGAN with suitable assumptions on equilibrium and penalty measure $\\mu. The use of measure valued differentiation helps handle penalty terms' derivatives. Penalizing data or sample manifold is crucial for regularizing WGAN with a gradient penalty. Experimental results with unintuitive penalty measures supporting theoretical findings are provided. Deep generative models, particularly generative adversarial networks (GANs), have revolutionized the modeling of complex data structures. Despite their success in various computer vision applications, GANs face challenges such as training instability and mode collapse. Injecting instance noise and exploring different divergences are common strategies to address these issues. The injection of instance noise and exploring different divergences are strategies to address challenges faced by GANs. S\u00f8nderby et al. (2017) proposed injecting noise into real and fake samples, showing its positive impact on data distribution support. f-GAN suggests f-divergence between target and generator distributions, while WGAN resolves GAN problems by using Wasserstein distance as divergence. However, WGAN may fail with simple examples due to difficulties in achieving Lipschitz constraint on discriminator. The Lipschitz constraint on the discriminator is rarely achieved during optimization, leading to the proposal of using a gradient penalty. Previous studies have shown the equivalence of noise injection and regularizing with a gradient penalty in GANs. The stability of GANs can be improved by regularizing with a simple gradient penalty term, as proven by theoretical analysis. This study aims to prove the convergence property of the simple gradient penalty in GANs. The study aims to prove the convergence property of the simple gradient penalty in GANs under general gradient penalty measures. It is the first theoretical approach to GAN stability analysis dealing with abstract singular penalty measures. The main contributions include proving the regularized effect and local stability of the dynamic system for a general penalty measure, introducing measure valued differentiation for handling parametric measures, and explaining the stability based on the proof. The study explores the convergence property of the simple gradient penalty in GANs under general gradient penalty measures. It introduces measure valued differentiation for parametric measures and examines the stability based on the proof of the stability. Experimental results show that test penalty measures, although unintuitive, still satisfy assumptions and yield similar convergence outcomes. Preliminary measure theoretic concepts are necessary to justify the smooth changes in the dynamic system. The text discusses the use of linearization theorem and parametric measures in dealing with gradient terms. It also introduces a differentiable dynamic system and soft regularization for GAN optimization. The study focuses on the discriminator and generator functions, real data distribution, and generated samples distribution induced by the generator function. The continuous dynamic system approach is used to analyze GAN optimization with gradient descent algorithm. The concept of weak convergence for finite measures is crucial for ensuring the continuity of the integral term in the dynamic system. Bounded measures are defined as having a finite and bounded set of measures in the sample space. The Portmanteau theorem provides an equivalent definition of weak convergence for finite measures, which is essential for the integrals over p \u03b8 and \u00b5 in the dynamic system. The Portmanteau Theorem states that a bounded sequence of finite measures converges weakly if integrals with respect to the measures converge. Dealing with the derivative of the integral is challenging when the penalty measure is singular, requiring the concept of a weak derivative of a probability measure. The WGAN optimization problem with a simple gradient penalty term is defined as an SGP \u00b5-WGAN optimization problem with a penalty measure \u00b5 and penalty weight hyperparameter \u03c1 > 0. The penalty term is introduced to update the discriminator, and stability can be observed by analyzing the spectrum of the Jacobian matrix. The simultaneous gradient descent algorithm for GAN updating can be seen as an autonomous dynamic system of discriminator and generator parameters. Two examples are investigated, including the univariate Dirac GAN with a gradient penalty. The results are then generalized to a finite measure case. Consider the Dirac GAN problem with a penalty measure satisfying certain conditions. The SGP \u00b5-WGAN optimization dynamics with a finite penalty measure \u00b5 \u03c8,\u03b8 are locally stable at the origin with an open basin of attraction. This idea can be extended to other examples where WGAN fails to converge to equilibrium points. The toy example with normalized probability measure \u00b5 \u03c8,\u03b8 is considered, along with a scenario where ideal equilibrium points are given. The convergence property of WGAN with a gradient penalty on a penalty measure \u00b5 is discussed. The system is locally stable near the equilibrium points, with parameters converging to ideal conditions for GANs. As the parameters approach equilibrium, the sample distribution converges to the real data distribution, making it indistinguishable for the discriminator. The stability of SGP \u00b5-WGAN relies on assumptions regarding the discriminator's inability to differentiate between generated and real data, the constancy of higher order terms, and the absence of \"bad\" equilibrium points near desired points. These assumptions allow for extension to discrete probability distributions. The stability of SGP \u00b5-WGAN relies on assumptions related to penalty measures and equilibrium points. Assumptions include the independence of penalty measure \u00b5 from discriminator parameter \u03c8 and the smooth approach of penalty measure \u00b5 to data manifolds. Weak versions of these assumptions are also proposed to ensure equilibrium. The gradient penalty regularization term relies on a penalty measure that smoothly approaches data manifolds near the equilibrium. This ensures stability in SGP \u00b5-WGAN by maintaining a flat discriminator on the penalty area. The main result explains the regularization effect of penalty measures such as \u00b5 GP, p d, p \u03b8, and their mixtures in a smooth manner. The dynamic system is proven to be locally stable near the equilibrium under modified assumptions. The stability analysis is based on tools described by Nagarajan & Kolter (2017). The necessary conditions for the penalty measure are proposed, and local stability is proven for penalty measures satisfying Assumption 6. The SGP \u00b5-WGAN optimization problem is shown to be locally stable at the equilibrium point (\u03c8*, \u03b8*). A detailed proof of the convergence theorem is provided in the Appendix. The proof involves three steps: canceling out undesired terms in the Jacobian matrix at equilibrium, ensuring local stability with positive definite Q and R matrices, and addressing zero eigenvalues by showing N(Q^T) \u2282 N(R^T). The analysis focuses on WGAN and its regularization using penalty measures, yielding results similar to gradient penalty methods. Various penalty measures were tested on different problems. Based on two-dimensional problems and datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-10, penalty measures were compared with WGAN using gradient penalty terms. Different penalty measures were tested, including three recently proposed measures and two artificial ones, with SGP \u00b5-WGAN as the model examined. In the experiments, various penalty measures were compared, including p \u03b8, p d, \u00b5 GP, \u00b5 mid, and \u00b5 g,anc. The BID3 implementation was used with modified loss functions for image generation tasks like CIFAR-10. Benchmark scores like inception score and FID were used to evaluate the generated images. Convergence of p \u03b8 was checked for 2D examples and MNIST digit generation with five penalty measures. The SGP-WGANs were trained on MNIST and 25 Gaussians for 200K iterations, 8 Gaussians for 30K iterations, and Swiss Roll data for 100K iterations. Results for MNIST with penalty measures \u00b5 mid and \u00b5 g,anc are shown in Figure 1. DCGAN and ResNet architectures were tested on CIFAR-10 dataset for 200K iterations. Inception score and FID were used to evaluate image quality. In this study, the local stability of simple gradient penalty \u00b5-WGAN optimization for a general class of finite measure \u00b5 was proven. The theoretical approach was supported by experiments using unintuitive penalty measures. Future research can explore extending the works to alternative gradient descent algorithms and optimal hyperparameters. Stability at non-realizable equilibrium points and optimal penalty measures for achieving the best convergence speed can be investigated using spectral theory. Using spectral theory, the stability of GAN convergence is analyzed mathematically. The equilibrium point (0, 0) is found, and local stability is determined based on the Jacobian matrix. The system's stability is proven through a Lyapunov function, ensuring non-negativity and convergence. The given system is stable according to the Lyapunov stability theorem and globally stable if \u00b5 \u03c8,\u03b8 is a probability measure. The basin of attraction is the whole R 2 plane. The system is locally stable when A = 0. Consider the Dirac-GAN setup and SGP \u00b5-WGAN optimization system with a slightly changed discriminator function D 2 (x; \u03c8) = \u03c8x 2. The system with a slightly changed discriminator function does not converge to (0, 0) but has equilibrium points on the whole \u03c8-axis. The dynamic system for the SGP \u00b5-WGAN optimization problem can be expressed as \u03c8 = \u2212\u03b8 2 \u2212 4/3 \u03c1\u03c8\u03b8. The system is stable and globally stable if \u00b5 \u03c8,\u03b8 is a probability measure, with the basin of attraction being the entire R 2 plane. The Jacobian matrix at the equilibrium (\u03c8 * , \u03b8 * ) is given, with notation for derivatives and matrices explained. \u00b5 \u03c8,\u03b8 and \u00b5 \u03c8,\u03b8 are considered as row and matrix of finite signed measures respectively. The block matrix A B \u2212B T 0 is Hurwitz for a negative definite matrix A and full column rank matrix B. If Q is positive definite and R is full column rank, the proof is complete. Considering the case where Q or R T R have zero eigenvalues, eigenvectors T D and T G are used to show equilibrium points. Projection orthogonal to N (Q) and N (R T R) is considered for perturbations. Projection orthogonal to N(Q) and N(RTR) is considered for perturbations, assuming v \u2208 N(Q) and w \u2208 N(RTR). Equilibrium points are shown for points (\u03c8* + \u03bev, \u03b8*) with |\u03be| < \u03bed and D(x; \u03c8* + \u03bev) is an equilibrium discriminator for |\u03be| < \u03b4d. Additionally, g(\u03b8*) = g(\u03b8* + \u03bdw) = 0 for |\u03bd| < \u03bdg, implying E p\u03b8*+\u03bdw[D(x; \u03c8*)] = 0 for a close |\u03bd| < g."
