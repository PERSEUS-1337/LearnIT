    "content": "Career and technical education (CTE), also known as vocational education, provides occupational and non-occupational preparation at various education levels. CTE prepares students for roles outside the paid labor market, teaches general employment skills, and skills required in specific occupations or careers. It distinguishes itself from academic education by focusing on practical application and developing broadly applicable skills. The federal government has a history of supporting workforce development, including CTE. The federal government has a long history of supporting workforce development, including career and technical education (CTE). This support dates back to the First Morrill Act of 1862, which established land-grant colleges for teaching agricultural and mechanical arts to the \"industrial classes.\" Federal funding for vocational education began with the Smith-Hughes Act in 1917, emphasizing its importance for national defense and prosperity. The Manpower Development and Training Act of 1962 aimed to retrain individuals with obsolete skills to address high unemployment due to advancing technology. The 1963 Vocational Education Act supported vocational schools, work-study programs, and research in the field. The federal government supports vocational education through various programs, including those authorized by the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act of 2006. In FY2009, there were 34 federal programs providing occupational or vocational training. These programs are administered by different departments such as the Department of Education, Department of Labor, Department of the Interior, and Department of Health and Human Services. The report provides an overview of Career and Technical Education (CTE) to support workforce development efforts amidst high unemployment rates. It discusses the organization of CTE, its role in secondary, postsecondary, and adult education, and the financial benefits of CTE credentials for students. CTE is offered by various institutions including high schools, CTE centers, community colleges, vocational schools, and employers through apprenticeships and on-the-job training. Career and Technical Education (CTE) encompasses various fields other than the liberal arts and integrates knowledge for practical purposes. It includes preparation in homemaking, nursing, business administration, culinary arts, automotive maintenance, software programming, engineering technology, and cosmetology. CTE coursework is organized into career clusters and pathways aligned with business and industry sectors. Career and Technical Education (CTE) emphasizes alignment with business and industry, preparing students for employment or family life through industry-recognized credentials. Career clusters and pathways are used to organize CTE programs, helping students understand related opportunities and develop necessary skills for postsecondary education or careers. Career and technical student organizations also play a role in supporting CTE. The U.S. Department of Education developed 16 career clusters for high school students to prepare them for postsecondary education or employment. These clusters cover a wide range of industries and are further broken down into career pathways to provide industry-relevant certification and training. The U.S. Department of Education created 16 career clusters for high school students to prepare for postsecondary education or employment. These clusters are divided into career pathways for industry-relevant certification and training. States use career clusters to guide education reform and economic development. 94% of states have adopted or adapted career clusters. Schools can focus on specific clusters for resource efficiency. Career clusters and pathways are used by schools, school districts, and federal agencies to organize learning communities, academies, and occupations. They help convert labor market information into usable career guidance for students and parents. The U.S. Department of Labor categorizes occupations based on career clusters in the O*NET database. The U.S. Department of Education (ED) uses career clusters to classify instructional programs in its O*NET database. In 2012, ED, DOL, and HHS emphasized the importance of career pathways for adults to acquire marketable skills. CTE providers collaborate with industry to develop relevant programs and ensure employable graduates. Community colleges offer customized training to employees based on specific business curriculum requirements. Industry representatives may also provide course instruction or equipment. Business and industry collaboration in CTE programs leads to the development of industry-recognized credentials (IRCs) that validate necessary skills for specific occupations. These credentials are verified qualifications issued by relevant authorities, such as educational institutions or industry associations. Industry-recognized credentials (IRCs) validate skills for specific occupations and can be required for work or to enhance employability. They include degrees, certificates, licenses, and certifications, with varying standards set by industries or governments. Some IRCs are nationally recognized, while others are regional or local. For example, Maryland regulates cosmetology practitioners through exams and training hours. CTSOs are essential in Career and Technical Education (CTE), providing co-curricular programs for students to gain practical experience and network with industry leaders. These nonprofit organizations are organized nationally, with state and local chapters advised by CTE teachers. In 1950, Congress chartered the Future Farmers of America (now FFA) for its role in training farm boys to become successful farmers and leaders. The act established the Chief of the Agricultural Education Service as the national advisor to FFA student officers and chairman of the board of directors. The Secretary of Education may provide personnel, services, and facilities to support FFA activities. CTE at the secondary level prepares students for non-paid roles and specific occupations, contrasting with academic education. At the secondary school level, education includes academic subjects like English, math, science, social studies, fine arts, and foreign languages, as well as enrichment programs covering general skills, health, physical education, religion, and military science. Schools also offer occupational and non-occupational Career and Technical Education (CTE). Non-occupational CTE includes family and consumer sciences education and general labor market preparation, while occupational CTE prepares individuals for specific fields, with some requiring additional postsecondary education. Additional postsecondary education may be required before entering the labor market. Secondary CTE providers include public and private high schools, career academies, area CTE schools, CTE-specific schools, detention centers, and cooperative programs with colleges. National statistics on CTE course offerings and student outcomes are based on surveys conducted before 2010. CTE is offered by the majority of public high schools (83%) but fewer private high schools (29%). Common CTE courses in public schools are in business (97%) and computer technology (95%). Some schools offer CTE courses offsite. Public schools use different approaches like area CTE schools, CTE-specific schools, and career academies. In 2009, 88% of public high school graduates earned at least one CTE credit, with 19% being CTE concentrators. CTE is organized into 11 occupational areas by ED's NCES. In 2005, a higher percentage of white students were CTE concentrators compared to the overall student population. Male students and students with disabilities also had higher rates of completing a CTE concentration. In 2005, a lower proportion of high school graduates who were English language learners completed a CTE concentration (12%) compared to those who were not (21%). The purpose of CTE at the high school level is debated, with some stakeholders believing it increases student engagement and reduces dropout rates. However, recent studies on vocational course taking show mixed results, with more rigorous analyses not supporting a clear link between CTE and higher student engagement. Some students may take CTE courses out of interest rather than for career preparation. Some students may take computer programming classes out of interest, not necessarily for career preparation. Schools may offer these courses to expose students to various career options and help them make informed decisions about their futures. However, some students expect practical job training to enter the workforce immediately after completing a career pathway in high school or postsecondary education. This strategy may conflict with offering unrelated CTE courses to increase student engagement. The study compared postsecondary education enrollment and labor market participation of 2004 public high school graduates, with a focus on CTE graduates. It found that a lower percentage of CTE graduates enrolled in postsecondary education but a higher percentage worked for pay within two years of graduation. Additionally, 22% of CTE graduates were in a postsecondary major related to their high school CTE concentration. Recent standards-based reform efforts in elementary and secondary education have integrated CTE to varying degrees. CTE graduates working for pay but not in postsecondary education had 30% in a related occupation. There was no significant wage difference between all graduates working for pay and CTE graduates. In postsecondary education, CTE graduates had a higher percentage majoring in agriculture and natural resources (3%) and a lower percentage in non-CTE fields (16%) compared to all graduates. Standards-based reform in education involves setting ambitious goals for all students, aligning curricula and assessments with these goals, and establishing performance standards to measure student achievement. This reform also includes aligning teacher professional development and school policies to support these goals. States have developed content and performance standards, assessments, and curricula to support education goals. CTE curriculum standards have been established by many states at secondary and postsecondary levels, based on input from educators and businesses. Efforts have been made to align high school curricula with workforce and college readiness. The National Governor's Association, Council of Chief State School Officers, and 49 states began developing common standards for K-12 education in 2009 to prepare students for college and careers. Business stakeholders were not formally involved, but some supported the standards. By 2014, 45 states, the District of Columbia, three territories, and the Department of Defense had adopted the standards, leading to contentious implementation in some states. The Common Career Technical Core (CCTC) was developed in June 2012 by a state-led initiative involving 42 states, the District of Columbia, Palau, business and industry representatives, educators, and other stakeholders. It provides standards for 16 career clusters and pathways in postsecondary CTE programs, focusing on imparting knowledge and skills relevant to specific occupations. This contrasts with liberal arts education, which emphasizes academic knowledge in a subject area. The liberal arts encompass general instructional programs in various subjects, while CTE students pursue credentials in non-liberal arts programs. Postsecondary CTE providers include vocational schools, technical colleges, community colleges, and private two-year colleges. Postsecondary CTE providers include vocational schools, technical colleges, community colleges, and private two-year colleges, as well as employers, labor organizations, industry groups, regional training centers, adult workforce education centers, and detention centers. Some CTE programs lead directly to employment, while others can be a stepping stone to a more advanced credential. The ability to transfer CTE credits towards a bachelor's degree highlights the conflicting purposes of CTE at the postsecondary level. Critics raise concerns about preparing students for lower-wage jobs, while proponents emphasize CTE as occupational preparation for higher-paying careers. Proponents of CTE highlight high wages and growth in CTE occupations, exceeding some bachelor's degree holders. Not everyone wants or can pursue a bachelor's degree. Difficulty in structuring postsecondary CTE programs with bachelor's degree requirements may deter CTE students. Figure 1 shows subject areas of AY 2011-2012 CTE graduates' associate's degrees or certificates. In AY2011-2012, the majority of CTE graduates completed programs in health professions and business management. Most CTE associate's degrees and certificates are awarded by public and private for-profit institutions. Private not-for-profit institutions award only 5% of these credentials. CTE completions vary between subbaccalaureate certificate and associate's degree levels. Public and private for-profit IHEs contribute equally to subbaccalaureate certificate completions, while public IHEs award more associate's degrees. Adult CTE includes work-related courses for skill acquisition, which can be formal postsecondary education or nonformal education through community organizations. In 2005, the Department of Education conducted a national survey on work-related course-taking by adults aged 16 and over. 27% of adults participated in work-related learning, with higher rates among older individuals, those more engaged in the labor market, and those with higher levels of education. Alternative credentials like certificates or licenses are associated with earnings benefits for individuals without a postsecondary degree. Starting in 2012, the U.S. Census Bureau began collecting data on alternative education credentials such as licenses, certifications, and educational certificates held by individuals over the age of 17. Over 90% of these credentials were obtained following coursework or training. Alternative credentials are associated with a wage premium for populations without a postsecondary degree, especially in CTE fields. The U.S. Census Bureau started collecting data on alternative education credentials in 2012, showing that individuals with professional certifications or licenses earn more than those with just a high school diploma. Associate's degree holders with certifications or licenses have higher earnings compared to those with educational certificates. Earnings vary across different CTE fields. Since 1984, Census has reported earnings differences among adults by field of training and educational credential. Vocational certificates and associate's degrees in technical CTE fields like computer services have higher earnings than those in less technical fields like business. For example, in 2009, individuals with a vocational certificate in engineering-related fields had median monthly earnings of $3,833. Individuals with a vocational certificate in engineering-related fields had median monthly earnings of $3,833, while those with a certificate in business/office management fields earned $2,800. The same earnings pattern holds for individuals with associate's degrees."
