The Act titled \"Energy Storage Technology Advancement Act of 2007\" defines key terms related to energy storage technology, including the Department of Energy, electric drive vehicles, islanding, and microgrids. The term \"microgrid\" refers to an integrated energy system with interconnected loads and distributed energy resources that can operate independently or in parallel with the utility grid. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. A \"self-healing grid\" is capable of automatically responding to power system disturbances. \"Spinning reserve services\" are excess electric generating capacity beyond peak demand. The Basic Research Program is outlined in Section 3. The Secretary conducts a basic research program for energy storage systems in various applications. Funding is awarded to stakeholders for research activities, with an authorization of $50,000,000 for this program. The Secretary is allocated $50,000,000 annually from 2009 to 2014 for energy storage system research.
