    "content": "The Act titled \"Let My Absentee Ballot Count Act of 2010\" amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 by adding a new section outlining requirements for the treatment of absentee ballots in federal elections. The Act \"Let My Absentee Ballot Count Act of 2010\" amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 by adding requirements for absentee ballot design and confirmation of acceptance before the election. The \"Let My Absentee Ballot Count Act of 2010\" amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 by requiring tracking procedures for received absentee ballots in federal elections. This includes online access to confirm receipt or a toll-free telephone number if no internet site is available. The \"Let My Absentee Ballot Count Act of 2010\" requires tracking procedures for received absentee ballots in federal elections. If a federal office does not have an Internet site, they can provide information through a toll-free telephone number. This information includes whether the absentee ballot was counted and reasons if it was not. Individuals informed before an election about their absentee ballot status can subsequently cast their vote at a polling place. If an individual casts a ballot at the polling place after voting absentee, the absentee ballot will not be counted. The ballot cast at the polling place will be treated as a regular ballot and not provisional, and the individual will not be in violation of any laws regarding voting multiple times in an election. The section prohibits casting more than one vote in an election, regardless of the accuracy of information provided. States cannot reject absentee ballots for lack of notarization or witness signatures. The provisions do not affect requirements for absentee voting by uniformed services or overseas citizens. Amendments are made to ensure enforcement and clerical accuracy in the Act. The table of contents of the Act is amended by inserting ``303, and 303A''. Sec. 303A outlines requirements for the treatment of absentee ballots."
