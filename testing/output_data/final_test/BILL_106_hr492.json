    "content": "The national standard for carrying certain concealed firearms by nonresidents is outlined in Section 1. The national standard for carrying certain concealed firearms by nonresidents is established in Section 926B of Chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code. This allows nonresidents with a valid state-issued concealed carry permit to carry a concealed firearm in another state, as long as the firearm was transported in interstate or foreign commerce. Nonresidents with a valid state-issued concealed carry permit can carry a concealed firearm in another state under the same restrictions. If the other state does not issue permits, certain locations are off-limits for carrying a concealed firearm. Amendment made by inserting a new item after section 926A. SEC. 2. EXEMPTION OF QUALIFIED CURRENT AND FORMER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS FROM STATE LAWS PROHIBITING THE CARRYING OF CONCEALED HANDGUNS. Section 926C allows qualified current and former law enforcement officers to carry concealed handguns with proper identification, regardless of state laws. A qualified law enforcement officer is defined as someone authorized to carry a firearm in the course of duty. A qualified former law enforcement officer is an individual who retired from service with a public agency as a law enforcement officer, has a nonforfeitable right to retirement benefits, and meets agency requirements regarding firearms. A law enforcement officer is someone authorized to engage in law-related activities and must have appropriate written identification. The document must identify the holder as a current or former officer, agent, or employee of the agency. The amendments allow qualified current and former law enforcement officers to carry concealed handguns. The effective date of these amendments is 180 days after the enactment of the Act."
