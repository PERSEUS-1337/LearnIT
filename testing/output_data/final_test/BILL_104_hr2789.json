    "content": "The Act titled \"Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund Act of 1995\" establishes the Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund is created in the Treasury of the United States to finance expenses of the National Railroad Passenger Corporation and eligible States. The Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund provides funding for qualified expenses to eligible States. The available amounts for fiscal years 1996 to 2000 are $131,000,000, $663,000,000, $667,000,000, $670,000,000, and $672,000,000 respectively. Each eligible State receives an amount based on their qualified expenses for the fiscal year. The Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund allocates funding to eligible States based on their qualified expenses. The formula for determining the amount includes a percentage of transferred and credited funds, as well as the number of months the State was eligible in the previous fiscal year. If the calculated amount exceeds the appropriated funds, adjustments are made. The Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund allocates funding to eligible States based on qualified expenses incurred for capital improvements in intercity passenger rail service. Expenses must be certified by the Secretary of Transportation to meet requirements. The Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund allocates funding to eligible States that lack intercity passenger rail service from Amtrak. The Secretary will determine the necessary funds by October 1, 2000, to cover qualified expenses and transfer any excess to the Mass Transit Account. The Secretary is also authorized to transfer funds from the Highway Trust Fund for intercity passenger rail purposes. The Secretary will transfer the intercity passenger rail portion of taxes from the Highway Trust Fund to the Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund. This portion is determined at a rate of 0.5 cents per gallon for taxes imposed after December 31, 1995, and before October 1, 2000. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to reduce outlays of the Mass Transit Account for a fiscal year by the amount exceeding available funds in the account. This change aligns with transfers to the mass transit account from the Highway Trust Fund. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to reduce outlays of the Mass Transit Account by the amount exceeding available funds, aligning with transfers from the Highway Trust Fund. Additionally, section 4081 is modified to include a new item in the table of sections for subchapter A of chapter 98. The amendments made by this section regarding the Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund apply to taxes imposed after December 31, 1995."
