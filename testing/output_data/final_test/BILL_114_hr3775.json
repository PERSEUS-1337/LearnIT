    "content": "The \"Pay Down the Debt Act of 2015\" is cited as the short title. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended to include a new title VI on Debt Stabilization, introducing a debt stabilization process. The \"Pay Down the Debt Act of 2015\" introduces budget targets for debt-to-GDP ratios, requiring reports on projected ratios exceeding prior years, and mandates the President's budget alignment with these targets. The \"Pay Down the Debt Act of 2015\" mandates that if projected debt-to-GDP ratios exceed certain levels for fiscal years 2017 through 2025, both the President's budget and the congressional budget resolution must include measures to meet the specified targets. The \"Pay Down the Debt Act of 2015\" requires committees of the House and Senate to recommend changes in laws to achieve budget targets. It also sets a point of order for budget resolutions that do not include directions to meet the targets. Additionally, any stabilization legislation must adhere to discretionary spending limits. The \"Pay Down the Debt Act of 2015\" sets requirements for stabilization legislation to adhere to spending limits. If Congress fails to agree on such legislation during a debt stabilization process, bills increasing budget authority or decreasing revenues are not allowed in the House or Senate. The House of Representatives may consider waiving a rule that applies to certain points of order. The Chair will decide on the consideration of propositions subject to points of order. Debate on consideration is allowed for ten minutes by each Member initiating a point of order and their opponent. The question of consideration will be decided without any intervening motion except for adjournment or rising of the Committee of the Whole. Amendments to the question are allowed. Amendments to bills or resolutions must also be considered for consideration under the same rules. In the Senate, a three-fifths majority is required to waive or suspend certain rules. The requirements of this title may be suspended during low growth if the Secretary of the Treasury notifies. The requirements of this title may be suspended if the Secretary of the Treasury notifies the President and Congress that the GDP growth is minimal or if a joint resolution deems the legislation harmful to the economy. If the Secretary of the Treasury notifies the President and Congress that the GDP growth is minimal or a joint resolution deems the legislation harmful to the economy, the requirements of this title may be suspended. Effective with regard to the first fiscal year beginning at least 6 months after the notification or enactment of the joint resolution, such suspension is no longer in effect. SEC. 602. CONSIDERATION OF ALTERNATIVE PROPOSALS. If Congress fails to agree on a budget resolution by June 15 during a debt stabilization process triggered by a report from the Congressional Budget Office, any member can introduce a bill to achieve the budget target. The bill must be titled 'To stabilize the debt pursuant to section 602 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.' The Congressional Budget Office will provide a cost estimate for the bill to the appropriate committees. The bill introduced must have a cost estimate provided by the Congressional Budget Office to the appropriate committees. If the bill has a certain number of cosponsors, it will receive expedited consideration in either the House of Representatives or the Senate. The bill introduced must have a cost estimate provided by the Congressional Budget Office to the appropriate committees. If the bill has a certain number of cosponsors, it will receive expedited consideration in either the House of Representatives or the Senate. Pursuant to paragraph (1), the committee shall report the bill to the House without amendment within three legislative days. If the committee fails to do so or if the House is adjourning sine die, the committee will be discharged from further consideration of the bill. It will then be placed on the appropriate calendar for consideration within 3 legislative days. The motion to proceed with a bill in the House must be made within two legislative days after announcing the intention, and cannot be made after a motion to proceed with a special message has been disposed of. The previous question is ordered on the motion without any other motions in between. Reconsidering the vote on the motion is not allowed. The House shall immediately proceed to consider the bill without intervening motion, with waived points of order. The previous question is ordered on the bill for passage with 2 hours of debate and one motion to limit debate. Reconsidering the vote on passage is not allowed. The Senate committees must report the bill without amendment within three session days after introduction. If the committee fails to do so or the Senate adjourns sine die, the bill will be automatically discharged and placed on the calendar. After the bill is reported or the committee is discharged, any motion to proceed must be made within three session days. If a bill is not discharged by the Senate committees within three session days, any Senator can move to proceed to consider the bill without debate. Once agreed to, the Senate will immediately proceed to consider the bill without any interruptions, and it will remain unfinished business until disposed of. The Senate limits consideration of a bill to 10 hours, with 1 hour for debatable motions. No amendments are allowed for bills referred to in the paragraph before. The bill referred to in paragraph (1) can have a provision struck from it during consideration in the Senate or House of Representatives. If one House receives a bill from the other before passing the bill in paragraph (1), the receiving House's procedure remains the same until the vote on passage, at which point the received bill supplants the original one. The term 'stabilization legislation' refers to any legislation certified by the chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives or the Senate to reduce the deficit or debt held by the public. This is part of the Debt Stabilization process outlined in Title VI of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974."
