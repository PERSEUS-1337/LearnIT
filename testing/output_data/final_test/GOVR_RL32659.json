    "content": "On October 7, 2004, the Senate rejected Senator John McCain's proposal to transfer jurisdiction over intelligence funding from the Senate Appropriations Committee to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. On October 9, 2004, the Senate established a new Subcommittee on Intelligence within the Senate Committee on Appropriations. The 9/11 Commission issued its final report on the September 11, 2001 attacks, outlining findings and recommendations for improving national security against future terrorist threats. The 9/11 Commission recommended restructuring congressional oversight of intelligence to enhance effectiveness against future terrorist attacks. It proposed either replacing existing intelligence committees with a joint committee or consolidating intelligence functions within existing committees to empower oversight. The goal is to establish a structured framework with limited powers for a small group of members to effectively oversee the intelligence establishment. The report focuses on the proposal to consolidate appropriation and authorization functions in the existing Senate and House Select Intelligence Committees. It describes the proposal, compares it to the existing committee system, provides arguments for and against consolidation, discusses alternatives, and describes current legislation. The 9/11 Commission proposes combining intelligence authorization and appropriation authorities under a single committee in each chamber, transferring jurisdiction over intelligence appropriations from the Senate and House Appropriations Committees to the intelligence authorization committees. The commission also recommends reducing the membership of the intelligence committees. The 9/11 Commission recommends reducing the membership of intelligence committees to seven or nine members in each chamber, with indefinite terms and subpoena power. It also suggests granting seats on the committees to members from specific panels and combining intelligence authorization and appropriation authorities under a single committee in each chamber. The Senate and House Appropriations Committees report measures providing funding for agencies, programs, projects, and activities. Appropriations for the intelligence community fall under the jurisdiction of the Senate and House Committees on Appropriations, while intelligence authorizations are overseen by the Senate and House Select Intelligence Committees and Armed Services Committees. Appropriations for the 15 agencies of the intelligence community are split among five subcommittees under the Senate and House Appropriations Committees. The intelligence community's budget is divided into three components: National Foreign Intelligence Program, Joint Military. The CIA and Office of the Director of Central Intelligence fall under the jurisdiction of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittees. Intelligence agencies under the Department of Defense account for approximately 80 percent of all U.S. spending for intelligence. The intelligence community is divided into three components: National Foreign Intelligence Program, Joint Military Intelligence Program, and Tactical Intelligence and Related Activities. These programs fund various intelligence activities to meet national, DOD-wide, and tactical military needs. DOD agencies funded by these programs include Defense Intelligence Agency, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, National Reconnaissance Office, and National Security Agency. The National Foreign Intelligence Program funds various intelligence agencies including CIA, Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Energy, FBI, Department of Justice, and Department of the Treasury. Senate and House committees oversee intelligence community authorization. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence oversees authorizations of appropriations for various intelligence agencies, including the CIA, Defense Intelligence Agency, NSA, and FBI. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence oversees authorizations for intelligence agencies, including the CIA, Defense Intelligence Agency, NSA, and FBI. It shares jurisdiction with the Senate Committee on Armed Services over the National Foreign Intelligence Program, DOD's Joint Military Intelligence Program, and Tactical Intelligence and Related Agencies. Other authorizing committees also have oversight over smaller portions of intelligence activities. In the House, the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has exclusive jurisdiction over the National Foreign Intelligence Program, including the CIA and Intelligence Community staff. It shares jurisdiction over other components with the House Committee on Armed Services through sequential referrals. Other committees may claim jurisdiction over intelligence matters. As Congress analyzes the commission's proposals, it may consider changing the jurisdictions over intelligence of the various authorization committees. This could involve consolidating the authorization authority over the intelligence community in the House and Senate Select Intelligence Committees. Examples of consolidation include providing the Senate Select Intelligence Committee with jurisdiction over the entire intelligence community or giving both select Intelligence Committees exclusive jurisdiction over intelligence. The 9/11 Commission proposed reorganizing the intelligence community by creating a new National Intelligence Program led by a National Intelligence Director. This would involve transferring intelligence appropriations to ensure implementation of the commission's recommendations. Congress may consider giving exclusive jurisdiction over intelligence to the Select Intelligence Committees in both houses. In the 19th century, jurisdiction over appropriations bills shifted between spending and authorization committees. The House and Senate established separate standing committees for spending and authorization, with the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees initially overseeing both revenue measures and general appropriation bills. After the Civil War, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees were created, taking over jurisdiction of general appropriation bills. These committees have been in existence for almost 140 years. In the late 19th century, the House and Senate started consolidating the appropriation and authorization functions of certain activities. The House and Senate consolidated appropriation and authorization functions by transferring jurisdiction over general appropriations bills to various committees. This fragmentation reduced central committee control over spending for approximately 35 years until bills were re-centralized in the House Appropriations Committee in 1920. The Senate also transferred jurisdiction over some bills to authorization committees in 1899. In 1922, the Senate re-centralized jurisdiction over all general appropriations bills in the Senate Appropriations Committee. Scholars have suggested theories for the fragmentation of appropriating authority, including concerns about economy, geographic bias in spending distribution, excessive power of the House Appropriations Committee, and a desire for more equitable distribution. Some Representatives and Senators sought a more equitable distribution of congressional power, aiming to reduce the influence of certain committee chairs. Executive agencies opposed Congress's control over spending, leading to decentralization of appropriations. Scholars believe this shift, along with economic factors, contributed to increased spending. The House and Senate later resumed centralizing appropriations authority in their respective committees. In response to the increase in expenditures and national debt after World War I, Congress centralized budget decision-making in the executive and legislative branches. The House centralized appropriations bills in the House Appropriations Committees, and the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 established the Bureau of the Budget. The Bureau recommended reorganizing appropriations bills on administrative lines, which was adopted by the House Appropriations Committee. However, procedural difficulties arose soon after. In 1922, the Senate re-centralized all general appropriations bills under the Senate Appropriations Committee and organized them along administrative lines. Today, spending is mainly controlled by the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees, along with the Senate and House Appropriations Committees. Committees oversee spending, with entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare making up 57% of FY2003 spending. Authorization committees evaluate programs, while appropriations committees determine funding levels. There are differences between past and present practices that affect the 9/11 Commission proposal. Authorization committees play a key role in determining funding levels for agencies and programs, providing detailed guidance for spending, and establishing and changing programs or projects. Annual appropriations acts offer more specific instructions compared to authorization acts, which are typically temporary and provide spending guidance to appropriations committees. The 9/11 Commission proposal would transfer jurisdiction over all intelligence appropriations to select intelligence committees, changing the organization of appropriations bills to align with administrative lines for both program activities and salaries. The congressional budget process involves setting annual spending ceilings and revenue floors, distributing spending among committees, and enforcing decisions through points of order and reconciliation. Budgetary information is publicly available to inform Congress and the public. The congressional budget process includes various spending ceilings such as total spending ceilings, committee spending ceilings, and appropriations subcommittee ceilings. Funding levels in measures considered by Congress are also available. Spending priorities are debated publicly during the annual budget resolution. Members enforce spending ceilings through points of order. Intelligence spending may pose challenges for transferring appropriations to authorization committees as the classified nature makes enforcement difficult. Intelligence appropriations would not be publicly enforced under the existing budget process. Intelligence appropriations are not part of the congressional budget process, with classified spending hidden in Defense appropriations bills. Members may consider modifying the budget process to include classified spending. Spending ceilings for Defense Appropriations Subcommittees are enforceable and publicly available, but total intelligence spending remains classified. The 9/11 Commission recommends improving Congressional oversight of intelligence by adopting reforms to enhance the capabilities of the House and Senate intelligence committees. This includes transferring appropriations authority to ensure effective oversight. Supporters argue for stronger intelligence oversight committees in Congress to provide independent monitoring of the secretive intelligence community. They believe robust oversight is crucial to monitor activities and ensure accountability. Transferring appropriations authority to intelligence authorizing committees is seen as a way to implement the 9/11 Commission's recommendations for improved oversight. The 9/11 Commission recommends transferring appropriations authority to intelligence authorizing committees to ensure successful implementation of proposals for a National Intelligence Director and National Counterterrorism Center. Centralizing executive branch national intelligence authority under a National Intelligence Director is proposed, but some argue against consolidating appropriation and authorization. Some argue for a consolidation of appropriation and authorization functions to provide control over executive branch intelligence power. This would give intelligence committees budgetary leverage for strong congressional checks and clear accountability. It aims to reduce conflicting directives to intelligence entities. Consolidation of appropriation and authorization functions is proposed to provide control over intelligence policies and programs. This would reduce conflicting directives to intelligence entities and ensure a more integrated perspective on national intelligence needs. The Defense Appropriations Subcommittees may focus on military intelligence needs at the expense of national intelligence needs. Intelligence needs may not always be adequately funded due to competing non-intelligence needs. Transferring jurisdiction over appropriations to intelligence committees could attract more members and make the committees more attractive. Increasing the attractiveness of intelligence committee membership by transitioning from limited to indefinite terms could ensure continuity and more informed oversight. Opponents argue that consolidation may reduce oversight of program quality, with budget analysis potentially becoming the primary focus for committees with consolidated jurisdiction. Consolidating jurisdiction of intelligence committees may lead to inadequate attention to program quality and weaken oversight. Critics argue that having only one committee overseeing intelligence could result in the loss of competitive analysis and checks and balances within Congress. Close relationships between intelligence committees and agencies could also compromise rigorous oversight. Some argue that consolidating intelligence committees could weaken oversight and lead to a shift in intelligence spending priorities. Senator Daniel K. Inouye emphasizes the importance of linking defense and intelligence for the military's needs. The Defense Subcommittee reviews recommendations from the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees to ensure needs are met. Increasing intelligence spending could lead to reduced oversight and unchecked spending. Members argue for dispersing appropriations to maintain spending controls. Some Members are concerned that transferring intelligence appropriations to select committees could set a precedent for other discretionary spending programs. Opponents of merging authorization and appropriation functions argue for a thorough analysis before any major overhaul. There are suggestions to restructure the jurisdiction of authorization committees to avoid concentrating too much power in intelligence committees. Some argue that consolidating authorization and appropriations jurisdiction within intelligence committees could lead to excessive power. This could result in fewer members questioning intelligence policies and practices. A bicameral approach may be necessary to transfer appropriations jurisdiction. Opponents may argue that a bicameral approach is needed for transferring appropriations jurisdiction to intelligence committees to avoid potential drawbacks in the conference process. This would involve one chamber approving a unified intelligence appropriation bill while the other passes a defense appropriations bill containing most intelligence funding. Congress is considering alternatives to consolidate intelligence authorization and appropriation, including a Joint Committee on Intelligence and establishing an Intelligence Appropriations Subcommittee in each chamber. The 9/11 Commission recommended replacing existing select intelligence committees with a joint committee modeled after the former Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. The former Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, established in 1947 and dissolved in 1977, was a powerful 18-member committee with equal representation from both chambers of Congress. It had exclusive legislative and oversight jurisdiction over the Atomic Energy Commission and nuclear energy, allowing it to report legislation to both the Senate and House. This unique authority limited policy competition to the Senate and House Appropriations Committees, making the joint committee one of the most influential in Congress. The Joint Committee on Atomic Energy had exclusive access to restricted data and strong leverage over nuclear activities. An alternative proposal suggests creating separate intelligence appropriations subcommittees in the Senate and House Appropriations Committees. This would transfer intelligence appropriations from existing subcommittees to new ones, retaining program-quality and budget analyses separately. The alternative proposal suggests creating separate intelligence appropriations subcommittees in the Senate and House Appropriations Committees, retaining program-quality and budget analyses separately. This approach would not concentrate power in a single committee, making it easier to implement than the 9/11 Commission's recommendation. It also aims to provide a more comprehensive national perspective on intelligence spending decisions. Opponents argue that establishing intelligence appropriations subcommittees may increase spending and neglect military intelligence needs. Concerns include diffuse congressional accountability compared to the 9/11 Commission proposal. A proposal to consolidate intelligence appropriation and authorization in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence was rejected in 2004. McCain proposed transferring appropriations and spending authority related to intelligence funding from the Senate Appropriations Committee to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. The Senate adopted a resolution establishing a separate Subcommittee on Intelligence in the Senate Appropriations Committee. The Appropriations Committee will identify the intelligence activities to be transferred to the new subcommittee. The Senate Appropriations Committee reorganized subcommittees to maintain 13 in total. An amendment merged Military Construction and Defense Subcommittees, replaced by final language proposed by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison. The House is expected to respond. The House rejected a proposal on 9/11 Commission oversight. In a vote of 203-213, a proposal was made to implement one of the 9/11 Commission's recommendations for establishing a Joint Committee on Intelligence or a single committee in each chamber with jurisdiction over intelligence authorizing and appropriating authorities. The proposal was an amendment to H.R. 10, the 9/11 Recommendations Implementation Act, introduced by Representative Robert Menendez."
