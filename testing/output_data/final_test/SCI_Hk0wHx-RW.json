    "content": "Deep latent variable models are popular in machine learning for representation learning. A new model is proposed in this paper to address shortcomings in the deep information bottleneck model. By applying a copula transformation, the new model achieves disentanglement of features in the latent space and sparsity. The method is evaluated on artificial and real data, emphasizing the importance of compact representation and interpretability in latent feature spaces. In this paper, the focus is on latent space representation learning using the deep information bottleneck (DIB) model. The DIB model combines the information bottleneck and variational autoencoder methods to identify relevant features with respect to a target variable. The variational autoencoder (VAE) is a generative model that learns a latent representation of x using the variational approach. The DIB model, a generative model, learns a latent representation t of x using the variational approach. It has shortcomings related to invariance and sparsity in the latent space. The contribution of this study is to restore invariance properties by making the latent space only depend on the copula. The proposed copula transformation in the DIB model ensures invariance properties by making the latent space solely dependent on the copula. This approach simplifies the model, resolves issues with marginal distributions, and exploits the sparse structure of the latent space for better interpretability. The copula transformation in the DIB model addresses shortcomings and induces sparsity in the latent space. The IB principle aims to compress x while retaining information from y, by solving a variational problem. Copula models combined with IB principle have been extended to be invariant against transformations and applied to analyze deep neural networks. The variational autoencoder in BID25 quantifies mutual information between network layers and sets an information theoretic limit on DNN efficiency. It combines the variational bound and reparametrisation trick from BID13 and BID22 to learn the posterior distribution of the latent space and decoder. The solution of the information bottleneck is identified with the latent space of the variational autoencoder, with variational lower bounds considered in BID3 and BID0. A significant amount of work has been done on modeling the latent space of deep neural networks, with various approaches such as group sparsity regularization and removing neurons with limited impact on the output layer. Recent methods involve training smaller neural networks to mimic larger ones and disentangling the latent space. However, none of these approaches consider the influence of the copula on the modeled latent space. The influence of the copula on the modelled latent space is not considered in existing approaches. A parametric formulation of the information bottleneck is used, with conditionals and a Markov chain assumed. The proposed model includes a graphical illustration in Figure 1. The model includes circles representing random variables and rectangles for deep nets parametrizing them. Latent random variables are denoted by blue circles, while copula transformed random variables are represented by red circles. The model assumes a conditional independence copula and Gaussian margins, with functions implemented by deep networks. The deep information bottleneck model is not invariant to strictly. The deep information bottleneck model is not invariant to strictly increasing transformations of the marginal distributions. Invariance property can only be guaranteed if the model is flexible enough to compensate for these transformations, which can be a severe problem in practice. The deep information bottleneck model may face challenges when dealing with bounded intervals for the output domain of y. Assumptions about the distribution marginals are needed even with non-Gaussian distributions. The authors argue that constant terms in the decoder side equation can be disregarded, except for cases involving monotone transformations of y. The deep information bottleneck model encounters challenges with bounded intervals for the output domain y. Constant terms in the decoder side equation can be ignored, except for cases involving monotone transformations of y. The entropy term h(y) in the model specified with mutual informations is not invariant to monotone transformations due to the differential entropy h(y) being dependent on such transformations. The entropy term h(y) in the deep information bottleneck model is not invariant to monotone transformations of y, leading to different (I(x, t), I(y, t)) pairs in the information curve. To address this issue, transformed variables using Gaussian cdf and empirical cdf are utilized, with the mapping being approximately invertible. The deep information bottleneck model addresses invariance issues by transforming variables using Gaussian cdf and empirical cdf, making the model a variational autoencoder with technical details involving a simple prior distribution. The divergence D KL (p \u03c6 (t|x) p(t)) is a divergence between two Gaussian distributions with an analytical form. Gradients are estimated on (mini-)batches for training the model using backpropagation. To handle deterministic nodes, the reparametrisation trick is used. The sparsity constraint on the information bottleneck, along with the copula transformation, results in a sparse latent space t. The Sparse Gaussian Information Bottleneck compresses x to a new variable t by minimizing I(x; t) \u2212 \u03bbI(t; y). The Sparse Gaussian Information Bottleneck compresses x to a new variable t by minimizing I(x; t) \u2212 \u03bbI(t; y), preserving information with respect to a second variable y. The optimal t is a noisy, sparse projection of x, with mutual information I(x; t) = 1/2 log |A\u03a3xA + I|. The Sparse Gaussian Information Bottleneck compresses x to a new variable t by minimizing I(x; t) \u2212 \u03bbI(t; y), preserving information with respect to a second variable y. This implies sparsity of A and a reduction in mutual information can only be achieved by a rank-deficient matrix A. The sparsity induced in the latent space of the copula version of the DIB is explained by allowing for an abstract pre-transformation of x, f \u03b2, in connection with the imposed sparsity constraint. This translates to the sparsity of the latent space of the copula DIB, measured by the number of active neurons in the last layer of the encoder. The Sparse Gaussian Information Bottleneck model compresses x to a new variable t by minimizing mutual information I(x; t) while preserving information with respect to y. The encoder part of the DIB involves a pre-transformation f \u03b2 of x parametrized by \u03b2. The optimization is performed over a matrix M containing samples of Af \u03b2 (x) and \u03b2 parameters. The estimator of I(x; t) simplifies to \u00ce(x; t) = 1 2 log |A\u03a3 x A + I|, or \u00ce(x; t) = 1 2 i log(D ii + 1) if D is diagonal. This model is equivalent to the Sparse Gaussian Information Bottleneck. The Sparse Gaussian Information Bottleneck model compresses x to a new variable t by minimizing mutual information I(x; t) while preserving information with respect to y. The sparsity constraint does not affect the generality of the IB solution as long as the matrix is diagonal. By approximating the diagonal part of the matrix, a low-dimensional representation of the latent space can be found. Minimizing an upper bound I(x; t) in the Information Bottleneck cost function leads to this approximation. The copula transformation in the Deep Information Bottleneck model aims to find the most orthogonal representation of inputs in the latent space, leading to disentanglement and sparse structure. Experimental verification of the copula's contributions is conducted to test its impact. The experiments test the impact of the copula transformation in the Deep Information Bottleneck model. Pair-wise experiments compare DIB without and with the copula transformation (cDIB) using artificial and real-world datasets. Monotone transformations are applied to an artificial dataset to assess reconstruction and classification performance differences between DIB and cDIB. The input matrix X is created using defined vectors and latent variables z1 and z2 are normalized. Target variables y1 and y2 are calculated, forming a spiral when plotted. A one-dimensional latent space can only reconstruct the spiral's backbone, requiring at least two dimensions to capture radial details. 200k samples are generated from X and y, with X transformed to beta densities. In the experiment, 200k samples from X and y are transformed and split into test and training sets. A latent layer with ten nodes models the means of a ten-dimensional latent space. The model, consisting of a neural network with two hidden layers, is trained using mini batches with the Adam optimizer for 70000 iterations. In the first experiment, comparing information curves of DIB and copula augmentation showed an increase in mutual information from 6 to 11 in the copula DIB. The copula DIB used only two dimensions in the latent space, outperforming the version without copula using 10 out of 18 dimensions. Experiment 2 builds on this by further analyzing the trained model. Experiment 2 builds on the findings of Experiment 1 by assessing the predictive quality of trained models on test data. The mutual information curve shows increased predictive capability of cDIB, indicating that the increased mutual information is not solely due to overfitting. In Experiment 3, the reconstruction capability of cDIB is qualitatively assessed compared to plain DIB, with a focus on the reconstruction quality of y on test data. The reconstruction quality of plain DIB on test data results in a tight backbone that cannot reconstruct y well. Information curves for an artificial experiment show how copula transformation improves resilience against outliers and adversarial attacks during training. An adversarial attack is simulated by replacing 5% of data entries with outliers. The copula model shows higher robustness against outlier data compared to the plain model due to the copula transformation. The copula transformation in the DIB leads to faster convergence rates compared to the plain DIB, as the marginals are normalized to the same range of normal quantiles. The copula transformation in the DIB results in higher convergence rates and increased robustness against outlier data. The impact of the copula transformation on the latent space is analyzed using a real-world dataset, the Communities and Crime dataset BID15 from the UCI repository. The dataset consists of 125 predictive, 4 non-predictive, and 18 target variables with 2215 samples. After preprocessing, 1901 observations with 102 predictive and 18 target variables are used for analysis. A latent layer with 18 nodes models the means of the 18-dimensional latent space, with the variance set to 1 for both the latent and output space. The stochastic encoder and decoder in the model consist of neural networks with two fully-connected hidden layers. Softplus is used as the activation function, and the decoder employs a Gaussian likelihood. The model is trained for 150000 iterations with mini batches of size 1255 using Adam BID12 with a learning rate of 0.0005. Experiment 6 involves computing information curves from the DIB and cDIB models, adjusting the \u03bb parameter every 500 iterations. The copula model shows higher mutual information values, attributed to its increased flexibility. Section 3.3 discusses the impact of copula transformation on the number of dimensions in the latent space. The copula DIB uses only four dimensions compared to eight dimensions in DIB, resulting in lower mutual information scores. A Kruskal-Wallis rank test confirms significant differences in information curves. Experiment 7 highlights the disentanglement of latent spaces in DIB models with and without copula transformation, showcasing correlations with target variables and class labels. The latent space of DIB and cDIB for \u03bb = 21.55 is compared in Figure 6, showing that cDIB has a clearer structure. The copula transformation leads to a disentangled latent space with non-overlapping modes of marginal distributions, improving representation learning in deep latent variable models. Restoring invariance properties of the Deep Information Bottleneck with a copula transformation results in disentanglement of features in the latent space. The copula transformation leads to sparsity in the latent space and allows for a simplified non-parametric treatment of marginal distributions. The method was evaluated on artificial and real data, showing improved prediction capability and resilience to adversarial attacks. The copula transformation is motivated by the lack of invariance properties in the original Information Bottleneck model. The copula transformation in the Deep Information Bottleneck model enhances disentanglement of features in the latent space, leading to sparsity and improved prediction capability. It also shows resilience to adversarial attacks and influences convergence rates positively. This addition promises to be a simple yet powerful tool in deep learning. The copula transformation in the Deep Information Bottleneck model improves feature disentanglement in the latent space, leading to sparsity and better prediction capability. Comparing the copula DIB with the plain DIB in Experiment 1 shows that the copula version outperforms, using fewer dimensions and producing better information curves. Different extensions of Experiment 1 include comparing the copula transformation to data normalization and using a gamma transformation instead of a beta transformation. The copula pre-transformation in the Deep Information Bottleneck model yields higher information curves and uses fewer dimensions in the latent space compared to Experiment 1 with a gamma transformation instead of a beta transformation."
