    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"In-Home Caregiver Assessment Resources and Education Act\" or the \"In-Home CARE Act\". The findings of the Act are also outlined. Congress finds that more than 43 million unpaid caregivers, primarily women, provide care for chronically ill, disabled, or aged family members. Ethnic minority caregivers, especially African-American and Hispanic-American caregivers, experience greater strain and worse physical health. Caregivers' needs vary based on factors such as race, ethnicity, age, social class, and gender. Unpaid family caregivers spend an average of 24 hours per week caring for their loved ones, with 23 percent providing 41 or more hours of care. Forty-nine percent care for a parent, while 14 percent care for a special needs child. In 2016, the average caregiver for someone 18 years or older spent $6,954 per year on caregiving expenses, nearly 20 percent of their annual income. (9) Sixty percent of caregivers providing care for adults have made work schedule modifications, with almost half taking time off from work. (10) Fifty-three percent have experienced health declines, affecting their ability to provide care. (11) Forty-six percent of caregivers of adults face challenges in caregiving. (11) 46% of adult caregivers perform medical tasks for patients with multiple conditions, with 78% managing medications, fluids, or injections. 20% assisting with medication management and 33% with changing dressings received no training. 84% of caregivers need more support. Home visiting programs are cost-effective and improve outcomes for children and parents. The Act aims to support unpaid caregivers and enable individuals to receive care at home instead of in institutions or hospitals. It includes provisions for caregiver grants under the Public Health Service Act. The Secretary will award grants to eligible organizations for home visiting programs for unpaid caregivers, defined as family members or adults providing care for individuals with special needs. The grants aim to support caregivers by assessing their needs, resources, and strengths. The term 'child or adult with a special need' refers to individuals requiring care to meet basic needs, prevent self-injury, or avoid institutional placement. An 'eligible organization' includes local government agencies, health care entities, or nonprofit/community organizations with experience in providing specified services. The Secretary will coordinate with relevant parties to implement this section. The Secretary shall coordinate with various programs and agencies to ensure caregiver services for individuals with special needs and avoid duplicative services. Eligible organizations must submit an application with an outreach plan to identify caregivers in the community. The organization will identify caregivers in the community most in need of support and education, especially those providing complex care activities. They will also focus on caregivers caring for individuals at risk of needing institutional care and who wish to participate in the caregiver home visiting program. The eligible organization will provide services directly using grant funds and through contracts or referrals. The eligible organization will identify gaps in services for caregivers and individuals with special needs, provide caregiver assessments, education, and training based on evidence-based models. Caregivers require education and training on medication management, wound care, nutrition, fall prevention, mental health conditions, assistance with daily living activities, engaging family members in care, and utilizing resources effectively. The curr_chunk discusses recommendations for home modifications and physical environmental changes to improve the health and quality of life of individuals with special needs. It also includes information on the organization's ability to provide or refer caregivers to local resources for physical and mental health care, transportation, and home modification services. The curr_chunk provides details on the services offered by eligible organizations for caregivers, including transportation, home modification, respite care, adult day care, support groups, and legal assistance. It also highlights the organization's ability to coordinate with other agencies and understanding of caregiver issues across various demographic groups and conditions. The curr_chunk outlines the capacity of eligible organizations to engage caregivers, family members, and individuals with special needs. It also describes the population of caregivers, their needs, existing services, and the priority given to organizations by the Secretary. The curr_chunk details the criteria for eligible organizations to receive grants for caregiver home visiting services, including the ability to provide ongoing support, use evidence-based programs, and demonstrate sustainability. Eligible organizations receiving grants for caregiver home visiting services must use funds for initial home visits, caregiver education, referrals for services, physical and mental health assessments, and referrals as needed. The Secretary will establish a technical assistance center to provide support for programs funded by grants under this section, including evidence-based models, training, answering questions, and facilitating information exchange among grantees. The Secretary will evaluate the success of the grant program for caregivers of individuals with special needs, including a reduction in hospitalizations. The evaluation of the grant program for caregivers of individuals with special needs will focus on reducing hospitalizations, institutionalizations, cost reductions, improved connection to community resources, care quality, and overall quality of life for both caregivers and individuals with special needs. The assessment will also consider improvements in stress, anxiety, health, relationships, mood, and community engagement. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress with recommendations on changes to the grant program for caregiver home visiting programs, expanding the number and scope of grants, and extending the length of the program. Authorization of appropriations is also included."
