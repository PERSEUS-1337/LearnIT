    "content": "This paper introduces continuous convolution to neural networks, projecting input data into a high-dimensional RKHS to model it as a continuous function. A closed-form solution for continuous convolution between functions in different RKHS is derived, allowing for more expressive filters without spatial discretization. Experiments on image classification show promising results. The proposed continuous convolutional neural network achieves competitive accuracy rates with fewer parameters and faster convergence in image classification tasks. Convolutional neural networks have gained popularity in computer vision for tasks like object detection and semantic segmentation due to their translational invariance, spatial connectivity, and shared weights. The convolution operation in computational tasks involves data discretization for easier computation, using a discrete approximation by sliding filters over input data. Fast Fourier transform can improve performance in convolutional neural network calculations, but may not address memory requirements. Various techniques have been used to optimize convolutional neural networks, such as sparse networks, spatial sparseness, octrees, quantization for mobile devices, and lookup-based networks. These methods aim to improve computational efficiency and model compression. This paper introduces continuous convolution to neural networks by projecting information into a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) to reconstruct input data as a continuous function. The framework allows for a closed-form solution to continuous convolution between functions in a high-dimensional space, optimizing neural networks by learning weight parameters and activation values efficiently. Optimizing neural networks involves learning weight parameters and the RKHS that defines each convolutional filter, resulting in more descriptive feature maps for discriminative and generative tasks. High-dimensional projection, such as infinite-layer neural networks, combines kernel-based learning with deep learning. Unlike other works that use the kernel trick on discretized image patches, this approach operates solely on data already projected to high-dimensional spaces. Additionally, the model jointly learns kernel parameters alongside traditional weight values, increasing the degrees of freedom in the resulting features. Continuous Convolutional Neural Networks (CCNNs) were proposed to increase degrees of freedom in feature maps for image classification. The technique achieved competitive accuracy with smaller network sizes and was also applied to unsupervised learning with a convolutional auto-encoder generating continuous function representations. The Hilbert Maps (HM) framework projects input data into a continuous space for calculations, primarily used for occupancy mapping and terrain classification. The curr_chunk discusses the use of Logistic Regression as a classification tool for occupancy mapping and terrain modeling. It explains the dataset used for learning a discriminative model and the use of a weight vector to produce flexible representations. The Logistic Regression classifier is chosen for its computational speed and direct extension to online learning. The curr_chunk discusses the use of Logistic Regression classifier BID6 for occupancy mapping. It explains the probability of occupancy for a query point x* using a feature vector \u03a6(.) in RKHS. Weight parameters w are optimized based on data in D by minimizing a negative log-likelihood cost function with regularization term R(w). The resulting model can query occupancy state of any input point x* without space discretization. Feature vector \u03a6(.) is crucial for defining input point representation in RKHS and approximating popular kernels. The feature vector proposed places inducing points in the input space to correlate data using a Gaussian distribution kernel. Each inducing point has its own mean and covariance parameters, resulting in a feature vector calculated for x in relation to the inducing points. This approach is similar to sparse random feature vectors but with different length-scale matrices for each inducing point. The feature vector proposed in the Hilbert Maps paper embeds non-stationarity by using different length-scale matrices for each inducing point. Efficiency is increased by using a subset of nearest neighbors for feature vector calculation. This approach has been successful in reconstructing large-scale 3D datasets at a fraction of the computational cost of other similar techniques, making it attractive for big data processing. The parameters of each kernel in M are fixed and calculated based on statistical information, with only the classifier weights optimized during training. The Hilbert Maps framework embeds non-stationarity by using different length-scale matrices for each inducing point, increasing efficiency by using a subset of nearest neighbors for feature vector calculation. The HM training methodology can be reformulated to optimize all parameters, including kernel parameters, using joint optimization techniques. This allows for more descriptive kernels and efficient calculation of partial derivatives during feature vector generation. An example of this joint learning process is illustrated in FIG1 for a simple 1D classification problem. The proposed Hilbert Layer (HL) framework improves upon the Hilbert Maps (HM) framework by learning kernel parameters and using fewer inducing points. HL achieves better results in both high and low densities, with sharper transitions and improved representation of under-represented areas. Unlike HM, HL can handle both classification and occupancy tasks. The proposed Hilbert Layer (HL) framework improves upon the Hilbert Maps (HM) framework by learning kernel parameters and using fewer inducing points. HL can handle both classification and occupancy tasks. In Section 2.1, the joint learning methodology can be modified for regression tasks by removing the activation function \u03c3 and optimizing mean squared error. The Hilbert layer can be extended to a convolutional scenario, creating the Convolutional Hilbert Layer (CHL) for image classification tasks. The Hilbert Layer framework enhances the Hilbert Maps by learning kernel parameters and using fewer inducing points. It can handle classification and occupancy tasks, and can be extended to a convolutional scenario for image classification. The framework approximates complex functions using simple kernels in a high-dimensional RKHS, simplifying the convolution of two Gaussian distributions. The convolutional Hilbert Layer framework simplifies the convolution of two Gaussian distributions by representing activation values between different functions in their respective RKHS. It can be optimized using the same training methodology to improve generative or discriminative models. The convolution between two parameter sets representing different functions is performed using a block-matrix for weight multiplications. The convolutional Hilbert Layer framework simplifies the convolution of two Gaussian distributions by using a block-matrix for weight multiplications. The output weights approximate the convolution in the RKHS defined by the cluster set, forming the parameter set P h. The convolution process is detailed in Algorithm 1, where each inducing point in the input parameter sets is convolved to obtain the convolved parameter set P h. The convolutional Hilbert Layer framework simplifies convolution using a block-matrix for weight multiplications. The output weights approximate the convolution in the RKHS defined by the cluster set, forming the parameter set P h. Multiple input channels and filters can be incorporated by concatenating K pq f g into a block-matrix. The output shows higher activation values in areas similar to the filter, capturing small variations and partial matches with higher detail than discrete convolution. Pooling can also be applied. The convolutional Hilbert Layer simplifies convolution using a block-matrix for weight multiplications, capturing small variations and partial matches with higher detail than discrete convolution. Pooling BID22 can be incorporated to decrease computational cost and resolution, while un-pooling increases resolution at the expense of more parameters. This process allows for larger filter sizes and number of channels, combating over-fitting and aggregating statistics of spatially close regions. A diagram illustrating the application of the convolutional Hilbert layer in an image classification task is shown in FIG5. Continuous Convolutional Neural Network (CCNN), shown in FIG5, models the original image as a continuous function in a RKHS. Each image is represented with a different set of model weights and convolved with filters to produce hidden feature maps. The final model weights are flattened for input into a fully connected neural network. The model weights are flattened for input into a fully connected neural network to classify different categories. The convolutional parameters optimized in this topology are cluster sets and filter sets that define the RKHS for each feature map and perform transformations between feature maps. Variance values are ensured to be positive-definite by learning a lower triangular matrix. To improve parameter initialization, a continuous fully-convolutional auto-encoder (CCAE) is employed, encoding data into a lower-dimensional latent feature vector representation and then decoding it back. The encoding pipeline consists of convolutional Hilbert layers from the classification topology, while the decoding pipeline reverses these layers without parameter sharing. A lower-dimensional representation is achieved by reducing the number of clusters used for feature map projection in deeper layers, simulating a pooling effect. In experiments, inducing points were initialized with mean values equally spaced in 2D space and with the same variance value. Weight values were initialized randomly using a truncated Gaussian distribution. Experimental results were presented to validate the proposed convolutional Hilbert layer in image classification scenarios using standard benchmarks like the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The datasets used in the experiments included MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, and SVHN, with varying numbers of training and test images. No preprocessing or data augmentation was applied. Reconstruction results for MNIST and CIFAR-10 using the proposed HL framework were shown in FIG7, where images were projected into the same input RKHS for optimization. The joint learning methodology optimized cluster set parameters and model weights to minimize reconstruction error. These parameters were then used in a continuous convolutional neural network (CCNN) for image classification. A continuous convolutional auto-encoder (CCAE) initialized the network's convolutional parameters. The proposed continuous feature maps were compared against a standard DCNN for image classification. In the study, a DCNN architecture with very few filters was used for image classification on the MNIST dataset. Results showed that a single continuous filter outperformed twenty discrete filters in both training and test accuracy. The continuous filter also exhibited less overfitting and continued to improve the loss function over time. The study compared DCNN and CCNN architectures for image classification on the MNIST dataset. CCNN showed less overfitting and maintained lower loss function values throughout training. Initial parameter values played a significant role, especially with fewer filters. Convolutional filters in CCNN exhibited variability and ability to model different patterns for classification. The study compared DCNN and CCNN architectures for image classification on the MNIST dataset, with CCNN showing less overfitting and lower loss function values. Results for three datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and STL-10, were presented in tables showing classification accuracy for various methods.
