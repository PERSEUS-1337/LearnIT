Despite federal funding for broadband initiatives, the gap still persists. Other challenges to closing the divide include increasing adoption. The digital divide in the United States persists despite federal funding for broadband initiatives. Challenges include increasing adoption, addressing broadband infrastructure in rural areas, costs of internet service and devices, and digital literacy skills. Simplistically equating the digital divide with just one barrier increases division in society. Broadband infrastructure initiatives funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 have concluded, but the FCC and RUS continue to have active programs. States are crucial in expanding broadband access, with various initiatives serving as potential models for federal programs. The term broadband refers to high-speed internet faster than dial-up. Federal funding focuses on broadband, while state efforts also address digital literacy and inclusion. Each state has unique approaches to broadband deployment. The term broadband refers to high-speed internet access faster than dial-up, defined by the FCC as 25/3 Mbps. Approximately 21.3 million Americans lack access to broadband at these speeds, with various technologies like DSL, cable modem, fiber, wireless, satellite, and BPL. The digital divide exists due to limited or no broadband infrastructure in many areas, influenced by factors like terrain, population density, demography, and market conditions. The FCC has broadband programs to bridge the digital divide and expand universal service principles, ensuring all Americans have access to communication services at reasonable rates. Various federal initiatives aim to address barriers and push communities across the digital divide, including increasing broadband adoption and providing digital literacy training. Despite strides in broadband deployment, challenges persist in closing the digital divide, with some citizens unable to access broadband due to socioeconomic factors. The Universal Service Fund was established to provide voice services and high-speed internet to underserved areas. It includes four programs: High Cost/Connect America Fund, Low Income (Lifeline) program, Schools and Libraries (E-rate) program, and Rural Health Care program. These programs aim to support rural areas, low-income consumers, schools, libraries, and rural health care providers with telecommunications and broadband services. The Universal Service Fund programs are funded by mandatory contributions from interstate telecommunications providers based on their revenues. The FCC adopted the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund to deploy high-speed broadband networks in rural America, with $20.4 billion over 10 years. Phase I targets unserved census blocks with speeds of at least 25/3 Mbps, providing up to $16 billion overall. The FCC's Rural Digital Opportunity Fund aims to provide broadband at speeds of at least 25/3 Mbps, with $16 billion allocated for unserved census blocks in Phase I. Phase II will target partially served areas with $4.4 billion, while the proposed 5G Fund for Rural America plans to allocate $9 billion for advanced 5G services in remote areas through a reverse auction. The FCC terminated the Mobility Fund Phase II due to unreliable LTE coverage data from providers and replaced it with the 5G Fund. Details of the 5G Fund are still forthcoming from the FCC. The USDA has various broadband connectivity programs including the Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee program, Community Connect Grants program, Telecommunications Infrastructure Loans and Loan Guarantees program, Distance Learning and Telemedicine program, and ReConnect program that provide funding for broadband deployment and infrastructure in rural areas. The ReConnect program offers loans and grants for broadband infrastructure in rural areas. Eligibility requirements vary by program, such as the Community Connect program which targets areas lacking 10 Mbps download speed. Funds can be used for building facilities and deploying broadband for residential and business customers. The Infrastructure Loans and Loan Guarantees program defines eligible areas as rural areas or towns with a population of 5,000 or fewer without telecommunications facilities. Approximately $2.5 billion was allocated through the Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP) under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to deploy infrastructure in rural areas. The Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) funded by the same act was a $4 billion grant program to bridge the digital divide by deploying broadband infrastructure. The BTOP program, funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, aimed to bridge the digital divide by deploying broadband infrastructure. As the program ended in 2015, NTIA launched BroadbandUSA to provide technical assistance and resources to communities seeking to improve broadband access. Although BroadbandUSA does not offer funding, it supports efforts to attract employers, create jobs, improve healthcare, and increase public safety. Funding for BroadbandUSA is appropriated annually. State governments are increasingly taking action to ensure all residents have access to broadband, regardless of location or socioeconomic factors. State broadband initiatives focus on infrastructure deployment, adoption, mapping, feasibility, digital equity, inclusion, gigabit broadband, and addressing the homework gap. These initiatives allow grant funds to be used for building infrastructure assets like conduits, fiber-optic cable, and wireless. State programs allocate funds for infrastructure assets like conduits, fiber-optic cable, and wireless towers, with speed requirements typically set at 25/3 Mbps. New York's $500 million Broadband Program aims to provide high-speed internet access to unserved and underserved areas, with 90% of funding awarded to projects connecting these locations for the first time. Building out broadband infrastructure in challenging areas of the United States may leave some communities with limited or no options to subscribe to broadband. States have explored public-private partnerships to expand broadband access, where the county or municipality offers resources to make deployment financially attractive to providers in return for technical expertise and investment. The North Carolina Broadband Infrastructure Office promotes public-private partnerships to bring technical expertise, innovation, equipment, and capital investment into underserved areas. Partners share risks and costs of broadband deployment. Examples include cost-sharing opportunities, community anchor tenants, and leasing rights of way for broadband infrastructure installation. The municipality can utilize its vertical assets for broadband infrastructure installation, and policies can encourage public-private partnerships to expand broadband access. In February 2020, a $5 million fiber network partnership was announced in New Mexico to provide advanced broadband to businesses along a 107-mile route. Building new broadband infrastructure in suburban or rural areas can be challenging due to terrain or other hindrances. Building new broadband infrastructure in suburban or rural areas can be challenging due to terrain or other hindrances. One option to address this challenge is to leverage existing infrastructure via rights-of-way grants or permits, allowing the use of public land or federal assets for deploying broadband infrastructure. This approach aims to lower the cost of broadband buildouts and encourage private-sector companies to expand broadband infrastructure, in line with the American Broadband Initiative's efforts to stimulate increased private sector investment in broadband. Arizona's Smart Highway Corridor Program aims to use the highway system for broadband infrastructure, with nearly $50 million in funding announced by Governor Doug Ducey to install over 500 miles of conduit and fiber optic cable in rural areas. This initiative will improve broadband capacity in Arizona's rural and tribal areas, addressing the ongoing challenge of broadband accessibility, especially in rural areas. The California Broadband Adoption Fund, created in 2017 through Assembly Bill 1665, aims to address barriers to broadband adoption by providing grants for digital literacy training programs and public education in communities with limited broadband adoption. The Public Utilities Commission prioritizes programs in communities with low broadband access, including low-income and senior citizen communities. Mapping broadband availability in the US is challenging due to factors like data accuracy and lack of validation. The FCC's Fixed Broadband Deployment Map has been criticized for inaccuracies. In early 2019, the FCC discovered inaccuracies in the Fixed Broadband Deployment Map's data, leading to potential overstatement of broadband availability. This could result in overbuilding in some areas while leaving others underserved. Efforts are being made to address mapping issues with the Digital Opportunity Data Collection, but a more accurate national broadband map may take several years to develop. States are creating their own broadband maps to assess actual availability. The Georgia legislature passed the ACE Act in 2018 to identify areas lacking broadband connectivity. The Georgia Broadband Deployment Initiative developed a database of premises in three pilot counties to identify broadband connectivity gaps. The pilot program surveys individual locations for broadband access, revealing inaccuracies in FCC maps. A statewide map for Georgia is expected by June 2020. The Georgia Broadband Deployment Initiative is working on a statewide map expected to be completed in June 2020. Conducting a feasibility study can help determine broadband needs, set long-term goals, and evaluate investment options for deploying new networks. Considerations include addressing unserved or underserved areas, digital equity issues, and consumer satisfaction with current internet providers. In Vermont, the Department of Public Service's Broadband Innovation Grant program aims to improve broadband access. The Vermont Department of Public Service's Broadband Innovation Grant program provides funding for feasibility studies and business plans to deploy broadband in rural, unserved, and underserved areas. The program awards up to $60,000 per grant to eligible organizations for proposing new broadband systems with minimum speeds of 25/3 Mbps. If a project can be profitable within three years, an actionable business plan is requested. Studies must be completed within six months of receiving the grant. The grant program from the Vermont Department of Public Service awards funding for feasibility studies and business plans to deploy broadband in rural areas. Studies must be completed within six months, and findings reported to the Commissioner of Public Service. Digital equity, defined by the NDIA, is crucial for full participation in society, democracy, and the economy. Digital inclusion involves access to broadband internet, devices, literacy training, technical support, and online content. State and local governments address digital equity issues based on regional variations. The Detroit Department of... The Detroit Department of Innovation and Technology aims to be a national model for digital inclusion, focusing on partnerships, funding, engaged residents, and political will. The Director of Digital Inclusion will work on expanding computer and internet access in Detroit, tracking progress, and securing funding. The City of Detroit is taking action to provide internet access, devices, and digital skills to residents. The FCC defines broadband as 25/3 Mbps, but higher speeds like gigabit can support multiple devices accessing data-intensive content simultaneously. North Dakota is the first state to offer gigabit service through a state-run network. In July 2019, North Dakota achieved one-gigabit service for all K-12 schools, following a 100-gigabit upgrade to STAGEnet announced in March 2018. This upgrade, in collaboration with the North Dakota Information Technology Department and Dakota Carrier Network, improved connectivity for schools, higher education institutions, and government agencies statewide. The lack of broadband access at home hinders some students from completing online assignments, creating obstacles in urban and rural areas. Many students lack reliable internet access at home, especially those from lower-income households, as schools shift classes online due to COVID-19. Students resort to doing homework at fast food restaurants or making elaborate plans to access Wi-Fi at friends' homes. This highlights the essential need for digital skills in education and participation. To address the homework gap for students lacking internet access, Caldwell County, NC, piloted a program placing Wi-Fi on school buses funded by the Caldwell Education Foundation and Google. Chromebooks are provided for students to use while commuting, allowing them to do online homework. Plans include creating Wi-Fi hot spots in key areas when buses are not in use. Congress has various options to consider for state broadband initiatives. Congress has implemented federal broadband programs, but state initiatives could provide templates for future programs. Congress may expand current initiatives or develop new ones. They may hold hearings on state initiatives to learn from their successes and challenges. Congress may also consider creating a universal method for sharing ideas between states and federal agencies. Pilot broadband initiatives could be developed to test solutions for the digital divide issue. Congress may consider developing pilot broadband initiatives to test different approaches before funding a nationwide program. These initiatives could tie funding to specific goals like adoption or digital inclusion, unlike current federal programs that focus on deployment. Providing federal funding directly to states for broadband initiatives could help expand and sustain state efforts. Attaching federal funding to state initiatives and conducting oversight could help states maximize their potential. Local leadership has called on industry to support where the federal government is lacking, as seen in Detroit's efforts. In Detroit, public-private partnerships have been developed without government funding, but federal resources are needed to sustain the work. Additional funding could support robust outreach and incentivize localized funding. Concerns arise about potential duplicative funding in broadband initiatives, highlighted by the FCC's Rural Digital Opportunity Fund. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's ReConnect Program and state broadband subsidy programs are impacted by a last-minute change, potentially cutting off millions of rural Americans from funding. Nearly every state has its own broadband subsidy program or receives federal funding for broadband. This change could hinder efforts to connect unconnected rural areas, as highlighted by a Pew Report. The FCC Order defines deployment obligations and debates duplication of funds for broadband. FCC Commissioner O'Rielly monitors funding programs to ensure efficient distribution to unserved communities, not areas already served. He voices concerns about overbuilding existing networks with scarce federal dollars. The new 90 percent unserved threshold in federal broadband programs may lead to overbuilding and exclusion of remote areas. States are working on bridging the digital divide through their own initiatives, showing complementary approaches to federal funding for network deployment. Congress may need to consider potential conflicts between avoiding duplication of funds and ensuring unserved areas are not excluded. States are working on bridging the digital divide through their own initiatives, showing complementary approaches to federal funding for network deployment.
