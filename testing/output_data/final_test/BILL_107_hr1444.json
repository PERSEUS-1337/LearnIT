    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Citizen Legislature and Political Freedom Act\". Congress acknowledges that the proliferation of campaign finance laws has placed strict limits on contributions, hindering challengers' ability to compete with incumbent politicians. Contribution limits force candidates to raise funds in small amounts, giving wealthy and long-term incumbents an unfair advantage and discouraging potential candidates from seeking office. The current campaign finance laws hinder challengers from fully discussing public policy issues and favor institutionalized special interests over grassroots and citizen activity. The current campaign finance laws impose burdensome reporting requirements and spending limits on political parties, favoring well-financed interest groups and wealthy individuals. The low contribution limits force contributors and activists to operate outside the system, leading to less accountability and irresponsible behavior. To promote robust discourse, free political speech, and protect constitutional freedom, all restrictions on political contributions should be lifted. The current campaign finance laws impose burdensome reporting requirements and spending limits on political parties, favoring well-financed interest groups and wealthy individuals. To promote robust discourse, free political speech, and protect constitutional freedom, all restrictions on political contributions should be lifted. This includes restrictions on political candidate and party contributions and expenditures, with full, instantaneous disclosure of all contributions and expenditures in elections for Federal office. The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 is amended to remove limitations on campaign contributions starting from 2002. Additionally, taxpayer financing of presidential election campaigns will be terminated. SEC. 4. TERMINATION OF TAXPAYER FINANCING OF PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CAMPAIGNS. This section terminates taxpayer financing of presidential election campaigns starting from taxable years after December 31, 2001.

Excess funds will be transferred to the general fund after that date. Chapter 96 of the Code will also terminate with a transfer of remaining funds to the Treasury's general fund. The provisions of this chapter will not apply to any candidate in presidential elections after December 31, 2002. Clerical amendments are made to update the table of sections in the Code. The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 is amended to include transfers of funds by national political parties to state or local political parties without regard to whether the funds are treated as contributions or expenditures.

PROMOTING EXPEDITED AVAILABILITY OF FEC REPORTS. Mandatory electronic filing for all reports under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 requires each person to maintain and file reports in electronic form accessible by computers. Designations, statements, and reports are now referred to as documents for filing purposes. The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 now requires all reports to be filed electronically, replacing designations, statements, and reports with a single document for filing. Contributions to any political entity must be reported. The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 now mandates that all contributions made to any political committee within 90 days of an election must be reported within 24 hours. The report should include details such as the candidate's name, office sought, contributor's identification, and contribution amount. The notification required under this paragraph must be submitted in addition to other reporting requirements under the Act. The amendment will be effective for reports starting on or after January 1, 2003.

This amendment applies to contributions for elections after January 2003. SEC. 8 prohibits labor organizations from involuntarily assessing funds for political activities. The Federal Election Campaign Act is amended to prohibit labor organizations from collecting dues for political activities without individual authorization. The authorization remains valid until revoked and individuals must be informed of their right to revoke it at any time.
