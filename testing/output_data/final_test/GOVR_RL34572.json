    "content": "Phthalates are chemical compounds used to make plastics in consumer products, with the most common use being to increase flexibility in PVC and PVDC polymers. These compounds are released into the environment and some can cause reproductive damage in rodents. Governmental bodies are concerned about potential human health effects from exposure to six main phthalates: DEHP, DBP, BBP, DINP, DIDP, and DnOP. The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 prohibits the sale of children's toys containing certain phthalates. Phthalates are not highly toxic but can damage reproduction and development in rodents at high doses. Some phthalates, if given to pregnant females at sufficient levels, can cause malformations in offspring's reproductive organs, especially males. Exposure to phthalates in rats during gestation can lead to testicular cancer in offspring. The higher the exposure, the more severe the effects on the reproductive system. While rat fetuses are most vulnerable, older rats can also be affected. Disruption of hormonal functions in humans can result in abnormal reproductive development. Studies suggest that phthalates may cause similar malformations in humans as seen in rodents, but conclusive evidence is lacking. The 2005 study showed developmental effects in human male infants exposed to phthalates. NHANES results indicate widespread American exposure to multiple phthalates, with children being the most exposed group. Levels of DINP breakdown product were undetectable in children. Phthalates are widely dispersed in the environment, with babies being the most heavily exposed group. Food and air are major sources of exposure, along with personal care items and medications. Medical devices can also be significant sources of exposure for critically ill patients. The new law requires regulation of six phthalates, which differ in structure, uses, and toxicities. These phthalates are more studied, toxic, and prevalent in consumer products and the environment compared to others. All six have been evaluated by the National Toxicology Program. DEHP, the most abundantly produced phthalate, is used to improve flexibility in PVC plastic. It is found in medical devices and home products. The NTP has expressed serious concern about DEHP exposure affecting male reproductive tract development in infants and children. Several studies have explored associations between DEHP and health effects like thyroid hormone levels, asthma, and obesity. DBPs, including di-n-butyl and di-isobutyl phthalate, are used in various products. The NTP found adverse effects on the male reproductive tract in rodents due to di-n-butyl phthalate. The NTP has concerns about DBP causing adverse effects on human development, especially the male reproductive system. Studies have shown a link between DBP exposure and testosterone synthesis in fetal male rats. BBP, used in various products, has similar effects to DBP and DEHP. The latest NTP monograph on BBP was released in 2003, based on studies before 2001. BBP exposure in animal studies showed adverse developmental effects at high levels, but estimated human exposure was lower. NTP had minimal concern for fetal and infant effects from BBP. Papers post-2001 confirmed BBP's developmental toxicity. DEHP, DBP, and BBP were deemed equally toxic by a U.S. EPA toxicologist. BBP is used to enhance plastic flexibility in products like gloves, straws, hoses, and toys, replacing DEHP in some instances. DINP is the most common phthalate in toys. DINP is the most commonly used phthalate in toys, but evidence suggests it is less potent than DEHP and DBP in causing developmental harm. Dr. Leon Earl Gray rated DINP as less potent than DEHP, DBP, and BBP for causing developmental harm. Studies on rodents show consistent findings on developmental toxicity and potential allergic responses to DINP exposure. The European Commission recommended precautionary restrictions on the use of DINP in toys and childcare articles due to uncertainties in exposure evaluation. Several studies have been conducted to estimate children's exposure to DINP in toys due to mouthing behavior. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and a Japanese study found higher exposures than initially estimated. The National Toxicology Program (NTP) had minimal concern for developmental effects, but this conclusion was controversial. Exposure to DINP in children was previously thought to be negligible based on MINP levels, but recent research suggests that other metabolites like MCIOP, MOINP, and MHINP are more significant. Estimates of DINP exposure may be underestimated. DIDP is another plasticizer used in various products, with no direct evidence of adverse effects on reproduction or development in humans. Studies have shown that exposure to DIDP can cause adverse developmental effects, but NTP concluded that exposures were probably not high enough to cause concern. Scientists had minimal concern for developmental effects in fetuses and children, and DIDP was not found to adversely affect human reproduction. Recent studies have found endocrine-disrupting effects following rodent exposure to DIDP. On the other hand, DnOP, used to improve plastic flexibility, has limited evidence of causing developmental effects in highly exposed rodents. There are few studies on the potential toxicity or exposure to DnOP. The NTP found limited evidence of DnOP causing developmental effects in highly exposed rodents. No reproductive effects were observed in available studies. Regulatory agencies like the EPA, OSHA, FDA, and CPSC may potentially regulate phthalates depending on their use. EPA regulates various phthalates released into the environment under its statutes. The EPA and other regulatory agencies oversee the regulation of phthalates in various ways, including as hazardous air pollutants, drinking water contaminants, and in consumer products. Federal agencies have taken actions to evaluate and regulate phthalates, with the FDA regulating products like medical devices and food contact substances that may contain phthalates. No phthalate-containing consumer product has been banned outright to date. Products that may contain phthalates include medical devices, food contact substances like plastic wrap, and cosmetics. FDA is conducting an inventory of regulated products containing phthalates while reviewing the safety of bisphenol A (BPA). Medical devices made of PVC, such as intravenous fluid bags and tubing, can leach phthalates into fluids and the body. FDA completed a safety assessment of DEHP, a common softener in PVC medical devices, in 2001. The FDA conducted a safety assessment of DEHP, a common softener in PVC medical devices, in 2001. In 2002, FDA identified high-risk individuals for exposure to DEHP during medical procedures and recommended alternatives to DEHP-containing devices. Phthalates are regulated by FDA as food contact substances that may leach into foods or beverages from packaging. FDA permits the use of various phthalates for these purposes. The FDA has established a Phthalate Task Group to review the risks associated with phthalate exposure from food packaging. If deemed unsafe, FDA will take regulatory action to remove these materials from the market. FDA also regulates phthalates in cosmetics and personal care products. The FDA regulates phthalates in cosmetics and personal care products, including nail polish, shampoo, and lotions. Cosmetic products are not subject to FDA premarket approval, but can be prohibited if they contain harmful substances. The FDA is currently assessing phthalate levels in certain cosmetic products to better understand infant exposure. Retail cosmetic products are required to carry ingredient labels, which would include phthalates. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) may regulate phthalates in consumer products, including toys and children's products, under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act or the Consumer Product Safety Act. CPSC has jurisdiction over toys, children's furniture, and other children's consumer products. The FDA regulates phthalates in cosmetics and personal care products, which are required to carry ingredient labels. The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) strengthened regulatory authority over children's products, including toys, cribs, and car seats. The CPSC can regulate phthalates under the CPSA or FHSA, each with different rulemaking procedures and enforcement authority. The CPSIA amended the CPSA to provide state attorneys general with injunctive enforcement authority. The CPSIA amended the CPSA to give state attorneys general the power to stop violations of federal standards. Critics raised concerns about the CPSC's ability to set safety standards quickly, citing onerous rulemaking procedures. The CPSIA streamlined rulemaking by removing the need for advance notice. The CPSC is encouraged to rely on voluntary standards where industry compliance is widespread. The CPSIA mandated safety standards for certain children's products, including toys and infant/toddler products, and prohibited the manufacture, sale, or importation of products subject to a voluntary recall. The CPSC can order recalls and inspect factories for safety violations, with products failing standards possibly facing importation denial. Prior to the CPSIA, the CPSC had not established safety standards for phthalates in children's products. The CPSC had not set safety standards for phthalates in children's products before the CPSIA. In 1983, the CPSC found that DEHP in children's products could expose children to a carcinogen. A panel concluded that DEHP could pose a cancer risk to children, leading to a voluntary ban on DEHP in pacifiers, rattles, and teethers. Manufacturers then used DINP as a substitute for DEHP in other children's products. The CPSC banned DINP and dioctyl phthalate from pacifiers and bottle nipples due to health concerns, despite previous studies linking DINP to liver toxicity and cancer in rodents. The CPSC conducted further studies and appointed a panel to assess the risk of phthalates in children's products, ultimately concluding that DINP posed minimal or nonexistent cancer risk to humans. In 2003, the CPSC denied a petition to establish a safety standard for PVC containing phthalates in children's products intended for children five years of age and younger. The EU prohibits the use of certain phthalates in toys and child-care articles at concentrations greater than 0.1% by mass of the plasticized material. It also bans the sale of products containing phthalates above the permitted level. \"Childcare article\" is defined as products intended for children's sleep, relaxation, hygiene, feeding, or sucking. The EU prohibits certain phthalates in toys and childcare articles at concentrations above 0.1% by mass of the plasticized material. The Decision limits the ban on six phthalates to products that can be mouthed by children under three years old. The Decision may not have been renewed in anticipation of new regulations. The Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006 will repeal Council Directive 76/769/EEC on June 1, 2009, maintaining the same phthalate standard for children's products. The European Commission must review and update the standard by January 16, 2010, based on new scientific information. Member States must comply with the new Regulation directly, without the need for national implementing legislation. Certain phthalates like DEHP, DBP, and BBP are banned without limitation due to their reproductive toxicity. Phthalates like DEHP, DBP, and BBP are banned without limitation in the European Union due to reproductive toxicity. DINP, DIDP, and DnOP are banned only for children's products that can be placed in the mouth. California, Vermont, and Washington have also enacted safety standards for phthalate content in children's articles. The federal phthalates safety standards of the CPSIA preempt any non-identical state standards, except for exemptions provided by the CPSA. The CPSIA clarifies that state laws on phthalate alternatives not covered by federal standards may not be preempted. States can request exemptions for higher protection standards that do not hinder interstate commerce. State phthalate standards are similar to EU regulations but vary in defining children's products. Several states have adopted resolutions and legislation regarding the regulation of phthalates in children's products. California will prohibit the sale of toys containing certain chemicals starting in 2009. Oregon has urged Congress to regulate phthalates at the federal level. Hawaii has requested monitoring of research on phthalates and bisphenol-A. The statute in California prohibits the sale of toys and child-care articles containing certain chemicals, including phthalates in concentrations exceeding 0.1%. Manufacturers must use less toxic alternatives and are prohibited from replacing phthalates with certain carcinogens or reproductive toxicants. The definition of \"toys\" and \"child care articles\" is specified in the statute. This regulation aligns with the EU Council Directive 76/769/EEC. The Vermont statute, modeled on the EU Council Directive 76/769/EEC, bans toys and child-care articles containing DEHP, DBP, or BBP for children under three years old. It includes a three-year-old age limit for mouth-contact products and adds \"teething\" to the scope of child-care articles. The Vermont statute prohibits toys and child-care articles for children under three years old containing certain phthalates. It aligns with California law but includes additional definitions and requirements for manufacturers to use safer alternatives. The Vermont law prohibits certain phthalates in toys and child-care articles for children under three years old. Violations of this law are considered violations of the Vermont Consumer Fraud Act. Firearms, ammunition, shooting ranges, and hunting/fishing equipment are exempt from this regulation. The Washington Department of Ecology identifies chemicals of high concern in children's products, requires notification from manufacturers, and enforces a ban on phthalates in children's products exceeding 0.1% by weight. The law also includes a product safety education campaign. The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 expanded the definition of \"children's product\" to include various items such as children's clothing, toys, cosmetics, jewelry, and car seats. The Act also banned certain phthalates in children's products and was signed into law on August 14, 2008. The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 expanded the definition of \"children's product\" to include various items such as children's clothing, toys, cosmetics, jewelry, and car seats. It prohibits children's toys or child care articles containing certain phthalates above 0.1 percent and temporarily bans three other phthalates pending review by a panel. The sale of children's toys or child care articles with concentrations of other phthalates above 0.1 percent is prohibited until a review is completed. The Act does not restrict phthalate alternatives and defines \"children's toy\" and \"child care article\" for regulatory purposes. The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 expanded the definition of \"children's product\" to include various items such as children's clothing, toys, cosmetics, jewelry, and car seats. It prohibits children's toys or child care articles containing certain phthalates above 0.1 percent and temporarily bans three other phthalates pending review by a panel. The Act does not restrict phthalate alternatives and defines \"children's toy\" and \"child care article\" for regulatory purposes. The statute includes guidelines for determining whether a product was intended or designed for use by children of certain ages and whether a toy can be placed in a child's mouth. The federal law preempts non-identical state laws unless an exemption is granted for stronger protections under state laws. The final phthalates provision in the new federal safety standard preempts recent state laws that do not offer identical protection. It resolved differences between the Senate and House treatment of a phthalates ban and evolved from a Senate-approved amendment to H.R. 4040. The House version of H.R. 4040 did not initially address phthalates, but the issue was later taken up by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. The Senate version of H.R. 4040, known as the Feinstein-Boxer Amendment, was based on the California statute but made some changes. It defined \"children's product\" as any item intended for a child's use during play, including those with DEHP, DBP, or BBP above 0.1%. The Feinstein-Boxer Amendment, based on the California statute, prohibits children's products with certain phthalates above 0.1%. It also restricts manufacturers from replacing phthalates with carcinogens or reproductive toxicants identified by the EPA, but does not mandate the use of the least toxic alternative. The provision in question would not have mandated manufacturers to use the least toxic alternative as a substitute for phthalates. It also addressed issues regarding preemption of non-identical State or local regulations of banned hazardous substances, specifically concerning phthalates not covered in the bill. The scientific basis for concerns about risks to human health from phthalates is strong for some chemicals, adequate for others, and weak for the rest. Recent evidence shows that DEHP, DBP, and DBB can harm reproduction and fetal development. The structure-activity relationship between phthalates and developmental damage is well understood, with scientific concern focusing on DEHP, DBP, and DBB. DINP is a developmental toxicant but less potent. Limited evidence suggests DIDP, DINP, and DnOP may affect the immune system, but they are less toxic to rodents. People, especially children, are exposed to DEHP, DBP, and DBB. Data on other phthalates are lacking. Children are most heavily exposed to phthalates, with newborn babies in hospitals facing continuous exposure. Studies suggest additive effects of multiple phthalate exposures. The National Academy of Sciences is evaluating the risk of aggregate human exposure to phthalates. New laws restrict the use of six phthalates in child-care items and toys to reduce exposure. The use of six phthalates in child-care items and toys is restricted to reduce exposure. Other chemicals may be used as substitutes, with potential risks that are not fully known. Testing for these chemicals is not legally required, making it uncertain whether new formulations pose more or less risk than current ones."
