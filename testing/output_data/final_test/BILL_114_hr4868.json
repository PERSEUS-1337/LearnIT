Exceptions include businesses involving private or commercial golf courses, country clubs, massage parlors, hot tub facilities, suntan facilities, racetracks, gambling facilities, stores selling alcoholic beverages for off-premises consumption, or businesses requiring records under section 2257 of title 18, United States Code, for performers. The gross revenue test for the Rural Microbusiness Investment Credit requires the average annual gross revenue of a trade or business to not exceed $1,000,000 over a 3-taxable year period. Aggregation rules apply to treat related persons as a single entity for this purpose. Special rules exist for entities not in existence for the entire 3-year period. For the Rural Microbusiness Investment Credit, rules similar to section 448(c)(3) apply. Self-employed individuals are treated as employees if classified as such under section 401(c). The term 'full-time equivalent employee' is defined as a number determined by dividing the total number of employees. The total number of hours of service for which wages were paid by the employer to employees during the taxable year is divided by 2,080. Any excess hours worked by an employee beyond 2,080 hours are not counted. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, determines the hours of service. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, will prescribe regulations to determine employee hours of service, including rules for non-hourly employees. A distressed rural area is defined as an area in the US that has lost population or has low median family income. A qualified area for the purposes of the regulations is defined as an area with a median family income below 85% of the national median, a poverty rate exceeding 12.5%, or average unemployment over 120% of the national average. This excludes cities with over 50,000 inhabitants or urbanized areas adjacent to cities. In determining distressed rural areas, the criteria include areas with no city over 100,000 inhabitants and no adjacent urbanized areas. Information from the Census Bureau and Labor Statistics is used for this determination. The text discusses how related persons are defined for tax purposes, the denial of double benefits, and the requirement for married couples to file a joint return for certain tax credits. The text discusses rules for married couples filing joint returns for tax credits and the denial of credits to dependents if a deduction is allowed to another taxpayer. Additionally, it mentions the rural microbusiness investment credit as part of the general business credit. The text introduces a 5-year carryback provision for the rural microbusiness investment credit under section 39 of the tax code. This provision allows for separate application of the credit and extends the carryback period to 5 taxable years. The text introduces amendments to extend the carryback period for the rural microbusiness investment credit to 5 taxable years by adjusting the taxable years in subparagraphs. The amendments made by this section extend the carryback period for the rural microbusiness investment credit to 5 taxable years, effective for expenditures made after the enactment of this Act."
