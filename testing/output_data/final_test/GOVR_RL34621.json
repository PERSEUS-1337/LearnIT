    "content": "Coal currently meets 25% of the world's primary energy demand and is projected to increase over the next 25 years. It accounts for 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions, with coal combustion responsible for 41% of CO2 emissions in 2005. Coal is crucial for electricity supply, generating 46% of the world's power in 2005. Coal-fired power generation is expected to rise by 2.3% annually until 2030, leading to a significant increase in CO2 emissions. For instance, China added over 90 GW of new coal-fired generating capacity in 2006. China added over 90 GW of new coal-fired generating capacity, potentially adding 500 million metric tons of CO2 annually. Developing technology to capture and store these emissions is crucial for reducing worldwide emissions. Currently, no commercial system is available for large-scale coal-fired power plants to achieve carbon capture and sequestration. The capture component of a CCS system can be the most challenging and costly part, depending on site-specific conditions. The capture component of a CCS system is the most costly and challenging part, with potential for significant cost reduction through technological advancements. Breakthrough technologies that lower CO2 capture costs by 50% or more would greatly impact the economics of CCS. On the other hand, the costs of transporting and sequestering CO2 underground are less dependent on technological breakthroughs and more on factors like construction materials and labor. The current focus is on developing technology for capturing CO2, with challenges in cost reduction. The costs of transporting and storing CO2 underground are influenced by factors like construction materials and labor, rather than technological advancements. Public acceptance and regulatory frameworks also play a role in determining the costs and timing of large-scale CCS projects. The report discusses the current status of carbon capture technology and the role of government in its development. Major reductions in coal-fired CO2 emissions would require various capture devices. Retrofittable post-combustion capture devices could have a substantial market, especially in the US and China. The report also provides a summary of technology under development for near-term availability. Post-combustion CO2 capture involves treating burner exhaust gases before they enter the stack, allowing retrofit at existing facilities. Processes capture CO2 through distillation, membranes, or absorption. The most widely used carbon capture technology involves chemical absorption using amines like monoethanolamine (MEA). Pilot-plant research on using ammonia as a solvent is also underway. MEA interacts with CO2 in an absorber, then the CO2 is separated from the MEA in a stripper using steam. The MEA chemical absorption process separates CO2 using steam, compresses the CO2, and recirculates the MEA. However, applying this technology to coal-fired power plants is costly due to steam diversion, energy needed for CO2 compression, and reduced plant efficiency. The installation of MEA in coal-fired power plants incurs efficiency losses of 25%-42%, increases electricity generating costs by 60%-250%, and faces challenges with amine degradation due to overheating and oxidation. Fluor has developed an MEA-based solvent called Economine FG Plus to improve CO2 recovery from low pressure, oxygen-containing streams in coal-fired power plants. This technology aims to address the shortcomings of traditional MEA by enhancing reaction rates and CO2 carrying capacity. Fluor's technology focuses on cleaning up impurities in flue gas to inhibit the formation of salts, requiring installation of controls for SO2, NOx, Hg, and particulates. Solvent temperature issues are addressed with an intercooler system, and energy consumption is reduced. Fluor's CO2 recovery unit at the Bellingham, MA power plant captured 360 tons of CO2 daily for use in the food and beverage industry. NRG Energy and Fluor planned to install Economine FG Plus at NRG's WA Parish plant in Texas for CO2 capture for enhanced oil recovery. DOE will provide up to $154 million for the project. Other chemical blends have been developed to increase efficiency in capture processes. The Purenergy CCS Capture System is modular and designed for easy transport. A commercial demonstration is planned for 2012 at Basin Electric's Antelope Valley Station in North Dakota. The system uses an ammonia-based solvent to absorb CO2 at a slower rate than MEA, with the captured CO2 being transported to Canada for EOR. The chilled ammonia process, owned by Alstom, uses a slurry of ammonium carbonate and ammonium bicarbonate to absorb over 90% of CO2 in flue gas. This process operates at a lower temperature, causing pollutants like SO2 to drop out and reducing the need for extensive control device upgrades. The CO2-rich ammonia is regenerated and the CO2 is stripped under pressure, reducing energy needed for compression during transportation. Alstom collaborated with AEP and RWE AG to operate this technology at AEP's Mountaineer plant in West Virginia. AEP began operating its CO2 capture technology at Mountaineer plant in West Virginia in 2009, with plans to scale up the project with DOE funding. The captured CO2 will be used for EOR, with commercialization targeted for 2015. A second ammonia-based process for CO2 capture from coal-fired facilities is also being developed. Powerspan is developing a process called ECO2 to increase CO2 absorption rates in absorbers, leading to higher CO2 removal. Test results from a 1 MW pilot unit show carbon capture costs below $50 a ton at 90% reduction. Integrated Gasification Combined-Cycle (IGCC) technology is currently required for pre-combustion CO2 capture, with four commercial IGCC plants worldwide. The technology has not made a major breakthrough in the U.S. market due to regulatory requirements. Carbon capture technology in an IGCC facility involves using physical or chemical solvents to separate CO2 from syngas before combustion. The process is under pressure to increase CO2 content for efficient separation. The use of physical solvents allows for the easy removal of CO2. The advantage of using physical solvents in carbon capture technology in an IGCC facility is that CO2 can be separated out easily. The captured CO2 is then compressed for transportation or storage, while hydrogen is used to produce electricity through gas and steam cycles. MIT estimates a 19% efficiency loss in incorporating capture technology, with an estimated increase in electricity generating cost ranging from 22%-25% for new construction. Commercialization of IGCC technology is actively being pursued. The commercialization of IGCC technology is actively pursued, with a focus on carbon capture methods. Projects in the development pipeline, such as the FutureGen initiative, aim to increase the concentration of CO2 in flue gas by combusting coal with pure oxygen. This approach results in highly concentrated CO2 and water vapor in the flue gas. The \"oxy-fuel\" process involves combusting coal with pure oxygen to produce concentrated CO2 and water vapor. The exhaust gas is cleaned of pollutants and some gases are recycled to control temperature. The gas stream is purified and compressed for transport or storage. Oxy-fuel technology can be retrofitted onto existing boilers and is being demonstrated in projects like the Vattenfall Project in Germany and the Callide Oxyfuel Project in Australia. The Vattenfall oxyfuel project in Queensland, Australia involves constructing a 30 MW pilot plant at Schwarze Pumpe, with plans to store captured CO2 geologically. The Callide Project, sponsored by CS Energy, is retrofitting a 30 MW boiler at Callide-A power station with oxy-fuel technology, aiming for operation in 2011 and CO2 storage in the same year. MIT estimates efficiency losses of 23% for new construction and 31%-40% for retrofitting existing plants with oxy-fuel technology. The cost of implementing CO2 capture technology in coal-fired power plants is significant, with a 46% increase in electricity generating cost for new construction and a 170%-206% increase for retrofit plants. Research is ongoing to improve the economics and operation of carbon capture technology, with the DOE's National Energy Technology Laboratory supporting various R&D projects. Funding from DOE supports carbon capture research projects ranging from bench-scale to pilot-scale testing, exploring various technologies like membranes, solvents, oxy-combustion, and sorbents. These technologies aim to be ready for large-scale field testing by 2018. Private sector projects like the AEP Mountaineer project in West Virginia are also advancing towards pilot-scale testing. Emerging, cost-effective technologies are incorporating price mechanisms like a carbon tax for viability. Incorporating a carbon tax provides a long-term price signal for research and development efforts, combining with public support for technology development. Government roles in encouraging environmental technology development are outlined. The federal role in encouraging development of environmental technologies is complex and involves a combination of government and private research efforts, demand pull mechanisms, and practical application feedback. It is important to consider the interlinked and dynamic nature of the innovation process to avoid mis-directed funding or mis-timing of results. This section discusses different roles in promoting carbon capture technology, including the need for demand-pull mechanisms and current technology-push efforts in the U.S. The driving force behind developing new technologies is the profit motive, but market forces may not incentivize climate-friendly technologies without reflecting social costs. Without a greenhouse gas policy, firms lack motivation to reduce emissions beyond energy cost savings. Without a policy that makes carbon dioxide emissions costly, firms lack motivation to innovate cheaper ways to reduce emissions. The focus on developing carbon capture technology has been on research and demonstration needs, but commercialization depends on market demand created by price mechanisms or regulatory requirements. Commercializing carbon capture technology for coal-fired power plants will increase generation costs without efficiency gains, making widespread adoption unlikely without regulation. Commercialization of carbon capture technology for coal-fired power plants is unlikely without regulation or a carbon price requirement. Regulated industries may face reluctance from regulators to invest in technology not mandated by law, as seen in a recent decision by the Virginia State Corporation Commission denying a rate adjustment for an IGCC facility by Appalachian Power Company. The company's argument for the project's value based on potential future legal requirements for carbon capture and sequestration was deemed insufficient due to unknown factors and other issues in the application. The feasibility of cost-effective carbon capture and sequestration in an IGCC Plant has not been sufficiently established, leading to reluctance in investing in technology not required by law. The unresolved nature of greenhouse gas regulation is impacting investment in coal-fired generation, as highlighted in \"The Carbon Principles\" by three Wall Street banks. The absence of comprehensive federal action on climate change poses financial risks for those building new fossil fuel generation resources. The absence of federal CO2 control legislation poses risks to investment in carbon capture technology. Unlike mission-oriented research, commercial development efforts need to consider market demand and value. Currently, the market value of carbon capture devices is zero due to the lack of regulations on carbon emissions. Investment in carbon capture technology is risky without a regulatory regime in place. The current spread of greenhouse gas control regimes doesn't provide clear guidance on performance standards and cost-effectiveness benchmarks. The future value of carbon reductions is uncertain under cap-and-trade programs. The future value of carbon reductions under a cap-and-trade program is uncertain, with different reduction targets leading to varying price tracks for CO2. Without a clear tonnage goal and reduction schedule, any deployment or commercialization strategy would be high-risk. Two approaches to a demand-pull mechanism are regulatory requirements and market-based CO2 reduction programs, which can serve different goals. The EPA's new source performance standards could phase in carbon capture technology for new construction, while a carbon tax or cap-and-trade program could signal the need for further controls on existing coal-fired facilities. The standards were technology-forcing, leading utilities to adopt complex chemical processes for emissions control. The utility industry requires 30- to 40-foot diameters for dealing with saturated flue gases containing contaminants. Mandating carbon capture technology through performance standards for coal-fired power plants is not a new idea, as the Clean Air Act requires the EPA to develop New Source Performance Standards for new and modified power plants. The Clean Air Act mandates New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) to control pollutants without National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), like carbon dioxide. NSPS sets the minimum emission control level for stationary sources, influencing Best Available Control Technology (BACT) and Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) determinations. NSPS aim to achieve the best emission reduction system demonstrated by the Administrator, considering costs and non-air quality impacts. In 1971, EPA established a 1.2 pound of SO2 per million Btu performance standard for new power plants, requiring a 70% reduction in emissions. This standard could be met with low-sulfur coal or emerging FGD devices. The number of FGD units increased due to NSPS, SO2 NAAQS, Supreme Court decisions, and state requirements for stringent SO2 controls. The growth of FGD installations in the 1970s was driven by state requirements for stringent SO2 controls and the market for retrofits of existing coal-fired facilities. Despite this growth, only 10% of new coal-fired facilities built between 1973 and 1976 had FGD installations, with early performance issues. AEP's campaign to reject FGD devices in favor of other controls was unsuccessful. The Congress modified NSPS requirements for coal-fired electric generators in 1977 by adding a \"percentage reduction\" requirement, leading to a 70%-90% reduction in emissions with the use of an FGD device. The scrubber requirement stimulated invention and focused inventive activity along certain technology pathways. The government policy stimulated inventive activity in developing FGD technology, leading to the creation of a market. The process was not smooth, with the US EPA continuously pushing for technology development through regulations. The development of FGD equipment faced unforeseen challenges despite the initial perception of simplicity in application. The example highlights the challenges of transitioning technology between industries. Technology-forcing regulations can drive market adoption, but long-term carbon capture development may require new infrastructure. Short-term solutions like enhanced oil recovery and in-situ storage can support early projects. Focusing on new construction for carbon capture technology deployment could lead to widespread commercialization. Regulatory measures can serve as an entry point for carbon capture deployment. Focusing on new construction for carbon capture technology deployment could lead to widespread commercialization. A regulatory approach like NSPS may be a first step, as seen with the SO 2 NSPS example. The literature emphasizes the importance of creating a price for carbon emissions to drive new technology development, even more so than research and development. The Congressional Budget Office suggests that near-term carbon pricing is a crucial element for a cost-effective policy approach. A carbon tax or cap-and-trade program can be used for market-based greenhouse gas control. The carbon tax provides a stable price signal to encourage innovation and technology development. It can be escalated over time to further incentivize emission reductions without causing market volatility. A cap-and-trade program creates a price signal for new technology through carbon permits. Allowances are issued by the government and can be used to comply with the cap, sold on the market, or banked for future use. The resulting market transactions determine the allowance price, which can be uncertain and volatile. A low allowance price may not encourage technology development. The 1990 CAAA effectively ended the development of FGD for retrofit purposes by setting an emission cap that resulted in low allowance prices and could be met through the use of low-sulfur coal. Research in dry FGD technology declined significantly as a result, with the flexibility provided by the 1990 acid rain regulations discouraging inventive activity in technologies that might have had broader markets under traditional command-and-control regimes. A cap-and-trade program can be more effective by auctioning a substantial portion of available allowances to promote carbon capture technology and create a strong price signal. This approach could incentivize the deployment of new technology and facilitate investment through a reserve price in the auction process. Auctioning allowances frequently would ensure availability close to expected demand and prevent potential short-squeezing. The acid rain cap-and-trade experience showed that \"bonus\" allowances and deadline extensions effectively incentivized the installation of FGD technology in power plants. This experience could be beneficial for proposed CCS \"bonus allowance\" provisions in greenhouse gas reduction schemes. The Department of Energy (DOE) is involved in these efforts. The Department of Energy (DOE) is actively involved in promoting carbon capture technologies through various activities, including research and development funding, loan guarantees, and tax credits. Funding for CCS-related programs has significantly increased since 1997, with nearly $575 million allocated in FY2009. However, funding for CCS R&D appeared to decrease in FY2010 compared to the previous year. Funding for CCS R&D decreased in FY2010 compared to FY2009, with a slight decrease in the FY2011 request. However, funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) significantly increased overall spending for CCS. DOE plans to propose a new budget structure for FY2012 to focus more on CCS technologies. Research, development, and deployment of CCS are crucial for global climate goals, with potential mass commercial deployment by 2020. Funding for carbon capture and sequestration technology has increased substantially due to the enactment of ARRA (P.L. 111-5). $3.4 billion was allocated through FY2010 for fossil energy research and development, with $1.52 billion for industrial carbon capture projects. Some funds would also be used for developing innovative concepts for reusing CO2. The ARRA (P.L. 111-5) allocated $1 billion for fossil energy research and development programs, with $1 billion going towards a renewed FutureGen facility in Mattoon, IL. $800 million was allocated to the DOE Clean Coal Power Initiative Round III solicitations for coal-based systems that capture and sequester CO2 emissions. Additionally, $50 million was allocated for site characterization activities, $20 million for geologic sequestration training and research, and $10 million for unspecified program activities. The ARRA allocated $1 billion for CCS activities, including the restart of FutureGen. This represents a significant increase in funding compared to previous levels. The focus of DOE's CCS program will shift to the capture component, raising questions about the effectiveness of a rapid increase in funding for long-term CO2 emissions reduction strategies. Funding mechanisms for carbon capture technology R&D and deployment include appropriations, loan guarantees, and tax credits. The Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009 authorized loan guarantees for CCS projects under Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, providing $6 billion for coal-based power generation and industrial gasification activities incorporating CCS. Additional $2 billion in loan guarantees were allocated for advanced coal gasification. The Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009 authorized $2 billion in loan guarantees for advanced coal gasification projects, in addition to the $6 billion allocated for CCS projects under Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The tax credits available under EPAct2005 for IGCC and ACBGT projects totaled $1.3 billion, with an additional $350 million for coal gasification projects under the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008. The Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 increased tax credits for ACBGT projects to $3.15 billion. It also added $1.25 billion for ACBGT projects, $350 million for coal gasification projects, and introduced a new tax credit for CO2 sequestration and storage. The tax credit is $20 per metric ton for storage and $10 per metric ton for enhanced oil or gas recovery, with a requirement of capturing at least 500,000 metric tons of CO2 per year. The facility must capture at least 500,000 metric tons of CO2 per year for a tax credit. Government funding mechanisms push carbon capture technologies through direct spending and private sector incentives. The lack of a price signal or regulatory mandate makes it challenging to assess the effectiveness of this approach for long-term technology development. The government funding mechanisms prioritize the successful demonstration of large-scale CCS technologies, with the only federally sponsored project, FutureGen, facing challenges due to rising costs and lack of perceived market. A carbon market could help assess costs against benefits, which accrue to the amelioration of future environmental degradation. The benefits of carbon capture and storage (CCS) contribute to reducing future environmental costs from greenhouse gas-induced global warming. Assigning a monetary value to these benefits for comparison with costs is challenging. Long-term pricing signals are essential for technological development and determining federal investment levels for commercializing environmental technologies like CCS. Private markets are better suited for selecting specific R&D projects, while government oversight ensures their success. The government invests in carbon capture technology R&D, with questions about the appropriate funding levels. Congress supports CCS through tax credits and loan guarantees, authorizing significant spending at DOE. EISA authorizes $2.2 billion for CCS from FY2008 to FY2013, emphasizing underground injection and storage experiments. The legislation authorizes $200 million per year for large-scale CO2 capture projects from industrial sources. ARRA provides significant funding for CCS RD&D, with the Carbon Capture and Storage Early Deployment Act proposing a $1 billion annual assessment on fossil-fuel based electricity for technology development. Legislation in the 110th Congress aimed to promote CO2 capture technology development through tax credits, debt financing, and regulations. Bills like S. 3132 and S. 3233 proposed incentives such as a tax credit of $20 per metric ton of CO2 captured and establishing a corporation for financing technology development. The priority was to deploy commercial-scale CO2 capture and storage technology by 2015. The American Energy Production Act of 2008 aimed to increase U.S. oil and gas production while reducing CO2 emissions. Bills like H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 in the 111th Congress focused on energy and climate change, with provisions for capturing CO2 emissions from coal-derived fuels. Both bills in the 111th Congress aim to promote the development of CCS projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They include provisions for grants and emission allowances for electric utilities and industrial facilities. Another bill, H.R. 513, proposes a Manhattan Project-style program for energy independence through RD&D grants and prizes. Some policymakers propose a system of grants and prizes for RD&D to achieve energy independence, drawing inspiration from the Manhattan project and Apollo program. The relevance of these large-scale government projects to developing carbon capture technology is explored. The Manhattan project and Apollo program, with their short-term goals and government-led initiatives, provide a funding history for comparison against CO2 capture technology cost projections. The federal government's efforts in response to the energy crisis of the 1970s and 1980s may offer a richer analogy for CO2 capture technology development. The national priority was to reduce dependence on foreign energy supplies, focusing on new domestic sources like oil shale, energy efficiency, and alternative energy like solar. The development of CCS technology is seen as crucial to combat human-induced climate change. Lessons from the federal government's energy technology promotion in the 1970s and 1980s could inform current approaches to CCS technology development. The Manhattan project occurred from 1942 to 1946. The Manhattan project took place from 1942 to 1946, costing $2.2 billion. The Apollo program encompassed 17 missions, including six lunar landings, from FY1960 to FY1973. The peak cost for the Apollo program was in FY1966 at $4.5 billion. The Apollo program, with a total cost of $19.4 billion, took place from FY1960 to FY1973, with the first lunar landing in July 1969 and the last in December 1972. The Department of Energy originated from the Manhattan project and became a Cabinet-level department in 1977. Funding for DOE energy R&D increased in the 1970s due to high oil prices and Carter Administration priorities on conservation and alternative energy development. The Reagan Administration reduced energy R&D programs in the 1980s as crude oil prices fell. DOE's current spending on CCS technology is much lower than peak funding for energy technology R&D in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Total federal expenditures on climate change, including basic research, are still less than the Manhattan project and Apollo program, but similar to DOE's energy technology development programs during peak spending. The FY2008 budget and FY2009 budget request for DOE's energy technology R&D is approximately $3 billion per year, much lower than peak funding for energy technology R&D in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Even if spending on CO2 capture technology were increased dramatically to Manhattan project or Apollo program levels, it is uncertain if the goal of developing a commercially deployable technology would be achieved. The primary goal for CO2 capture is to develop a technology that would be widely deployed and effective at removing a substantial amount of CO2 over the next half century, requiring commercialization and widespread use throughout the utility sector. The government's attempt to develop a synthetic fuels industry in the late 1970s and early 1980s through the Synthetic Fuels Corporation (SFC) is a case study of unsuccessful federal involvement in technology development. The SFC was established by Congress in 1980 to develop large-scale projects in coal and shale liquefaction and gasification, but most projects focused on basic and conceptual work rather than demonstration programs. The goal of CO2 capture technology development is to achieve commercial deployment and widespread use in the utility sector. The Synthetic Fuels Corporation (SFC) was formed in response to the 1970s energy crisis to support projects that industry couldn't due to uncertainties. $20 billion in financial incentives were authorized, but the program ended in 1986 due to collapsing energy prices, environmental concerns, lack of support from the Reagan Administration, and administrative issues. The primary reason for the SFC's failure was the fluctuating crude oil prices, making it unable to adapt to market changes. The Synthetic Fuels Corporation (SFC) failed due to its inability to adapt to market changes and government constraints. The program lacked flexibility to adjust to fluctuating fuel prices and public resistance to environmental costs. Emphasis on production targets hindered research and program flexibility, while turnover among high-level officials slowed administrative actions. Despite these challenges, the program showed that large-scale synthetic energy projects could be successfully built and operated within technical parameters. The DOE's decision to restructure the FutureGen program was influenced by rising costs and the lack of a global price for CO2 emissions. Unlike the failed SFC, FutureGen's value in CO2 reduction cannot be easily compared to its construction costs. The market conditions that led to the SFC's failure may differ from those with a CO2 price in place. The stability and predictability of CO2 price signals depend on the mechanism used, such as carbon tax, allowance pricing, or auctions. A long-term price signal for carbon could benefit CO2 capture technology R&D programs. Addressing the world's reliance on coal for energy, especially in electricity generation, requires developing technology to capture and store CO2 emissions. Some suggest delaying greenhouse gas reduction programs until carbon capture technology is proven, but technological innovation and carbon control are interconnected. A technology policy is not a substitute for environmental policy and must be developed in conjunction with it. Legislators face challenges in crafting greenhouse gas reduction legislation, particularly in creating a market for emerging carbon capture technologies. Table 4 compares different price signals based on criteria like magnitude, direction, timing, stability, and duration. The duration of price or regulation imposed on affected companies is crucial. Regulation is seen as the most effective method for technology development, but it can also limit market opportunities. Allowance prices can provide a less clear signal, with volatility being a concern. Bonus allowances can improve incentives, but eligibility criteria may be perceived as government favoritism. The government's eligibility criteria may be seen as favoritism, while carbon taxes and allowance auctions provide strong market-based price signals. These signals depend on the environmental goals, reduction requirements, timing, and compliance techniques. The urgency for carbon capture technology is informed by these factors. The urgency for carbon capture technology is driven by the need for appropriate cost-performance parameters in the emerging carbon market. Various groups have proposed roadmaps to prepare for greenhouse gas reduction programs, emphasizing the importance of demonstration-size projects. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 and ARRA provide increased funding for CCS technology demonstration projects. Financial markets and regulatory authorities are hesitant to invest in coal-fired power plants without carbon capture capacity due to uncertainty surrounding climate change legislation. The MIT study argues against subsidizing new coal-fired power plant construction without carbon capture due to high retrofit costs. Retrofitting SCPC plants for CO2 capture is more expensive than retrofitting IGCC plants, but retrofitting IGCC plants for CCS is complex and costly. Plants without CCS assistance under the 2005 Energy Act will be more expensive to retrofit. The concept of a \"capture ready\" plant is unproven and unlikely to be successful. The Energy Act envisions \"capture ready\" to apply to gasification technology, but retrofitting IGCC or pulverized coal plants with CCS technology is costly and reduces efficiency. Financial assistance to conventional IGCC plants without CCS may not be wise due to the risks associated with developing carbon capture technology. Ultimately, the lack of a regulatory scheme or carbon price poses a risk to the future of coal."
