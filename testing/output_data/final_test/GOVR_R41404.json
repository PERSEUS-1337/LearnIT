    "content": "The unauthorized disclosure of classified information is not covered by a single statute but by a patchwork of laws depending on the nature of the information and the circumstances of the disclosure. The Espionage Act protects national defense information, while other statutes cover different types of relevant information. These laws apply to both government employees and the general public, and the specific statute applicable to a disclosure will depend on the details of the case. The Espionage Act was originally enacted during World War I and remains a key tool for the U.S. government in prosecuting unauthorized disclosures. The Espionage Act, codified in 18 U.S.C. Sections 793-798, criminalizes the gathering, handling, or transmitting of national defense information. The Act does not clearly define what constitutes national defense information, but the Supreme Court has explained it as relating to military and naval establishments. The Espionage Act, found in 18 U.S.C. Sections 793-798, criminalizes activities related to national defense information. Courts defer to executive determinations on what constitutes national defense information. The Act has faced challenges for being vague, but the Gorin Court found the mental state requirements provide clarity. Section 793(a) prohibits gathering, receiving, or transmitting national defense information to unauthorized individuals. Section 793 of the Espionage Act prohibits obtaining information related to national defense with intent to harm the United States or benefit a foreign nation. It also prohibits individuals from obtaining or duplicating material connected to national defense with similar intent. Subsection (c) creates criminal liability for receiving or obtaining such material when the individual knows it was obtained contrary to the Act. Section 793 of the Espionage Act prohibits the collection, copying, and dissemination of national defense information. Subsection (c) criminalizes receiving such information if the recipient knows it was obtained unlawfully. Subsections (d) and (f) prohibit the dissemination of national defense material, with subsection (f) also covering mishandling through gross negligence. Section 793(e) prohibits unauthorized possession of national defense information. Section 793 of the Espionage Act prohibits the collection, dissemination, and unauthorized possession of national defense information. Section 794 covers cases of transmitting such information to foreign governments, with penalties including fines and imprisonment. Section 794 of the Espionage Act prohibits attempts to elicit information related to public defense that could be useful to the enemy, with penalties including imprisonment, life sentence, or death in certain circumstances. It also covers conspiracies to violate this provision and allows for the death penalty in cases involving covert agents, nuclear weapons, or transmitting military information to the enemy during wartime. Offenders may also face forfeiture of gains and property used in the offense. Section 794 of the Espionage Act prohibits the transmission of national security information to aid the enemy or foreign government, with penalties including imprisonment, life sentence, or death in certain cases. Sections 795, 796, 797, and 798 further prohibit unauthorized creation, publication, sale, or transfer of defense-related photographs or sketches, use of aircraft for capturing images of defense installations, and disclosure of classified information, with violators facing fines or imprisonment. The disclosure of classified information for reasons of national security can result in penalties, including death for military members under Article 106a of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Unlike Section 794 offenses, Article 106a offenses do not require the death of a covert agent or involvement in military operations during war to incur the death penalty. The death penalty can be imposed under Article 106a of the Uniform Code of Military Justice for offenses involving espionage or treason, even if not directly related to the death of a covert agent or military operations during war. In addition to espionage, military members could also be charged with violations of other articles such as failure to obey orders, aiding the enemy, or offenses under Article 134. Article 134 of the UCMJ can be used to prosecute military members for violations of federal law not covered by the UCMJ, such as 18 U.S.C. Section 1030(a). This section punishes the willful retention, communication, or transmission of classified information obtained through unauthorized computer access. Other criminal laws in the U.S. Code could also be used to prosecute the disclosure of classified information. The unauthorized access to government computers can lead to criminal culpability for individuals involved as conspirators, aiders and abettors, or accessories after the fact. Violations can result in fines, imprisonment up to 10 years for first offenses, and up to 20 years for repeat offenses. Section 641 of the U.S. Code punishes theft or conversion of government property, including prosecution of \"leakers.\" Penalties include fines, imprisonment up to 10 years, or both, with exceptions for property valued under $100. The Intelligence Identities Protection Act, 50 U.S.C. Section 3121, protects the identity of covert intelligence agents. It applies to individuals authorized to know or who learn the identity of covert agents through access to classified information. It also covers those who disclose the identity of covert agents with the intent to impair U.S. foreign intelligence. The Intelligence Identities Protection Act prohibits the unauthorized disclosure of covert agents' identities to protect U.S. foreign intelligence efforts. Violators face fines or imprisonment for up to three years if found guilty. Another provision, 18 U.S.C. Section 1924, prohibits government employees from removing classified material, with penalties of up to $1,000 fine and one year in prison for offenders. Employees of the United States can face fines, prison sentences up to 10 years, or both under 18 U.S.C. Section 952 for willfully publishing or furnishing official diplomatic codes without authorization. The same punishment applies for materials obtained during transmission between foreign governments and their diplomatic missions in the U.S. However, the removal of classified material concerning foreign relations to store at an unauthorized location is a misdemeanor under 18 U.S.C. Section 1924, applicable only to U.S. government employees. Employees of the United States can face fines, prison sentences up to 10 years, or both under 18 U.S.C. Section 952 for willfully publishing or furnishing official diplomatic codes without authorization. Violation of 50 U.S.C. Section 783 involves communicating classified information to suspected foreign agents, punishable by a fine of up to $10,000 or imprisonment for not more than 10 years. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 42 U.S.C. Section 2274, prohibits disclosure of nuclear energy and weapons information, with criminal penalties for violators. The Espionage Act includes criminal penalties for disclosing Restricted Data with intent to harm the US or benefit a foreign nation. Treason under 18 U.S.C. Section 2381 is punishable by death, imprisonment, or fine for aiding enemies. The Act's various sections have different mental state requirements (mens rea) for prosecution. The term mens rea refers to the defendant's mental state of culpability that the government must prove in order to secure a conviction. Different laws have varying requirements for mens rea, such as intentional, willful, knowing, or negligent acts. The Espionage Act requires the defendant to have acted with intent or reason to believe that the national defense information is to be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation. In certain cases, dual mens rea elements are present in sections 793(d-e) and 798. The Espionage Act requires the defendant to have acted willfully in disclosing information with reason to believe it could harm the United States or benefit a foreign nation. The mens rea elements in sections 793(d-e) do not apply to the disclosure of national-security-related documents, only national security information. Section 793(f) of the Act is unique in its requirements. Section 793(f) of the Espionage Act punishes the loss or removal of national defense information due to \"gross negligence,\" defined as the failure to exercise even a slight degree of care. Prosecutions under this provision appear rare, but at least two servicemembers were convicted for removing classified materials and failing to report or return them. Another law, 18 U.S.C. Section 1924, punishes the knowing removal of classified information by government employees or contractors with the intent to retain it in an unauthorized location. The disclosure of protected information requires the defendant to be aware of the criminal behavior. Punishments may vary based on the defendant's mental state, such as intent or reason to believe. Strict liability offenses, which require no mens rea, are also present in some modern statutes. No current statutes impose strict liability for unauthorized disclosure or mishandling of classified information. The public release of such information may serve the public interest, but it also poses a threat to national security. Policymakers must balance the public's right to access government information with the need to provide for the common defense. The First Amendment protects freedom of speech and press, but restrictions can be justified for compelling government interests like national security. Certain types of speech, especially during times of war, can be suppressed if they pose a threat of violence or give military advantage to enemies. The government can regulate speech that poses a threat to national security or gives military advantage to enemies. It must show a compelling interest to justify enforcement. Punishing disclosures of classified information depends on the potential to harm national defense or foreign relations. The Court emphasizes the protection of press freedom for the discussion of governmental affairs. Government classification of information, even if seemingly innocuous, can be crucial in espionage cases as courts require the information to be \"closely held.\" Judges typically defer to executive decisions on national security, presuming potential harm in disclosed material. The government must show that releasing specific national defense information could harm U.S. interests to prevent the Espionage Act from punishing whistleblowers. The Supreme Court accepts that national security justifies some intrusion into protected activities, especially for federal employees. Courts do not automatically accept government classification as proof of harm, but they often agree that the material in question is damaging. Defendants claiming information poses no danger to national security must provide convincing evidence. The Espionage Act is not limited to classic spying cases involving foreign governments. Some defendants prosecuted for leaking information to the press or advocacy groups. Government classification not always accepted as proof of harm. In notable criminal prosecutions for leaks, no individual acquitted based on public interest justifying disclosure. In 1971, analysts Ellsberg and Russo indicted for leaking Pentagon Papers to influence public opinion on Vietnam War. In 1971, analysts Ellsberg and Russo were indicted for leaking the Pentagon Papers to influence public opinion on the Vietnam War. The government also brought criminal charges against them for violations of the Espionage Act, but revelations of government misconduct led to a mistrial and dropped charges. Samuel Loring Morison later became the first person convicted for selling classified documents to the media, setting an important precedent under the Espionage Act. Morison was convicted under the Espionage Act for providing classified satellite photographs to a news organization. Despite arguing lack of intent to commit espionage, the court found his intent to sell classified information sufficient to satisfy the legal requirements. His claim of a noble motive to raise awareness about the Soviet threat did not negate the charges. The prosecution of Morison for leaking classified information to the media raised concerns about selective prosecution and the chilling effect on whistleblowers. President Clinton pardoned Morison upon leaving office. In 2005, Lawrence Franklin was indicted for disclosing classified information to an Israeli diplomat. Lawrence Franklin disclosed classified information to an Israeli diplomat and AIPAC employees, citing concerns about American security threats from Iran. He pleaded guilty to charges under the Espionage Act. In 2009, Shamai Leibowitz, a Hebrew translator for the FBI, was prosecuted for unauthorized disclosure to the media during the Obama Administration. Shamai Leibowitz, a Hebrew translator for the FBI, disclosed classified information from FBI wiretaps of the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C. He intended to expose misconduct, not harm national security, but pled guilty and received a 20-month prison sentence. In a separate case, Thomas Drake, a senior NSA official, was indicted on 10 felony charges for leaking classified information about NSA programs to the media. The Baltimore Sun reported on Thomas Drake's indictment under the Espionage Act, which was later reduced to a single misdemeanor for unauthorized use of an NSA computer. The court criticized the government's handling of the case as \"unconscionable\" and sentenced Drake to one year probation and 240 hours of community service. Jeffrey Sterling, a former CIA officer, was indicted in a separate investigation that spanned the Bush and Obama administrations. Jeffrey Sterling was indicted in 2010 for disclosing classified information about a CIA operation to New York Times reporter James Risen. He was found guilty on nine felony counts, including violations of the Espionage Act, and sentenced to 42 months in prison. Another individual, Stephen Jin-Woo Kim, was indicted for disclosing classified information about North Korea's nuclear program to Fox News correspondent James Rosen. Kim pled guilty to disclosing national defense information to an unauthorized person, violating the Espionage Act, and was sentenced to 13 months in prison. Chelsea Manning, while serving as an Army intelligence analyst, downloaded classified material and leaked it through WikiLeaks. Chelsea Manning, an Army intelligence analyst, leaked classified material through WikiLeaks. Manning pled guilty to multiple charges, including violating the Espionage Act. In 2013, Manning was convicted of most charges and sentenced to 35 years in prison, but President Obama commuted the sentence in 2017. In Alexandria, VA, civilian involvement in the investigation remains under seal. Media outlets reported a sealed indictment against Julian Assange, but US officials denied it. Former CIA officer John Kirakou was indicted for disclosing classified information. Kirakou faced charges under the Espionage Act and for making false statements. John Kirakou pled guilty to disclosing the name of a covert CIA operative, citing earlier criticism of the CIA. He was sentenced to 30 months in prison. James Hitselberger, a former Navy contract linguist, was indicted for violating the Espionage Act by providing classified information to a think tank. Hitselberger entered a plea agreement, with Espionage Act charges dropped, pleading guilty to a misdemeanor count. Donald Sachtleben, a former FBI contractor, pled guilty to unlawfully removing classified material and was sentenced to time served. He leaked information about a foiled suicide bombing attack to the Associated Press, leading to charges under the Espionage Act. The government subpoenaed AP journalists' phone records for evidence against him. In 2013, Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor, leaked top-secret documents to the Guardian and the Washington Post. He fled to Hong Kong and sought asylum in Ecuador, but currently resides in Russia under a temporary residency permit. Snowden faces charges under the Espionage Act and theft of government property. Russia has refused U.S. requests for extradition. Former Army General and CIA Director David Petraeus was charged with mishandling classified information in March 2015. Despite not fitting the typical leak prosecution mold, Petraeus admitted to disclosing information to a biographer he was romantically involved with. He pled guilty to a misdemeanor charge and was fined $40,000 as part of a plea agreement. Russia declined U.S. requests for his extradition. The court imposed a $100,000 fine on David Petraeus for mishandling classified information, despite prosecutors recommending a $40,000 fine. The Espionage Act allows for convictions for leaks to the press, but the government has never prosecuted a news organization for receiving protected information. Some argue that the Act could apply to anyone who disseminates national defense information, even if they are part of the press. The government pursued Espionage Act charges against AIPAC lobbyists for receiving leaked national security information. Legal discussions arose regarding the press's role in leak prosecutions and government subpoenas for media sources. Notable legal proceedings involved press members or recipients of leaked information facing civil or criminal suits or being targeted by the government for evidence gathering. The only known criminal prosecution for leaking classified information involved AIPAC lobbyists Steven J. Rosen and Keith Weissman, indicted for conspiracy to disclose national security secrets to unauthorized individuals, including Israeli officials and a reporter. The prosecution was criticized for \"criminalizing the exchange of information.\" The AIPAC lobbyists Steven J. Rosen and Keith Weissman were charged with leaking classified information, but the charges were dropped due to concerns about proving intent and disclosing classified information at trial. The judge ruled that the prosecution must prove bad faith intent to harm the United States or aid a foreign government under the Espionage Act. Later courts interpreted the intent issue differently, stating that the \"reason to believe\" standard does not require intent to harm. The Pentagon Papers case involved criminal prosecution of individuals for leaking information, and civil suits against newspapers for publishing the leaked documents. The Supreme Court rejected the government's request to prevent publication, distinguishing between injunctions and prosecutions for publication. The Supreme Court's Pentagon Papers decision recognized high First Amendment protection for the press in civil suits, distinguishing them from criminal prosecutions. While the decision denied an injunction, it left open the possibility of criminal prosecution under the Espionage Act for publishing protected information. The Supreme Court's Pentagon Papers decision acknowledged First Amendment protection for truthful information lawfully acquired by the press. The Court has not determined if the government can punish the publication of unlawfully acquired information. Routine newsgathering is considered lawful acquisition, allowing for publication without government retribution. In a 2001 case, Bartnicki v. Vopper, the Court ruled that media organizations cannot be punished for disclosing unlawfully obtained information. Recipients of unlawfully disclosed information are not considered to have obtained it unlawfully solely based on their knowledge. Disclosure by an innocent recipient is protected by the First Amendment, while wrongful disclosure by a person in violation of trust receives no protection. No civil or criminal proceedings have been filed against media members receiving leaked information. In legal disputes involving leaked information, the government has sought testimony and records from the press. In the trial of CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling, the Obama Administration tried to compel New York Times reporter James Risen to testify about classified information. The district court recognized a reporter's privilege under the First Amendment, limiting Risen's testimony to protect his confidential source. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed a ruling that protected journalist James Risen's confidential source. The Department of Justice issued subpoenas to obtain phone records from AP bureaus and reporters in an investigation involving leaks of covert efforts. The government's evidence-gathering methods were criticized for lack of transparency. The government's evidence-gathering methods were criticized for lack of transparency, including the case of former State Department contractor Stephen Jin-Woo Kim's disclosures to Fox News correspondent James Rosen. The Department of Justice subpoenaed Rosen's emails without notice, characterizing him as acting like an intelligence officer. Rosen was never charged, but the affidavit's language suggesting he may be charged for violating the Espionage Act received criticism. The backlash against the possibility of charging a news media member under the Espionage Act led to the Department of Justice revising its leak investigation policies in 2013. Critics argue that current laws protecting classified information are outdated and vague, while others believe they do not consider the value of releasing information to the public. Congress attempted to create a new law in 2000 and 2001-2002 to address these issues. The proposed provision in subsection (a) would penalize the disclosure of classified information to unauthorized individuals, with fines, imprisonment up to 3 years, or both. This was in response to concerns about outdated laws protecting classified information and the value of releasing information to the public. The proposed provision aimed to penalize disclosure of classified information to unauthorized individuals, expanding the scope of information covered by espionage laws. It would have made it a crime to disclose classified information to those without authorized access, with exceptions for certain entities like courts and authorized foreign power representatives. The proposed language aimed to make it easier for the government to prosecute unauthorized disclosures of classified information by eliminating the need to prove damage to national security. The measure was passed by the 106th Congress but vetoed by President Clinton for being overbroad and potentially chilling. President Clinton vetoed the proposed legislation, citing concerns that it was \"overbroad\" and could discourage government officials from engaging in legitimate activities. He argued that the criminal provision was unnecessary in a society built on freedom of expression and consent of the governed. The criminal provision for unauthorized disclosure of classified information was deemed unnecessary by President Clinton due to concerns of it being overbroad and potentially chilling legitimate activities. The 107th and 109th Congresses considered similar measures but opted for reviews instead. The Attorney General's report to the 108th Congress highlighted existing statutory prohibitions against unauthorized disclosures. There is no specific statute for criminal penalties for unauthorized disclosure of classified information, but current laws can be used to prosecute offenders if identified. Consideration for tailored legislation to address unauthorized disclosures of classified information has been suggested, but its practical benefits are uncertain. The Espionage Act applies to unauthorized receipt and dissemination of classified information. The Espionage Act applies to unauthorized receipt and dissemination of classified information, which includes closely held government materials related to U.S. military operations, facilities, and personnel. Courts have deemed disclosures of classified information by government employees to the press as conduct without First Amendment protection. The legality of punishing the media for publishing unlawfully obtained information remains uncertain under the First Amendment. The publication of national security information may be protected under the First Amendment, with the value to the public weighed against potential harm to national security. This poses a challenging case for prosecutors."
