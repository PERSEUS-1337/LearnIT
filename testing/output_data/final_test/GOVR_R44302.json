    "content": "The federal government has focused on ending chronic homelessness among the chronically homeless population for over a decade, using permanent supportive housing (PSH) which provides housing along with services. The Housing First model, emphasizing consumer choice and lack of preconditions, has gained prominence. This approach differs from previous beliefs that individuals must address underlying issues before moving into permanent housing. Prioritizing chronically homeless individuals for housing resources is supported by evidence. The CRS report summarizes research on permanent supportive housing (PSH) for chronically homeless individuals, highlighting its cost-effectiveness compared to emergency shelter or transitional housing. It discusses the evolution of assistance for the chronically homeless and the success of PSH as an effective intervention. The report also explores the definition of chronic homelessness and gaps in research. The term \"chronic homelessness\" refers to individuals experiencing long periods of homelessness with disabling conditions, first appearing in research literature in the 1980s. The report identified three patterns of homelessness based on duration, including chronically homeless individuals who are more likely to have mental illness and substance abuse issues. Researchers Kuhn and Culhane categorized homeless individuals based on shelter days and episodes of homelessness, defining three categories: Transitionally homeless, episodically homeless, and chronically homeless. Their work has been influential in efforts to end chronic homelessness. Chronically homeless individuals, who make up about 10% of all homeless shelter users in New York and Philadelphia, use nearly 50% of the total shelter days. They are more likely to have physical and mental health issues and substance abuse problems compared to episodically homeless individuals. Assistance for homeless individuals can be targeted based on the nature of their homelessness. Short-term help like income supports may suffice for those transitionally homeless, while those chronically homeless may require long-term housing subsidies and ongoing services. Efforts to end chronic homelessness were prioritized by homeless service providers and policymakers, with initiatives launched in the early 2000s to define and address chronic homelessness. HUD issued proposed regulations to define \"chronically homeless,\" federal projects targeted assistance to these individuals. The definition stemmed from the Bush Administration's plan to end chronic homelessness and the Collaborative Initiative funded in 2003 by HUD, HHS, and VA. The initiative provided rental assistance and supportive services, with the definition finalized in 2006. The definition of \"chronically homeless\" was finalized in 2006 as part of the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act. To be considered chronically homeless, individuals or families must meet specific criteria, including having a disabling condition such as substance use disorder, mental illness, or physical illness. The definition of \"chronically homeless\" includes cognitive impairments from a brain injury, chronic physical illness, or disability. To be considered chronically homeless, individuals or families must be continuously homeless for a year or have had at least four occasions of homelessness in the past three years. HUD's regulation clarifies that occasions of homelessness must total at least 12 months, with at least seven nights separating each occasion. Individuals and families are considered homeless if they are residing in a place not meant for human habitation, in an emergency shelter, or a safe haven. The number of people experiencing chronic homelessness varies based on estimates from annual community point-in-time counts conducted by HUD since 2005. Communities determine chronic homelessness by asking about length of time homeless and disabling conditions. The number of chronically homeless individuals has decreased from 18.8% in 2008 to 14.6% in 2013 and 2014. In 2015, half of chronically homeless individuals lived in the 50 largest cities in the U.S. Los Angeles had the most chronically homeless individuals with 12,356. HUD collects data on chronically homeless individuals through annual point-in-time counts. HUD began publishing data on individuals in chronically homeless families in 2013, with 2.8% of the total homeless population being members of such families. By 2015, this number decreased to 2.3%. Qualifying disabling conditions for chronically homeless status include physical and mental disabilities, as well as substance use disorders. The majority of chronically homeless individuals are believed to have serious mental illness, substance use disorders, or both. For example, in a specific program, 67% of individuals screened had a psychotic disorder or serious mental illness, 60% had an alcohol abuse issue, and 60% had a drug abuse issue. Among veterans in the HUD-VASH program in FY2010, 60% reported substance use disorder and 42% reported serious mental illness. Homeless individuals with mental illness and substance use disorders may struggle to stabilize their lives without assistance. Diagnosing mental illnesses and substance use disorders relies on symptoms that interfere with daily functioning. Prior to the late 1990s and early 2000s, addressing homelessness among high-need populations, such as those with mental illness and substance abuse issues, involved a linear approach to housing. This approach required interim steps like abstinence from drugs and alcohol before achieving permanent housing. The Federal Task Force on Homelessness and Severe Mental Illness highlighted the need for safe havens for homeless individuals with mental illness. The Federal Task Force on Homelessness and Severe Mental Illness emphasized the necessity of safe havens for homeless individuals with severe mental illness to overcome barriers to permanent housing. President Clinton's executive order called for a coordinated Federal plan to address homelessness, including emergency shelter, transitional services, and permanent housing with support services like substance abuse treatment and mental health services. The HUD adopted a \"Continuum of Care\" model for administering Homeless Assistance Grants in 1996, which included transitional housing with supportive services for homeless individuals. Research showed that chronically homeless individuals used expensive public services, leading to the development of alternative approaches to address chronic homelessness. Permanent supportive housing (PSH) is a housing model that provides long-term housing with supportive services for residents, aiming to reduce costs associated with public services such as hospitalizations, prison stays, and emergency shelter stays for certain populations. HUD defines PSH as community-based, not time-limited, with renewable leases, and offering supportive services to help residents with disabilities live independently. Permanent supportive housing (PSH) provides long-term housing with supportive services for residents with disabilities to live independently. PSH units may be scattered site or single-site multifamily rental properties, with residents paying a portion of their income towards rent. SAMHSA published practices that should characterize PSH. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published guidelines for Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) services, emphasizing voluntary services with consumer choice, comprehensive individualized services, and adherence to SAMHSA principles. PSH models may vary in service availability and provider interactions, with some requiring residents to abstain from drugs and alcohol. SAMHSA developed a fidelity scale for PSH providers to assess program effectiveness. The Housing First model, pioneered by Pathways to Housing in the early 1990s, offers immediate access to housing for homeless individuals without requiring abstinence or medication compliance. It provides counseling and treatment services on a voluntary basis. The Housing First model offers counseling and treatment services to clients on a voluntary basis, emphasizing resident choice and harm reduction in drug or alcohol use. It involves a team of providers available 24 hours a day with a low staff to client ratio, and aims to maintain housing for residents even when problems arise. Some permanent housing with supportive services may not follow the Housing First model, but more are adopting the low-demand approach. HUD, VA, and SAMHSA endorse Housing First for chronically homeless individuals. USICH promotes Housing First as a solution to homelessness in its report Opening Doors. The Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) model provides comprehensive support for individuals with severe mental illness, offering services from a multidisciplinary team around the clock in home or community settings. This includes assistance with daily living activities and goes beyond traditional mental health services. The Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) model offers comprehensive support for individuals with severe mental illness, including assistance with daily living activities and support in pursuing employment or education. ACT services may be costly but are cost-effective as they reduce the use of inpatient and emergency services. For homeless individuals, ACT services may include assistance with housing applications and advocacy with landlords. Studies have shown that ACT reduces homelessness more than standard case management. Research has found that ACT combined with housing assistance is more effective in reducing homelessness than ACT alone. The federal government prioritized ending chronic homelessness due to the high cost of services used by chronically homeless individuals. Chronically homeless individuals utilize resources like emergency rooms, hospitals, and jails more than those experiencing homelessness for shorter durations. Solving chronic homelessness through housing is achievable and beneficial. Several federal programs targeted resources and assistance to help chronically homeless individuals since the early 2000s, aligning with the government's goal to end chronic homelessness. Interagency collaborations under the George W. Bush Administration included initiatives like the Collaborative Initiative to Help End Chronic Homelessness, Ending Chronic Homelessness through Employment and Housing, and Housing for People Who Are Homeless and Addicted to Alcohol. These programs aimed to provide housing, treatment, and employment assistance to address chronic homelessness. The HUD Homeless Assistance Grants fund housing for people experiencing homelessness, prioritizing permanent supportive housing for chronically homeless individuals. Grants totaling around $2 billion per year support permanent housing, transitional housing, and supportive services. Funding for PSH has been emphasized in recent years, with a focus on targeting chronic homelessness through grant applications. In FY2004, 10% of funds were allocated for serving chronically homeless individuals, and in FY2005, a permanent housing bonus was offered for new projects serving this population. The HUD Homeless Assistance Grants prioritize permanent supportive housing for chronically homeless individuals. Grantees are requested to prioritize chronically homeless individuals when units become available. The HEARTH Act ensures that at least 30% of funding for new housing is devoted to permanent housing for homeless individuals with disabilities and their families. The HUD-VA Supported Housing program began in 1992. The HUD-VA Supported Housing (HUD-VASH) program, established in 1992, provides housing to homeless veterans through Section 8 vouchers and supportive services. Eligible veterans have chronic mental illness or substance use disorders. Congress allocated $575 million from FY2008 to FY2015 for vouchers. Priority is given to housing for chronically homeless veterans. The US Interagency Council on Homelessness encouraged local communities to develop 10-year plans to end homelessness, with a focus on chronic homelessness. The HEARTH Act directed the USICH to develop a national plan to end homelessness, with a target of ending homelessness among chronically homeless individuals by 2017. The Department of Health and Human Services released a primer and best practices for linking health care and homelessness. The federal government has used research on chronic homelessness to support efforts to end it, which may be relevant to ongoing policymaking. Research has shown how Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) affects outcomes for chronically homeless individuals, with studies focusing on unaccompanied individuals rather than families. HUD did not include chronically homeless families in its definition until 2009. The primary purpose of research on chronic homelessness is to determine if housing reduces homelessness. Outcomes are typically measured by days spent housed or returns to homelessness. Some studies also look at secondary outcomes like reduced substance use and improved mental health. The CRS searched for articles on outcomes for chronically homeless individuals moving to Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) from homelessness. Only peer-reviewed journal articles were included in the search. The CRS selected studies on outcomes for chronically homeless individuals moving to Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) from homelessness. The outcomes measured include housing status and stability, public service use and costs, and substance use. Researchers also looked at whether the intervention was characterized as Housing First. The success of Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) for chronically homeless individuals is evaluated based on housing stability, mental health, and resident satisfaction. While PSH reduces chronic homelessness, outcomes in other areas like mental health and substance use are mixed. Researchers measure housing stability over time to determine success. The success of Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) for chronically homeless individuals is evaluated by measuring housing stability over time. Studies show that individuals in PSH experience increased days housed and decreased days homeless compared to other housing options. This supports the Housing First principle that individuals do not need to be housing-ready. Studies support the Housing First principle that individuals do not need to be housing-ready to succeed in ending long-term homelessness. Factors such as substance abuse and mental illness may affect housing success, with some evidence showing substance abuse contributing to housing instability. Non-white residents generally had less housing success. Substance abuse among homeless individuals can impact housing stability. Some studies show that drug and alcohol use can lead to housing loss or prolonged homelessness, while others found no significant relationship. Targeting services to resident needs may increase housing success. Studies have shown that individuals with co-occurring substance use disorders are more likely to maintain housing compared to those with either mental illness or substance use only. Active substance users have more days housed and fewer days homeless than less active substance users. Factors such as gender, race, age, and educational attainment also play a role in housing success. Being a woman, white, and older are associated with greater housing success. Prior research by Montgomery, Locke, Schutt, Goldfinger, Burt, and O'Connell found various factors influencing housing stability for chronically homeless individuals. Living situation prior to entering housing, time spent homeless, and living location all impact housing stability. Factors such as being white, female, and living in a shelter were associated with increased likelihood of remaining housed. Prior research by Montgomery, Locke, Schutt, Goldfinger, Burt, and O'Connell identified factors influencing housing stability for chronically homeless individuals. Residence in psychiatric institutions led to shorter housing tenure compared to other locations. Studies showed that time spent in residential treatment or transitional housing did not necessarily improve housing stability and could even detract from it. Some research found that clients with mood disorders were more likely to remain housed. In previous studies, homeless veterans with co-occurring mental disorders had better housing outcomes compared to those with substance use disorders only. Housing dedicated to individuals with alcohol addiction saw residents with severe psychotic symptoms more likely to leave. Criminal background did not significantly impact housing success. Services may help residents maintain housing, with group home residents having better outcomes than those in independent apartments. In research studies, the quality of housing and services providers, adherence to Housing First principles, and intensity of case management can impact residents' success in maintaining housing. Different levels of case management did not show significant differences in outcomes. Housing provided by experienced Housing First providers had higher success rates in residents remaining housed compared to new providers. Residents in housing dedicated to alcohol addiction had varying outcomes. Malone, and Clifasefi (2013) found that residents in housing tailored to alcohol addiction had different outcomes based on drug use and drinking habits. Gilmer, et al. (2014) showed that high fidelity to Housing First principles reduced days homeless compared to low-fidelity models. Davidson, et al. (2014) found that adherence to consumer participation principles increased housing retention. Prioritizing permanent supportive housing for the chronically homeless can reduce the use of expensive public services. Researchers often measure outcomes related to service use and costs paid for with public funds, including changes in visits to service providers and public funds spent on homeless individuals before and after moving into housing. They may use actual costs incurred in providing services, such as Medicaid reimbursement rates, or estimates of average costs for housing and healthcare services. Some studies focus on specific categories of costs, while others consider all possible costs. Not all researchers include housing costs in their analysis. A review of studies found that outcomes related to public service use and costs for chronically homeless individuals in Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) are mixed. Some studies showed cost reductions in certain service categories after providing PSH, while others showed cost increases. Overall, the findings on cost reductions from PSH are not as consistent as improvements in housing stability. Factors influencing differences in service use and cost among studies on Permanent Supportive Housing include population neediness, type of assistance received, costs assessed, and follow-up period length. Researchers have found mixed results in cost reductions from PSH interventions. Researchers have found that Housing First programs can lead to cost reductions, with costs per day ranging from $75-$125 for participants compared to $100-$150 for the comparison group. Placement in housing has also been linked to a decrease in emergency department visits and overall costs, with monthly costs for housed participants reduced by $2,249 per person. Sadowski, et al. (2009) found that homeless individuals who moved into housing reduced hospitalizations, days hospitalized, and emergency room visits compared to those who received only hospital discharge planning. In Srebnik, Connor, and Sylla (2013) homeless individuals with high visits to sobering centers reduced emergency room and sobering center visits. Culhane, Metraux, and Hadley (2002) found that costs declined for shelter and hospital stays for homeless individuals with severe mental illness who moved into housing, but the offsetting costs of housing resulted in a cost increase. Overall, studies have shown that providing housing assistance to homeless individuals can lead to increased costs in health care and case management, but decreased costs in inpatient/emergency and criminal justice services. For example, one study found that veterans receiving housing and modified ACT case management had higher costs compared to those receiving standard case management only. Additionally, housed participants had higher health care costs compared to those without housing assistance. In studies, providing housing to homeless individuals increased health care and case management costs but decreased inpatient/emergency and justice system costs. For instance, in Gilmer et al. (2010), costs for outpatient and housing rose for mentally ill homeless individuals with housing, while inpatient, emergency, and justice system costs decreased. Basu et al. (2012) found higher outpatient, housing, and case management costs for housed mentally ill individuals compared to those without housing. Substance abuse treatment costs were lower for the housed group. Among veterans enrolled in the HUD-VASH program in FY2010, 60% reported having a substance use disorder. Researchers study how substance use changes after gaining housing, measuring outcomes based on alcohol and drug use instances and amounts consumed. Self-reports and tools like follow-back calendars are used to track substance use. The Addiction Severity Index is also used to measure the severity of substance addiction. Studies have examined changes in substance use outcomes for chronically homeless individuals moving into Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH). Out of 47 studies surveyed, 34% looked at substance use changes, with some showing reductions in drug and alcohol use after housing was provided. Engagement in substance abuse treatment was found to be higher among those not in PSH. Studies have shown that substance use outcomes for chronically homeless individuals in Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) vary. Factors such as environment, availability of substances, and length of substance use can impact the effectiveness of treatment. Reducing reliance on drugs and alcohol may not happen quickly, especially for those with sustained high levels of use over many years. The authors of a study noted the limitation of a 24-month follow-up period. Comparison groups without housing participated in treatment more frequently than those in housing programs. Five studies found no significant differences in substance use outcomes between homeless individuals in housing and those without housing. In studies by Gulcur and Tsemberis (2006) and Mares and Rosenheck (2011), no significant differences were found in alcohol and drug use between individuals who received housing and those who did not. However, Cheng et al. (2007) reported that the group that moved into housing had fewer days of alcohol use compared to comparison groups without housing, while Padgett et al. (2011) found that those without housing were more likely to use illicit drugs and heavy alcohol. Davidson et al. (2014) showed that residents in Housing First programs with greater consumer participation were more likely to reduce use of opiates and stimulants. Residents in Housing First programs with greater consumer participation were more likely to reduce use of opiates and stimulants compared to those in housing with lower fidelity. Larimer et al. (2009) found that residents with alcohol addiction reduced days drinking to intoxication 12 months after obtaining housing. Collins et al. (2012) also observed decreased alcohol intake and fewer residents drinking to intoxication over two years. Edens et al. (2011) noted a decrease in drug and alcohol use among high-frequency substance users after moving into housing. Tsai et al. (2012) found a small decrease in residents reporting drug use. Rosenheck (May 2012) found small decreases in residents reporting drug use and Addiction Severity Index scores for alcohol use. Non-housed participants used treatment more than those in housing. Studies comparing treatment-first programs to Housing First programs showed higher use of substance abuse treatment in the treatment-first group. Participants in treatment-first programs were 10 times more likely to use substance abuse services than those in housing. High-frequency substance users who moved into housing reduced substance use treatment. In a study by Appel, Tsemberis, Joseph, et al. (2012), participants who received housing were more likely to maintain methadone treatment over 8 and 24 months. A large percentage of chronically homeless individuals suffer from mental illness, with 67% found to have a serious mental illness in one study. Among veterans in the HUD-VASH program, 42% had a serious mental illness. Researchers use surveys like the Colorado Symptom Index and SF-12 to measure mental health outcomes. Of the studies surveyed by CRS, 14 out of 47 examined mental health improvements in chronically homeless individuals moving into PSH. Mental health improvements in PSH residents were infrequent, with only six studies showing statistically significant results. It may not be expected for mental health symptoms to improve immediately upon entry into housing, as most mental illnesses are chronic conditions that can be managed over time with appropriate treatment. Stable housing may not guarantee better mental health treatment outcomes, as individuals with stable housing may still face barriers to accessing care. Providing stable housing can remove a barrier to mental health care, but other obstacles such as lack of available providers or motivation to seek care may still exist. No significant changes in mental health status were found in studies evaluating the impact of providing housing on psychiatric symptoms and mental health outcomes among homeless individuals. Studies have shown mixed results regarding the impact of providing housing on mental health outcomes for homeless individuals. One study found reductions in depression and perceived stress for those moving into housing, while another saw reduced reports of psychological distress and small improvements in mental health scores post-housing. Additionally, a study found that individuals receiving services without housing assistance spent more time in psychiatric hospitals compared to those who were housed. Studies have shown mixed results on the impact of housing on mental health outcomes for homeless individuals. Research found that individuals in a treatment-first group used mental health treatment more after 48 months. Homeless individuals who moved into housing increased case management, medication management, and therapy. Housing First projects prioritize resident choice in location and services. Some studies surveyed formerly homeless housing residents on satisfaction with living situation and quality of life in Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH). Residents in Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) reported varying levels of satisfaction with housing and community choice, with some feeling isolated. Fulfilling housing preferences was linked to higher quality of life scores. Resident satisfaction may not directly correlate with cost reductions or improvements in mental health or substance use. Satisfaction and quality of life may be important goals for formerly homeless individuals, providing comfort, stability, and reduced stress. Formerly homeless individuals who moved into housing reported greater satisfaction with their living situation. Satisfaction levels were higher in Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) compared to those without housing assistance. Satisfaction may vary based on prior residential treatment experiences. Those with prior residential treatment experiences reported greater housing satisfaction compared to those who moved directly to housing. In non-abstinence contingent housing, residents had higher satisfaction levels after 18 months, but some also reported feelings of isolation and less empowerment. Both abstinence-contingent and non-abstinence contingent groups faced difficulties fitting into the community. Participants in two studies reported higher consumer choice levels in housing. Having more housing preferences met was linked to higher quality of life scores. Housing recipients reported larger social networks and better family relationships. Those living in housing had more positive responses regarding family and social relationships. Participants also reported increased confidence in support from service providers but decreased confidence in support from others. Residents indicated increased community and civic participation, such as going to stores, restaurants, visiting family and friends, and voting. Drug and Alcohol Use and Mental Health Status may impact housing satisfaction and quality of life. Participants using both alcohol and drugs had less community integration and housing satisfaction. Veterans with a mental disorder and substance use disorder had lower quality of life scores. High baseline scores on depression-anxiety were linked to less housing satisfaction and higher crisis intervention levels. Residents in supportive housing were more likely to have lower housing satisfaction, higher crisis intervention levels, more isolation, less empowerment, and a lower quality of life. Research shows that while permanent supportive housing can reduce homelessness, it may not necessarily improve mental health, substance use, or duration in housing. Research indicates that while permanent supportive housing (PSH) can reduce chronic homelessness, it may not necessarily solve all issues faced by homeless individuals or reduce treatment and service costs for everyone. Cost reductions from PSH placement may only occur for those with the most serious issues and high service utilization rates. Tailoring housing subsidies and services may be necessary to effectively address the needs of homeless individuals. Tailoring housing subsidies and services to homeless individuals based on their needs can offset costs of PSH placement. Intervening early with less intensive interventions before health conditions and substance use issues become severe could lead to cost reductions in the long run. It is important to consider the level of impairment and co-occurring disorders when providing supportive housing or case management to homeless individuals. Cost reductions from providing Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) for chronically homeless individuals may not benefit the entity funding the housing, such as HUD. Instead, savings could be seen by provider hospitals, state Medicaid programs, and law enforcement at the state and local levels. With limited federal funding available, flat funding may not be enough to end chronic homelessness with PSH. Exploring other budget areas where agencies can reduce costs and improve outcomes may be necessary. In states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, housing providers are partnering with Medicaid providers to improve outcomes for chronically homeless individuals. Medicaid funds can be used for housing-related activities and services, including Housing Transition Services and Housing and Tenancy Sustaining Services. Some states are using Medicaid funds to provide housing for high-need recipients, aiming to reduce health system costs. Medicaid can cover services related to housing but not direct housing costs, except for institutional settings like nursing homes. Medicaid agencies and providers are working together to find stable housing for clients. Some states are using their state share of Medicaid funds to support housing costs, including Pennsylvania's HealthChoices program and New York's allocation for Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH). Pay for Success initiatives are also being utilized, where government entities partner with outside investors to fund programs that benefit individuals, with repayment contingent on achieving predetermined outcomes. The government partners with outside investors in Pay for Success initiatives to fund programs like Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) for homeless individuals. These initiatives aim to create housing stability and reduce costs by targeting budgets effectively. The benefits of ending homelessness may justify the added expense of investing in housing. Studies have shown that housed participants have better access to healthcare providers, leading to more outpatient visits for physical health, mental health, and substance use. Additionally, there are increases in Social Security receipt, SNAP receipt, and utilization of healthcare services, which can improve recipients' health and quality of life and potentially lead to cost reductions elsewhere. The study conducted searches for journal articles on outcomes for chronically homeless individuals transitioning to permanent supportive housing from 2000 to 2013. Search terms included \"housing first,\" \"homeless/homelessness,\" \"chronic/chronically,\" and \"permanent supportive housing/supportive housing.\" Bibliographies of the studies were also reviewed for additional references. Some studies referenced pre-date 2000, and in a few cases, the publication dates are before 2000. The study searched for journal articles on outcomes for chronically homeless individuals transitioning to permanent supportive housing from 2000 to 2013. The range of publication dates for the included studies is from 1996-2014. The criteria for inclusion were articles published in peer-reviewed journals, focusing on individuals considered chronically homeless or with histories of homelessness and disability in the United States. The housing provided was permanent and included access to supportive services. The focus was on chronically homeless individuals, not families, as the federal definition did not include families until recently. The study focused on outcomes for chronically homeless individuals transitioning to permanent supportive housing. Articles included high-need homeless populations meeting aspects of the federal definition of chronic homelessness. Articles were not excluded based on methodology, with varying levels of statistical rigor. Research articles were grouped based on measured outcomes, including housing status, stability, service use, and costs. The study focused on outcomes for chronically homeless individuals transitioning to permanent supportive housing, including housing status and stability, service use and costs, substance use, mental health, and resident satisfaction/quality of life. Research summaries in the provided tables cover these outcomes, with limited focus on employment, income, criminal justice, and physical health outcomes. The provided tables summarize research outcomes for chronically homeless individuals transitioning to permanent supportive housing, including housing status, service use, substance use, mental health, resident satisfaction, and quality of life. The tables arrange research by date and include links to citations for journal articles. Researchers also note the type of housing and services received by intervention groups, outcomes measured, and whether the intervention was characterized as Housing First."
