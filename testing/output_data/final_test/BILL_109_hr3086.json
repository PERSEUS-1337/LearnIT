The Congress acknowledges that heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death among women in the United States, with almost 500,000 women dying each year. Approximately 1 in 4 women have some form of cardiovascular disease, which is often undetected and untreated until it becomes severe, leading to a high mortality rate. Obesity increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and certain cancers in women, but better nutrition and lifestyle changes can help prevent and treat obesity. Osteoporosis is also a significant public health concern for millions of Americans. In 2002, women over 50 accounted for 75% of hip osteoporosis cases. 1 in 2 women over 50 will have an osteoporosis-related fracture. Hip fracture rates are higher in women than men. Direct costs for osteoporotic fractures are $12-18 billion annually. Physical activity, calcium, and vitamin D are crucial for bone health. Muscular strength and balance reduce osteoporosis risk. 18.2 million Americans have diabetes, with 200,000 deaths yearly. Diabetes cases in adults increased by 61% since 1990. Diabetes in the United States increased by 61% from 1990 to 2001, making it the sixth leading cause of death. Approximately 8.7% of women over 20 have diabetes, with one-third unaware. Cardiovascular disease risk is higher in women with diabetes, leading to a 23% increase in heart disease deaths over 30 years. The costs of diabetes amount to over $132 billion annually. Better nutrition, physical activity, and blood glucose control can help delay diabetes progression. Modest physical activity and a healthy diet can reduce the risk of developing type-2 diabetes by nearly 60%. The WISEWOMAN program offers preventive health services like cholesterol and blood pressure screening, identifying risk factors such as obesity, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, sedentary behavior, and poor diet. It has also detected cases of undiagnosed hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes in women. The direct and indirect costs of diabetes exceed $130 billion annually. Research has shown that the uninsured face poorer health outcomes and struggle to access preventive healthcare services, highlighting the importance of programs like WISEWOMAN in identifying risk factors in women. SEC. 3. SUPPLEMENTAL GRANTS FOR ADDITIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH SERVICES FOR WOMEN. Amendment to Section 1509 of the Public Health Service Act to establish a program for additional preventive health services. The Secretary may award grants to States for preventive health services like screenings for diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, osteoporosis, and obesity, as well as health education and interventions for behavioral risk factors. The Secretary may award grants to States for preventive health services, including screenings for diseases like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, osteoporosis, and obesity. The grants aim to provide appropriate referrals for medical treatment, ensure follow-up services, and evaluate activities through surveillance or research. States must agree to provide services in conjunction with entities screening women for breast or cervical cancer. The provisions of this title apply to grants for preventive health services, with authorized funding amounts for fiscal years 2006-2008 and subsequent years. No additional resources can be appropriated unless a certain amount is allocated for breast and cervical cancer."
