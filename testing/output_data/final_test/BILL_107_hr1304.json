    "content": "Credit for recycling or remanufacturing equipment is provided in Section 1. The reclamation credit is a new addition to the Internal Revenue Code, offering a 20% credit for qualified reclamation property placed in service during the taxable year. Qualified reclamation property is defined within the code. The term 'qualified reclamation property' refers to tangible property with a useful life of at least 5 years, acquired by purchase by the taxpayer, and eligible for depreciation or amortization. The basis of qualified reclamation property for a taxpayer is limited to $10,000,000 per year. Controlled group members are treated as one taxpayer for this limitation. The Secretary will distribute the dollar limitation among the component members of a controlled group as prescribed by regulations. Partnerships and S corporations are subject to the dollar limitation, with similar rules applying to partners and shareholders. The term 'controlled group' is defined for this purpose. For the purposes of this subsection, the term 'controlled group' is defined as per section 1563(a), with certain progress expenditure rules applicable. 'Qualified recycling property' refers to equipment exclusively used for collecting, distributing, or sorting used materials. The term 'qualified remanufacturing property' refers to equipment primarily used in rebuilding or remanufacturing used products or parts with 50% or less virgin material. The equipment must not be used primarily in a process occurring after the product or part is rebuilt or remanufactured. Coordination with rehabilitation and energy credits is required, with a special basis adjustment rule in place. Special Basis Adjustment Rule amended to include reclamation credit in section 50(c) of the Code. Clerical amendments made to section 48 heading. Section 48 of the tax code is amended to include energy credit, reforestation credit, and reclamation credit. The amendments apply to property placed in service on or after January 1, 2002."
