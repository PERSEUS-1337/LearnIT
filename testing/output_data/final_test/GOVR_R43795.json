President Xi of China agreed to peak Chinese CO2 emissions around 2030 and increase non-fossil energy share to 20% by 2030. Policy makers are concerned about whether U.S. GHG emissions will meet these goals or increase. The report provides data on U.S. GHG emissions from sources like the EPA and EIA. It discusses factors influencing emissions and challenges in making projections. U.S. GHG emissions increased from 1990 to 2007, decreased in 2008 and 2009, and fluctuated in subsequent years. In 2010, emissions increased but decreased again in 2011 and 2012, reaching levels comparable to 1995. U.S. GHG emissions in 2012 were approximately 10% below 2005 levels, meeting the President's 2020 target. GHG emissions come from various sources like smokestacks, vehicles, households, and commercial buildings. CO2 from fossil fuel combustion accounted for 78% of total U.S. GHG emissions in 2012. The focus is on reducing CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion, particularly from large stationary sources like power plants, have been closely monitored for almost 20 years. Measurement devices in smokestacks report data to the EPA. The largest contribution (40%) comes from electricity generation, distributed to residential, industrial, and commercial sectors. Changes in emissions from fossil fuel combustion have been the main factor affecting U.S. emission trends. Multiple variables impact U.S. GHG emission levels. One approach in climate change analysis is to consider factors influencing U.S. GHG emissions, such as population, income (per capita GDP), energy intensity, and carbon intensity. Policies targeting energy and carbon intensity are most relevant for climate change mitigation. Energy intensity is the amount of energy consumed, while carbon intensity is CO2 emissions per energy use. Energy intensity is the amount of energy consumed per economic output like GDP, measured in metric tons of oil equivalent or British thermal units. In the U.S., energy use increased from 1990 to 2000 at 1.6% annually, then remained steady. GDP increased by 2.5% annually from 1990 to 2013, leading to a decline in U.S. energy intensity. Comparing energy intensities of the U.S., EU, and China from 1990 to 2011, U.S. energy intensity decreased by 2% annually, with a 31% decrease in 2011 compared to 1990. The energy intensity in the United States was 42% higher in 2011 than in the European Union, influenced by industries with high energy intensities. Selected energy-intensive industries' contribution to the U.S. GDP decreased from 4.2% in 1998 to 3.2% in 2011. Carbon intensity measures CO2 emissions from energy use, including fuel combustion for electricity and transportation. Energy sources vary widely. Energy sources vary in the amount of carbon released per unit of energy supplied. Coal emits 80% more CO2 than natural gas and 28% more than crude oil. Nuclear and some renewables do not produce CO2 emissions. The carbon content of energy use in the U.S. declined by 8% from 2005 to 2013, largely due to changes in fuel consumption. The decline in carbon content of energy use in the U.S. from 2005 to 2013 is largely attributed to changes in fuel consumption. Coal's contribution decreased while natural gas and renewable energy sources increased. The electric power sector plays a significant role in these changes, with renewable energy's share of total consumption rising substantially. The decline in carbon content of energy use in the U.S. from 2005 to 2013 is attributed to changes in fuel consumption. Coal decreased, natural gas and renewables increased. Forecasting future GHG emissions is complex due to various factors like technological developments, energy prices, weather patterns, and policy changes. EIA provides annual CO forecasts. The EIA provides annual forecasts of CO2 emissions in the United States and abroad, stating that projections are not definitive but based on assumptions and methodologies. Actual CO2 emissions have consistently been below past projections, with the decline attributed to changes in fuel consumption. The EIA provides annual forecasts of CO2 emissions, with projections based on assumptions and methodologies. Actual emissions have been consistently below past projections, attributed to changes in fuel consumption. The AEO from 2000 projected CO2 emissions to be almost 6.7 billion metric tons in 2012, 20% higher than observed. Recent projections (AEO 2012 and 2014) suggest emissions will remain relatively flat over the next decade."
