The \"Civil Rights Tax Relief Act of 2007\" excludes amounts received on account of unlawful discrimination from gross income, including backpay, frontpay, and punitive damages. This amendment applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 2006. The \"Civil Rights Tax Relief Act of 2007\" amends the Internal Revenue Code to limit taxes on income from backpay and frontpay received due to unlawful employment discrimination. The \"Civil Rights Tax Relief Act of 2007\" limits taxes on income from backpay and frontpay received due to unlawful employment discrimination by adjusting the tax calculation for the taxable year. The \"Civil Rights Tax Relief Act of 2007\" limits taxes on backpay and frontpay received for unlawful employment discrimination by adjusting the tax calculation based on the average annual net backpay and frontpay amount. Definitions for terms like backpay, frontpay, and unlawful employment discrimination are provided in the Act. \"Frontpay refers to compensation attributable to employment that would have occurred after a claimed violation of law, in taxable years following the violation.\" The term 'backpay period' refers to the period of services performed to which backpay is attributable, adjusted to the next highest number of whole taxable years if not equal to a whole number of years. The term 'average annual net backpay and frontpay amount' is defined as the excess of employment discrimination backpay and frontpay over the amount of deductions that would have been allowable, divided by the number of years in the backpay period and frontpay period. SEC. 1302 states that income from backpay and frontpay due to unlawful employment discrimination will be taxed starting in 2007. SEC. 4 ensures that this income will not increase alternative minimum tax liability. The amendment to Section 55(c) of the Internal Revenue Code excludes income from employment discrimination for regular tax computation. Effective starting from taxable years after December 31, 2006."
