The USDA reactivated dairy export subsidies and raised dairy product price supports. Congress allocated $350 million in the FY2010 Agriculture appropriations act to supplement existing dairy programs. Concerns about dairy pricing and milk price volatility on farmers were also raised. This report explores dairy pricing and related issues, including how milk producers receive price signals. The report discusses dairy pricing and related issues such as how milk producers receive price signals, farm milk price variability, managing price risks, and the farm share of retail prices for dairy products. It also explores alternative approaches proposed by the dairy industry to deal with dairy pricing. Price movements for milk and other commodities have long-term trends and seasonal components affecting prices. The supply of milk increases in the spring, leading to price declines. Dairy farmers are concerned about cyclical price movements caused by a mismatch in demand and supply. Lower prices in 2008 and 2009 prompted producers to cut milk production. Supply adjustments and improved demand lifted farm milk prices in fall 2009, with further gains expected in 2010. Farm milk prices fell sharply in fall 2009 after reaching record highs in 2007-2008. The volatility in prices began in the late 1980s and 1990s due to changes in export markets and world dairy prices. Historically, dairy programs provided stability in farm milk prices, especially in the 1970s. In the 1970s and early 1980s, dairy programs provided stability in farm milk prices by increasing support prices. However, in the mid-1980s, Congress reduced price supports, leading to increased price volatility. This shift prompted the dairy industry to focus on developing export markets to manage output. As a result, domestic markets became more susceptible to price fluctuations from the world market. The increasing price volatility in dairy producer prices has led to a greater demand from dairy farmers for managing price and revenue risks. Dairy farmers who are members of cooperatives benefit from risk management practices employed by their cooperatives through higher net milk prices or patronage dividends. These practices include shifting production between plants or product types, integrating into consumer and niche markets, and forming partnerships with other firms to mitigate business risk. Managing risks associated with changes in both output and input prices is crucial for dairy farmers. Producers in the agricultural sector can use futures markets to manage risks associated with price changes. Futures contracts allow for buying or selling commodities at a set price in the future. Various agricultural commodities, as well as other financial instruments, are traded on futures exchanges. Farmers can protect against declining prices by selling futures contracts. If prices in the futures market rise instead of fall, the farmer will realize a loss, but these losses can be offset by gains in the value of milk being sold. By using hedging strategies, farmers can lock in predetermined prices for milk production and key feed inputs like corn and soybean meal. Large-scale operators with matching milk volumes may hedge directly on exchanges. Some farmers hedge production through cooperatives or exchanges based on futures market prices and local cash prices. Hedging milk production is complex due to factors affecting cash prices like marketing order prices, premiums, and quality adjustments. Volatility can occur if losses in one market are not offset by gains in another. Some dairy farmers use forward contracts to lock in selling prices before delivery, allowing them to bypass minimum pricing rules established by federal marketing orders. This option became available under the 2008 farm bill, providing farmers with more flexibility in managing their milk prices. Some dairy farmers use forward contracts to bypass minimum pricing rules. Another option is the Livestock Gross Margin for Dairy Cattle insurance policy, which protects against loss in gross margin. Producers receive indemnity if actual gross margin is less than the guarantee, using futures prices for calculations. LGM for Dairy Cattle is available in over 35 states and is administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency. Farmers purchase policies from private crop insurance agents. Observers note that low participation in the Livestock Gross Margin for Dairy Cattle insurance policy is partly due to the producer bearing the full premium cost, unlike crop insurance where the government covers a significant portion. This disparity in subsidies has led to higher participation rates in crop insurance compared to LGM policies. Additionally, there are concerns about the slow adjustment of retail food prices to reflect falling farm prices, impacting the farm value share and raising questions about the role of processors and retailers in economic stress. In recent years, Congress has questioned the impact of processors and retailers on the economic stress faced by agricultural sectors, especially dairy farmers. The farm share of the retail food dollar has decreased over time, with the farm share for all farm products dropping from 41% in 1950 to 18.5% in 2006. Various factors contribute to this decline, including increased productivity, demand for value-added products, and changes in food marketing. For dairy products, the farm share is around one-third of the retail dollar. The farm share of the retail food dollar has decreased over time, with the farm share for all farm products dropping from 41% in 1950 to 18.5% in 2006. For dairy products, the farm share is approximately one-third of the retail dollar. Examining changes in monthly farm and retail prices during 2008 and early 2009 indicates a decline in the farm-value share of retail product values and a widening of the marketing margin. Between July 2008 and December 2008, the farm price of milk reported by USDA fell by $0.33 per gallon. Meanwhile, the average retail milk price fell only $0.28, with the marketing margin increasing to $2.35 per gallon. In January 2009, the difference between the average retail price of milk and the farm price of milk reached a record-high $2.43 per gallon. Retailers have cut prices due to lower costs for farm milk and other inputs, leading to a decline in the farm and retail price difference to $1.89 per gallon in September 2009. This is below the recent five-year average margin. Retail milk and dairy product prices have decreased significantly from highs in 2007 and 2008, falling more sharply than overall food prices. Dairy pricing in the United States is influenced by both market-based and administered prices, with perishability and other factors playing a role in determining farm milk prices. In the short run, excess milk production must be either dumped or processed into storable dairy products due to perishability. Market-based pricing for milk is determined by buyers and sellers based on demand, supply conditions, and government policy changes. Market mechanisms like cash and futures markets at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange play key roles in price discovery for dairy products. Wholesale cash prices for dairy products are determined daily at the CME, influencing contracts between dairy manufacturers and buyers. Some producers believe CME pricing harms them. Milk and dairy futures contracts in Chicago help manage financial risks from price fluctuations. Administered farm milk prices are influenced by government policies like the DPPSP and FMMOs. The Dairy Product Price Support Program (DPPSP) and Federal Milk Marketing Orders (FMMOs) are government policies that support dairy farmers by setting minimum prices for dairy products. FMMOs aim to stabilize market conditions and balance power between milk handlers and farmers. These policies play a significant role when milk prices are low, and the government steps in to purchase dairy products. The Dairy Product Price Support Program (DPPSP) ensures minimum prices for dairy products by allowing the government to purchase unlimited amounts of butter, American cheese, and nonfat dry milk at specified prices. This prevents market prices from dropping below support levels. Changes in farm milk prices have increased since the mid-1990s due to reduced price support levels. Federal Milk Marketing Orders (FMMOs) mandate minimum prices that processors must pay producers in milk marketing areas. Federal Milk Marketing Orders (FMMOs) mandate minimum prices for milk paid by processors to producers, based on wholesale dairy product prices collected by USDA. These minimum prices fluctuate monthly with changes in the dairy product market and determine the price farmers receive for their milk based on its end use. FMMOs also regulate how market proceeds are distributed among producers through a pooling system. Federal Milk Marketing Orders (FMMOs) regulate milk prices in 10 geographic areas, ensuring a minimum price for farmers based on wholesale dairy product prices. Some states, like California, have their own milk marketing regulations. Marketing orders were established in the 1930s to balance power between farmers and milk handlers and prevent destructive competition. Milk prices at the farm level reflect minimum prices set by handlers under the orders, plus any premiums from local supply/demand factors. Cooperatives play a crucial role in dairy pricing, representing farmers in negotiations with milk handlers and participating in the rulemaking process. They manage the distribution of raw milk, coordinate product movements, and bargain for prices. Dairy farmers typically sign contracts to market their entire production through cooperatives. Dairy farmers sign contracts with cooperatives to market their milk and manage price risks by shifting production. Price incentives influence production levels and price movements. Dairy farmers in the United States receive a \"mailbox price\" for their milk, which is the net price after adjustments for quality, marketing costs, and over-order premiums. Production decisions are based on monthly revenue, feed costs, and minimum FMMO prices. USDA calculates FMMO prices using wholesale product prices as input. The Federal Milk Marketing Order (FMMO) system determines minimum prices for different classes of milk based on wholesale prices. Pricing issues include timing, clarity, and the \"make allowance\" for dairy manufacturers. Prices are announced monthly by USDA, with fluid milk prices announced in advance and other class prices announced after the month closes. Mailbox prices are calculated once marketing order pools close, and FMMO administrators determine the overall blend price. The Federal Milk Marketing Order (FMMO) system establishes monthly prices to create a stable price environment for dairy farmers. However, criticism arises from the system's slow transmission of price signals in today's fast-changing market, leading to delays in responding to market fluctuations. The Federal Milk Marketing Order system establishes monthly prices to stabilize the dairy market. However, delays in price signals reaching producers can hinder their response to market changes, potentially leading to excessive production growth. Critics argue that the pooling function in milk marketing orders, while reducing competition, can also mute market signals for individual producers. The USDA calculates minimum milk prices in the FMMO system using survey data from dairy manufacturers. A \"make allowance\" is subtracted to account for processing costs, which some producers feel unfairly reduces minimum prices. Manufacturers argue the make allowance is necessary to reflect higher energy costs. Manufacturers argue that the fixed make allowance in the FMMO system can lead to artificially wide margins, impacting farm prices negatively. The primary cash market for dairy products is located at the CME, where cheese, butter, and nonfat dry milk are traded. Prices at this market influence wholesale price contracts nationwide, with adjustments for quality and transportation. Some dairy producer groups criticize the CME for being thinly traded and lacking transparency, impacting federal minimum prices set under the FMMO system. The CME spot cheese market is criticized for being thinly traded, lacking transparency, and creating a volatile market. The market is susceptible to manipulation due to a small number of trades and traders. However, industry participants are prepared to counteract any price manipulation by monitoring the market and trading when prices disconnect from supply and demand conditions. Some industry participants want to increase sales volume on the CME to reduce these issues. The dairy industry and policymakers are working to improve the dairy pricing system, with the CFTC and CME monitoring for price manipulation. In 2008, penalties were paid for attempting to manipulate milk futures prices. Hearings on dairy policy and pricing were held in 2009, and the USDA's Dairy Advisory Committee is reviewing farm milk price volatility to suggest solutions to the Secretary of Agriculture. The Dairy Advisory Committee is tasked with addressing price volatility in the dairy industry by proposing changes to the pricing system. Two approaches are being considered: supply control to stabilize prices or allowing market fluctuations and helping farmers manage price risk through hedging strategies. Various organizations are also exploring potential changes to federal dairy programs. Holstein Association USA has proposed a plan to stabilize farm milk prices with assessments on farmers who increase milk production. The National Farmers Union supports the plan, which aims to reduce price volatility and prevent severely depressed producer milk prices. Legislation has been introduced to apply import controls on specific dairy products to further stabilize the market. The Federal Milk Marketing Improvement Act of 2009 aims to stabilize the milk market and support dairy farmers by using the cost of milk production for pricing. It includes provisions for USDA to reduce prices to limit overproduction. Supporters argue for supply control to offset overproduction incentives, while critics fear it may harm competitiveness and innovation in the U.S. dairy industry. Critics argue that a pricing system based on supply control and/or cost of production could harm the competitiveness of the U.S. dairy industry, limit innovation, and raise consumer prices. The National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF) advocates for a market-based approach to address milk pricing issues, proposing a new dairy producer income insurance program and reforms to the federal milk marketing order system. The National Milk Producers Federation advocates for a market-based approach to address milk pricing issues, proposing a new dairy producer income insurance program and reforms to the federal milk marketing order system, including discontinuing the dairy product price support program. Proponents believe that managing price risks without limiting industry growth is key, while critics argue that supply management is necessary to prevent overproduction and ensure long-term financial health for producers. Some dairy producers believe that current policies encourage overproduction, leading to financial concerns. Congress may monitor dairy pricing due to the economic challenges faced by farmers in 2009. Efforts to address pricing issues may be influenced by market trends, with forecasts suggesting a potential upturn in milk prices by late 2009. If forecasts hold, policymakers and producers may find it challenging to make major policy changes while milk prices are rising. Further intervention could disrupt the favorable price situation. Discussions and policy proposals on dairy pricing may be ongoing in the 111th Congress or the next farm bill debate starting in 2011."
