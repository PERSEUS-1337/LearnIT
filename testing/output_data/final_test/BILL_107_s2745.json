The San Rafael Swell in Utah is a 900-square mile region dominated by the jagged San Rafael Reef. It is a wilderness castle with highlands fractured by uplift and erosion, featuring mesas, buttes, and canyons. The region holds important natural, historical, and cultural resources. The San Rafael Swell region in Utah contains exceptional backcountry recreation opportunities, habitat for Desert Bighorn Sheep, historical sites like the Old Spanish Trail and the Outlaw Trail, paleontological resources, and wilderness study areas. The State of Utah owns approximately 102,871 acres of land in this region. The San Rafael Swell region in Utah, administered by the Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration, consists of lands granted by Congress to the State of Utah for the benefit of public institutions. These lands are scattered among Federal lands in a checkerboard pattern. Development of resources on State trust lands in this area could conflict with wilderness preservation goals. The State of Utah owns land within the Manti-La Sal National Forest and Red Cliffs Desert Reserve, designated for conservation purposes. The United States owns lands in Utah that can be exchanged for State trust lands in the San Rafael Swell, Manti-La Sal forest, and Red Cliffs Desert Reserve without impacting Federal management goals. The Red Cliffs Desert Reserve poses challenges for land management in Utah and the United States. An agreement has been reached for the exchange of State trust lands in the San Rafael Swell and Manti-La Sal forest regions, aiming to simplify Federal land management and avoid administrative delays and expenses. The parties agreed to avoid identifying Federal assets for conveyance to the State if known or likely to have wilderness study areas, proposed wilderness designation, endangered species habitat, archaeological resources, critical environmental concerns, or other significant environmental issues. The agreement aims to resolve environmental conflicts in Utah's wild areas by exchanging State trust lands with the Federal Government, benefiting public schools and conservation resources. The agreement between the State of Utah and the United States involves exchanging State and Federal lands of approximately equal value to consolidate and protect lands with significant resources. The purpose of the Act is to enact this agreement into law to further the public interest. The Act ratifies the agreed exchange between Utah and the United States for consolidating and protecting lands with significant resources. The State of Utah, the Department of the Interior, and the Department of Agriculture have agreed to exchange Federal lands in Utah for lands managed by the Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration. The terms of the agreement are ratified and confirmed, setting forth obligations as a matter of Federal law. SEC. 4. CONVEYANCES.\n\nAll conveyances under sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Agreement must be completed within 70 days of this Act's enactment. Maps and legal descriptions of the lands involved must be available for public inspection. In case of any conflict, legal descriptions will take precedence.\n\nSEC. 5. MINERAL DEVELOPMENT. SEC. 5. MINERAL DEVELOPMENT.\n\nPayments received by the United States under the Agreement will be shared with the State of Utah as per the Mineral Leasing Act. Authorization is given for necessary funds to carry out the Act, including reducing amounts owed by the United States to the Trust Lands Administration. The United States and Utah will bear their own costs for implementing the Act."
