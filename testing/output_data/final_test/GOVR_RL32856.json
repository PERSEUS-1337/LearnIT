    "content": "The President signed the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for FY2006, providing $7.73 billion for the EPA with a 0.476% rescission. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act for FY2006 included a 1% government-wide rescission, reducing EPA's final appropriation. Despite the rescissions, the FY2006 EPA appropriation increased from the Administration's request but decreased from FY2005. Various programs and activities within EPA's funding were debated, including wastewater infrastructure and Superfund cleanup. The EPA's funding for wastewater infrastructure, hazardous waste cleanup, brownfields cleanup, homeland security activities, and earmarks was a significant issue. Another focus was on human dosing studies for pesticide exposure risks. The report explains funding methodology, EPA's history and mission, the President's FY2006 budget request, congressional appropriations, and funding levels for selected programs. The curr_chunk discusses FY2006 appropriations for the Environmental Protection Agency, including details on total funds available and adjustments for rescissions required by specific laws. The White House's Office of Management and Budget is responsible for applying these rescissions to agency budgets. The curr_chunk provides details on how funding amounts for the Environmental Protection Agency in FY2006 are adjusted based on various factors, including comparisons with previous funding levels, House and Senate amounts, the Administration's request, and appropriations enacted for FY2005. The funding amounts presented in the report have not been adjusted for inflation, and small increases above the previous year's funding may actually reflect a decrease when adjusted for inflation. The House Committee on Appropriations is the primary source of funding figures used in the report for FY2005 enacted amounts. The Nixon Administration established the EPA in 1970 in response to public concern about pollution, consolidating federal pollution control responsibilities. Annual appropriations fund EPA's responsibilities in regulating air and water quality. Funding figures for FY2005 and FY2006 are sourced from various sources including the Congressional Record and OMB's Budget of the U.S. Government. The EPA was established in 1970 to regulate air and water quality, manage hazardous wastes, and clean up environmental contamination. It awards grants to assist governments in controlling pollution to comply with federal laws. EPA's funding trends reflect statutory responsibilities enacted by Congress in response to environmental concerns. The EPA's annual appropriation has represented a small portion of the federal budget, growing from $1.0 billion in FY1970 to $8.4 billion in FY2004. President Bush's FY2006 budget request included $7.52 billion for EPA, $506 million less than FY2005. The request was divided among eight accounts, and EPA presented its budget request based on performance goals. The EPA's FY2006 budget justification was based on five goals: Clean Air and Global Climate Change, Clean and Safe Water, Land Preservation and Restoration, Healthy Communities and Ecosystems, and Compliance and Environmental Stewardship. The Administration used OMB's Performance Assessment Rating Tool (PART) to measure program performance, with 32 EPA programs rated. The largest proposed decrease in the President's initial request was for grants to states for wastewater infrastructure projects. A subsequent request was made to rescind $166 million from EPA's FY2006 appropriation for wastewater infrastructure projects. The President's FY2006 budget proposed a rescission of $166 million from EPA's appropriation for wastewater infrastructure projects funded through the clean water State Revolving Fund. This would have significantly reduced the increase provided by Congress for this purpose. Additionally, the budget did not include funding designated by Congress in FY2005 for individual projects, locations, or institutions within EPA's appropriations accounts. Congress later restored earmarked funding for many of these projects. In FY2006, Congress restored earmarked funding for various projects and designated new funding for others. The President's budget proposed decreases for some programs but included steady or increased funding for activities like cleanup of Superfund sites, brownfields, homeland security, and grant programs for scientific research. A subsequent request in October 2005 aimed to increase EPA's overall funds by $15 million, with $8 million reallocated for EPA's response to leaking underground tanks in hurricane-affected areas. In FY2006, Congress reorganized its subcommittees, leading to the elimination of the Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies subcommittee which historically funded EPA. EPA's funding was then placed under the Department of the Interior subcommittee. The House and Senate passed the FY2006 Interior bill, signed into law as P.L. 109-54 on August 2, 2005, which included funding for EPA. The final bill (P.L. 109-54) signed into law on August 2, 2005, provided $7.73 billion for EPA, with a 0.476% rescission. This amount was a compromise between the House's proposed $7.71 billion and the Senate's proposed $7.88 billion. Additionally, $80.0 million was rescinded from past fiscal year appropriations to offset and increase EPA's total appropriation to $7.81 billion. This amount was a net increase above the Administration's request but a decrease from the FY2005 appropriation. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act for FY2006 (H.R. 2863, H.Rept. 109-359) was passed by the 109th Congress with a government-wide rescission reducing funding for EPA and other agencies by 1%. The bill (P.L. 109-148) signed into law on December 30, 2005, reallocated $8 million in emergency funds to EPA for responding to leaking underground tanks in Gulf Coast states affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. This reallocation was part of a larger proposal to reallocate $17.1 billion among federal agencies. The 109th Congress passed the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for FY2006, reallocating $17.1 billion for disaster relief in Gulf Coast states. The Act did not include a $166 million rescission for EPA's clean water State Revolving Fund. The Administration had requested this rescission to offset the cost of disaster relief and control discretionary spending growth. The FY2006 budget resolution included $30.02 billion for the Natural Resource and Environment Function, with funding levels for EPA and other agencies determined in the appropriations process. EPA's FY2006 appropriation is allocated among eight line-item. In FY2006, EPA's appropriation was allocated among eight line-item accounts. The Science and Technology (S&T) account received $772.3 million before rescissions, with a transfer of $30.6 million from the Hazardous Substances Superfund account for research on cleanup of hazardous substances. The final appropriation was higher than the Senate's proposal but lower than the House amount, the Administration's request, and the FY2005 appropriation. The Science and Technology (S&T) account received $772.3 million in FY2006, with a transfer of $30.6 million from the Hazardous Substances Superfund account for research on cleanup of hazardous substances. The S&T account funds scientific research to support decisions on environmental pollution prevention and regulation, as well as advancing environmental sciences through various partnerships and activities. The congressional debate on funding for scientific research by EPA and federal agencies focuses on the use of \"sound science\" in policy development. P.L. 109-54 saw increases in some programs but decreases in others. The FY2006 request prioritized media programs like air and water quality, as well as cross-media research on risks to specific populations. The funding issues regarding scientific research and specific research activities administered by EPA are discussed in Section 201 of P.L. 109-54. The provision prohibits EPA from conducting or accepting human dosing studies for pesticides until relevant final rulemaking is issued, with a focus on protecting pregnant women, infants, and children. This provision reflects Senate-adopted amendments and principles of the Nuremberg Code. The provision in P.L. 109-54 prohibits EPA from conducting intentional human dosing studies for pesticides using FY2006 funds. There is significant interest in Congress regarding EPA's policies on human dosing studies, with some advocating for strict safeguards to protect participants' health. Some scientists and groups advocate for strict safeguards in human dosing studies to protect participants' health, while others argue for caution and further evaluation to ensure alternative approaches are exhausted. Congress has provided less earmarked funding for specific projects within EPA's FY2006 appropriation compared to FY2005. Prior to the two rescissions, EPA's FY2006 appropriation included $33.3 million in earmarked funding within the S&T account for \"Research/Congressional Priorities\". Congress earmarked nearly $66 million for specific projects within the S&T account for FY2005, awarded noncompetitively to designated recipients. The House had proposed $40 million, and the Senate had proposed $50 million for these projects. The FY2006 funding for EPA's homeland security activities is allocated within five of the eight EPA appropriations accounts, supporting various critical activities such as water infrastructure protection, laboratory preparedness, decontamination, and communication. The final bill identified individual projects, locations, or institutions to receive designated funds, allowing past recipients of earmarks to compete for these funds. P.L. 109-54 provided funding for EPA's homeland security activities in FY2006, with reductions compared to the President's request. The largest cut was for the Water Sentinel Initiative in the S&T account. The initiative received $9.0 million, lower than the requested $44.0 million. The scope of the initiative is unclear due to the significant funding reduction. The FY2006 funding for EPA's Water Sentinel Initiative was substantially reduced below the requested level, leading to uncertainty about the initiative's scope. The proposed pilot program in five major U.S. cities aimed to detect chemical and biological contaminants as potential terrorist threats to public drinking water systems. The House Appropriations Committee recommended that EPA clarify goals and milestones for the initiative and justify the program more clearly for FY2007. The EPA's implementation of Clean Air Act provisions and efforts to address climate change have sparked debate among stakeholders and Congress. Funding for scientific research on air quality standards and pollution controls is a key issue in the 109th Congress, with debates on ozone and particulate matter standards, mercury exposure reduction, and emissions control regulations for power plants and vehicles. The FY2006 EPA appropriation included $212.4 million for air quality activities, compared to $206.4 million in FY2005. Funding supports program implementation, research, and monitoring for air toxics, climate protection, and indoor air quality. P.L. 109-54 also provided funding for air quality activities in various accounts. The FY2006 EPA appropriation included funding for air quality activities, with a provision affecting pending EPA regulations on small engine emissions. The provision prohibits the use of FY2006 funds for these regulations until a safety study is completed. Existing state standards for small engines are not affected. The final appropriation for Environmental Programs and Management (EPM) was less than the House amount but more than the Senate's. The FY2006 EPA appropriation included funding for air quality activities, with a provision affecting pending EPA regulations on small engine emissions. The final appropriation for Environmental Programs and Management (EPM) was less than the House amount but more than the Senate and Administration had proposed. The EPM account represents roughly one-third of EPA's budget and funds regulatory, standard-setting, and enforcement efforts for various environmental programs. This account covers the development of environmental standards, monitoring pollution conditions, federal pollution control planning, technical assistance, and compliance assurance. The FY2006 EPA appropriation included funding for air quality activities, with a provision affecting pending EPA regulations on small engine emissions. P.L. 109-54 included a mix of increases and decreases within the EPM account compared to the President's FY2006 request and FY2005 appropriation. Congress made reductions below the President's request and FY2005 appropriation, while maintaining funding for some activities at or near FY2005 levels. Selected activities within the EPM account are discussed due to varying levels of interest in Congress. Prior to rescissions, $25.0 million was allocated for administrative expenses of the Brownfields Program in the EPM account. The EPM account for administrative expenses of the Brownfields Program received $25.0 million, the same as the Senate proposal. This program assists states and tribes in cleaning up contaminated sites for redevelopment. The EPM account only covers administrative costs, while cleanup grants come from a different account. The Environmental Education Program funding for FY2006 was reinstated by Congress despite the President's proposal to eliminate it. The program has been supported by state and local grants for elementary and secondary schools, with advocates citing its positive impact on education nationwide. The Environmental Education Program funding for FY2006 was reinstated by Congress, providing $313.5 million for air quality activities within the EPM account, an increase from the previous year's $298.3 million allocation. The President's FY2006 budget included $50 million in anticipated revenues for air quality activities, derived from changes to fees for pesticide registrations and toxic chemical notices. However, P.L. 109-54 and the House and Senate-passed bills did not include these revenues. Of the $50 million proposed, $46 million would come from pesticide registration fees and $4 million from notices for new chemicals. Congressional approval would have been required for the fee changes. The House Appropriations Committee criticized EPA for proposing pesticide fees in conflict with current authority. The fees were separate from those authorized under the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004. PRIA rescinded EPA's authority to collect certain pesticide registration fees, while P.L. 109-54 allowed the Administrator of EPA to collect pesticide registration service fees for FY2006. The House Appropriations Committee criticized EPA for proposing pesticide fees in conflict with current authority. PRIA rescinded EPA's authority to collect certain pesticide registration fees, while P.L. 109-54 allowed the Administrator of EPA to collect pesticide registration service fees for FY2006. In the 109th Congress, language in an FY2005 appropriations act banned EPA from collecting pesticide tolerance fees as rescinded by PRIA. The 108th Congress rejected the President's FY2005 budget proposal to reinstate pesticide fees. Earmarked funding in P.L. 109-54 provided less funding for individual projects, locations, or institutions compared to FY2005. Prior to the two rescissions, EPA's FY2006 appropriation included $50.5 million within the EPM account for \"Environmental Protection/Congressional Priorities\". The House had proposed $40 million, and the Senate had proposed $50 million. The FY2005 appropriation included $92.3 million for congressional priority projects. The President's FY2006 request did not include any funding for such projects. The conferees on H.R. 2361 did not agree to require competitive solicitations for projects within the EPM and Science and Technology accounts. The conferees designated funding for specific projects in the EPM account, including geographic/ecosystem programs addressing environmental and human health risks. Members of Congress are interested in funding and oversight of these programs, which involve collaboration among EPA, state/local governments, communities, and nonprofit organizations. Funding for Great Lakes restoration has been a focus, with P.L. 109-54 providing less than FY2006 request but more than FY2005 appropriation for cleanup of contaminated sediments. The funding provided for the cleanup of contaminated sediments in the Great Lakes under the Great Lakes Legacy Act of 2002 is aimed at addressing high concentrations of contaminants that pose risks to aquatic organisms, wildlife, and humans. Prior to the rescissions, $51.0 million was allocated for EPA's Office of Inspector General for FY2006. The House Appropriations Committee recommended that EPA develop a clear plan for implementing the Legacy Act to specify how funding would support future budget requests. The FY2005 appropriation included a transfer of $13.5 million from the Superfund account for investigative oversight. The Office of Inspector General audits and investigates EPA functions to identify deficiencies. $40.2 million was provided for the Buildings and Facilities account for FY2006. Congress appropriated $41.7 million for this purpose. Congress appropriated $41.7 million for FY2005 for repairs, improvements, and new construction projects. For FY2006, $1.26 billion was provided for the Superfund account, with transfers to Science and Technology and the Office of Inspector General. After transfers, $1.22 billion was allocated for the Superfund account. The Superfund program, established by CERCLA in 1980, aims to clean up hazardous waste sites. The Superfund account in EPA's budget funds efforts to remove immediate contamination risks and remediate potential exposure pathways. EPA enforces CERCLA and identifies sites on the National Priorities List. The Superfund program, established by CERCLA in 1980, aims to clean up hazardous waste sites. The Superfund account funds EPA's efforts to enforce CERCLA, require potentially responsible parties to remediate contamination, and pay for cleanup at private sector sites with no financially viable party. Concerns include funding adequacy, cleanup pace, and differing views on funding sufficiency for the program. The Superfund program aims to clean up hazardous waste sites. EPA reported a slower pace of cleanup in FY2006 compared to previous years. A study estimated $14-16 billion in funding needed from FY2000 to FY2009 for cleanup. The Superfund program requires significant funding for cleanup efforts, with annual expenditures projected at $1.5 billion through FY2006. Congress appropriated $1.26 billion for the Superfund account in FY2006, funded by general Treasury revenues due to expired dedicated taxes. Since FY2003, Superfund program funding has come from general Treasury revenues after remaining revenues were used up. Some Members want to bring back Superfund taxes, arguing that using general revenues goes against the \"polluter pays\" principle. Others believe financially viable parties still pay for cleanup, with EPA noting responsible parties clean up 70% of NPL sites. Brownfields cleanup funding shifted to State and Tribal Assistance Grants and Environmental Programs and Management accounts after FY2003. Prior to the rescissions, P.L. 109-54 provided $73.0 million for the Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Program account for FY2006, the same as proposed by the House, Senate, and Administration. Additionally, $8 million in emergency funds were reallocated to EPA for responding to leaking underground tanks in Gulf Coast states affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The LUST Trust Fund was established by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 to help cover costs of responding to releases from leaking underground storage tanks containing petroleum. The LUST Trust Fund, established in 1986, is used to implement the LUST program, oversee corrective actions, and recover funds for cleaning up abandoned tank sites. Despite a balance exceeding $2 billion, recent appropriations have been around $70 million. States are requesting more funds from the trust to address over 412,000 ongoing cleanups and 128,000 leaking tank sites needing remediation. Many state LUST programs are understaffed and underfunded. The LUST Trust Fund, established in 1986, is used to implement the LUST program and oversee corrective actions for cleaning up abandoned tank sites. States are requesting more funds from the trust to address over 412,000 ongoing cleanups and 128,000 leaking tank sites needing remediation. The presence of MTBE at many LUST sites is increasing the cost and complexity of cleaning up these sites. EPA responds to spills on land from leaking pipelines, accidents in transport, or other events, with approximately 300 oil spills annually. EPA's Oil Spill Response account received $15.9 million for FY2006, similar to previous years. EPA is reimbursed for site-specific response expenses. The EPA responds to approximately 300 oil spills annually and is reimbursed for site-specific response expenses from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. Prior to the rescissions, P.L. 109-54 provided funding for the State and Tribal Assistance Grants account for FY2006. Congress appropriated $3.58 billion for FY2005. P.L. 109-54 also rescinded $80 million from past fiscal year appropriations for grants, contracts, and interagency agreements. The House and Senate proposed provisions for rescinding past year appropriations, differing from the conference agreement. Unlike the House-passed bill, neither P.L. 109-54 nor the conference report specified the activities for redirecting $80 million in rescinded past year appropriations in FY2006. The House bill had specified using $100 million for the clean water State Revolving Fund, while the Senate bill included $58 million within the STAG account without specifying the allocation in EPA's FY2006 budget. The STAG account historically represents a large portion of EPA's annual budget, comprising about 40% of the total. Most of the funding is for SRFs for water infrastructure projects, with separate funds for clean water and drinking water projects. Clean water SRF supports wastewater infrastructure, while drinking water SRF funds drinking water treatment facilities. The account also funds other water infrastructure grants, pollution control activities, brownfields cleanup, and clean school buses. The STAG account is a significant part of EPA's budget, mainly for SRFs for water infrastructure projects. It includes funding for clean water and drinking water projects, as well as grants for pollution control activities, brownfields cleanup, and clean school buses. Funding issues for the clean water and drinking water SRFs are discussed, with Congress appropriating $900 million for clean water and $850 million for drinking water in FY2006. The Administration's request to redirect $100 million in unobligated balances from past EPA appropriations was not approved by Congress. Additionally, Congress did not approve the Administration's request to rescind $166 million from the FY2006 appropriation for the clean water SRF. Funding levels for both SRFs have been contentious, with Congress appropriating more than the Administration's requests for the clean water SRF. There has been less disagreement on funding levels for the drinking water SRF. Some Members have advocated for substantial increases for both SRFs. Some Members have advocated for substantial increases in funding for the clean water State Revolving Funds (SRFs) to address local water infrastructure needs and comply with new drinking water contaminant standards. Amendments to increase funding by $500 million and $100 million were rejected during House debates on H.R. 2361. A motion to provide an additional $242 million for the clean water SRF was not agreed upon. An amendment to modify the distribution formula for SRF funds in the Senate was withdrawn. The Senate agreed to a floor amendment recommending $1.35 billion for the clean water State Revolving Fund (SRF) in FY2006, but it was not included in the final budget resolution. H.R. 2361 would have provided $1.1 billion for the clean water SRF. EPA estimates future water infrastructure needs at $181 billion for wastewater treatment facilities and $277 billion for public drinking water systems over 20 years. Some groups project higher funding needs than EPA. The Water Infrastructure Network (WIN) estimated total wastewater and drinking water capital needs to be $940 billion over the next 20 years. WIN foresees a $23 billion per year funding gap between needs and current spending, with $12 billion for wastewater and $11 billion for drinking water. Funding debates include whether to earmark funds for specific communities or provide competitively through the SRFs. P.L. 109-54 included provisions within the STAG account limiting the amount of grants earmarked for water infrastructure to 55% of a project's total cost, requiring a 45% match from the recipient. EPA could waive the matching funds requirement in certain circumstances. The debate continues on whether communities should receive SRF loan funds or grant assistance for water infrastructure projects. Prior to the two rescissions, P.L. 109-54 provided $200 million in earmarked funding for FY2006 within the STAG account for water infrastructure grants. The projects included wastewater, drinking water, and storm water infrastructure projects in specific locations. Congress earmarked $309.5 million for similar projects in FY2005. The President's FY2006 budget did not include funding for these projects. The House Appropriations Committee did not allocate the $200 million among specific community projects in their version of the FY2006 Interior bill. The House and Senate committees allocated $200 million in earmarked funding for water infrastructure projects in the final bill. The funds were distributed among 257 recipients identified in the conference report, including specific projects in three geographic-specific areas. The Administration had requested additional funding for these grants, with $50 million designated for wastewater projects along the U.S./Mexico border and $35 million for projects in Alaska Native Villages. The House and Senate allocated $200 million for water infrastructure projects, including $35 million for construction in Alaska Native Villages. The FY2006 appropriation for wastewater and drinking water facilities in Alaska Native Villages was less than the FY2005 amount. No funding was provided for drinking water improvements in San Juan, Puerto Rico. EPA categorical funds support various activities within media programs. Grant funding distributed through multiple grants to support activities in a media program for environmental laws implementation. EPA's FY2006 budget justification outlined 23 categorical grant programs in six sub-categories. Grants include support for air quality monitoring, water quality implementation, hazardous waste management, and multimedia projects. The EPA's FY2006 budget included grant funding for various environmental programs such as air quality monitoring, water quality grants, hazardous waste management, pesticide enforcement, and pollution prevention grants. The proposed State and Tribal Performance Fund aimed to support \"results-oriented\" environmental protection work by helping states and tribes measure and improve the results of their programs. The Administration proposed funding for a new grant program in its FY2005 budget request, but Congress did not appropriate any funding for it. P.L. 109-54 provided $165.0 million for EPA's Brownfields Program in FY2006, the same as the Senate amount but less than the House and Administration proposals. This program assists in cleaning up abandoned commercial and industrial sites, funded within the STAG account for grants to states and tribes. EPA's program administration expenses are funded within the Environmental Programs and Management account. Table 17 shows funding for the Brownfields program, previously funded through the Superfund account until FY2003. Grants for economic redevelopment of brownfields are awarded by the Department of Housing and Urban Development after cleanup. P.L. 109-54 expanded eligibility for grants or loans to include those who purchased property before the Brownfield Revitalization Act of 2001. This provision only applied to FY2006 and did not provide permanent authority. P.L. 109-54 did not provide permanent authority for the use of brownfields site characterization and assessment grants for administrative expenses. It allocated $7.0 million for FY2006 within the STAG account for Clean School Bus Initiative grants, with the House proposing $10 million and the Senate proposing $1 million. Despite the relatively small funding compared to other programs, there is strong interest in grants to retrofit or replace older diesel buses. The EPA received over 120 proposals seeking $60 million in grants for retrofitting or replacing older diesel buses. Despite the high demand, funding appropriations were limited, with Congress providing less than requested for FY2005 and the Administration reducing its request for FY2006. In FY2006, P.L. 109-54 allocated more funding for EPA than requested by the Administration but less than the previous fiscal year. The State and Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG) received the largest portion of the appropriation, with debates focusing on funding adequacy. The contentious issue was the Administration's proposal to reduce funding for the clean water state revolving fund (SRF) within the STAG account. Despite a $170 million increase above the request, the clean water SRF received $900 million, a decrease from the FY2005 appropriation of $1.09 billion. In FY2006, P.L. 109-54 allocated more funding for EPA than requested by the Administration but less than the previous fiscal year. The House proposed $850 million for the clean water SRF, with $100 million rescinded from prior year appropriations. The Senate proposed $1.1 billion, slightly above the FY2005 level. Congress debated earmarking funds for individual projects, with P.L. 109-54 providing less funding for congressional priorities than in FY2005. In FY2006, P.L. 109-54 allocated more funding for EPA than requested by the Administration but less than the previous fiscal year. Congress debated earmarking funds for individual projects, with P.L. 109-54 providing less funding for congressional priorities than in FY2005. The House Appropriations Committee proposed awarding funds competitively among past recipients in certain accounts, but this approach was not adopted in the final bill. The adequacy of funding for the Superfund program to clean up hazardous waste sites remained a prominent issue, with some questioning whether the increase in funding was sufficient. Funding for Superfund cleanup activities is a contentious issue in Congress, with the program now supported by general Treasury revenues. Some Members advocate for reinstating taxes on industry to support the trust fund, while others argue that individual polluters should continue to pay for cleanups. Several bills to reinstate Superfund taxes were introduced in the 109th Congress but did not progress. P.L. 109-54 continued the use of general Treasury revenues to support the program. P.L. 109-54 continued the use of general Treasury revenues to support the Superfund program in FY2006. EPA's consideration of intentional human dosing studies for determining human health risks of pesticides was of interest to Members during the appropriations debate. Provisions in P.L. 109-54 directed EPA to complete relevant rulemaking and banned the use of FY2006 funds for human dosing studies until a final rule is issued. In FY2006, EPA's funding was affected by competing priorities of Congress, leading to a reorganization shifting its funding jurisdiction to the Interior subcommittees from the VA-HUD and Independent Agencies subcommittee."
