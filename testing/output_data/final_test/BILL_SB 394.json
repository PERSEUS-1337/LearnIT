    "title": "SB 394",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 23663 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to allow taxpayers to assign eligible credits to eligible assignees, who can then apply the credit against their tax liability. An affiliated corporation is defined as a member of a commonly controlled group. The amended Section 23663 of the Revenue and Taxation Code allows taxpayers to assign eligible credits to affiliated corporations, known as eligible assignees, who can use the credits to offset their tax liability. Eligible credits include those earned after July 1, 2008, or carried forward from before that date. The amended Section 23663 of the Revenue and Taxation Code allows taxpayers to assign eligible credits to affiliated corporations, known as eligible assignees. The election to assign any credit shall be irrevocable once made and must be done on the original tax return. The assigned credit cannot be used by the assigning taxpayer or carried over in future years. The eligible assignee of any credit under this section may apply the assigned credits against their tax for the taxable year or subsequent years, without selling or transferring the credit to another taxpayer. No consideration is required for the assignment, and if any consideration is paid, no deduction is allowed for the amount paid. The Franchise Tax Board specifies the form and manner for making the election to assign credits, along with necessary information. Taxpayers must report information to substantiate and verify the assignment and application of any assigned credit. The Franchise Tax Board may issue regulations to implement the assignment of credits, including specifying the treatment of non-compliant assignments. Taxpayers and eligible assignees are jointly liable for any tax consequences resulting from the disallowance of assigned credits. The Franchise Tax Board has the authority to audit taxpayers who assign eligible credits. A report on the effects of the section, including credit usage, business activity impact, tax revenue loss, and focus on research and development, economic incentive areas, and low-income housing credits, must be submitted by June 30, 2013."
