    "content": "Award of Purple Heart to members of the Armed Forces killed or wounded in terrorist attacks within the United States. Congress recognizes the ideology behind terrorism, as highlighted in the 9/11 Commission Report. This ideology can influence individuals in the US to carry out attacks, as seen in incidents at a recruiting station in Little Rock and Fort Hood. Investigative reports from House and Senate committees support these findings. Since September 11, 2001, at least 33 threats, plots, and strikes related to domestic terrorism against US military communities have been uncovered. These incidents show that members of the Armed Forces are at risk of terrorist attacks both overseas and within the United States. The Department of Defense has issued revised regulations, such as Army Regulation 381-12, to address the threat of terrorist attacks, including those carried out by members of the Armed Forces. Since September 11, 2001, there have been numerous threats, plots, and attacks related to domestic terrorism against US military communities. The Department of Defense has revised regulations to address this threat, including when members of the Armed Forces advocate unlawful violence for political, religious, or ideological goals. It is recommended that the Secretary of Defense honor those killed or wounded in terrorist attacks inspired by the ideology defined in the 9/11 Commission Report. Additionally, a new section is added to award the Purple Heart to members killed or wounded by terrorists. New section: Sec. 1129a. Purple Heart awarded to members killed or wounded in terrorist attacks within the United States.

The Intelligence Threat Awareness and Reporting Program defines a terrorist attack as the use of violence to instill fear for political, religious, or ideological goals. The Secretary concerned will not differentiate between international and domestic terrorism. If victims of a terrorist attack are from multiple armed forces, the determination will be made jointly by the Secretaries of the armed forces. This section does not apply to armed forces members whose death or injury is due to willful misconduct. The section clarifies that armed forces members who die or are injured due to willful misconduct are not covered. It also states that the designation of individuals involved in attacks as enemy combatants and legal proceedings related to such attacks are not affected.
