A single model is presented that performs well on multiple tasks across different domains. The model incorporates convolutional layers, an attention mechanism, and sparsely-gated layers, with each block being crucial for specific tasks. Adding these blocks, even if not essential, improves performance on all tasks. The model presented performs well on multiple tasks across different domains by incorporating convolutional layers, an attention mechanism, and sparsely-gated layers. Tasks with less data benefit largely from joint training with other tasks, while performance on large tasks degrades. Recent successes of deep neural networks have shown their effectiveness in various domains such as computer vision and speech recognition. While convolutional networks excel in vision-related tasks and recurrent neural networks perform well in natural language processing, the need to design and tune networks for specific tasks limits the impact of deep learning. The question arises: Can a unified deep learning model be created to solve tasks across multiple domains? This idea has been explored in the deep learning literature, with natural language processing models benefiting from a multi-task approach. In recent years, deep neural networks have shown success in various domains like computer vision and speech recognition. Natural language processing models have benefited from a multi-task approach. Multi-task machine translation models have exhibited zero-shot learning when trained on multiple languages. Speech recognition and vision problems have also shown improvements with multi-task training. However, a competitive multi-task multi-modal model has not been proposed yet. The MultiModel architecture is introduced as a single deep-learning model that can learn multiple tasks from various domains simultaneously. It is trained on 8 different corpora for tasks such as speech recognition, image classification, image captioning, and constituency parsing. The model achieves good performance across these tasks, although it is not currently state-of-the-art. The MultiModel architecture can perform various tasks like image captioning, categorization, and translation. It uses modality nets to convert inputs into a unified representation space for different data types. The MultiModel architecture utilizes modality nets to convert inputs into a variable-size unified representation space, promoting heavy feature extraction. Different tasks within the same domain share modality nets to encourage generalization and allow for the addition of new tasks seamlessly. The MultiModel architecture incorporates various computational blocks from different domains, such as depthwise separable convolutions, attention mechanism, and sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts layers. These blocks were introduced in different papers and have not been studied across domains before. Each mechanism is crucial for the specific domain it was introduced in. The MultiModel architecture incorporates computational blocks like convolutions, attention layers, and mixture-of-experts. These components are crucial for specific domains and have been shown to improve performance even in tasks they were not originally designed for. The model consists of modality-nets, an encoder, I/O mixer, and a decoder, utilizing these key computational blocks for good performance across different problems. The MultiModel architecture utilizes computational blocks such as convolutions, attention layers, and mixture-of-experts to enhance performance. The model includes modality-nets, an encoder, I/O mixer, and a decoder, with a focus on efficient depthwise separable convolutions for local computation. The MultiModel architecture incorporates efficient depthwise separable convolutions for local computation. These convolutions consist of a ReLU activation, followed by a SepConv, and layer normalization. The convolutional steps are defined as a combination of these components. The convolutional steps in the architecture involve stacking blocks with residual connections and skip-connections. The blocks consist of convolutional layers with different kernel sizes and dropout. For attention, a multi-head dot-product mechanism is used with two tensors for source and target inputs, along with timing signals and convolutional blocks. The target tensor is composed with a timing signal and processed through convolutional blocks. It undergoes self-attention using a multi-head dot-product mechanism with timing signals allowing content-based attention based on position. Sine and cosine curves are concatenated to create timing signals. The source tensor is further processed with pointwise convolutions to generate memory keys and values. The attention mechanism is applied between the self-attended target and the source. The architecture includes sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts layers similar to those introduced previously. The MultiModel architecture includes a mixture-of-experts layer with a trainable gating network to select experts for processing inputs. During training, 4 experts are selected from a pool of 240 when training on 8 problems jointly, and 60 experts when training on each problem separately. The model consists of an encoder, mixer, and decoder for processing inputs and generating outputs. The MultiModel architecture includes an encoder, mixer, and decoder with convolutional blocks and attention mechanisms. The model is designed to be autoregressive, with padded convolutions in the mixer and decoder to prevent access to future information. This allows for the establishment of long-term dependencies and large receptive fields over inputs and past outputs. The MultiModel architecture includes a decoder that starts decoding with a command-token for different tasks. There are 4 modality nets for language, images, audio, and categorical data. Cross-entropy loss is used for predictions, with language data tokenized using 8k subword-units. The language input modality maps a sequence of tokens to the correct dimensionality, while the output modality performs a linear mapping followed by a Softmax. The MultiModel architecture includes a decoder for different tasks with 4 modality nets. The input modality maps tokens to correct dimensionality, while the output modality performs linear mapping followed by Softmax. Image input modality deepens feature depth using ConvRes blocks. Audio input is accepted as 1D waveform or 2D spectrogram. GlobalAvgPool calculates mean across spatial and temporal dimensions. The MultiModel architecture utilizes a stack of 8 ConvRes blocks for both waveform and spectral input modalities. The spectral modality maintains full resolution in the spectral domain without striding. Training on a batch of data from any of the 8 tasks activates the corresponding sub-network, updating parameters accordingly. Distributed training was used for multi-task runs, with separate workers training on each task while shared parameters were updated on a parameter server.

The MultiModel architecture, trained on 8 tasks simultaneously, aims to compare its performance with state-of-the-art results. Results show similarity to task-specific models without heavy tuning. Comparison between jointly trained MultiModel and separately trained models on single tasks reveals similar performance on large tasks and better performance on tasks with less data. Notable improvement is seen in parsing tasks due to the abundance of text data in translation. The MultiModel architecture, trained on 8 tasks simultaneously, shows significant performance improvements even when trained with seemingly unrelated tasks like ImageNet. The shared computational primitives between tasks allow for transfer learning. Results in Table 3 demonstrate the impact on parsing tasks, with notable improvements in log-perplexity, per-token accuracy, and fully correct parse trees. Training without mixture-of-experts layers or attention mechanism also influences performance on different problems. The attention mechanism and mixture-of-experts layers influence performance on various tasks, including English-French translation and ImageNet. Removing these blocks may improve performance on ImageNet alone, but results show they either have no effect or slightly improve performance. Mixing different computation blocks is a good way to enhance performance on multiple tasks."
