This method allows agents to adapt to new environments by learning robust features. The approach outperforms other regularization and data augmentation methods in tasks such as 2D CoinRun, 3D DeepMind Lab exploration, and 3D robotics control. Deep reinforcement learning has been applied to various applications like board games, video games, and robotics control tasks. However, deep RL agents often struggle to generalize to new environments, leading to overfitting and unreliable performance in applications like healthcare. RL agents lack generalization ability in applications like health care and finance. Generalization can be characterized by visual changes, different dynamics, and various structures. This paper focuses on generalization across tasks where agents encounter unseen visual patterns at test time. RL agents fail due to small visual changes, making it challenging to learn generalizable representations from high-dimensional input observations like images. Strategies to improve generalization include regularization and data augmentation. The paper proposes a simple randomization technique to enhance generalization ability in training deep RL agents across tasks with unseen visual patterns. This method aims to improve performance without the need for a physics simulator, unlike previous approaches that relied on simulator-based training. The paper introduces a randomization technique to train RL agents on tasks with unseen visual patterns, aiming to improve generalization without a physics simulator. By utilizing random networks to generate inputs and re-initializing parameters at each iteration, agents learn more invariant features. An inference technique based on Monte Carlo approximation stabilizes performance by reducing variance during testing. The proposed method aims to improve generalization in RL agents by training them on tasks with unseen visual patterns. It reduces the generalization gap in unseen environments compared to conventional techniques like data augmentation. Our method improves success rates in various tasks such as 2D CoinRun, 3D DeepMind Lab, and Surreal robotics control. It can be influential in studying different dynamics and solving real-world problems like sim-to-real transfer. Generalization in deep RL has been explored through methods like splitting training and test environments and using distinct sets of levels in video games. Regularization is a key direction to enhance generalization ability in deep RL algorithms. Regularization methods improve generalization performance of RL agents in Atari and CoinRun environments. Data augmentation techniques also enhance generalization, with domain randomization and cutout methods being proposed. Combining these methods can further improve generalization. Random networks have been used in deep RL for various purposes, such as defining intrinsic rewards for unexplored states. In deep reinforcement learning, random networks are used to improve generalization ability of agents by predicting rewards from unexplored states. Unlike transfer learning in supervised learning, fine-tuning pre-trained models for target tasks is not beneficial in deep RL. In deep reinforcement learning, fine-tuning pre-trained models for target tasks is not beneficial. Gamrian & Goldberg (2019) proposed a domain transfer method using generative adversarial networks, while Farebrother et al. (2018) used regularization techniques to improve fine-tuning methods. Higgins et al. (2017) introduced a multi-stage RL approach to extract disentangled representations and train agents on them. This study focuses on zero-shot performance of agents at test time without further parameter fine-tuning. In deep reinforcement learning, the return R t is the total rewards accumulated with a discount factor \u03b3. A random network f with parameters \u03c6 is introduced to train agents with randomized inputs. The policy network \u03c0 is optimized using policy gradient with past transitions D. By re-initializing \u03c6 per iteration, agents are trained with varied observations. In deep reinforcement learning, agents are trained to adapt to new environments by learning invariant representations through feature matching loss. The total loss includes a hyper-parameter \u03b2, and the procedure is summarized in Algorithm 1. Results on a dogs vs. cats dataset show classification accuracy, with the best result highlighted in bold. Samples of visual patterns are generated with the same semantics but randomized networks. The study proposes using a single-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) as a random network with reinitialized parameters using a mixture of distributions. Clean inputs are used with a certain probability to avoid complicating training, and the Xavier normal distribution is employed. The Xavier normal distribution is used for randomization to stabilize training and remove visual bias in an image classification experiment. ResNet-18 does not generalize effectively due to overfitting to an undesirable bias. Several image processing methods such as grayout, cutout, inversion, and color jitter can be applied to address the issue of overfitting and undesirable bias in training data. These methods are not as effective in improving generalization ability compared to the approach proposed by the authors. Their method aims to make deep neural networks capture more desired and meaningful information while maintaining semantic information without requiring additional information to eliminate bias. The approach is mainly focused on reinforcement learning applications but can also be explored in other directions. The authors propose a method to improve generalization ability in deep neural networks by addressing bias without requiring additional information. Their approach focuses on reinforcement learning applications but can be explored in other directions. The method involves training stochastic models using Monte Carlo approximation and generating random inputs to aggregate decisions, resulting in improved performance of trained agents. In this section, the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on various tasks such as 2D CoinRun, 3D DeepMind Lab exploration, and 3D robotics control. They evaluate the generalization ability of trained agents in unseen environments with different backgrounds, objects, and floors. The experimental setups and results are provided in the Appendix. The agents are trained using the CNN architecture from IMPALA and the Proximal Policy Optimization method. Agents receive an observation frame of size 64x64 at each timestep. Agents receive a 64x64 observation frame at each timestep, and trajectories are collected using a 256-step rollout for training. A hybrid CNN and LSTM architecture is used for the policy network, and a distributed version of PPO is employed for training. The proposed method, PPO + ours, incorporates random networks and feature matching loss. Performance is measured in unseen environments every 10M timesteps, with comparisons to regularization and data augmentation methods such as dropout and L2 regularization. In regularization methods, dropout, L2 regularization, and batch normalization are compared using hyperparameters suggested in previous studies. Various data augmentation methods are also considered. The proposed method incorporates random networks and feature matching loss, with performance measured in unseen environments. The task involves an agent collecting coins in CoinRun within a limited timeframe. The environment consists of various levels with different themes and obstacles. Success rates are measured by the number of collected coins divided by the number of played levels. In an ablation study on small-scale environments, agents were trained on one level for 100M timesteps and tested in unseen environments with background style changes. Baseline agents failed to generalize, showing that regularization techniques had little impact. Data augmentation techniques slightly improved performance, but a proposed method that produces diverse novelty in attributes and entities was most effective. Training with randomized inputs could degrade performance. The study explores the effectiveness of training RL agents with diverse novelty in attributes and entities. Visualization of hidden representations shows that the method enables agents to learn invariant and robust representations, leading to aligned trajectories in seen and unseen environments. The quality of hidden representation is also quantitatively evaluated using cycle-consistency. The study evaluates the cycle-consistency of trajectories in hidden space to ensure accurate alignment. Three-way cycle-consistency is also measured to assess alignment along different paths. The method enables agents to learn robust representations, leading to aligned trajectories in seen and unseen environments. The study evaluates cycle-consistency of trajectories in hidden space for accurate alignment. Activation maps show agents focusing on essential objects in seen environments. Our agent outperforms vanilla PPO in maintaining focus in unseen environments. Entropy of normalized activation maps is used as a quantitative metric. The entropy of activation maps quantitatively measures an agent's focus on salient components in its observation. Results show that our agent maintains low entropy in both seen and unseen environments, while the vanilla PPO agent only does so in seen environments. Generalization ability is evaluated on a fixed set of 500 levels of CoinRun, with half of the themes used for training. Our method outperforms baseline methods on 1,000 different levels with unseen themes, improving success rates significantly. Results on DeepMind Lab also show the effectiveness of our approach in a 3D game environment. The agent in the experiment collects goal objects to earn rewards within 90 seconds. It receives ten points for each goal object collected and is then placed in a random location. The agent is trained on a fixed map layout but tested in unseen environments with different wall and floor styles. Results show that while baseline agents perform well in familiar environments, they struggle to adapt to new environments. The agent trained by the proposed method excels in both seen and unseen environments, showcasing its ability to learn generalizable representations from complex 3D input observations. Results from the Surreal robotics control task demonstrate significant performance gains in unseen environments while maintaining performance in seen environments. Our method maintains essential structural spatial features of input observations and outperforms baseline agents trained with more diverse environments. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in learning generalizable representations compared to simply increasing the number of seen environments. In reinforcement learning, our method proposes randomizing the first layer of CNN to improve generalization by perturbing low-level features. This encourages agents to learn invariant and robust representations, beneficial for adversarial defense, sim-to-real transfer, transfer learning, and online adaptation. Further discussions on dynamics generalization and failure cases are provided in the appendices. The proposed method aims to enhance the robustness of DNN-based policies against adversarial attacks by training agents with randomly perturbed inputs. This approach is expected to improve defense mechanisms against adversarial perturbations, as agents learn to adapt to perturbations in their environment. The proposed method enhances DNN-based policies' robustness to adversarial attacks by training agents with randomly perturbed inputs. Results show improved defense against FGSM attacks with \u03b5 = 0.01, indicating more robust hidden representations. Additionally, visual aids in the form of painted boxes help agents learn optimal actions without needing to memorize previous states, enabling effective performance with a simple CNN-based policy. In this section, various image preprocessing methods are compared for data augmentation in computer vision tasks. These methods include cutout, grayout, inversion, and color jitter, each with specific characteristics to enhance the input images. The parameters for these methods are randomized and fixed within each episode to ensure consistent preprocessing. In this section, random networks are applied at various locations in the network architecture to measure performance in large-scale CoinRun without feature matching loss. Placing random networks in higher layers decreases performance in unseen environments, while placing them in residual connections improves generalization. However, randomizing only local features at the beginning of the network is more effective for generalization. Small-scale CoinRun environments with fixed map layouts are also considered for performance measurement. In a large-scale CoinRun experiment, agents are trained on a fixed set of 500 levels using half of the available themes and tested on 1,000 levels with unseen themes. The dataset consists of 25,000 images of dogs and cats categorized by color as bright or dark for training and testing.

ResNet-18 is trained with specific hyperparameters and evaluated in the Block Lifting task using the Surreal distributed RL framework. The method avoids using pre-trained ResNet-18 with ImageNet to prevent inductive bias. In the Block Lifting task using the Surreal distributed RL framework, the Sawyer robot lifts a block on a table to receive a reward. A hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture is used as the policy network, and a distributed version of PPO is employed to train the agents. Agents take observation frames with proprioceptive features and output mean and log standard deviation for actions. They are trained on one environment and tested on five unseen environments with different styles of table, floor, and block. In the Surreal robot manipulation experiment, the vanilla PPO agent is trained on 25 environments with different styles of tables and boxes. An extension to generalization on domains with different dynamics is considered, similar to dynamics randomization. An experiment is conducted on CartPole and Hopper environments where an agent takes proprioceptive features. The goal of CartPole is to prevent the pole from falling over, while Hopper aims to make a one-legged robot hop forward as fast as possible. A random layer is introduced between the input for dynamics generalization. In the Surreal robot manipulation experiment, a random layer is introduced between the input for dynamics generalization. A method is applied to randomize visual inputs by introducing a random layer between the input and the model. The convolution operation is performed by multiplying a diagonal matrix to d-dimensional input states. The matrix elements are sampled from a standard uniform distribution. This randomization method improves agent performance in unseen environments while maintaining intrinsic information. Training is done using the Schulman et al. (2015) method, with varying mass in the training and testing environments. In this section, the proposed method is tested for color-conditioned RL tasks, such as collecting good objects and avoiding bad objects with the same shape but different colors. The method shows potential success in distinguishing objects based on other environmental factors, like shape, in a modified CoinRun environment. The proposed method is tested for color-conditioned RL tasks, such as collecting good objects and avoiding bad objects. It shows potential success in distinguishing objects based on other environmental factors, like shape, in a modified CoinRun environment. The method achieves significant performance gains compared to vanilla PPO agents in unseen environments. The proposed method for color-conditioned RL tasks maintains the structure of input observations, handles extreme cases by adjusting clean sample fractions, and generalizes well across low-level transformations. The best performance is achieved with a 0.1 fraction of clean samples on large-scale CoinRun."
