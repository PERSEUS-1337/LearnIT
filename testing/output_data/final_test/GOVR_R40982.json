The bills focus on green jobs training and worker assistance for those affected by climate change mitigation measures. The U.S. House and Senate have introduced bills addressing greenhouse gas emissions and climate change impacts, focusing on green jobs training and worker assistance for those affected. The provisions in S. 1733 aim to reduce GHG emissions by curbing fossil fuel use and implementing an economic \"price\" on high-carbon fuels to promote cleaner energy alternatives. This could impact manufacturing competitiveness and enterprise profitability. The legislative provisions in S. 1733 and H.R. 2454 aim to assist in the development of green jobs training programs and provide employment retraining and financial assistance for workers affected by climate change mitigation requirements. The bills focus on green jobs training programs and a new government program to assist workers impacted by climate change. Grants are awarded to partnerships for programs in clean energy, renewable energy, energy efficiency, climate change mitigation, and adaptation. An internet-based clearinghouse will be established to aid career and technical education in renewable energy by collecting information on technological changes, best practices in training, and education. The Secretary will solicit expertise from the renewable energy industry, higher education institutions, and training programs. Separate sections will focus on solar and wind energy. A \"Green Construction Careers\" demonstration project will be established within 180 days to promote middle-class careers in the green construction sector. The Secretaries of Education, Energy, and Labor will evaluate the projects after three years to identify further successful projects. The Government Accountability Office will report on projects to Congress. A petition for eligibility for adjustment assistance can be filed by various parties with the Secretary of Labor and the governor of the state where the workers are located. The Secretary will investigate to determine eligibility. The governor ensures rapid response activities and core services are available to workers affected by Clean Air Act requirements. Eligible workers are in energy-related industries or those impacted by the shift to renewable energy sources. The Secretary determines eligibility based on job loss and decreased sales due to CAA requirements. The Secretary determines eligibility for assistance under Title VII of CAA for workers affected by the shift from fossil fuels to renewables or other adverse impacts. Information collection is authorized to verify applications, with confidentiality protection. Eligibility determination is due within 40 days of petition filing. Climate change adjustment assistance payments are made to certified, eligible workers for any week of unemployment after certification, with conditions such as separation circumstances and previous employment length. Workers cannot receive other unemployment insurance while receiving assistance. Enrollment in a training program is required unless waived for specific reasons like having current marketable skills or being close to a work recall. Climate change adjustment payments are provided to eligible workers who meet certain criteria, such as having current marketable skills, being close to retirement, or having health issues that prevent participation in a training program. The payments are 70% of the average weekly wage, up to a maximum of 156 weeks. Workers also receive employment services like skills testing, career counseling, job listings, and information on support services. Training approval is determined by the Secretary. The Secretary determines training approval for eligible workers based on the availability of suitable employment and reasonable expectation of future job opportunities. States receive funds for administrative costs and employment services training. A one-time reimbursement of up to $1,500 for job search expenses is provided to workers who have completed the training program. Relocation assistance is also available for eligible workers unable to find suitable employment in their commuting areas. The worker must have a bona fide job offer in the relocation area to receive assistance. Health insurance coverage will continue with 80% of the premium paid. The Secretary can make agreements with states for data reporting. Adversely affected workers cannot receive other unemployment benefits. Eligibility for benefits can only be reviewed under state laws. The Secretary may waive sections of the law to ensure Armed Forces reserve members on duty are eligible for climate change assistance. A study on older workers' circumstances is required. Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Worker Training is covered in Section 208. An \"Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Worker Training Fund\" will be established in the U.S. Treasury, funded by auction proceeds from emission allowances. A separate account called the \"Worker Transition Fund\" will receive proceeds from emissions auctions to support Part 2 of Subtitle A of Title III of Division A. The Chairman's Mark includes a correction in definition (10) related to industries dependent upon certain factors. The Chairman's Mark includes corrections to definitions related to industries dependent upon certain factors and adds citations for the Railroad Insurance Act. Differences between the House and Senate bills are summarized, with no significant material differences noted. A Change Worker Assistance Fund is proposed in Title VII of the Clean Air Act, with differences between the Senate and House versions regarding the allocation of proceeds from allowance auctions. The House version adds $25 million to the Energy Worker Training Program and establishes a separate fund for worker training in energy efficiency and renewable energy. The Department of Energy's Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability will use $500 million from Title VIII of ARRA for worker training in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Both the House and Senate bills aim to provide employment retraining for green jobs and financial assistance for workers affected by climate change mitigation. The funding source for the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Worker Training Fund is not clearly defined in either bill. The term \"Green Jobs\" is being defined by the Labor Department, relating to renewable energy and energy efficiency. The extent to which these jobs will be exclusive to these areas is debated, with skills potentially transferable to other job classifications. The legislation focuses on assisting workers impacted by climate change mitigation measures. The proposed legislation aims to assist workers affected by climate change mitigation measures by providing adjustment assistance, including monetary support and training for up to three years. Training for \"Green Jobs\" focuses on renewable energy projects like wind and solar. The proposed legislation aims to provide qualified workers for renewable energy construction projects, such as wind and solar projects, energy transmission systems, and energy efficiency jobs. Many of these jobs can be filled by tradesmen with existing skills in electrical wiring and welding. Workers may need to follow projects to where the jobs are, often in the Midwest or Southwest. States will receive funds for retraining and career counseling, with federal oversight on fund usage. The proposed legislation aims to provide qualified workers for renewable energy construction projects, such as wind and solar projects, energy transmission systems, and energy efficiency jobs. Eligible workers must be citizens or nationals of the United States, or have \"satisfactory immigration status\" to receive program benefits. The separate jobs retraining and assistance program envisioned by S. 1733 appears to be more comprehensive than existing workforce programs, perhaps raising issues of equity for unemployed workers not eligible for Climate Change Worker Adjustment Assistance. \"Middle class careers\" and \"quality employment\" are described as goals of the Green Construction. The Green Construction careers project aims for middle-class careers and quality employment, with a focus on long-term job opportunities in manufacturing for renewable energy products. Federal policies and oversight for industry support and retraining programs are needed for retrained workers. Assistance benefits are available for up to three years, with options for job search assistance or lump sum payments. The worker may apply for job search assistance or relocation if suitable employment is not found. Adjustment assistance to climate change-impacted industries will be provided through emissions allowances, but downsizing may occur. Growth in green industries is expected to create future employment opportunities. Coordination between government, education, retraining providers, and employers is crucial for economic growth and employment results."
