    "content": "The \"Adoption Awareness Act of 1999\" is cited as the short title. Grants are provided for activities promoting adoption counseling for pregnant women under a new section added to the Public Health Service Act. The Secretary will make grants to national adoption organizations to train eligible health center staff in providing adoption counseling to pregnant women and infertile married couples. The organizations can use the grant for training programs directly or through other adoption organizations. The grant may be used for developing a training curriculum. The national adoption organization must make reasonable efforts to provide adoption training at or near eligible health centers through experienced individuals in adoption counseling in the center's geographic area. The term 'adoption organization' refers to an organization whose primary purpose is promoting adoption. The national adoption organization must provide adoption training at eligible health centers through experienced individuals in adoption counseling. Eligible health centers are public and nonprofit private entities that offer health services to pregnant women. Married couples are defined as couples in a legal marriage. The national adoption organization must provide adoption training at eligible health centers, including those that receive grants for family planning, community health centers, services in schools, and those that do not perform or refer for abortions. The Secretary requires federally-funded family planning services to offer nondirective counseling and referrals for prenatal care, infant care, foster care, and adoption. Religious organizations are also allowed to receive funding for these services. Religious organizations can receive grants without compromising their religious character or the freedom of beneficiaries. They are eligible for grants as long as programs adhere to the Establishment Clause. The Federal Government cannot discriminate against religious organizations applying for grants based on their religious character. Religious organizations receiving grants must maintain independence from government control over their religious beliefs and practices. They are not required to change their internal governance or remove religious symbols to be eligible for grants. Religious organizations receiving grants must maintain independence from government control over their beliefs and practices. Individuals with objections to the religious character of the organization providing services under a grant must be offered services from an alternative provider of equal value. Religious organizations receiving grants must maintain independence from government control over their beliefs and practices. An individual described in this subparagraph is someone who receives, applies for, or requests services under a program funded by a grant. A religious organization's exemption regarding employment practices under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is not affected by its participation in a grant program. The organization shall not discriminate against individuals in providing services under the grant based on their beliefs. Religious organizations receiving grants must maintain independence from government control over their beliefs and practices. Any religious organization receiving a grant under subsection (a) shall be subject to the same regulations as other grantees to account for the expenditure of the grant in accordance with auditing principles. If a religious organization segregates grant funds into separate accounts, only those funds shall be subject to audit. Compliance with regulations is required for parties seeking to enforce their rights. The subsection outlines the process for enforcing rights through civil action, clarifies that state laws restricting funds to religious organizations are not preempted, and prohibits the use of grants for religious purposes. Grants can only be awarded upon submission of a formal application to the Secretary. The Secretary determines the necessary form, agreements, assurances, and information for applications under this section. $7,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2000, with additional funding for fiscal years 2001 through 2004."
