    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Preserving Educational Opportunities for Immigrant Children Act of 2001\". Many children brought to the United States by parents or other adults arrive without the ability to make independent decisions or live independently due to entering the country without inspection or authorization. Many immigrant children in the United States become fully integrated into American life, learning English and often losing ties to their native country. They attend public schools, excel academically, and contribute to their communities. However, current immigration laws do not consider their special circumstances, putting them at risk of being removed to a foreign country. Many immigrant children in the United States face the threat of being deported to a country they do not know, disrupting their lives and education. Current immigration laws prevent them from accessing higher education, hindering their ability to contribute to their communities in the US. This Act aims to provide opportunities for these children to regularize their status, attend college, and become productive members of society. The Act aims to repeal legislative barriers for immigrants to integrate into US society. The Act defines a \"transplanted child\" as an alien granted cancellation of removal or with a pending application for cancellation of removal. It also restores state flexibility in providing in-state tuition for college-age alien children. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 is amended to remove section 505, affecting postsecondary education benefits from July 1, 1998. Additionally, the eligibility of transplanted children for public benefits is expanded under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. The Attorney General has the authority to adjust the status of certain children. The Attorney General has the authority to cancel removal and adjust the status of certain children brought to the United States. To be eligible for cancellation of removal and adjustment of status, an alien must have been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of at least 3 years (or 5 years if 18 years or older) preceding the application date, demonstrating good moral character during that time. To be eligible for cancellation of removal and adjustment of status, an alien must have been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of at least 3 years (or 5 years if 18 years or older) preceding the application date, demonstrating good moral character. The removal of an alien may be allowed if extreme hardship would result to the alien, the alien's child, or the alien's parent. The Attorney General's authority does not apply to aliens inadmissible or deportable for crimes of moral turpitude unless extreme hardship is determined. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to include provisions regarding inadmissible or deportable aliens under security and related grounds. Section 240A(b) is also amended to include paragraph (3) in addition to paragraphs (1) and (2) for eligibility for cancellation of removal and adjustment of status."
