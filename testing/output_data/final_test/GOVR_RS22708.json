    "content": "Federal courts may order defendant restitution to crime victims only if authorized by specific statutes. Restitution can be permitted or required based on the type of crime committed. Additionally, restitution can be ordered as part of a plea agreement, probation, or supervised release. The procedure for imposing restitution orders is outlined in Section 3664. Mandatory restitution is required for certain felony offenses, including crimes of violence, fraud, drug-related crimes, human trafficking, and sexual abuse. The federal restitution statutes address who qualifies as a victim, what crimes trigger restitution authority, and what type of injuries or losses are covered. The Supreme Court initially limited restitution to harm from the crime of conviction, but Congress later expanded coverage in Sections 3663 and 3663A. The federal restitution statutes, specifically Sections 3663 and 3663A, define a victim as a person directly harmed by the offense for which restitution may be ordered. This includes individuals harmed by a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of activity related to the crime. The harm must be directly caused by the defendant's misconduct without any intervening causes. Intervening causes can impact the assertion of direct and proximate harm unless they are related to the offense of conviction. Proximate cause refers to a sufficient connection between the injury and the injurious conduct, emphasizing the need for a direct relation between the asserted injury and the harmful behavior. Proximate cause is crucial in establishing a direct link between the injury and the injurious conduct alleged, emphasizing foreseeability and the scope of risk. Restitution definitions expand when crimes involve conspiracy or patterns of misconduct, holding defendants accountable for both their actions and those of their coconspirators. Restitution in crimes involving schemes or patterns may include losses from different episodes of the same scheme. Courts differ on what qualifies as \"scheme, conspiracy, or pattern\" laws. Some require it to be an element of the crime, while others do not. Sections 3663 and 3663A outline the circumstances for restitution. Courts have the authority to order restitution for victims, including governmental entities, family members, and individuals involved in schemes or patterns of crime. The definition of victim is the same in \u00a7\u00a73663 and 3663A, but they do not cover restitution for the same crimes. The list of crimes for which mandatory restitution applies under \u00a73663A includes crimes of violence, offenses against property, tampering with consumer products, and theft of medical products. Section 16 defines a crime of violence as an offense involving the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force. The controlled substance offense under \u00a73663A involves the risk of using physical force against another's person or property. Restitution is required for maintaining a place where controlled substances are involved. Conspiracy under title 18 can also lead to mandatory restitution for property damage offenses. Product tampering includes tampering with products affecting commerce or spreading false rumors. Section 670 addresses theft. Section 670 prohibits theft of pre-retail medical products. Mandatory restitution requirements for defendants convicted of certain offenses are tempered by qualifications, including the need for an identifiable victim with physical injury or pecuniary loss. Restitution may not be ordered in cases where the number of victims makes it impractical or when complexity would introduce an undue burden. Other federal statutes authorize restitution in specific cases. Federal statutes authorize mandatory restitution in specific cases, such as child support, peonage, sexual abuse, sexual exploitation of children, domestic violence, copyright infringement, telemarketing fraud, and controlled substances offenses involving amphetamine and methamphetamine. Restitution requirements vary in scope and application, with most following procedures similar to \u00a7\u00a73663 and 3663A but applying to a narrower range of crimes and a wider range of losses. Section 3663 authorizes restitution for certain crimes under title 18 of the United States Code, including trafficking offenses and air safety prohibitions. Restitution can also be ordered as part of a plea agreement, probation, or supervised release, even for crimes not covered by mandatory restitution statutes. Restitution is limited to losses authorized by statute, including property, bodily injury, and participation losses. Restitution under sections 3663 and 3663A allows for the return of property or compensatory payments to victims for actual losses, such as salary theft or insurance replacement costs. The focus is on making victims whole, with awards based on actual losses rather than intended losses. The courts consider whether attorneys' fees qualify as reimbursable property losses in cases of scurrilous litigation. Section 3663 allows for restitution for costs incurred by victims of identity theft. The court may order restitution in drug trafficking cases with no identifiable victims, capped by the fine amount. Restitution is provided for victims of identity theft and state agencies in certain drug trafficking cases. Individual restitution sections focus on property damage or loss victims. The child support restitution section, 18 U.S.C. 228(d), adopts procedures from \u00a73663A for interstate evasion of child support orders, determining restitution based on state court support orders or governing state law. The peonage restitution section, 18 U.S.C. 1593, provides compensation for victims of human trafficking offenses. The child support restitution section, 18 U.S.C. 228(d), adopts procedures from \u00a73663A for interstate evasion of child support orders, determining restitution based on state court support orders or governing state law. The peonage restitution section, 18 U.S.C. 1593, provides compensation for victims of human trafficking offenses, including economic benefits derived from the victim's services and a catch-all clause ensuring compensation for predicate crime-related injuries and losses. The telemarketing fraud restitution statute, 18 U.S.C. 2327, and the methamphetamine statute, 21 U.S.C. 853(q), cover specific types of losses caused by predicate crimes. The USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act allows for restitution in cases involving possession, possession with intent to distribute, or manufacture of amphetamine and methamphetamine. Sections 3663 and 3663A provide for restitution for personal injuries, including medical expenses, lost income, rehabilitation, and funeral expenses. The general mandatory restitution authority in \u00a73663A covers medical expenses, psychiatric treatment, lost income, and restitution for various offenses related to sexual abuse, exploitation of children, domestic violence, and stalking. The mandatory restitution authority in Section 3663A covers medical expenses, psychiatric treatment, lost income, and restitution for offenses related to sexual abuse, exploitation of children, domestic violence, and stalking. Section 3663A also defines \"victims\" similar to Sections 3663 and 3663A, lists losses for which restitution must be ordered, and adopts procedural mechanisms for restitution. Unlike Sections 3663 and 3663A, Section 3663A does not require bodily injury as a precondition for awarding the cost of psychiatric treatments and includes a catch-all clause. However, it does not authorize payments to third parties for crime-related victim treatment. The courts have ruled that private parties can recover investigation costs, including attorneys' fees, as a result of a defendant's wrongful conduct. While the sections mention human victims, corporations and legal entities are also entitled to restitution. However, restitution for internal investigations not required by criminal investigators or prosecutors may not be permitted. Governmental entities, corporations, and legal entities can receive restitution under the provisions. Restitution awards may include relocation expenses, compensation for lost wages during investigations, and attorneys' fees. Section 3664 governs the issuance of restitution orders, with the court directing the probation service to identify victims and their injuries, damages, or losses upon a defendant's conviction. Prosecutors are required to provide relevant information to the probation officer. The probation officer gathers information from prosecutors and victims regarding the defendant's financial situation and the extent of losses. The court resolves restitution disputes based on evidence presented, with the prosecution proving the victim's losses and the defendant addressing their finances and compensation efforts. Section 3664 outlines the court's process for issuing a restitution order. The court must frame the restitution order to provide full compensation for each victim, regardless of the defendant's financial circumstances. Payment methods can include lump sum, in-kind, installments, or a combination. The court considers the defendant's assets and financial obligations when determining the payment schedule. In cases where the defendant's financial condition is limited, nominal periodic payments may be ordered. It is crucial for the court to closely monitor the restitution payment schedule and not require immediate payment. The court may set a restitution order for victims, considering the defendant's financial situation. Restitution can be paid in various ways, and the court should not demand immediate payment if the defendant cannot afford it. If victim losses are not fully determined within 10 days of sentencing, the court must be informed, and a final determination should be made within 90 days. Victims have a limited time to present claims for compensation. The Supreme Court resolved a circuit split over the application of restitution provisions in cases where time lines have not been observed. In Dolan, the Court held that a sentencing court can order restitution after the 90-day deadline if the defendant was aware beforehand. Victims can assign their right to receive restitution to the Crime Victims Fund, but courts are divided on whether restitution can be ordered to be paid to the Fund if the victim refuses. If multiple defendants contributed to the victim's loss, restitution may be apportioned accordingly. The Supreme Court clarified how courts should handle restitution when non-co-defendants are responsible for a significant portion of the victim's losses. In cases where multiple defendants are liable, restitution may be apportioned accordingly. The Court addressed the issue of joint and several liability, stating that each defendant is liable for the entire amount but the victim is entitled to no more than what is needed to be made whole. The Court clarified that restitution orders should reflect the defendant's contribution to harm, with the US to be served last. Restitution can be ordered to third parties who have assumed victim's losses, ensuring full compensation. The court can amend a restitution order to reflect the defendant's changed economic circumstances, but not for anticipated future changes or to challenge the legality of the order. Restitution orders can be enforced through various means, including collection of fines or other reasonable methods. Restitution orders can be enforced through various means, including collection of fines or other reasonable methods. Restitution operates as a lien on the defendant's property for 20 years, and the government can use garnishment and other collection mechanisms to enforce it. Victims can also secure a lien in their name against the defendant's property to ensure payment. Additionally, victims have the right to full and timely restitution, enforceable through legal action if necessary. In most cases, victims can sue the defendant for conduct leading to conviction and restitution order. Restitution orders are final and can be enforced through various means. The death of a defendant before final appeal abates all underlying issues. The death of a defendant before final appeal abates all underlying issues, including dismissed appeals, overturned convictions, and abated indictments. Abated convictions cannot be used in related civil litigation against the estate. There is no consensus among lower federal courts on whether a restitution order would also abate in such cases."
