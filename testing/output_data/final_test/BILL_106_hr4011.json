    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Clean Air and Water Preservation Act of 2000\". The Congress finds that the oxygenate requirement in the RFG program has reduced emissions, but MTBE, a chosen oxygenate, is contaminating water sources nationwide and is a probable carcinogen. MTBE is highly soluble and persistent in water, requiring only one gallon to contaminate 26 million gallons. Ethanol is a safer alternative that can achieve the same emission reductions. The RFG program requires an oxygenate to be added to gasoline, with ethanol being a safer alternative to MTBE. Ethanol industry is rapidly expanding, with production capacity estimated at 1.8 billion gallons in 1998 and projected to reach 3.1 billion gallons by 2004 to replace MTBE. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that replacing MTBE with ethanol will increase demand for corn by over 500 million bushels annually, creating 13,000 new jobs and improving farm cash receipts by $1 billion each year. Ethanol is an energy-efficient fuel, providing 25% more energy than production requires, with a potential net energy gain exceeding 150%. The net energy gain potential of ethanol can exceed 150% with advanced agricultural and production technologies. Ethanol enhances automobile performance and is approved by all vehicle manufacturers for use in 10% blended fuels. Replacing MTBE with ethanol maintains emissions reductions without water contamination issues. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 required gasoline in the RFG program to contain 1.5% oxygenate by weight, which was not Congress's original intent and hinders efficient use. Lifting the regulatory requirement for oxygenates in gasoline will provide refiners more flexibility for RFG compliance and high-performance gasoline year-round. However, a limit on aromatics in gasoline is necessary to protect public health, and a prohibition on increased emissions is needed to safeguard air quality. SEC. 3. USE OF MTBE AS A FUEL ADDITIVE. The Clean Air Act prohibits the use of MTBE as a fuel additive, with regulations to be promptly amended by the EPA. The effective date is three years after enactment, and labeling requirements are in place during this period. The EPA mandates labeling for gasoline containing MTBE at retail fuel dispensing systems. SEC. 4. EXISTING MTBE WATER CONTAMINATION. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to prioritize groundwater areas contaminated by MTBE. EPA will develop cleanup guidelines for MTBE contamination. The Administrator will develop technical guidelines to assist States in investigating and cleaning up MTBE contamination in groundwater. SEC. 5. Allowing oxygen averaging in the RFG program by amending the Clean Air Act to insert \"an average of\" before \"2.0 percent\". Regulation establishing a minimum oxygen content is invalidated. SEC. 6. Anti-backsliding measures. The Clean Air Act is amended to regulate ozone forming potential and aromatic hydrocarbon content in emissions from vehicles using reformulated gasoline. The regulations aim to limit ozone precursors and ensure compliance with standards set in 2000. The Clean Air Act is amended to regulate aromatic hydrocarbon content in gasoline, limiting it to the average content of reformulated gasoline sold in covered areas in 2000. The Clean Air Act is amended to regulate aromatic hydrocarbon content in gasoline. The Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will evaluate oxygenate alternatives to MTBE and promote renewable ethanol as a substitute."
