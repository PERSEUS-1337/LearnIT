    "content": "Oil exploration and production in Iraq started in the 1920s under a concession granted to international oil companies. Iraq's oil resources were nationalized by 1975, and production was state-operated until 2003. Despite reaching a peak production of 3.5 million barrels per day in 1990, war, sanctions, and mismanagement hindered the country's hydrocarbon infrastructure. Iraq's oil reserves are the world's third-largest, with 115 billion barrels. Estimates suggest there may be more reserves yet to be discovered. Many experts believe Iraq has the potential for the world's largest oil reserves that are not fully developed. Iraq's current proven reserves are concentrated in southern Iraq, particularly in Al Basrah and Al Tamim near Kirkuk. The average oil production rate is 2.5 mbd, with exports below target levels. Crude oil accounts for over 90% of domestic energy consumption and 85% of government revenue. Declines in global oil prices led to consecutive $15 billion deficits in 2009 and 2010. The IMF projects significant deficits for Iraq in 2010 and 2011, with a return to surplus in 2012. Fluctuations in oil prices and production could impact fiscal stability and development plans. Iraq aims to increase oil production to 6 mbd by 2017, currently contributing 3% of global supply. Iraq aims to increase oil production to 4 mbd by 2013 and then to 6 mbd by 2017. International firms are expected to invest after the 2010 Iraqi elections. The IMF and World Bank warn of fiscal shortfalls due to stable oil production levels and moderate global oil prices. Iraq is facing challenges in meeting its ambitious oil production goals, with experts skeptical of achieving them within the current timeframe. The government has conducted bidding rounds for oil field services but faced difficulties in reaching agreements with international firms on fees. Despite efforts to expand oil production, there are concerns that fiscal shortfalls may jeopardize the government's ability to provide services and maintain security gains. Several first round field contracts were signed with foreign partners in late 2009, resulting in more competitive bids from international oil companies (IOCs) in the second bidding round in December 2009. Contract negotiations have progressed quickly since then, but challenges remain, including Iraq's aging infrastructure, corruption, and security issues. Under new technical service contracts signed by the Ministry of Oil, IOCs will work with Iraq's state-owned oil firms to improve production in specific oil fields. Iraq will compensate IOCs based on an agreed per barrel fee for specific oil fields, subject to contract conditions. Contracts are reviewed by Iraq's cabinet, with terms subject to renegotiation and adjustments for potential future OPEC quota considerations. Recent Iraqi oil service contracts have been offered and awarded in bidding rounds. Iraq has also decided to invest in some fields itself. In late 2007, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) finalized its own regional oil and gas investment law and signed production sharing contracts with international companies, including Hunt Oil. Foreign firms manage oil production in designated fields under the KRG's model PSC, recovering costs from oil sales. The KRG is against federal approval of contracts but supports revenue sharing as per the constitution. In May 2009, the national Ministry of Oil allowed the KRG to export oil from Tawke and Taq Taq fields through the national pipeline. The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) signed production sharing contracts with international companies for oil fields Tawke and Taq Taq. A dispute over compensation has halted exports from KRG-controlled fields. Kurdish officials aim to increase oil production to 1 mbd by 2014. US efforts support legal frameworks and Iraqi budget execution. US programs for oil infrastructure rehabilitation are nearing completion, with $2.06 billion allocated by December 2009. As of December 2005, the United States administered over $2.8 billion in Iraqi funds for oil infrastructure projects. Iraq's Oil Ministry saw an 800% increase in operational funds from 2008 to 2009, reaching $950 million. Investment funding for the oil sector remained stable at $2.2 billion in 2009 and is set to increase to $2.6 billion in 2010. Significant investments in infrastructure such as ports, roads, rail, water, and power are crucial for Iraq to meet its oil production expansion goals. Key points of contention in energy policy in Iraq include the roles of federal and regional bodies, foreign participation in oil and gas development, and equitable sharing of resources. Overall, Iraqi labor groups and elected officials have challenged the transparency of legislative drafting and contract negotiation processes for oil and gas revenue sharing. Constitutional amendments have direct implications on federal and regional government authorities in regulating oil and gas activities. Concerns have been raised by Iraqi, U.S., and international observers regarding the impact of violence and political tension on the consideration of hydrocarbon legislation and new contracts. The U.S. Defense Department report highlighted disagreements over oil and gas contracts in Iraq. Candidates' positions on energy policy were scrutinized before the 2010 elections. The Iraqi constitution's ambiguity on resource ownership has caused division between the national government and the Kurdistan Regional Government. The Iraqi constitution includes provisions for the federal government, producing governorates, and regional governments to manage oil and gas extraction. However, differing interpretations have led to a political impasse over oil issues, with Iraqi Kurds seeking autonomy in signing oil deals and the national government proceeding with bidding processes. Concerns about foreign involvement in Iraq's energy sector have also been raised. Iraq's energy sector faces nationalist concerns over foreign firms' involvement. The government uses technical service contracts and joint ventures for state-owned oil firms. Disputes arise between the national government and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) over the legality of oil contracts. The KRG's contracts with foreign firms are deemed \"illegal\" by Baghdad until reviewed and approved. The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and Baghdad dispute the legality of oil contracts signed after February 2007. KRG officials halted oil production for export in KRG territory in October 2009 due to a payment dispute with the national government. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki expressed willingness to resolve the issue in January 2010. Oil Minister Shahristani suggested compensating firms for physical work on contracted fields but not for profits from KRG-signed contracts. The dispute between the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and Baghdad over oil contracts signed after February 2007 remains unresolved. Iraqi leaders are showing interest in resolving the issue, but it is uncertain if an agreement will be reached. Legislation proposed in 2007 to manage the country's oil and gas resources is stalled due to ongoing political disputes. This legislation is seen as crucial for promoting political reconciliation and economic development in Iraq. The legislative package in Iraq, including a draft hydrocarbon framework law, has moved forward for consideration by parliament. Disagreements over regional and national government powers have hindered progress in adopting new laws. The package aims to regulate oil and gas exploration, revenue sharing, establish a National Oil Company, and reorganize the Ministry of Oil. Legislation for the hydrocarbon sector is expected to be considered after the 2010 national elections. It is unclear if Iraqi officials will stand by proposed legislation or seek to renegotiate key elements. In 2007, proposed legislation in Iraq aimed to regulate oil and gas exploration, revenue sharing, and establish a National Oil Company. However, disagreements over government powers have hindered progress. The U.N. Secretary General reported in 2009 that Iraq still needed to implement a control and measurement system for oil production. Questions have been raised about Iraq's ability to manage its oil resources transparently. The IMF Executive Board noted in 2010 the importance of completing the legislation. Iraq's oil exports are managed by the State Oil Marketing Organization (SOMO) and revenue is deposited into a controlled account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Five percent is reserved for reparations, while the remaining 95% goes into the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI). IMF Executive Board emphasized the completion of the oil metering system for reconciliation of oil and financial flows. Iraq began implementing the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in 2010. The remaining 95% of Iraq's oil revenue is deposited into a Development Fund for Iraq (DFI) account at the FRBNY and transferred to an Iraqi Ministry of Finance account at the Central Bank of Iraq. UNSCR 1905 extended the mandate for the DFI and the International Advisory and Monitoring Board (IAMB) until December 2010. The IAMB provides reports on Iraq's oil revenue, its use, and production practices. The Iraqi cabinet created the Committee of Financial Experts (COFE) in 2006 to monitor oil revenue collection. The Committee of Financial Experts (COFE) was inaugurated in April 2007 to monitor oil revenue collection and administration. In April 2009, the COFE was deemed capable of overseeing the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI) by the International Advisory and Monitoring Board (IAMB) and the UN Security Council. Immunity provisions protect Iraqi funds in the DFI from legal judgments, with U.S. legal protections extended by Presidents Bush and Obama. The U.S.-Iraq security agreement commits to assisting Iraq with UN requests. The U.S.-Iraq security agreement commits to assisting Iraq with UN requests to extend protections for energy proceeds and the DFI. The IMF warned of Iraq's fragile public finances and limited fiscal room for slippage due to missed oil production targets. High oil prices compensated for revenue losses until late 2007, but drops in prices after September 2008 led to drastic cuts in Iraqi oil revenues. The IMF warned of Iraq's fragile public finances and limited fiscal room for slippage due to missed oil production targets. The projected budget deficit for 2009 was $15 to $17 billion, and was financed in part through the use of reserve funds accumulated from prior budget surpluses. In a March 2010 follow up report, the IMF reiterated that \"Iraq's longer term economic outlook is strong as oil prices and production are projected to increase markedly in the coming years.\" However, the IMF estimated that Iraqi budget deficits in 2010 and 2011 would create a $5 billion financing gap after domestic resources have been tapped that will need to be met with international financial support. The 2010 budget deficit will be covered by funds raised through an Iraqi government bond issue and external support agreements like the IMF Stand-by Arrangement and World Bank loans. Oil revenue availability depends on production, export capacity, and global market prices. Concerns about equitable distribution of oil revenues persist due to the oil sector's central role in Iraq's economy and historical communal favoritism. This has fueled disputes between the KRG and the federal government. The dispute between the KRG and the federal government in Iraq continues to revolve around the equitable distribution of oil revenues, as outlined in Article 112 of the constitution. A fair revenue distribution formula is crucial for Iraq's economic health and political stability. Formulas for equitable revenue distribution in Iraq are debated, focusing on per capita distribution and allocation to \"damaged\" regions. Discussions also involve whether regions should decide on oil and gas revenue and if federal distribution should be fixed or discretionary. Current budget allocates 17% to KRG and $1 per barrel to producing governorates. The provision in Iraq's budget allocates $1 per barrel to producing governorates, raising concerns about financial redistribution impacting infrastructure investments and potential for local corruption. Political tensions and capacity constraints have hindered the holding of a national census to determine revenue distribution ratios. Per capita population formulas aim to ensure fair shares of oil and gas proceeds, but may lead to resentment in less populous regions, including minority Sunni Arab areas. Resentment could also arise from rewarding producing governorates. Iraq faces logistical and technical challenges in expanding oil production to planned levels. Investments are needed in drilling rigs, pumping equipment, water supplies for oil field reinjection, and oil pipelines. Current capacity constraints limit exports to under 3.0 mbd until major infrastructure work is completed in the southern region. The International Energy Agency has identified export capacity constraints as a significant issue that urgently needs to be addressed. Iraq needs $50 billion in investment to expand oil production capacity from 2.4 mbd to 6 mbd. The U.S. and Iraqi governments are working on improving financial management and coordination for assistance programs. Iraq is granting greater contracting authority to ministries to manage investments. The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and USF-I have reorganized budget assistance programs for better coordination. Security of Iraq's oil infrastructure has improved with the introduction of Pipeline Exclusion Zones. Investments in security infrastructure will be needed for new oil infrastructure and pipelines. Investments in security infrastructure and personnel will be necessary for the expansion of Iraq's oil production. The renegotiation of Iraq's OPEC production quota is expected to be contentious, potentially impacting global oil prices. Iraq's Minister Shahristani stated in December 2009 that discussions on increasing oil production will only happen once there is a significant increase in production. He emphasized the need to consider criteria such as construction and development when studying quotas. Iraq aims to coordinate efforts to maximize revenues from oil sales. OPEC Secretary General Abdullah al Badri mentioned accommodating Iraq in future discussions. Experts highlight the importance and challenges of reaching an agreement. If global economic growth picks up, it could ease the Iraq-OPEC transition. Iraq's 2009 technical service contract bidding rounds signaled commitment to capitalizing on resource potential and generating revenue. Fiscal shortfalls from constant oil production levels could jeopardize government services and security gains. Experts are skeptical about Iraq's ability to meet its challenges. The challenges facing Iraq make experts skeptical about meeting ambitious oil production goals set by the government. The International Energy Agency warns that reaching these targets is near impossible due to political, logistical, and technical hurdles. The outcome of the national elections and formation of a new cabinet are closely watched by industry professionals. The formation of a new cabinet in Iraq raises concerns about potential revisions to international investment terms in the oil and gas sector. The government must address unresolved political and constitutional issues amidst the pending election. The US aims for political reconciliation and economic development in Iraq, supporting Iraqi forces to maintain a secure environment for resolving core political differences. The ongoing debate over energy policy reflects Iraqis' unresolved issues. The ongoing debate in Iraq over energy policy and legislation reflects unresolved political differences among Iraqis regarding federal and regional powers, equitable distribution of hydrocarbon revenues, and concerns about unity and sovereignty. US policymakers face challenges in influencing Iraqi energy policy debates as the US military role diminishes. Key questions include how US diplomats should engage with Iraqis on managing economic resources and promoting constitutional reforms before hydrocarbon sector legislation. The United States faces challenges in influencing Iraqi energy policy debates as the US military role diminishes. Key questions include promoting equitable revenue-sharing mechanisms and international investment in Iraq's oil and gas sector. Constitutional disputes over federal and regional authority could undermine compromises on hydrocarbon legislation and new contracts. International investment and technology are necessary for Iraq's ambitious plans for oil and gas production, but terms of participation remain controversial. The US government's positions on Iraqi energy policy can impact Iraqi attitudes towards the US presence, legislation, and investments. Congress has worked to prevent US control of Iraq's oil resources through legislation like P.L. 111-84 and P.L. 111-118. Section 314 of P.L. 111-32 prohibits the US government from controlling Iraq's oil resources. Senator John Ensign advocates for an \"Iraq Oil Trust\" to ensure fair distribution of oil proceeds. S. 351, the Support for Iraq Oil Trust Act of 2009, requires a plan for oil trusts in Iraq and withholds 10% of US Economic Support Fund assistance until the plan is delivered. The Support for Iraq Oil Trust Act of 2008, co-sponsored by Hillary Clinton, aimed to ensure equitable distribution of Iraq's oil resources among different ethnic groups. The Act prohibited US control over Iraq's oil and required progress reports on benchmarks related to oil resource distribution. The interim report on Iraq benchmarks highlighted unsatisfactory progress in revenue-sharing, urging Iraqi leaders to approve draft laws swiftly. Limited progress has reduced confidence in the Iraqi government, particularly in enacting legislation for fair distribution of oil revenue. The report emphasized uncertainty regarding future progress when Iraq's parliament reconvenes. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, National Defense Authorization Act, and other related legislation prohibit the United States from controlling Iraq's oil resources. President Bush issued signing statements affirming this stance. President Bush issued signing statements regarding the executive branch's interpretation of certain provisions in legislation related to Iraq's oil sector. A draft hydrocarbon framework law was prepared by a committee under the Iraqi cabinet in 2006, with subsequent edits by a political negotiating committee. The Council of Ministers approved a draft version of the law in February 2007, leading to negotiations on federal and regional authorities' responsibilities and contracting procedures for oil fields. In July 2007, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki announced the approval of a final version of the framework law for oil fields, which was forwarded to the Council of Representatives for consideration. Kurdish officials protested changes made by the Council of Ministers, leading to a withdrawal of support for the legislation. Disagreements among Iraqi entities delayed parliamentary consideration of the law as of November 2009. Parliamentary consideration of the oil legislation in Iraq is being delayed by disagreements among key political figures and is likely to continue until the election of a new parliament in early 2010. The Council of Ministers is considering new draft legislation, but no timetable has been announced. There is skepticism about Oil Minister Shahristani's performance and opposition to the investment bidding round conducted in July 2009 and contracts signed by the Kurdistan Regional Government. Compromises reached prior to the announcement of draft legislation may be in doubt. Note: Analysis is based on draft legislation from 2007 and may need revision if new legislation emerges. The draft hydrocarbon framework legislation in Iraq includes the creation of a powerful Federal Oil and Gas Council (FOGC) to oversee national oil and gas sector policies. The FOGC would have the authority to review all contracts and operate based on a two-thirds majority decision-making system. Seats on the FOGC are reserved for specific cabinet members, regional government representatives, hydrocarbon experts, and \"producing governorates.\" A \"Panel of Independent Experts\" would provide non-binding advisory support to the FOGC, with the potential for foreign energy experts or industry representatives to be included. The draft hydrocarbon framework legislation in Iraq includes the creation of a powerful Federal Oil and Gas Council (FOGC) to oversee national oil and gas sector policies. The possibility of foreign energy experts or industry representatives being chosen to participate on this panel has raised concerns among some Iraqis and foreign observers. The makeup of the FOGC specified in the draft law could potentially lead to sectarian or regional tensions, with Sunni Arabs fearing their interests may not be adequately represented. Some Iraqis may seek constitutionally recognized regional status to ensure their representation in the council. The draft hydrocarbon framework law in Iraq establishes criteria for future oil contracts to preserve Iraqi control and maximize economic return. It does not mandate production-sharing agreements as the sole model. Contract holders may have exclusive rights to oil activities with approval from Iraqi authorities. General terms aim to maintain Iraqi sovereignty over oil production and ensure economic returns while providing appropriate returns to investors. The draft hydrocarbon framework law in Iraq sets criteria for evaluating oil contracts signed by the Kurdistan Regional Government and the Ministry of Oil since 2003. It allows for foreign participation, potentially reversing the nationalization of Iraq's oil sector. Specific contract details will determine the level of foreign involvement and revenue benefits. The draft hydrocarbon framework law in Iraq aims to promote foreign investment in the oil sector without mandating specific contract terms. The law allows for foreign participation in oil and gas fields, with mechanisms in place to maintain control in the hands of the national government. It does not provide specific guidelines for revenue sharing but proposes the creation of two funds for oil revenues. The draft hydrocarbon framework law in Iraq proposes the creation of two funds for oil revenues: an \"Oil Revenue Fund\" and a \"Future Fund\" for long-term development goals. Regional authorities would have seats on the FOGC and licensing powers over specified oil fields, subject to the terms of the law. Kurdish representatives opposed the draft annexes and threatened to withdraw support. Dubai opposed draft annexes in the legislative package, threatening to withdraw support. The annexes were removed before cabinet approval. The new arrangement gives FOGC control over specific oil fields. Article 112 of the Iraqi constitution sets criteria for revenue distribution. Negotiations on the draft revenue-sharing law continued until June 2007. Baghdad and Washington reached a broad agreement on revenue sharing based on population. In June 2007, a draft revenue-sharing law was prepared as part of the hydrocarbon legislative package. The law empowered the federal government to collect oil and gas revenue, allocating funds to national priorities while distributing the remainder to regions and governorates based on population density percentages. The draft revenue law includes provisions for distributing funds to regions and governorates based on population density percentages. It also establishes a Commission to monitor financial resources and calls for the creation of a \"Future Fund\" for surplus revenue. The hydrocarbon legislative package in Iraq includes proposed laws to reorganize the Ministry of Oil and establish an Iraqi National Oil Company (INOC). The draft Ministry and INOC laws aim to ensure proper oversight, accountability, and separation of powers between the two entities. A draft INOC law was approved by the Council of Ministers in November 2009 but was not considered by the Council of Representatives before the 2010 national election."
