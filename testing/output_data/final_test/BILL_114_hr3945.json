A small business concern owned by service-disabled veterans must meet specific criteria, including having at least 51 percent ownership by service-disabled veterans and being included in a database specified in title 38, United States Code. The time period after a veteran's death for the surviving spouse ends upon remarriage, relinquishing ownership in the business, or 10 years after the veteran's death.
