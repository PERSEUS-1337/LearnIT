The \"Holocaust Victims Insurance Act\" requires insurance companies to report on policies issued from 1920 to 1945, including details on policyholders, beneficiaries, efforts to locate beneficiaries, comparisons with Holocaust victims, reasons for inability to provide information, and contributions to a fund. Any person failing to report as required by the \"Holocaust Victims Insurance Act\" will face a $1,000 civil penalty per day. The Secretary of Commerce must promptly transmit the report to the Committees on Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Senate. SEC. 3. PAYMENT OF PROCEEDS OF INSURANCE. Insurance companies must pay the beneficiaries or descendants of Holocaust victims the proceeds of insurance policies issued during 1920 to 1945. Companies without records should establish a fund to compensate victims. The Secretary of Commerce, with State insurance commissioners, must report to Congress within 180 days on Holocaust victims with life insurance policies from 1920-1945. Details include the number of victims, payments made, unpaid policies, payments to non-beneficiaries, and the issuing companies.
