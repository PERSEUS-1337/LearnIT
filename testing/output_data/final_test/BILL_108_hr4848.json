Congress finds that obstetric fistula is a devastating condition occurring during childbirth, leading to tissue deterioration and open holes in the vagina, bladder, or rectum. It is excruciatingly painful, causing loss of bowel control, with an estimated 2,000,000 cases reported worldwide, mostly in Africa among young, malnourished women in rural areas. Obstetric fistula is a devastating condition during childbirth, with an estimated 2,000,000 cases worldwide, mostly in Africa. In Nigeria alone, approximately 1,000,000 women suffer from obstetric fistula. 50,000 to 100,000 new cases occur each year, mostly in women under 20. Women with obstetric fistula face social isolation, abandonment, and emotional stress, often exacerbated by the death of their child during labor. Obstetric fistula, a devastating condition during childbirth, can be prevented through increased access to emergency obstetrical care, postponement of sexual activity, and training for birth attendants. Treatment is available through a minor surgical procedure that is 90% effective and costs as little as $150. However, many women suffering from obstetric fistula are unaware of treatment options, leading to unnecessary suffering. Treatment centers in developing countries, particularly in Africa, are limited, resulting in high demand for services that exceed supply. The United States Agency for International Development provides assistance for programs targeting prevention, not treatment, of obstetric fistula. Thousands of women in developing countries could be treated if resources were allocated. The purpose of this Act is to prioritize treatment of obstetric fistula in US foreign assistance programs by establishing and expanding treatment capacity in developing countries. This includes providing surgery and post-surgery care. The Act aims to reduce obstetric fistula incidence in developing countries by providing surgery, post-surgery care, and educational materials. The Act defines obstetric fistula as a rupture in tissues during obstructed childbirth without medical attention. Amendments to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 are included. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to authorize the President to provide assistance for the establishment of twelve obstetric fistula treatment centers in developing countries, with a focus on Africa. Consultation with various stakeholders is required for site selection. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to authorize the establishment of twelve obstetric fistula treatment centers in developing countries, with a focus on Africa. Each center will provide surgery and post-surgery care for women in need, including transportation, shelter, and food assistance. Activities to reduce the incidence of obstetric fistula will also be carried out. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to establish twelve obstetric fistula treatment centers in developing countries, focusing on Africa. These centers will provide surgery, post-surgery care, and activities to reduce the incidence of obstetric fistula. The President is required to report annually to Congress on the implementation of these efforts. $35,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year 2005 and 2006 for this purpose. Obstetric fistula is a condition that occurs in obstructed childbirth without adequate medical attention."
