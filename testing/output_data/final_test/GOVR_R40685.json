    "content": "The annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill funds agencies in three federal departments, including the Department of the Interior, Forest Service, Indian Health Service, and Environmental Protection Agency. It also provides funding for arts and cultural agencies like the Smithsonian Institution and the National Endowment for the Arts. The appropriations laws for Interior and Related Agencies previously funded DOE programs, Naval Petroleum Reserves, and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. However, in the 109th Congress, these DOE programs were transferred to energy and water subcommittees, while EPA and smaller entities were moved to Interior and Related Agencies subcommittees. This change was due to the abolition of subcommittees covering Veterans Affairs, Housing, and Urban Development. The report is organized into three primary titles: Title I covers Interior agencies, Title II discusses EPA, and Title III addresses other agencies, programs, and entities. A fourth section covers selected cross-cutting topics. The report highlights key funding changes and policy issues related to agencies and issues funded in the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. Appropriations legislation is complex, with budget submissions for agencies containing numerous funding and programmatic changes. Appropriations laws fund various accounts and activities, with explanatory statements providing additional directives. The term appropriations in this report includes total funds available, excluding permanent mandatory budget authorities. FY2009 appropriations levels for agencies and programs are detailed in the report. For more information on programs funded in the bill, contact key policy staff members listed at the end of the report. The report contains FY2009 appropriations levels for agencies, programs, and activities as enacted in the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 (P.L. 111-8). Additional funding was provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. These funds were available for obligation until September 30, 2010. The report provides information on stimulus funds allocated in FY2009, sourced from House and Senate Appropriations Committees, agency budget justifications, and the Congressional Record. The FY2010 appropriations for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies saw a significant increase compared to previous years. The total budget for FY2010 was $32.29 billion, a $4.97 billion increase from FY2004 in current dollars. This represented an 18.2% increase in current dollars or a 2.6% increase in constant dollars. The FY2010 appropriations for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies totaled $32.29 billion, a $4.97 billion increase from FY2004. This represented an 18.2% increase in current dollars or a 2.6% increase in constant dollars. The House, Senate, and Administration had initially supported higher levels for FY2010, but the final appropriation was $6.50 billion less than FY2009. The FY2010 appropriations for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies totaled $32.29 billion, a $4.97 billion increase from FY2004. This was $201.1 million less than the House approved and $228.3 million less than the Obama Administration requested. Funding and policy issues debated included oil and gas leasing, wildland fire fighting, Indian trust fund management, and climate change. Other issues included funding for Bureau of Indian Affairs construction, education, and housing; Indian Health Service construction and urban Indian health; wastewater/drinking water needs; land acquisition; and the Superfund program. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages public land for various uses, including energy development, grazing, recreation, and preservation. They oversee federal mineral estate and operations on Indian Trust lands. In FY2010, BLM received $1.14 billion in appropriations, with an additional $305.0 million in stimulus funds. This funding does not include funds for DOI Wildland Fire Management. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) received $958.6 million in appropriations for Management of Lands and Resources in FY2010, which was $16.8 million less than the Administration's request but $68.4 million higher than FY2009. An additional $125.0 million was allocated for activities like remediation of abandoned mines and maintenance of facilities. The FY2010 law provided increased appropriations for soil, water, and air management, with $18.4 million more than FY2009. This included $15.0 million for BLM to address climate change impacts. Land and realty management saw a $16.9 million increase to promote renewable energy development on public lands. The FY2010 law allocated funds for renewable energy coordination offices and additional staff at BLM offices. Concerns were raised about the impact of renewable energy development on federal lands, leading to a directive for DOI and the Forest Service to report on site selection, coordination of projects, infrastructure removal, and other related issues. The Interior appropriations law for energy and minerals in FY2010 totaled $156.2 million, with differing opinions on funding sources among the Administration, House, and Senate. The Administration's request for funding in FY2010 included discretionary appropriations of $110.7 million and collections of $45.5 million in offsetting fees from oil and gas drilling permits. They proposed increasing the permit fee from $4,000 to $6,500 per application and repealing provisions redirecting mineral leasing revenues. The House and Senate supported $89.7 million in discretionary funds, while the Administration anticipated offsetting the loss of mandatory funds with increased appropriations and higher fees. The FY2010 Interior appropriations law provided $89.7 million in discretionary appropriations, $45.5 million in offsetting fees by increasing the APD fee to $6,500, and $21.0 million in mandatory funds for energy and minerals. Total FY2009 funding was $156.8 million, with $99.4 million in discretionary appropriations, $36.4 million in offsetting fees, and $21.0 million in mandatory funds. The law also allocated $64.0 million for the wild horse and burro program, $3.5 million less than requested but $23.4 million more than FY2009. This funding aimed to reduce the number of wild horses and burros on BLM lands. The FY2010 law provided increased funding for activities related to wild horses and burros, including gathers, population control, and adoptions. It also prohibited the slaughter of healthy animals and required BLM to develop a new long-term management plan. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed BLM to include private proposals in the plan. The FY2010 law provided increased funding for the management of wild horses and burros, including private proposals. It also allocated $74.6 million for the National Landscape Conservation System, an increase of $7.9 million from the previous year. Additionally, $8.6 million was appropriated for BLM construction projects in FY2010. The FY2010 funding allocated $180.0 million to BLM for construction projects, including energy efficient retrofits and road repairs. Land acquisition received $29.7 million, with a focus on specific acquisitions in five states. Funding for BLM acquisitions had decreased from $49.9 million in FY2002 to $8.9 million in FY2008. The FY2010 Interior appropriations law allocated $1.65 billion for Fish and Wildlife Service accounts, slightly more than the Administration's request of $1.64 billion. This amount was higher than the FY2009 appropriation but lower than the total including stimulus funds. The law also included a Senate amendment regarding the use of funds on public lands for border control activities. The FY2010 Interior appropriations law allocated $1.65 billion for Fish and Wildlife Service accounts, slightly more than the Administration's request. The largest portion of the FWS annual appropriation is the Resource Management account, which received an increase in funding for programs such as the Endangered Species program and Law Enforcement. Congress also approved a new line item for Climate Change Adaptive Science Capacity within Resource Management. The FY2010 appropriation for the Resource Management account of the Fish and Wildlife Service was $179.5 million, an increase of 14% from the previous year. The funding was allocated to address a backlog of candidate species awaiting listing decisions and to improve the consultation program. Additionally, the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund received an increase to $100.0 million to benefit conservation efforts for listed species. The President proposed increasing the program budget to $100.0 million in FY2010, but Congress appropriated $85.0 million. The total FY2010 appropriation for refuge operations was $264.5 million, a 13% increase over FY2009. The FY2010 Interior appropriations law provided $503.3 million for refuge operations and maintenance, increasing all categories of refuge spending. Operations costs have risen due to various factors including hurricane damage and border enforcement. Refuge funding was not keeping pace with new demands, leading to cuts in programs aiding endangered species, invasive species control, habitat restoration, and staffing. FY2009 stimulus law provided additional funding, but ongoing problems are expected after the stimulus funding is exhausted. Congress approved $65.8 million for nationwide law enforcement, exceeding the request and FY2009 appropriations. For FY2010, a new line item of $20.0 million was proposed to address climate change, with half the funding supporting work with partners to develop strategies at local and regional scales. The other half would fund cooperative scientific research on climate change's impact on wildlife and habitat, supporting Landscape Conservation Cooperatives. The Administration requested a $65.0 million increase for land acquisition in FY2010, with the Interior appropriations law providing a higher increase to $86.3 million. The funding was primarily allocated to acquisition of land for federal refuges, funded by the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The FWS has a source of mandatory spending for land acquisition through the MBCA, with funds derived from the sale of duck stamps and import duties. The National Wildlife Refuge Fund compensates counties for federal lands presence, but additional appropriations are needed. The Administration requested $14.1 million for FY2010, with an appropriation of $14.5 million. The FY2010 appropriation for the Multinational Species Conservation Fund was $11.5 million, higher than the President's request of $10.0 million. The Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Fund received $5.0 million in FY2010, an increase from the requested $4.8 million. State and Tribal Wildlife Grants also received funding. State and Tribal Wildlife Grants, created in FY2001, help fund conservation efforts for species of concern to states, territories, and tribes. The FY2010 appropriation was $5.0 million, with the Administration requesting $115.0 million for FY2010, an increase from $75.0 million in FY2009. Funds can be used for state conservation plans and practical conservation projects, with a portion set aside for competitive grants to tribal governments. The proposed $40.0 million increase for states and tribes to incorporate climate change adaptation strategies into wildlife action plans was not provided by Congress. The Senate Appropriations Committee stated that states already had the authority to address climate change within the existing program. Additionally, the FY2010 appropriations law reduced the required state match for planning grants from 50% to 25% and the state share of implementation grants from 50% to 35%. This program, funded by an excise tax on hunting equipment, provides grants to states for activities benefiting hunters and hunting programs. The Administration requested $28.0 million for hunter education and outreach, targeting under-represented groups. Congress did not allocate funding for this program in FY2010, citing sufficient funding elsewhere. Total NPS appropriations for FY2010 were $2.74 billion, an increase from the previous year. The National Park Service received $2.74 billion in total appropriations for FY2010, with $2.26 billion allocated for the Operation of the National Park System account. This funding supports the administration and conservation of the National Park System's 391 units covering 85 million acres. The FY2009 funding, including stimulus appropriations, totaled $3.28 billion. The National Park Service received $2.74 billion in total appropriations for FY2010, with $2.26 billion allocated for the Operation of the National Park System account. This funding supports various activities and services essential for park operations, including resource stewardship, visitor services, facility maintenance, and administrative expenses. Additionally, $10.0 million was allocated for NPS climate change activities, and $102.6 million for the U.S. Park Police, a law enforcement entity with jurisdiction in Washington, DC, New York City, and San Francisco. The US Park Police received $15.0 million for the signature projects matching program in FY2010 to refurbish and prepare the National Park System for its 100th anniversary in 2016. The program aimed to leverage private donations for park projects, with at least 50% of project costs coming from non-federal sources. The Administration had requested $25.0 million for signature projects, but the Senate did not approve funds for this purpose. The Senate did not approve funds for signature projects in FY2009. The conferees on the FY2010 appropriations bill expressed concern about the Park Service's management of recreation fee revenues and directed the agency to report on earlier projects and criteria for new ones. They noted the need for dramatic changes to reduce a carryover balance of over $270 million. The Park Service has the authority to reduce fees retained at park units from 80% to 60% to address this issue. The Interior appropriations law in FY2010 provided $68.4 million for National Recreation and Preservation (NR&P), an increase from previous years. This funding supports various park system activities, including resource protection programs, environmental compliance, and technical assistance for preserving natural and cultural resources. Additionally, the law allocated $5.9 million for statutory and contractual aid, slightly higher than the previous year. The FY2010 law included $5.9 million for statutory and contractual aid, slightly higher than the previous year. The Obama Administration proposed discontinuing funding for the program that provides financial assistance through partnerships to areas not managed by the NPS. The appropriation for heritage partnership programs was $17.8 million, supporting national heritage areas (NHAs) not owned or managed by the NPS. Appropriators have concerns about the increasing number of NHAs and prefer funding new areas through savings from mature programs. The FY2010 appropriation included $4.6 million for the \"Preserve America\" matching grant program, which supports preservation efforts through heritage tourism and historic preservation planning. The Historic Preservation Fund (HPF) administered by the NPS provides grants for restoring historic districts, sites, buildings, and objects significant in American history. The HPF also includes funding for Save America's Treasures, a grant program for preservation work on nationally significant cultural artifacts and historic structures. The FY2010 appropriations law provided $79.5 million for the Historic Preservation Fund (HPF), including $46.5 million for state grants and $8.0 million for tribal preservation grants. An additional $25.0 million was allocated for Save America's Treasures, with $10.2 million designated for specific projects. The law also included $4.6 million for the Preserve America matching grant program, which supports heritage tourism and historic preservation planning. The FY2010 Interior appropriations law moved the Preserve America program from the HPF to the National Recreation and Preservation account. The FY2010 appropriation for NPS construction was $233.0 million, a $27.0 million increase over the Administration's request. An additional $589.0 million in stimulus funds was enacted for FY2009. The Construction line item funds new construction projects, improvements, repair, rehabilitation, and replacement of park facilities. It also includes funding for general management planning and NPS road construction and repair. The FY2010 Interior appropriations law provided funding for addressing deferred maintenance for the NPS, with estimates ranging from $8.23 billion to $12.11 billion. Additionally, $589.0 million was allocated for NPS construction from the stimulus law. Funding for Land Acquisition and State Assistance in FY2010 saw a significant increase to $126.3 million, with $86.3 million designated for NPS land acquisition from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. In FY2010, $86.3 million was allocated for NPS land acquisition from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. State assistance funds of $40.0 million were designated for recreation-related land acquisition and planning by states. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) received funding for various activities related to natural hazards, geological resources, and water quality assessment. The FY2010 Interior appropriations law provided $1.11 billion for the USGS, which was $67.9 million above the FY2009 omnibus appropriation of $1.04 billion. An additional $140.0 million in stimulus funding was appropriated for FY2009. The FY2010 appropriation also exceeded the Administration's request and provided more funding for all eight USGS activities compared to FY2009. The FY2010 Interior appropriations law allocated $145.6 million for the National Geospatial Program, an increase from the FY2009 level. This program supports the Federal Geographic Data Committee and aims to provide public access to geospatial information. The National Geospatial Program supports collaboration to make geospatial data available to various government entities and communities. The FY2010 law allocated funds for the Land Remote Sensing Program and Geologic Hazards, Resources, and Processes activities to support earth science information for partners and customers. Landsat satellites provide data for environmental monitoring, while the program serves federal, state, local agencies, NGOs, industry, and academia. The FY2010 law allocated funds for geological hazards assessments, including earthquakes, volcanoes, and landslides, with $92.8 million designated for this purpose. Additionally, $4.0 million was provided for seafloor mapping expeditions and data management infrastructure. Water resources investigations received $232.3 million to support research and monitoring activities. This work is crucial for establishing claims in the Arctic as sea lanes open up due to melting ice. The Resources activity supports water research and monitoring activities addressing water availability, quality, flood, and drought hazards. The Hydrologic Monitoring, Assessments, and Research subactivity includes six federally funded programs focused on groundwater resources, water quality assessment, toxic substances hydrology, research and development, streamflow information, and hydrologic networks. The FY2010 law allocated $160.2 million for this activity, aiming to enhance the National Streamgage Network in support of climate change. The increase in funding for the National Streamgage Network aims to support climate change monitoring and re-establish discontinued streamgages. Additionally, funding was allocated for the U.S.-Mexico Transboundary Aquifer Assessment Program and the Biological Research Program to conserve and manage biological resources. The FY2010 Interior appropriations law provided $204.9 million for biological research, including $5.0 million for scientific studies. The FY2010 Interior appropriations law increased funding for biological research and monitoring, including studies on species at risk in changing arctic ecosystems. The funding also supported the expansion of USGS forecasting capacity in the Arctic region. Additionally, research on the impact of endocrine disrupters on water quality and wildlife diseases was encouraged. The FY2010 appropriations law increased funding for various USGS activities, including Enterprise Information, Science Support, and Facilities. These activities cover information technology, scientific information management, and maintenance costs. The law also consolidated climate change research within the USGS. The FY2010 appropriations law increased funding for USGS activities, including an integrated global climate change research program. $58.2 million was allocated for this program, with $17.5 million above the FY2009 level. The program aims to provide science, monitoring, and predictive modeling on climate change effects in the United States. $5.0 million of the increase was designated for the National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center, bringing its total funding to $15.0 million for FY2010. The FY2010 appropriations law increased funding for USGS activities, including an integrated global climate change research program. $7.0 million of the increase was allocated for research on geologic carbon sequestration, bringing total funding to $10.0 million. The National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center aims to evaluate global climate change models and serve as a model for implementing an integrated approach to climate change science and adaptation by the DOI. Locations for regional centers under the NCCWSC are to be selected through a collaborative process involving federal, state, and tribal agencies, universities, and other partners. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) oversees the Offshore Energy and Minerals Management (OEMM) Program and the Minerals Revenue Management (MRM) Program. OEMM manages leasing on submerged lands in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) for oil, gas, minerals, and alternative energy. MRM collects and distributes revenues from federal onshore and OCS leases. Revenues are allocated to states, the U.S. Treasury, and designated programs. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) disbursed $10.7 billion in FY2009 from mineral leases on federal and Indian lands, with royalties from natural gas and oil leases contributing 29% and 41% respectively of total receipts. Oil royalties increased to 39% in FY2007. Other sources of MMS receipts include bonus bids, rents for leasable minerals, and royalties from coal and other minerals. The FY2010 appropriation for MMS was $348.2 million, slightly higher than the requested amount. The FY2010 appropriation for the Minerals Management Service (MMS) was $348.2 million, slightly higher than the requested amount. The funding level for FY2010 was $136.5 million in appropriations, $45.0 million in cost sharing deductions, and $166.7 million in offsetting collections, including $10.0 million in new inspection fees. A new subactivity for renewable energy programs was proposed at $21.4 million and supported by both the House and the Senate. The MMS has established a new Office of Offshore Alternative Energy Programs to implement offshore renewable energy policies. MMS plans to start its offshore renewable energy leasing program in the North Atlantic and Mid-Atlantic states in FY2010. The Administration proposed new inspection fees and other measures for OCS production, but these were not included in the FY2010 Interior appropriations law. Controversial issues not tied to specific funding accounts were debated during the bill consideration. Oil and gas development moratoria in various regions were also discussed. President Bush lifted executive moratoria on OCS oil and gas leasing in 2008, allowing potential activity in Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico areas. The debate continues on lifting the moratorium in the eastern Gulf of Mexico under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, with some supporting increased domestic supply and others concerned about environmental impacts. The debate continues on lifting the moratorium in the eastern Gulf of Mexico under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act. Some support increasing domestic oil and gas supply, while others are concerned about adverse economic and environmental impacts. The current MMS five-year leasing program is in effect, despite a court order to vacate and remand the 2007-2012 program. The Department of the Interior is conducting a more thorough environmental analysis of certain areas of the OCS in response to the court order. The Bush Administration initiated a new leasing program in August 2008 for the OCS, with a draft proposal published in January 2009. The Obama Administration extended the comment period to 240 days, closing in September 2009. The Secretary of the Interior announced a closer examination of OCS information due to resource assessments and environmental concerns. In April 2009, a report identified resource data gaps, and the MMS was directed to complete a PEIS for the Atlantic OCS within 90 days after enactment of the bill. Royalty relief for OCS oil and gas producers has been debated during consideration of Interior appropriations bills. The MMS has not been collecting royalties on leases awarded in 1998 and 1999 due to missing price thresholds in the lease agreements. A lawsuit filed by Kerr-McGee questioned the Secretary of the Interior's authority to impose price thresholds. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a District Court decision in favor of Kerr-McGee on this matter. Orleans upheld a District Court decision in favor of Kerr-McGee, stating that the Secretary of the Interior lacked authority to set price thresholds in leases under the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected the Administration's appeal on October 5, 2009. The ruling could impact future OCS royalties, with estimated losses ranging from $21-$53 billion over 25 years. The MMS faces challenges in ensuring audit and compliance. The MMS is facing challenges in ensuring audit and compliance, with critics pointing out a less rigorous royalty collection system. The DOI's Inspector General has recommended strengthening administrative controls, including adopting a risk-based compliance approach. The agency's FY2010 budget request reflects a commitment to this approach. Additionally, the DOI established the Royalty Policy Committee to review the MMS Mineral Leasing Program and offered over 100 recommendations for improvement. This included an examination of the Royalty-in-Kind Program, which saw significant growth in oil barrels. The Royalty-in-Kind (RIK) Program experienced significant growth from 41.5 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) sold in 2004 to 112 million BOE sold in 2007. A report by GAO in 2008 suggested improvements to the RIK Program, leading to its phased-in termination. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 established the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) to ensure coal-mined land is reclaimed. The Act also created an Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund funded by coal production fees to address abandoned mine sites. The Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund, funded by coal production fees, is used to reclaim hazardous abandoned sites. Funding for state and tribal grants comes from both annual appropriations and mandatory appropriations. Other activities like federal AML programs and OSM administrative expenses receive annual appropriations. The addition of mandatory appropriations addressed concerns about western states bearing a disproportionate share of reclamation expenses. The Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund, funded by coal production fees, is used to reclaim hazardous abandoned sites. Fee collections exceeded appropriations for several years, resulting in an unappropriated balance of over $2.2 billion by November 2008. Western states pushed for increased AML appropriations to receive more of the unappropriated balances allocated to their state share accounts. Under the restructuring of the program in P.L. 109-432, unappropriated AML collections are being returned in seven annual installments to states and tribes that completed remediation of priority sites. The Administration proposed to end payments to certified states and tribes from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund in FY2010, citing that the funds could be used for any purpose, which goes against the intent of the program. This proposal would require a change in law and is strongly opposed by the affected states and tribes. The House approved $159.4 million for the Office of Surface Mining in FY2010, while the Senate approved $166.9 million. The enacted bill set total funding at $162.9 million. The FY2010 Interior appropriations law included $127.3 million for Regulation and Technology, with most of the increase sought for state and tribal regulatory programs. The House-passed bill set spending from the AML fund at $32.1 million, agreeing with an Administration proposal to end the program supporting federal emergency projects and grants. The Senate approved $39.6 million from the AML fund, $7.5 million over the House's allocation. The FY2010 Interior appropriations law allocated $39.6 million from the AML fund, exceeding the Administration's request and House-passed level. The Bureau of Indian Affairs provides various services to federally recognized tribes, including government operations, law enforcement, and social programs. The Bureau of Indian Affairs provides services to tribes including government operations, law enforcement, social programs, economic development, employment assistance, housing repair, and management of trust assets. Education programs are now under the Bureau of Indian Education. Funding for BIA and BIE in FY2010 was $2.62 billion, with additional appropriations from the FY2009 stimulus law totaling $2.88 billion. The FY2009 stimulus law allocated $450.0 million for BIA construction programs, including road repair, school construction, and maintenance. An additional $50.0 million was designated for workforce training, housing improvement, and loan programs. Key programs for BIA and BIE include law enforcement, education improvement, and tribal college funding. Rising crime rates, methamphetamine use, and juvenile gang activity are concerns on some Indian reservations. The federal government has jurisdiction over major criminal offenses on most Indian reservations, with tribes sharing jurisdiction. BIA funds law enforcement, jails, and courts in Indian country, supporting 191 law enforcement agencies, 91 detention programs, and 288 court systems. However, tribes and BIA have fewer resources compared to state and local jurisdictions, with many BIA and tribal law enforcement agencies having fewer law officers per inhabitant than recommended by the Justice Department. The Justice Department reports that BIA-funded law enforcement agencies lack sufficient officers and face staffing, training, and maintenance issues. In FY2010, $303.2 million was allocated for BIA law enforcement, with a $20 million increase for criminal investigations and police services. In FY2010, funding for BIA law enforcement saw increases for criminal investigations, police services, detention, and corrections. Congress supported additional funding for hiring more officers and staffing new facilities, with a $5.8 million increase for detention and corrections facilities. Tribal courts received $24.7 million, a 25% increase over the House and Administration proposals. In FY2010, funding for BIA law enforcement increased for criminal investigations, police services, detention, and corrections. Congress supported additional funding for hiring more officers and staffing new facilities, with a $5.8 million increase for detention and corrections facilities. The Administration's proposal included increases for development and implementation of corrective action plans to improve tribal courts, with an additional $4.2 million for Tribal Justice Support under BIA law enforcement. The Indian land consolidation program aims to reduce ownership fractionation of Indian trust lands by purchasing small ownership interests. The federal government administers the Indian land consolidation program by purchasing small ownership interests in trust lands and transferring them to Indian tribes or holders of large interests. Funding for the program was transferred to the BIA in FY2010 with an appropriation of $3.0 million. The Obama Administration aimed to maintain the program and develop alternative ways to reduce ownership fractionation. Federal recognition provides unique benefits to Indian tribes, including partial sovereignty, jurisdictional powers, and eligibility for federal Indian programs. The Office of Federal Acknowledgment (OFA) within the Interior Department handles recognition petitions, employing professionals to consider them. The process has been criticized for being lengthy due to a lack of resources, leading some tribes to seek acknowledgment legislation from Congress. The Administration's FY2010 proposal for the Executive Direction and Administrative Services budget activity included $2.7 million for the Office of Federal Acknowledgment (OFA), an increase of $58,000 (2%) over FY2009. Congress approved this amount, which funds the same number of OFA professional employees. The Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) operates 184 schools and dormitories, educating about 44,000 students in 23 states. Tribes and tribal organizations operate 124 of these institutions, with BIE operating the rest. The Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) operates 184 schools and dormitories, educating about 44,000 students in 23 states. BIE also operates two postsecondary schools and provides grants to 26 tribally controlled colleges and two tribally controlled technical colleges. Key issues include low student achievement, schools failing to make adequate yearly progress, increased formula funding, forward funding for tribal colleges, and inadequate school facilities. In school years 2003-2007, 68%-70% of BIE-funded schools failed to make AYP. The chief source of BIE funding for school operations is the Indian School Equalization Program (ISEP) formula grant program. For FY2010, the Administration proposed $391.7 million in ISEP formula funding, an increase of $16.7 million from FY2009. The FY2010 increase of $16.7 million for BIE would be used for textbooks, classroom materials, equipment, and additional education specialists. Congress approved the Administration's proposal for ISEP and required BIE to report on the fiscal impact of restoring schools removed from the system between 1951 and 1972. Tribal college administrators requested a change in funding distribution due to difficulties in planning caused by the disjunction between school years and fiscal years. The Administration proposed forward funding for tribal colleges with a one-time appropriation of $50.0 million for school year 2010-2011. BIE school facilities are old and in need of repair, with $113.0 million allocated for BIA education construction in FY2010. The appropriations law for FY2010 allocated $113.0 million for BIA education construction, a decrease of $15.8 million from FY2009. The budget for replacement school construction saw a reduction of $16.4 million. Additionally, under the stimulus law, BIA education construction received an additional $277.7 million, bringing the total to $406.5 million for education construction in FY2009. OIA provides financial assistance to four insular areas. The Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) manages relations between U.S. territories and freely associated states in the Western Pacific, providing funding to support their fiscal and administrative capacity. OIA funding consists of permanent appropriations and funds from the annual appropriations process, including Assistance to Territories (AT) and Compact of Free Association (CFA) accounts. The Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) provides funding through Assistance to Territories (AT) and Compact of Free Association (CFA) accounts for government operations, infrastructure projects, and natural resource initiatives in U.S. territories and freely associated states. The total OIA request for FY2010 was $423.3 million, with $336.9 million in permanent and indefinite funding required by statutes, including funds from Compacts of Free Association. The FY2010 Interior appropriations law provided $85.2 million in Assistance to Territories (AT) funding, with $75.9 million reserved for technical assistance to territories and $9.3 million for OIA salaries and expenses. Additionally, $5.3 million was provided in Compact of Free Association (CFA) funds. The FY2010 appropriations law allocated $90.5 million to the Office of Insular Affairs (OIA), a $6.5 million increase from the previous year. The law allows for GAO audits of the funding and permits the transfer of funds for rural development projects in Guam. Additionally, Title III authorized the Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians within the Interior Department. The Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians (OST) was authorized by the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994. It oversees the reform of Interior Department management of Indian trust assets, manages tribal funds owned by over 250 tribes, and individual Indian funds (IIM) in about 380,000 accounts. Total asset value exceeds $3.0 billion for tribal funds and $440 million for IIM accounts. The Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians (OST) manages tribal funds and individual Indian funds (IIM) totaling over $3.0 billion and $440 million, respectively. The Administration proposed $186.0 million for FY2010 for OST, with key issues including historical accounting expenditures and possible litigation effects on IIM and tribal accounts. The Office of Historical Trust Accounting, under the OST, manages appropriations for historical accounting. In FY2010, the Administration proposed limiting historical accounting to $56.5 million, with reductions in funds for IIM historical accounting and increases for tribal historical accounting. Enacted appropriations matched the Administration's request. Historical accounting is linked to litigation against the United States by IIM account holders and Indian tribes. The Office of Historical Trust Accounting, managed by the OST, handles appropriations for historical accounting related to litigation by IIM account holders and Indian tribes. Expenditures have shifted from IIM to tribal historical accounting due to increased tribal litigation. The IIM historical accounting process has been costly and time-consuming, with a plan developed in 2003 and last revised in 2007. OST estimated a total cost of $271 million for the IIM plan, to be completed by FY2011 if funded at $40 million per year. This accounting is also influenced by court rulings in the Cobell v. Salazar case, where plaintiffs disagreed with OST's plan. In January 2008, the district court in the Cobell v. Salazar case rejected OST's IIM historical accounting plan due to insufficient congressional appropriations. The appeals court later ordered the district judge to enforce the best accounting Interior can provide with available resources. Despite this, OST continues its IIM historical accounting activities. A settlement of the IIM suit was announced, pending approval by Congress and the court. OST may adjust its allocation of historical accounting appropriations between IIM and tribal historical accounting. Numerous tribal suits were filed in 2006, with 94 tribal trust fund and accounting suits filed by 116 tribes. The Cobell v. Salazar case, a class-action lawsuit filed in 1996, reached a settlement in 2009. The settlement of the IIM suit was announced on December 8, 2009, with the United States agreeing to pay $3.4 billion for historical accounting claims. $1.4 billion will go to plaintiffs, and $2.0 billion will be used to purchase fractionated land interests from IIM account-holders. Approval from Congress and the district court is required for the settlement. The Cobell plaintiffs had varying estimates of the total owed, ranging from $176 billion to $48 billion. In 2008, the district court ruled that the United States owed $455.6 million in restitution to the IIM plaintiffs, which was later vacated in 2009. The new settlement agreement is $3.4 billion, with $1.4 billion going to plaintiffs and $2.0 billion for purchasing fractionated land interests. The Cobell settlement addressed issues related to appropriations for historical accounting and potential costs of settling the litigation. The use of the Judgment Fund relieved concerns about jeopardizing spending on other Indian programs. However, the settlement did not cover tribal trust fund and accounting suits, which could involve larger potential costs. Tribal claims may exceed the IIM claim in value, indicating that tribal settlements could be more costly than the Cobell settlement. The EPA's responsibilities include regulating air and water quality, pesticides, and waste management. In FY2010, $10.29 billion was provided for the EPA, an increase from previous years. Congressional appropriations for the EPA in FY2009 totaled $14.86 billion, including stimulus funds. In FY2009, Congress appropriated $14.86 billion for EPA. Funding levels for FY2010 were compared to appropriations enacted in FY2009. Attention was on federal assistance for infrastructure projects, environmental cleanup, and climate change research. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative expanded EPA's efforts. Certain EPA regulatory actions also received attention, such as fuel sulfur standards for steamships. The FY2010 funding increases for EPA focused on capitalization grants for Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds (SRFs) for local wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects. The Clean Water SRF received $2.10 billion, and the Drinking Water SRF received $1.39 billion in funding. This provision impacts proposed EPA regulations of ship and port emissions under the Clean Air Act. In FY2010, the Clean Water SRF received $2.10 billion, and the Drinking Water SRF received $1.39 billion in funding. The appropriations were below the amounts proposed by the House and the President but more than three times the FY2009 levels. Additional funding was provided in FY2009 through the stimulus law. EPA allocates annual appropriations based on a formula authorized in the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act. States must provide 20% matching funds to receive federal grants. The Safe Drinking Water Act requires states to provide 20% matching funds to receive federal funds for State Revolving Funds (SRFs). SRFs are used to issue low-interest loans for water infrastructure projects, with repayments going back into the funds for new loans. Advocates argue for more federal funding to meet long-term community needs and expanding water quality requirements. The FY2010 Interior appropriations law mandated that a portion of funds for Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds (SRFs) be used for green infrastructure and innovative projects. It also required states to provide additional subsidies through principal forgiveness, negative interest loans, or grants. In FY2010, construction projects funded by Clean Water and Drinking Water revolving loan funds must comply with the Davis-Bacon Act, which mandates paying prevailing wages to workers. Congress has debated the application of Davis-Bacon to these programs. Additionally, Congress allocated $156.8 million for special project grants in the STAG account, separate from SRF capitalization grants. The FY2010 Interior appropriations law required recipients to provide matching funds for special project grants, with exceptions for financial hardship. The President's FY2010 budget did not include funding for these projects, as past administrations viewed them as Congress' priorities. The Hazardous Substance Superfund (Superfund) account supports the assessment and cleanup of contaminated sites under EPA's program. The Superfund program, established under CERCLA, allocates funding for cleaning up hazardous waste sites. The FY2010 appropriation for the Superfund account was $1.31 billion, slightly less than what the President and Senate had supported. Funding levels have remained consistent over the years, with an additional $600.0 million provided by the stimulus law. The Superfund program received $600.0 million for remedial cleanup projects, with nearly half of the funding allocated to these long-term actions. Members of Congress emphasize the importance of steady federal funding and contributions from responsible parties to meet cleanup needs. There is a debate over the need for more federal funds to improve the pace and quality of cleanup at sites without responsible parties. There is also a discussion about reinstating Superfund taxes on industry to support the Hazardous Substance Superfund Trust Fund, as the authority to collect these taxes expired in 1995. Congress has been increasing revenues from the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury to finance the Superfund program. Congress has increased revenues from the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury to support the Superfund Trust Fund after the expiration of industry taxes. Industry now contributes through corporate income taxes, along with individual income taxes and other federal receipts. The EPA also administers a program for cleaning up brownfields, which are commercial and industrial properties with less hazardous contamination levels. The EPA administers a program for cleaning up brownfields, which are commercial and industrial properties with less hazardous contamination levels. Section 104(k) of CERCLA authorizes EPA to award grants for the assessment and cleanup of individual brownfields, funded through the STAG account. The Interior appropriations law provided $173.4 million for EPA's Brownfields program. The FY2010 funding for EPA was $174.7 million, primarily for administrative expenses. This amount was an increase from FY2009 levels but less than the total appropriation of $269.5 million for FY2009. EPA's efforts to address climate change and greenhouse gas emissions were of interest to Congress. EPA funding for climate change activities represents less than 2% of total federal funding for such activities and was included in three EPA accounts: Science and Technology (S&T), EPM, and STAG. The FY2010 appropriations law allocated $161.5 million for EPA climate change research and implementation activities, with the House proposing $163.1 million and the Senate proposing $151.5 million. This funding is above the FY2009 enacted appropriations of $139.0 million. The law also mandated EPA to study domestic and international black carbon emissions, focusing on sources, impacts on climate, and quantifying effects compared to carbon emissions. The FY2010 appropriations law allocated funds for EPA climate change research, including a study on black carbon emissions and their climatic effects compared to other greenhouse gases. Title IV included provisions restricting funds for certain climate change activities affecting livestock operations and requiring a report on climate change expenditures. Section 425 of the FY2010 appropriations law prohibited the use of funds for mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from manure management systems. Section 426 required the President to report on federal obligations and expenditures for climate change programs in FY2009 and FY2010. EPA's proposed rule on greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act was central to the climate change debate. Multiple Senate amendments were filed regarding this rule. The \"Air Act\" published in April 2009 included multiple Senate amendments aimed at delaying or restricting EPA's implementation of regulations, particularly regarding carbon dioxide from stationary sources. The President's FY2010 request proposed a Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to address issues like invasive species and pollution. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, based on strategic planning and recommendations of the Great Lakes Interagency Task Force, will be implemented through grants and agreements with various organizations. The Interior appropriations law allocated $475.0 million for the initiative, with provisions for EPA to transfer funding to other federal departments. Funding will support Great Lakes programs, including grants to state and local governments and nonprofit organizations. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative will provide funding for restoration activities conducted by non-federal partners, with a focus on financial relief for recipients facing hardship. The initiative combines federal Great Lakes programs, including the EPA's Great Lakes National Program Office and the Great Lakes Legacy Act, to clean up contaminated sediments. EPA is directed to develop a comprehensive restoration plan through the existing Great Lakes Regional Collaboration. The EPA is directed to develop a restoration plan based on the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration Strategy, with input from stakeholders. Annual reports on funding allocations by federal agencies will be provided starting in 2010. In FY2010, the Interior appropriations law provided $5.30 billion for the Forest Service, $551.5 million more than FY2009. In FY2010, the Interior appropriations law provided $5.30 billion for the Forest Service, $551.5 million more than FY2009. FS appropriations are provided in major accounts including Forest and Rangeland Research, State and Private Forestry, National Forest System, Wildland Fire Management, Capital Improvement and Maintenance, Land Acquisition, and Other programs. Significant budget issues for FY2010 included funding for wildfire suppression and cabin user fees. The enacted provision prohibited fee increases in 2010 of more than 25% of the 2009 fee. The FY2010 Interior appropriations law provided $312.0 million for FS Research, $3.4 million more than the House, $5.0 million more than the Senate, and $11.4 million more than the Administration. State and Private Forestry programs received $308.1 million, $0.6 million more than the House and $2.0 million more than the request, and $31.1 million more than the Senate. The enacted levels matched higher Senate funding for forest inventory and analysis and nearly matched higher House funding for research and development, including additional funding for global climate change science. The FY2010 enacted State and Private Forestry (S&PF) funding increased forest health management programs and cooperative fire assistance. The funding levels were between the House and Senate-passed levels for various forestry programs, exceeding the Administration's request for some accounts. The FY2010 enacted funding for forest programs exceeded the Administration's request. The forest legacy program received $76.5 million, slightly more than the House and $14.6 million less than the President's request. $5.0 million was provided for the Economic Action Program. The National Forest System received $1.55 billion, $44.8 million more than the Administration's request. The FY2010 enacted funding for forest programs exceeded the Administration's request, with nearly every activity receiving more than requested. Funding for four activities matched the House-passed and Senate-passed levels, while funding for other activities was between the House-passed and Senate-passed levels. The exception was vegetation and watershed management, which saw a modest reduction from both levels. This account includes funding for construction and maintenance of facilities, roads, trails, and deferred maintenance. The FY2010 Interior appropriations law provided $538.1 million for construction and maintenance of facilities, roads, and trails, with an additional $18.0 million deferred for road and trail fund payments. The agency's deferred maintenance backlog was estimated at $5.1 billion as of September 30, 2008. The law also allocated $90.0 million for specific deferred maintenance accounts. The FY2010 Interior appropriations law allocated $90.0 million for legacy road remediation, $10.0 million less than the House-passed level and $40.0 million more than the Senate-passed level. The law did not fund the proposed \"Presidential Initiative: Protecting the National Forests\" at $50.0 million. $64.8 million was provided for FS land acquisition, including $63.5 million for LWCF, which was $4.3 million less than the Senate-approved amount and $26.7 million more than the House-approved amount. The Indian Health Service (IHS) in the Department of Health and Human Services provides medical services for American Indians and Alaska Natives through a network of facilities. As of October 2008, IHS operated 31 hospitals, 61 health centers, 2 school health centers, and 30 health stations. The Indian Health Service (IHS) operates numerous healthcare facilities for American Indians and Alaska Natives, including hospitals, health centers, school health centers, and health stations. In FY2010, IHS received $4.05 billion in appropriations, with additional funding from the FY2009 stimulus law. They also receive funding from third-party reimbursements, a special Indian diabetes program, and rents on personnel. In FY2010, the Indian Health Service (IHS) received $4.05 billion in appropriations, with additional funding from third-party reimbursements, a special Indian diabetes program, and rents on personnel quarters. The IHS funding is divided into Health Services and Facilities categories, with 90% allocated to Health Services and 10% to Facilities. Key budget issues for FY2010 include the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund, Contract Health Services, contract support costs in Health Services, and the health care facilities construction program in Facilities. Congress approved a $45.5 million appropriation for the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund, a significant increase from the previous year. In FY2010, the Indian Health Service received $4.05 billion in appropriations, including a $45.5 million increase for the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund (IHCIF). IHCIF provides additional funding to reduce deficiencies in health status and resources among IHS operating units. Allocation is based on a formula to address funding disparities, with funds prioritized for units with the lowest percentage of funding needs met. In FY2008, IHS operating units nationwide received 54.5% of their total needed funds, with funding ranging from 25.1% to 100%. 46 units were below 40% funded. FY2009 IHCIF funding aimed to bring all units to at least 40% of need. FY2010 funding was directed to bring units up to 45% of need. $779.3 million was allocated for Contract Health Services in FY2010, a 23% increase from FY2009. CHS funds essential health services from local providers when IHS cannot provide care. In FY2010, the Contract Health Services (CHS) program received a 23% increase in funding to address medical needs in IHS regions with limited facilities. The Catastrophic Health Emergency Fund (CHEF) within CHS covers high-cost cases above $25,000, but funding may not always meet demand. The proposed increase in funding aimed to reduce denials of CHS requests, but the exact impact was not estimated. In FY2010, the Catastrophic Health Emergency Fund (CHEF) received $48.0 million, a 55% increase from FY2009. This increase would fund 700 additional high-cost cases. Contract support costs (CSC) for FY2010 were $398.5 million, a 41% increase from FY2009, to help tribes administer IHS-funded programs. The CSC program, funded by the Assistance Act, covers costs for tribes including financial management, training, and program start-up. Shortfalls in CSC funding have led to reduced services and efficiency for tribes. The Administration's proposed increase would benefit tribes with contracts or compacts, but it's unclear if it will fully fund existing agreements. Congress approved $29.2 million for health care facility construction, a decrease from previous appropriations. Additional funding from the stimulus law will complete up to two facilities. The Indian Health Service received $227.0 million in stimulus funding for health care facilities construction in FY2009, totaling $267.0 million. The FY2010 request aimed to continue construction of a hospital and two health centers, focusing on completing ongoing projects. Increased appropriations are needed for facility construction due to the poor condition of many IHS facilities. The Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation was established to resolve a land dispute between the tribes. The Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation (ONHIR) was established to resolve a land dispute between the tribes. ONHIR's activities include land and housing acquisition, infrastructure construction, and post-move assistance for families being relocated. The FY2010 appropriations law allocated $8.0 million for ONHIR, with concerns about the speed of relocation and possible evictions. The Navajo-Hopi relocation began in 1977, with 98.5% of eligible Navajo families and 100% of eligible Hopi families completing relocation by FY2007. However, new families may delay the process. Around 125 Navajo families living on Hopi land may opt out of accommodation agreements and relocate using ONHIR benefits, potentially extending relocation beyond FY2009. Post-move assistance would require two more years of expenditures after the last relocation move. The Smithsonian Institution (SI) is a museum and research complex with 19 museums, galleries, and the National Zoo. It had over 25.2 million visitors in 2008 and received $1 billion in revenue in FY2008 from federal appropriations and private trust. For FY2010, $761.4 million was allocated to SI, an increase from previous years. Funding was provided for Salaries and Expenses, Facilities. For FY2010, the Smithsonian Institution received $636.2 million for salaries and expenses, facilities capital, and the Legacy Fund. The funding increase was for salaries, utilities, rent, security, IT improvements, facilities maintenance, collections care, and governance support. An additional $2.0 million was allocated for a museum-wide collections care initiative. A Senate amendment included $250,000 for activities under the Civil Rights History Project Act of 2009. Studies estimate a $2.5 billion investment over ten years. The FY2010 law allocated $125.0 million for Facilities Capital, including $89.3 million for revitalization and $35.7 million for facilities planning and design. An additional $25.0 million in stimulus funding was provided for FY2009. Studies estimate a $2.5 billion investment over ten years is needed to address advanced facilities deterioration. The Legacy Fund, established by Congress in 2008 for the National Museum of African American History and Culture, received federal funding in FY2008, FY2009, and FY2010. Private donations were required to match federal funds, with specific restrictions on how the money could be used. The Legacy Fund, established for the National Museum of African American History and Culture, received federal funding in FY2008, FY2009, and FY2010. Private donations were required to match federal funds with specific restrictions on use. The Smithsonian Institution's net assets decreased in FY2008 to just under $2.4 billion, with federal support for the arts and humanities through the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities. The National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities includes the NEA, NEH, Federal Council on the Arts and Humanities, and IMLS. NEA and NEH have been operating on temporary authority since FY1993. NEA is a major federal supporter of arts disciplines, providing grants to all states. In FY2010, NEA received $167.5 million in funding, an increase from previous years. The NEH received $167.5 million in funding for FY2010, an increase of $12.5 million from FY2009. The majority of the increase was for grants, which support humanities education, research, preservation, and public programs. The federal/state partnership grants program, NEH's largest program, received $40.4 million. The federal/state partnership grants program received $40.4 million for FY2010, an increase of $5.4 million from FY2009. The \"We the People\" initiative received $14.5 million, equal to the budget request. The Administration's proposed relocation of the National Capital Arts and Cultural Affairs Program was not included in the FY2010 appropriations law. Environmental deterioration in South Florida is attributed to altered natural water flows caused by canals, levees, and urban development. In 1996, Congress authorized the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to create a plan to restore the South Florida ecosystem, including the Everglades. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was completed in 1999, with federal involvement authorized by the Water Resources Development Act of 2000. WRDA 2000 is considered the key law for Everglades restoration, with appropriations provided for restoration projects in the region. Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations laws have funded DOI agencies for restoration projects in southern Florida, including CERP and non-CERP activities. Federal and state funding for South Florida ecosystem restoration projects has exceeded $3.3 billion and $12.0 billion, respectively. The average annual federal cost for restoration activities in southern Florida is expected to be around $286 million. FY2010 Interior appropriations did not specify total funding for Everglades restoration. Total funding for Everglades restoration is typically determined by the Administration's budget request for the following year. The FY2010 Interior appropriations did not specify total funding for Everglades restoration until the Administration's budget request for the subsequent year. The Modified Water Deliveries Project (Mod Waters) received $8.4 million in funding, a significant reduction from previous levels. Mod Waters aims to improve water deliveries to Everglades National Park and restore natural hydrological conditions within the park. Funding and planning for the Tamiami Trail portion of Mod Waters are being conducted by the Corps. The FY2009 omnibus appropriations law provided funding for the Mod Waters project, specifically for the Tamiami Trail project to increase water flows to Everglades National Park. The project includes building a 1-mile bridge and raising a canal by 1 foot, with an estimated cost of $227 million. Funding for Mod Waters in FY2010 will support ongoing work on the Tamiami Trail and bridge modifications, aiming for completion at the earliest possible date. The House committee urged the Department of the Interior to continue efforts in restoring the Everglades. The committee urged DOI to focus on Everglades restoration projects with the greatest benefits. Concerns arise over federal commitment to CERP implementation due to limited authorized projects since WRDA 2000. Some believe federal funding will increase as projects move to construction phase. The LWCF is authorized at $900 million annually through FY2015 for acquiring lands and funding recreational development by federal land management agencies and state/local governments. Congress has appropriated roughly $32 billion to the LWCF from FY1965 to FY2009. From FY1965 to FY2009, approximately $32 billion was credited to the LWCF, with about $15 billion appropriated. Funding for LWCF has varied over time, with FY2010 seeing an increase in appropriations to $450.4 million. This included $265.8 million for federal land acquisition, as well as $12.1 million for land appraisals. The FY2010 appropriation for federal land acquisition was $111.9 million, more than double the level of five years ago. The conferees expressed concern with the processes for acquiring lands and provided directives to the agencies to use funds for acquiring high-priority lands threatened by development. They also addressed delays in conducting land appraisals. The conferees directed the DOI and Agriculture Secretaries to harmonize land acquisition policies and report findings to Congress. Concerns were raised about LWCF-funded lands being used inconsistently and notification was required before changing land use. The FY2010 appropriation for stateside grants was $40.0 million, more than double the FY2009 level. The Administration, House, and Senate sought increased funds for the program. Appropriations for the state grant program are allocated to states based on a formula in law. Funding has ranged from $19.0 million to $143.9 million over the past decade. Revenue from certain OCS leasing is provided to the stateside grant program. In FY2010, $9.7 million was projected to be collected and disbursed. Additionally, funds were allocated for FWS Cooperative Endangered Species grants and the FS Forest Legacy program at $56.0 million and $76.5 million, respectively. Since FY2008, the largest portion of the LWCF appropriation has been for land acquisition. Wildfire protection programs and funding remain controversial, with ongoing discussions about the high cost of fire suppression efforts, locations for fire protection treatments, and challenges hindering fuel reduction and post-fire rehabilitation. FS and DOI wildfire line items include funds for fire suppression, preparedness, and operations. Comparing FY2010 appropriations with Senate- and House-passed levels, Administration-requested funds, and FY2009. The FY2010 Interior appropriations law provided $3.37 billion for Wildland Fire Management, with $2.52 billion for the FS and $855.9 million for DOI. This amount included $200.0 million in prior-year funds, totaling $3.57 billion for FY2010. The funding was slightly less than the House, slightly more than the Senate, and higher than the Administration's request. Additionally, it was $183.5 million less than total FY2009 funding. The FY2010 law established new FLAME funds for DOI and the FS, including funding for wildfire preparedness totaling $965.5 million, slightly more than the Administration's request. The funding matched the requested amount for FS fire preparedness and was less than the Senate and House levels. The FY2010 Interior appropriations law established the FLAME Wildfire Suppression Reserve Fund for DOI and the Department of Agriculture. The funds are used for large or complex fires when Wildland Fire Management accounts are exhausted. Each Secretary can transfer funds from the FLAME fund for suppression activities. The FLAME fund is used for wildfire suppression when Wildland Fire Management accounts are depleted. A secretarial declaration is required for the fund to be activated, typically for fires over 300 acres or posing a threat to lives, property, or resources. The conferees aim to fully fund suppression needs without borrowing from other programs, directing the Secretaries to develop new methods for estimating funding needs. The FY2010 appropriations law allocated $474.0 million for the FLAME funds, supplementing the FS and DOI fire suppression funding totaling $1.38 billion. In FY2010, appropriations for wildfire suppression totaled $1.86 billion, with $1.41 billion for the FS and $444.8 million for DOI. The House, Administration, and Senate all approved $1.86 billion for wildfire suppression but structured the funding differently. The Senate allocated $664.3 million for wildfire suppression, $357.0 million for Wildland Fire Suppression Reserve Funds, and $834.0 million for a new FLAME fund. For FY2010, the Interior appropriations law provided $751.9 million for other wildland fire operations, including burned area rehabilitation, biomass fuels reduction, research, and assistance to states and private entities. Fuel reduction activities received the bulk of funding, with $556.5 million allocated ($350.3 million for the FS and $206.2 million for DOI), an increase of $36.1 million over the Administration's request. The enacted level for fuel reduction in FY2010 matched the Senate-passed level, with $611.2 million allocated ($378.1 million for the FS and $233.1 million for DOI). For burned area rehabilitation, the FY2010 Interior appropriations law provided $31.9 million, slightly exceeding the Senate level. The enacted level was slightly more than the FY2009 appropriations and an increase of $2.6 million more than the request. In FY2010, additional funds were provided for forest health management activities, including surveying and controlling insects, diseases, and invasive species. The enacted level for wildfire appropriations matched the House, Senate, and Administration levels. Funding for the Joint Fire Science Program remained at $6.0 million for DOI and $8.0 million for FS. Wildfire funding for FS fire plan research and development was maintained. In FY2010, wildfire funding for FS fire plan research and development remained at $23.9 million. The law also included $80.3 million for FS fire assistance to states, with $71.3 million for state fire assistance and $9.0 million for volunteer fire departments. DOI funding for community assistance remained at $7.0 million."
