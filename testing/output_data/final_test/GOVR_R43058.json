    "content": "The process of nominating lower federal court judges by the President and their consideration by the Senate has been a topic of interest in recent Senate debates. There are differing perspectives on the success of a President's nominees in gaining Senate confirmation compared to nominees of other recent Presidents. Concerns have been raised about delays in the processing of judicial nominations and the increasing number of vacant judgeships in the federal judiciary. This report aims to provide information for the current debate. This report analyzes President Obama's judicial nominations during his first term, comparing their success in the Senate confirmation process with past Presidents. Various factors influencing nomination statistics are identified. The report analyzes President Obama's judicial nominations during his first term, comparing their success in the Senate confirmation process with past Presidents. Statistics were generated from an internal CRS judicial nominations database, focusing on nominations to U.S. circuit court and U.S. district court judgeships. The Constitution establishes the judicial power of the United States in the Supreme Court and lower courts, with judges holding office during good behavior. The federal system includes the U.S. circuit courts of appeals, U.S. district courts, and U.S. Court of International Trade. The report focuses on President Obama's nominations to U.S. circuit courts of appeals and U.S. district courts. The U.S. Courts of Appeals hear appeals from federal district court decisions and review administrative agency decisions. The nation is divided into 12 geographic circuits, each with a U.S. court of appeals. The U.S. has 12 geographic circuits with a U.S. court of appeals each. The Federal Circuit has specialized subject matter jurisdiction. There are 179 appellate court judgeships authorized by law. The First Circuit has 6 judgeships, while the Ninth Circuit has 29. Nominations to U.S. courts of appeals judgeships are referred to as \"circuit court nominations.\" U.S. district courts are federal trial courts of general jurisdiction, with 91 Article III district courts in total. Each state has at least one U.S. district court. There are 673 Article III U.S. district court judgeships authorized by law, with Congress authorizing between 1 and 28 judgeships for each district court. Additionally, there are three U.S. territorial district courts with a total of 677 judgeships. Judicial appointees serve 10-year terms, with one judgeship each in Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, and two in the U.S. Virgin Islands. This section provides a statistical analysis of President Obama's nominations to U.S. circuit courts of appeals and U.S. district courts from January 20, 2009. The text provides a statistical summary of President Obama's nominations to U.S. circuit courts of appeals and U.S. district courts from January 20, 2009, through January 19, 2013. It includes confirmation status, vacant judgeships comparison, and details on appointees. During his first term, President Obama nominated 42 individuals to U.S. circuit court judgeships, with 71.4% confirmed by the Senate. For U.S. district court judgeships, out of 173 nominees, 82.7% were confirmed. During his first term, President Obama had 80.5% of his circuit and district court nominees confirmed. The distribution of his confirmed judicial appointees varied across geographic circuits based on vacancies. During his first term, President Obama had a high confirmation rate for his judicial nominees, with the greatest number of U.S. appeals court judgeships held by his appointees in the Fourth, Second, Ninth, and Federal Circuits. However, he did not have any nominees confirmed to the Eighth Circuit or the D.C. Circuit, making him the first President in over 50 years to serve a full term without a nominee confirmed to the D.C. Circuit. Obama appointees held a significant percentage of judgeships in various circuits, with the highest numbers in the Fourth, Second, Ninth, and Federal Circuits. The Eighth and D.C. Circuits had the smallest percentage of judgeships held by Obama appointees. In U.S. district courts, Obama appointees had the most judgeships in the Ninth, Second, and Fourth Circuits. The First and D.C. Circuits had the fewest judgeships held by Obama district court appointees. During his first term, President Obama had success in appointing district court judges in the D.C. and Eighth Circuits, despite no circuit court nominees being confirmed in these circuits. Obama's appointees held a significant percentage of judgeships in various circuits, with the highest numbers in the Fourth, Second, Ninth, and Federal Circuits. At the end of President Obama's first term, there were 81 vacancies for circuit and district court judgeships, compared to 55 when he took office. 38.3% of these vacancies had nominations pending, with 32.3% on the Executive Calendar and 67.7% in the Senate Judiciary Committee. At the end of President Obama's first term, there were 81 vacancies for circuit and district court judgeships, compared to 55 when he took office. If the 4 circuit court nominees with nominations pending on the Executive Calendar had been confirmed before the end of the 112th Congress, the number of circuit court vacancies would have been the same at the end of President Obama's first term as at the beginning. Confirmation of the 4 circuit nominees would have reduced the end-of-first-term vacancy total to 13, equal to the 13 vacancies President Obama inherited at the start of his term. At the end of President Obama's first term, 61.7% of the 81 circuit or district court vacancies were still unfilled, with an average vacancy duration of 452.5 days. 46.0% of these vacancies occurred after July 1, 2012. There was a more significant increase in district court vacancies compared to circuit court vacancies during Obama's first term. During President Obama's first term, the number of district court vacancies increased significantly compared to circuit court vacancies. Obama took longer to name individuals to district court vacancies, averaging 399 days for nominations compared to 230 days for circuit court vacancies. This delay resulted in a higher number of unfilled district court vacancies at the end of his term. The delay in nominating individuals for district court vacancies during President Obama's first term led to a higher number of unfilled positions compared to circuit court vacancies. Factors outside the administration's control, such as judges departing office and Senate processing, also influence the number of vacancies and the time they remain unfilled. The section analyzes institutional and political factors affecting the Senate's processing of judicial nominations. It compares nomination and confirmation processes from Presidents Reagan to Obama, focusing on circuit and district court nominees. Key comparisons include vacancy rates at the beginning and end of each President's first term, as well as the average and median days from nomination to confirmation for both court levels. The report analyzes the time taken for nomination to confirmation for judicial nominees, without taking a position on appropriate numbers or timeframes. It compares data from Presidents Reagan to Obama on circuit and district court nominees. President G.H.W. Bush had the most circuit court nominees confirmed, while President Reagan had the highest percentage of circuit nominees confirmed during a first term. President Obama had the second-lowest percentage of circuit court nominees confirmed. Presidents Clinton and G.W. Bush tied for the most district court nominees confirmed during their first terms. During his first term, President G.W. Bush had the highest percentage of district court nominees confirmed (95.0%), while President Obama had the second-lowest number of district court nominees confirmed (143) and the second-lowest confirmation rate (82.7%). President G.W. Bush also had the highest number and percentage of combined circuit and district court nominees confirmed during his first term (205 nominees, 88.7% confirmation rate), followed by President Clinton with 200 confirmed nominees. President Obama had the second-lowest number of combined nominees confirmed (173) and the second-lowest confirmation rate (80.5%) at the end of his first term. The statistics in Table 2 show that late nominations in a President's first term may not always be processed by the Senate before adjourning, potentially affecting confirmation rates. Excluding late nominations can increase the percentage of nominees confirmed, as seen in President Reagan's first term where the confirmation rate for circuit court nominees rose from 86.8% to 97.1% after excluding late nominations. The vacancy rate for circuit and district court judgeships varies over a presidency and is influenced by the pace of nominee selection and Senate consideration. Comparing President Obama and his predecessors, the percentage of nominees confirmed can increase by excluding late nominations. Table 3 shows the circuit court vacancy rates during the first terms of five Presidents. President G.W. Bush was the only one to see a decrease in vacancy rate from 14.5% to 8.4%. President Reagan had the highest increase from 3.8% to 15.5%, while President Obama had the smallest increase from 7.3% to 9.5%. The increase in vacancy rate after President Reagan's term and G.H.W. Bush's presidency may be due to the creation of new circuit court judgeships during their terms. The Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982 and the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984 created new judgeships for the Federal Circuit and circuit courts. President G.H.W. Bush's Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 also added new circuit court judgeships. District court vacancy rates decreased during President G.W. Bush's first term and President Clinton's term, but increased during President Obama's first term. During President Obama's first term, district court vacancy rates increased without the creation of new judgeships, unlike Presidents Reagan and G.H.W. Bush who saw increases in vacancy rates coinciding with new judgeship creations. During President Obama's first term, district court vacancy rates increased without new judgeships being created. President Obama took longer on average to nominate persons to fill district court vacancies compared to Presidents Clinton and G.W. Bush. In President Obama's second and fourth years, a greater percentage of district court vacancies remained unfilled compared to Presidents Clinton and G.W. Bush during their first terms. During Presidents Clinton and G.W. Bush's first terms, the speed of submitting judicial nominations to the Senate varied. Factors influencing the selection and confirmation process are discussed, based on nomination and confirmation statistics. The analysis excludes nominees not confirmed during a President's first term. Figure 2 shows the average and median number of days from nomination to confirmation by President from Reagan to Obama. During Presidents Clinton and G.W. Bush's first terms, the speed of submitting judicial nominations to the Senate varied. The analysis excludes nominees not confirmed during a President's first term. President G.W. Bush's circuit court nominees who were confirmed during his first term waited the longest period of time from first nomination to confirmation (277.0 days), followed by President Obama's nominees (240.2 days). President Obama's circuit court nominees had the second-longest wait time. President Obama's circuit court nominees had the longest median wait time from nomination to confirmation (225.5 days), followed by President G.W. Bush's nominees (216.0 days), Clinton's nominees (102.5 days), G.H.W. Bush's nominees (85.5 days), and Reagan's nominees (28.0 days). For district court nominees, Obama's nominees waited 221.8 days on average, G.W. Bush's nominees waited 156.2 days, and Clinton's nominees waited 92.5 days on average. During President Clinton's first term, nominees waited an average of 92.5 days for confirmation, while nominees of Presidents G.H.W. Bush and Reagan waited 103.8 and 34.7 days, respectively. The median waiting times for district court nominees ranged from 215.0 days during President Obama's first term to 28.0 days during President Reagan's first term. President Obama is the only President for whom nominees waited more than half a year to be confirmed. The time it takes for a President's judicial nominees to be confirmed by the Senate depends on the waiting time for a committee hearing and on the Executive Calendar. Figure 3 shows the average and median days from nomination to committee hearing for circuit and district court nominees from Reagan to Obama. All nominees who received hearings during a President's first term were included in the calculations. Figure 3 illustrates the waiting time for circuit court nominees to receive a committee hearing after being nominated by different Presidents. President G.W. Bush's nominees had the longest wait, with an average of 274.6 days and a median of 172.5 days. In comparison, President Reagan's nominees had the shortest wait, with an average of 28.7 days and a median of 16.5 days. President Clinton's nominees waited an average of 89.2 days. President Obama's circuit court nominees had a relatively low confirmation rate in his first term, but they received hearings quickly. On average, they waited 69.6 days from nomination to first hearing, which was less than nominees from Presidents G.H.W. Bush, Clinton, and G.W. Bush. Reagan's nominees had the shortest wait at 28.7 days. District court nominees had similar waiting times across presidencies. The average waiting time for district court nominees from first nomination to first hearing varied across presidencies. During President Obama's first term, the average was 80.2 days, similar to G.H.W. Bush's presidency at 83.4 days. Clinton's nominees waited 70.2 days on average, while G.W. Bush's nominees had the longest wait at 82.5 days. Obama's median wait time was 70.0 days, lower than G.W. Bush's 82.5 days but higher than G.H.W. Bush and Clinton. The waiting times for district court nominees during different presidencies varied significantly. President Reagan's nominees had a median waiting time of 15.0 days, while President Obama's nominees waited an average of 80.2 days. The waiting times for nominees confirmed during a President's first term were highest under President G.W. Bush, with an average of 82.5 days. The waiting time between committee report and confirmation increased from presidency to presidency. The shortest average waiting time for confirmed circuit court nominees was during President G.H.W. Bush's term (7.8 days). The average waiting time increased from 7.8 days in G.H.W. Bush's presidency to 138.5 days in President Obama's first term. During President Obama's first term, the median number of days for confirmed circuit court nominees was 131.5, significantly longer than previous presidencies. President Clinton and G.W. Bush had shorter confirmation times, with roughly half of their nominees confirmed within 6.5 and 18 days, respectively. In contrast, President Obama had no nominees confirmed within 25 days. During President Obama's first term, the median number of days for confirmed circuit court nominees was 131.5, significantly longer than previous presidencies. This difference is due to the fact that many noncontroversial nominees were confirmed quickly, pushing down the median figures, while a few cases experienced longer confirmation times. These outliers had a greater impact on the average confirmation time than the median. During President Obama's first term, district court nominees experienced increasing confirmation times, with an average of 98.5 days and 42.7% waiting at least 100 days from first committee report to confirmation. This trend contrasts with President G.H.W. Bush's nominees, who had shorter confirmation times. During President Obama's first term, the confirmation times for district court nominees increased significantly. The median confirmation time rose from 1.0 days under President G.H.W. Bush to 91 days under President Obama. Waiting times from committee report to confirmation also increased during the 111th and 112th Congresses. During Presidents Clinton to Obama, nominees confirmed without any nay votes were analyzed. The report includes the number and percentage of unopposed nominees confirmed during each President's first term, along with the average and median confirmation wait times. Presidents Reagan and G.H.W. Bush were excluded from the analysis. During President Obama's first term, circuit court nominees with zero nay votes had the longest average confirmation wait time of 124.7 days on the Executive Calendar, compared to previous administrations. During President Obama's first term, district court nominees with zero nay votes had an average confirmation wait time of 89 days, the longest among previous administrations. The median number of days from committee report to confirmation was also highest during this term, at 88 days. The text discusses the statistical aspects of the lower court appointment process and the variation in these statistics across presidencies. Factors influencing the selection and confirmation process include appointment opportunities, vetting processes, and Senate processing of nominations. These factors are not exhaustive and may not always be quantifiable in terms of their impact on confirmation rates. Opportunities for a President to make judicial appointments arise when judgeships are vacant or scheduled to become vacant. The number of judicial vacancies a President inherits when taking office is influenced by various factors such as the frequency of judicial departures, new judgeships created, and Senate confirmation rates. A large number of vacancies created before a new presidency may or may not result in many appointment opportunities for the incoming President. The number of judicial vacancies a President inherits when taking office is influenced by various factors such as the frequency of judicial departures, new judgeships created, and Senate confirmation rates. The Senate's confirmation rate prior to different presidencies affected the number of appointment opportunities for Presidents. For example, in 2000, 55.4% of district court nominations were confirmed, while in 2008, 64.9% were confirmed, leading to variations in appointment opportunities for Presidents G.W. Bush and Obama. Legislation creating new judgeships could also impact a new President's appointment opportunities. Legislation creating new judgeships can provide a new President with the opportunity to appoint a greater number of judges than they might have otherwise inherited. Acts in 1978, 1984, and 1990 substantially increased the number of authorized judgeships. President Clinton inherited a large number of district court vacancies, partly due to the Federal Judgeship Act of 1990 creating 74 new district court judgeships. The rate at which judges depart office also affects the opportunities for a President to make circuit and district court appointments. District court appointments are influenced by judges departing office and the creation of new judgeships. President Obama faced more vacancies in his first three years due to judges retiring. The modern presidential role in judicial appointments involves selecting, vetting, and evaluating federal judicial nominees. Factors affecting this process include the number of individuals involved, selection criteria, and resources devoted to filling vacancies, such as Supreme Court vacancies in the Clinton and Obama Administrations. The pace of selecting judicial nominees by a President can be influenced by consultation with home state Senators and the priority attached to the process. Communication difficulties or disagreements with Senators representing states with vacant judgeships can slow down the nomination process. Additionally, delays can occur if Senators are slow in recommending candidates or if they cannot agree on a suitable nominee. The Obama Administration did not prioritize judicial selection during the 111th Congress. Judges were not seen as a priority by those closest to the President, and the selection process was not a major focus. The speed of selecting nominees may be influenced by the length of the vetting process. The Obama Administration took longer to submit judicial nominees compared to the G.W. Bush Administration, partly due to pre-nomination vetting by the ABA committee. This additional vetting process added 30 to 45 days to the nomination stage. The Senate confirmation process for judicial nominations is influenced by various institutional and political factors. The Senate confirmation process for judicial nominees is influenced by factors such as ideological differences between the President and the Senate, interest group opposition, presence of champions on the Senate Judiciary Committee, timing of nominations, and ABA ratings. Divided government may also impact the processing of judicial nominations. Divided government may affect procedural strategies in opposing a President's judicial nominees, with Senators potentially using different tactics based on party control. Factors like the ABA's evaluation of candidates may influence the speed of processing nominations at the committee level versus on the floor. The ABA's evaluation of judicial candidates can impact the time it takes for a nomination to be processed by the Judiciary Committee. If the ABA evaluates candidates before nomination, it does not add to the time between nomination and committee report. However, if the evaluation occurs after nomination, it can prolong the overall processing time. The amount of information Senators and their staff review on a judicial nominee before hearings can delay final committee action. Delays in Senate action can be influenced by political factors. Even noncontroversial nominees can face significant delays due to holds or objections on the Executive Calendar. The Senate Judiciary Committee's blue-slip policy, dating back to 1917, allows home state Senators to assess judicial nominations. Senators can use blue slips to express support or objections to nominees, influencing the processing of judicial nominations. The blue-slip policy allows Senators to express support or objections to judicial nominees, influencing the nomination process. Returning positive blue slips from both home state Senators does not always lead to a quick confirmation, as seen during President Obama's first term. The average time for circuit and district court nominations to be confirmed reached historically high levels. A new standing order in the 113th Congress aims to expedite floor consideration of district court nominations by reducing post-cloture consideration time from 30 hours to 2 hours for nominations supported by at least three-fifths of the Senate. This new procedure allows for quicker final action on district court nominations, which are typically considered through unanimous consent agreements due to the lengthy cloture process. The new standing order in the 113th Congress aims to expedite floor consideration of district court nominations by reducing post-cloture consideration time from 30 hours to 2 hours for nominations supported by at least three-fifths of the Senate. This could facilitate unanimous consent negotiations and reduce waiting time for nominations."
