    "content": "Ongoing U.S. military operations against the Islamic State, authorized by President Obama in 2014, aimed to combat the insurgent force in Iraq and Syria through airstrikes. In 2014, the United States began airstrikes in Syria targeting IS forces and affiliated groups. This followed significant military operations in Iraq after the capture of Iraqi territory by the Islamic State. U.S. forces had previously been deployed in Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein and assist the post-Saddam government. Offensive U.S. military operations in Iraq ceased in 2011 but resumed in 2014 at the request of the Iraqi government to combat IS forces. In 2014, the Iraqi government requested U.S. assistance in responding to advancing IS forces through airstrikes. The United States deployed military personnel to collect intelligence, advise Iraqi security forces, and protect U.S. personnel and facilities in Iraq. President Obama authorized limited airstrikes to stop IS advances and protect civilians. Additional airstrikes were authorized to assist Iraqi forces in recapturing the Mosul Dam and delivering humanitarian assistance to civilians in Amirli. In 2014, the United States responded to IS threats in Iraq by deploying military personnel for intelligence gathering, advising Iraqi forces, and protecting civilians. President Obama authorized airstrikes to halt IS advances and provide aid to civilians in Amirli. The U.S. considered expanding military action against IS, leading to airstrikes in Syria targeting IS forces and the Khorasan Group. The Obama Administration initially cited Article II of the Constitution as the legal basis for U.S. operations against the Islamic State, but later claimed authorization under the 2002 Iraq AUMF and the 2001 AUMF. Some observers and Members of Congress disagree with this interpretation. As of the date of the report, Congress has not passed specific legislation authorizing force against the Islamic State. The Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2015 authorized the President to arm and train Syrian opposition groups to deter attacks by the Islamic State. Legislative proposals aim to limit executive military action in Iraq and Syria without congressional approval. The report addresses legal questions regarding the use of military force against the Islamic State, including presidential authority, relevant authorizations like the 2002 Iraq AUMF and the War Powers Resolution, and the United Nations Charter's applicability to U.S. military strikes in Iraq and Syria. It will be updated as needed. The report discusses legal issues related to U.S. military action against the Islamic State, including presidential authority, relevant authorizations, and the applicability of the United Nations Charter. It will be updated as necessary. Additional information can be found in other CRS reports on the topic. The U.S. Constitution serves as the legal basis for military action against the Islamic State. Questions arise regarding the need for congressional authorization and the President's independent authority to order military force. Congress holds the power to declare war and authorize military action under Article I, Section 8. Congress has the authority to declare war, tax and spend for defense, regulate the Armed Forces, and make necessary laws. The President is the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, responsible for executing laws and preserving the Constitution. He is also primarily responsible for foreign affairs. The President has independent authority to conduct military operations without congressional authorization, including protecting U.S. persons abroad, repelling attacks, or defending national interests. Congress views the President's authority to introduce U.S. forces into hostilities as limited, as stated in the War Powers Resolution of 1973. The President has the authority to conduct military operations without congressional authorization, including protecting U.S. persons abroad, repelling attacks, or defending national interests. Congress believes that the President's power to deploy U.S. forces into hostilities is restricted, as outlined in the War Powers Resolution of 1973. Congress asserts that the President can only use military force with a declaration of war, specific statutory authorization, or in a national emergency caused by an attack on the U.S. or its armed forces. There is limited legal precedent on the extent of the President's authority to order military action without explicit approval or prohibition from Congress. In cases where the allocation of power between the executive and legislative branches is unclear, Congress's support or lack thereof for presidential actions may impact their constitutional validity. The Supreme Court has considered situations where the President and Congress may have concurrent authority or where power distribution is uncertain. In such instances, the Court looks at all circumstances that illuminate Congress's stance on the action. In Dames & Moore, the petitioners challenged President Carter's executive order to establish regulations for compliance with an executive agreement with Iran. The Court found that Congress's historical treatment of similar matters showed intent to give the President broad discretion to act, even without explicit statutory authorization. The Court found that Congress's historical treatment of similar matters showed intent to give the President broad discretion to act, even without explicit statutory authorization. This history of congressional acquiescence in the President's conduct invites measures on independent presidential responsibility. The executive branch argues that historical congressional acquiescence to presidential actions in military affairs gives greater legal significance to the President's use of military force without explicit authorization. However, the executive acknowledges that certain intense military actions require congressional approval, except in cases of defending the country from attack. In a 2011 opinion from the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel, it was stated that determining whether a planned military engagement constitutes a \"war\" for constitutional purposes requires a fact-specific assessment of the anticipated nature, scope, and duration of the operations. This assessment is typically satisfied by prolonged and substantial military engagements involving significant risk to U.S. military personnel over a substantial period. The Obama Administration had not cited the 2002 Iraq AUMF in public statements regarding military action against the Islamic State. Challenges to military actions without congressional authorization have been dismissed on procedural grounds, preventing U.S. courts from ruling on the validity of presidential claims of independent authority. The White House supported the repeal of the 2002 Iraq AUMF, but later cited it as authorization for some U.S. operations against the Islamic State. Questions arise on whether the 2002 Iraq AUMF covers current security threats in Iraq. The law was enacted due to concerns about Saddam Hussein's regime and weapons of mass destruction. The 2002 Iraq AUMF allows the President to use U.S. Armed Forces to defend against threats posed by Iraq, even after the removal of the Hussein regime. The vague language of the AUMF gives the President discretion in interpreting what constitutes a threat to national security. The IS insurgency could be seen as a new threat to U.S. interests in Iraq, potentially justifying military action. The 2002 Iraq AUMF may authorize the President to use force in response to threats from Iraq, but the context of its enactment and subsequent events suggest it may not apply to current military actions. The 2002 Iraq AUMF may not be relevant to U.S. military action against non-government actors in Iraq in 2014. If interpreted to cover the IS threat in Iraq, it may raise questions about military action in Syria. The resolution's scope in Syria depends on whether the conflict is part of the same armed conflict in Iraq. The 2002 Iraq AUMF could be implied to cover the threat from Syria if both conflicts are linked. However, the threat posed by IS in Syria to the Assad regime may not directly threaten U.S. national security. The 2002 Iraq AUMF does not authorize U.S. actions against IS forces in Syria. The Obama Administration cited the 2001 AUMF for military operations against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The 2001 AUMF is the primary legal authority for military action against Al Qaeda and associated forces. The 2001 AUMF grants the President authority to use force against nations, organizations, or persons involved in the 9/11 attacks or harboring them. It authorizes military action against Al Qaeda and associated forces. The 2001 AUMF authorizes military action against Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces. Debate surrounds the definition of \"associated forces\" and the criteria for being deemed as such. The AUMF does not permit military action against entities solely based on terrorism participation. The 2001 AUMF authorizes military action against Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces. The definition of \"associated forces\" is debated, focusing on the group's relationship with Al Qaeda or the Taliban. The nature of the Islamic State's relationship with Al Qaeda is unclear, with current IS leaders denying being an offshoot of Al Qaeda. The Obama Administration argues that the Islamic State is covered by the 2001 AUMF as a successor to the version of Al Qaeda responsible for the 9/11 attacks. A schism arose between Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, both claiming the mantle of Osama Bin Laden. The 2001 AUMF applies to both groups, despite the Islamic State not meeting the definition for an \"associated force.\" The legitimacy of this argument depends on the Islamic State's relationship with Al Qaeda at the time of the 9/11 attacks. The 2001 AUMF may apply to the Islamic State due to its lineage and association with Al Qaeda, despite a schism between the two groups. The Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2015, does not provide authority for ongoing military operations not covered by existing legislation. The 2015 CR does not authorize ongoing military operations not covered by existing legislation, but it does not prohibit funds for airstrikes against IS targets in Iraq or Syria. The provision for assistance to Syrian rebels does not explicitly allow direct combat roles for US Armed Forces. The War Powers Resolution (WPR) enacted in 1973 aimed to reassert Congress's role in matters of war, providing a mechanism to potentially force the President to withdraw U.S. forces from unauthorized hostilities. The War Powers Resolution (WPR) enacted in 1973 aimed to reassert Congress's role in matters of war by providing a mechanism to potentially force troop withdrawal from unauthorized hostilities. Despite never being successfully employed, the WPR limits military action against IS forces without legislative authorization, requiring the President to consult with Congress before introducing U.S. Armed Forces into hostilities. The War Powers Resolution (WPR) requires Congressional notification within 48 hours when combat-equipped U.S. forces are deployed to a foreign nation. U.S. troops must be withdrawn within 60 days unless Congress authorizes continued involvement through a declaration of war or specific authorization. Congress can also compel the withdrawal of U.S. forces at any time. The War Powers Resolution allows Congress to compel the withdrawal of U.S. forces from unauthorized hostilities outside the U.S. through a concurrent resolution. A House concurrent resolution stated that the President cannot deploy U.S. Armed Forces in sustained combat in Iraq without specific statutory authorization, potentially triggering the WPR's requirements. The War Powers Resolution allows Congress to compel the President to terminate sustained combat roles in Iraq by U.S. forces, but doubts exist regarding the legal effect of such measures due to existing jurisprudence. The constitutionality of Section 5(c) is questionable following the Supreme Court's ruling in INS v. Chadha, which emphasized the need for resolutions to go through the bicameral and presentment process to become law. The constitutionality of WPR Section 5(c) is in question after the Supreme Court ruling in INS v. Chadha. A concurrent resolution may not legally compel the termination of U.S. military operations, but it could counter arguments of Congress acquiescence to the President's use of force. Section 5(b) of the WPR limits the executive's ability to use force without further action by Congress. The constitutionality of WPR Section 5(b) is debated, with some legal observers expressing concerns. Despite this, it is generally seen as a permissible exercise of Congress's authority over war matters. Section 5(b) requires the withdrawal of U.S. troops introduced into hostilities without congressional authorization, unless Congress approves the use of force or extends the deadline. This provision does not necessarily act as a statutory constraint on military action. The 2002 Iraq AUMF and 2001 AUMF may authorize military action against the IS, potentially bypassing the deadline set by Section 5(b) of the WPR. If these statutes do not cover IS military action, it is uncertain if all offensive operations must cease under the WPR. The executive branch has been providing reports on U.S. military actions consistent with the War Powers Resolution. The executive branch has been providing reports on U.S. military actions related to the IS since June, but it is unclear if they satisfy the War Powers Resolution requirements. Deployment of U.S. forces to Iraq in June for protection may not trigger the WPR's termination timeline, but repeated airstrikes against the Islamic State in August raise questions. The executive branch has been providing reports on U.S. military actions related to the Islamic State since June. There are concerns that these reports may not meet the requirements of the War Powers Resolution, especially regarding the repeated airstrikes against the Islamic State in August. This raises questions about the authorization and termination timeline of such military actions. Disagreements between political branches can arise regarding the scope of military activities covered by Section 5(b) of the War Powers Resolution. During U.S. operations in Libya, there was a debate over whether ongoing military actions needed authorization from Congress after the 60-day deadline. The Obama Administration argued that the requirement to terminate unauthorized hostilities within 60 days did not apply to their continued engagement in aerial attacks on Libyan targets. The Obama Administration's interpretation of the War Powers Resolution (WPR) in relation to military activities in Libya was that the attacks were not considered \"hostilities\" under the WPR due to their limited scope and duration. This interpretation aimed to avoid triggering the 60-day deadline for congressional authorization. Critics viewed this interpretation as overly restrictive, as the WPR does not clearly define the term \"hostilities.\" The Obama Administration's interpretation of the War Powers Resolution in relation to military activities in Libya was that the attacks were not considered \"hostilities\" under the WPR due to their limited scope and duration. Critics viewed this interpretation as overly restrictive, as the term \"hostilities\" is not clearly defined. Some argue that repeated military strikes by one sovereign entity against another may be deemed \"hostilities,\" even without an exchange of fire. Additionally, it is suggested that assessing whether U.S. forces are engaged in hostilities should consider the overarching military conflict, not just their supporting role. The dispute over the interpretation of the War Powers Resolution in relation to military actions in Iraq involves the role of U.S. forces in the broader military operations. Despite challenges brought by Members of Congress against the executive, court rulings have consistently dismissed these cases without addressing the underlying merits, citing various legal doctrines and concerns. It is unlikely that the dispute will be definitively resolved through the courts. The courts have faced procedural barriers like discretion doctrine, ripeness, mootness, and congressional standing concerns for dismissing cases related to war powers. However, these barriers are not insurmountable, and the main obstacle to jurisdiction is the posture of the cases. U.S. military strikes in Iraq with Iraqi government consent do not constitute force against Iraq, but IS fighters use Syria for attacks in Iraq. It is unlikely that courts will delve into this politically charged issue. The use of force in Syria without its consent or a U.N. Security Council resolution could have implications under international law, as international law generally prohibits one state from acting militarily within the territory of another without consent. Exceptions exist, mainly based on a nation's right to self-defense. Prior to World War II, states had the sovereign right to use military force against other states for various reasons. The United Nations Charter limits the use of military force between member states, except in cases of self-defense as outlined in Article 51. This restriction aims to reduce the incidence of war and maintain international peace and security. Article 51 of the UN Charter outlines the right to self-defense, which some interpret as including preemptive self-defense in the face of an imminent attack. Military actions can be undertaken with the consent of the state on whose territory force is used, avoiding a violation of the UN Charter. The ongoing US military actions against IS forces in Iraq have been conducted with the consent of the Iraqi government, ensuring no violation of Iraq's territorial integrity. The US military actions against IS forces in Syria may conflict with the UN Charter without consent from the Syrian government or UN Security Council authorization. The right to use force in self-defense was exemplified in the Caroline incident in 1837. In the Caroline incident of 1837, the US protested Canada's actions on an island, asserting that self-defense must be immediate, overwhelming, and proportional to the threat. These conditions establish the grounds for extraterritorial use of force. The conditions for extraterritorial use of force, such as self-defense being immediate, overwhelming, and proportional to the threat, are crucial in determining the legality of military action by the United States against IS forces in Syria. The nature of the threat posed by the Islamic State to the US is less direct, but if US military action is justified as collective defense, it would involve protecting Iraq or other nations. The legality of US military action in Syria without consent may be justified by the \"unwilling or unable\" test, which questions Syria's capability to remove threats from its territory. This test is separate from the Caroline test and has been applied in military operations against Al Qaeda and the Taliban. The United States has informed the U.N. Security Council that it has started military operations in Syria against the Islamic State and the Khorasan Group, justifying the actions as self-defense measures and citing Iraq's request for assistance. The \"unwilling and unable\" doctrine is being applied to determine Syria's capability to address the threat. The United States has initiated military operations in Syria against the Islamic State and the Khorasan Group, citing self-defense measures and Iraq's request for assistance. The \"unable and unwilling\" test is being used to assess Syria's ability to combat the threats, with the UN Secretary-General supporting the strikes in areas no longer under the government's control. The legitimacy of these airstrikes in international law and the acceptance among states remain to be seen."
