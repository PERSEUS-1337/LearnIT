    "content": "The \"Graton Rancheria Restoration Act\" is cited as the short title. The Congress finds that the Advisory Council on California Indian Policy recommended the legislative restoration of the Graton Rancheria. The Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria Tribal Council has decided to restrict gaming in accordance with the Act's provisions. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"Tribe,\" \"Secretary,\" \"Interim Tribal Council,\" \"member,\" \"State,\" \"reservation,\" and \"service area.\" SEC. 4. RESTORATION OF FEDERAL RECOGNITION, RIGHTS, AND PRIVILEGES. Federal recognition is restored to the Tribe, along with all rights and privileges under Federal treaties, orders, agreements, or statutes that were diminished or lost under a previous Act. Federal laws and regulations applicable to Indians will also apply to the Tribe and its members. The Tribe and its members are eligible for Federal services and benefits, regardless of reservation status. This eligibility does not affect other benefits or payments received by the Tribe or its members. The Act does not impact any payments or benefits received by the tribe, individual, or household under federal programs. It also does not affect hunting, fishing, trapping, gathering, or water rights of the Tribe and its members. Additionally, it does not alter any property rights, contractual obligations, or tax obligations, except as specified in the Act. TRANSFER OF LAND TO BE HELD IN TRUST. The Secretary will accept real property in Marin or Sonoma County, California into trust for the Tribe if there are no legal claims, including liens or taxes. Indian-owned fee land can also be eligible for trust status under certain conditions. Any real property taken into trust for the Tribe will become part of the reservation and will be exempt from all local, State, and Federal taxation. Gaming on the trust land will be restricted and not exempt under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. SEC. 6. MEMBERSHIP ROLLS. The Secretary must compile a membership roll of the Tribe within 1 year of the Act's enactment, in consultation with the Tribe. Criteria for membership include being living, not a member of another federally recognized tribe, and meeting specific requirements related to historical distribution lists. The Graton Indian Rancheria distribution list requirements for membership include being identified as an Indian from specific California vicinities or being a lineal descendant of a listed individual. After adopting a tribal constitution, membership in the Tribe is governed by it. Proof of Graton Indian ancestry is required for membership. The Secretary will accept any available evidence establishing Graton Indian ancestry, including information from specific census records and distribution lists approved by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. SEC. 7. INTERIM GOVERNMENT. The Tribe's governing body will be an Interim Tribal Council until a final constitution is ratified. The initial council members will be those elected under the 1997 tribal constitution. Vacancies will be filled by eligible members elected in the same manner. SEC. 8. TRIBAL CONSTITUTION. After compiling the tribal membership roll, the Secretary will conduct a secret ballot election, upon request of the Interim Council, to ratify a final constitution for the Tribe. Absentee voting is allowed regardless of voter residence. Within 120 days of ratification, the Secretary will conduct another secret ballot election to elect tribal officials in accordance with the tribal constitution. The tribal constitution must be followed in procedures outlined in subsection (a) unless there is a conflict. The House of Representatives passed the document on June 19, 2000."
