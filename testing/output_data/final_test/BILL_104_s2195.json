The term 'human tissue' is defined as a collection of similar human cells intended for medical use, including diagnosis, treatment, and reproduction. It may be processed before use and can be combined with safe substances that do not have a therapeutic effect. This definition includes reproductive tissue, demineralized bone, heart valves, dura mater, and manipulated autologous cells. The term 'human tissue' excludes vascularized human organs, gene therapy, blood, soluble blood components, milk, or products made by combining human tissue with biomaterials. Human tissue is not considered a drug, biological product, or device unless reclassified by the Secretary. The regulation of human tissue excludes vascularized human organs, gene therapy, blood, soluble blood components, milk, or products made by combining human tissue with biomaterials. Human tissue is subject to regulation only if voluntary regulation is deemed inadequate to protect public health. Registration is required for those involved in the recovery, processing, storage, or distribution of human tissue for transplantation in the United States. States must register following the procedures for drug registration under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Registration includes person's name, facility location, types of human tissue handled, and brief processing methods. Registered individuals are authorized for tissue activities unless they fail to meet operating standards determined by the Secretary upon inspection. The Secretary can suspend or revoke the authority of a registered individual if they fail to meet operating standards after being notified and given a chance to comply. The Secretary can suspend or revoke the authority of a registered individual if they fail to comply with patient registry requirements or pose a danger to public health. Operating standards for human tissue may be established by the Secretary after notice and opportunity for comment. The requirements for the recovery, processing, storage, and shipment of human tissue include infection control, processing practices for safety, labeling, and recordkeeping. Statements in labeling or advertising must be accurate and based on sound scientific information. A registry may be required for tracking purposes. The Secretary may require a person registered under subsection (b) to maintain a patient registry or meet retrospective patient data requirements for tissue commercially available in the US for less than 5 years to protect public health. The Secretary can reclassify human tissue as a drug, biological product, or device if necessary. The Secretary may reclassify human tissue as a drug, biological product, or medical device if information from patient registries or retrospective data is insufficient to confirm safety and clinical benefit, or if a particular type of tissue poses a public health hazard. The Secretary can reclassify a human drug, biological product, or medical device as human tissue if deemed unnecessary for public health protection. Reclassification can also occur upon petition from the sponsor or registered person, if consistent with public health. Enforcement actions can be taken if violations are found. If violations of regulations pose a significant risk to public health, the Secretary can issue an order to cease distribution of human tissue or recall it. The person in possession of the tissue must comply with the order and can request an informal hearing within 5 days. The Secretary can conduct a hearing within 30 days of a request and issue an order within 15 days. Registered persons can be inspected under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Cord blood is subject to the same regulations as human tissue. The Secretary implements regulations for cord blood and human tissue. The interim regulation remains until amended. Effective date is June 30, 1997. Effective June 30, 1997, amendments are made to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act regarding human tissue regulations. The Act now includes provisions for adulteration and misbranding related to human tissue processing and distribution. Amendments to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act now include regulations for adulteration and misbranding of human tissue. Amendments to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act now include regulations for adulteration and misbranding of human tissue in medical devices and drugs. The amendments also involve inspections for compliance with these regulations."
