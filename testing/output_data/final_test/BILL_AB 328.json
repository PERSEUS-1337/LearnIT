    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 17941 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to require limited liability companies in California to pay an annual tax for the privilege of doing business in the state. Limited liability companies in California must pay an annual tax for doing business in the state, as required by Section 17941 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. The tax is to be paid each taxable year if articles of organization have been accepted by the Secretary of State, until a certificate of cancellation is filed. If a taxpayer files a final return with the Franchise Tax Board, they will be notified that the annual tax is due until a certificate of dissolution or cancellation is filed with the Secretary of State. The tax is payable by the 15th day of the fourth month of the taxable year. A limited liability company formed under state law is not taxable as a corporation for California tax purposes. If the Secretary of State files a certificate of cancellation for the company, certain tax provisions apply as if the company were treated as a corporation for that specific purpose. No reimbursement is provided for taxes or fees already paid. A small business limited liability company owned by a deployed member of the US Armed Forces is exempt from tax if operating at a loss or ceasing operation during deployment. The Franchise Tax Board can create regulations, including defining \"ceases operation.\" \"Deployed\" refers to active duty during combat or homeland defense, excluding training or permanent station changes. For taxable years starting on or after January 1, 2018, a small business LLC with total income of $250,000 or less is defined as a small business. A new veteran-owned small business LLC is exempt from taxes for the first three taxable years starting on or after January 1, 2016. (2) Definitions: \n- \"New veteran-owned small business\" refers to a veteran-owned LLC with total income of $250,000 or less, formed in this state or qualified to transact business here.\n- \"Veteran\" is an honorably discharged individual from the US Armed Forces.\n- \"Veteran-owned limited liability company\" is an LLC where over 50% of the membership interest is owned by one or more veterans. Section 23153 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to subject certain corporations to a minimum franchise tax until dissolution or ceasing business in California. This applies to corporations incorporated under state laws unless exempted. Certain corporations in California are subject to a minimum franchise tax until dissolution or ceasing business. This includes corporations incorporated under state laws, those qualified to transact intrastate business, and those doing business in the state. Credit unions are exempt from this tax. Nonprofit cooperative associations organized under Chapter 1 of the Food and Agricultural Code in California are exempt from the minimum franchise tax for five years starting from the issuance of the certificate by the board of supervisors. This exemption applies to associations formed after January 1, 1994. Corporations subject to the minimum franchise tax in California must pay an annual minimum franchise tax of $800, except for specific cases where the tax is reduced to $25. This reduction applies to inactive corporations formed for gold or quicksilver mining that have not conducted business within the state for a certain period. For taxable years starting in 1999, qualified new corporations must pay a minimum franchise tax of $500 annually to the state. The gross receipts of a corporation include those of all members in the commonly controlled group. (2) \"Gross receipts, less returns and allowances reportable to this state,\" includes gross receipts from business and nonbusiness income as defined in Section 25120. A \"qualified new corporation\" is a corporation incorporated in or qualified to do business in the state, starting operations with estimated gross receipts of $1,000,000 or less. It excludes corporations previously operating as sole proprietorships or partnerships. Limited partnerships, limited liability companies, limited liability partnerships, and charitable organizations are not included. The curr_chunk describes various types of entities such as regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, and qualified Subchapter S subsidiaries as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. For taxable years starting between January 1, 1999, and January 1, 2000, if a corporation pays $500 in its second year but exceeds $1,000,000 in gross receipts, an additional $300 tax is due. Corporations incorporating after January 1, 2000, are exempt from the minimum franchise tax in their first year. The subdivision exempts certain entities like limited partnerships, limited liability companies, charitable organizations, and real estate investment trusts from the minimum franchise tax. It also excludes corporations reorganizing solely to avoid paying the tax. (g) A domestic corporation filing a certificate of dissolution and not doing business is exempt from the minimum franchise tax. (h) The tax increase cannot exceed 10% per year. (i) A small business owned by a deployed member of the military is exempt from the tax if operating at a loss or ceasing operation during deployment. The Franchise Tax Board can create regulations for this subdivision, including defining \"ceases operation.\" Definitions for \"deployed,\" \"operates at a loss,\" and \"small business\" are provided. This subdivision will be inactive for taxable years starting on or after January 1, 2018. For taxable years starting on or after January 1, 2016, new veteran-owned small businesses in California are exempt from taxes for their second and third years if their total income is $250,000 or less. The definition of a \"veteran\" is someone honorably discharged from the US Armed Forces, and a \"veteran-owned corporation\" is one where over 50% of voting power and stock value is owned by veterans. This does not apply to corporations reorganizing to reduce their franchise tax. This act constitutes a tax levy and takes immediate effect."
