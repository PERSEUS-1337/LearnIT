    "content": "The report describes the gene editing technology CRISPR-Cas9, which has the potential to revolutionize genetic engineering and the biotechnology industry. It also discusses the economic benefits, regulatory considerations, national security concerns, and ethical issues surrounding the technology. CRISPR-Cas9 is a gene editing technology that offers substantial improvements in ease of use, speed, efficacy, and cost. It was named \"Breakthrough of the Year\" in 2015 by Science magazine. Many believe it may revolutionize disease investigation, prevention, and treatment, gene function understanding, crop yield improvement, biofuel production, and invasive species control. The CRISPR system, including CRISPR-Cas9, serves as an immune system against foreign DNA by identifying, cutting, and destroying it. Researchers have developed CRISPR-Cas9 as a gene editing technology that has been used to modify the genomes of various species. This technology is praised for its simplicity, low cost, and potential for widespread adoption, creating new research opportunities. The report discusses the challenges of using CRISPR-Cas9 for gene editing, focusing on improving delivery and reducing off-target activity. Scientists are working to enhance the technology despite technical hurdles. Gene editing technologies, including CRISPR-Cas9, allow for specific and intentional changes to DNA by inserting, removing, or modifying genes within the genome. CRISPR-Cas9 enables the targeting of multiple genes simultaneously, known as genome editing. This technology involves an enzyme that cuts DNA and a targeting mechanism to guide the enzyme to a specific location on the DNA strand. CRISPR-Cas9 is a gene editing technology that uses an enzyme (Cas9) and guide RNA to target and modify specific DNA sequences. This technology allows for precise editing of genomes in various organisms, offering flexibility and potential applications across different species. CRISPR-Cas9 technology, specifically the Cas9 nuclease, has been adapted to allow for various modifications to the genome, such as base editing, single strand DNA cutting, and gene expression regulation. This technology has also advanced gene drive research by biasing inheritance to increase the likelihood of passing on modified genes. Gene drives, facilitated by CRISPR-Cas9 technology, copy modified DNA into unmodified parent DNA, leading to the preferential increase of specific traits in subsequent generations. This approach has potential applications in disease control, invasive species eradication, and reversing pesticide resistance in agriculture. Despite concerns, the self-propagating nature of gene drives shows promise for significant societal and economic benefits in the future. Recent projections by market research firms and private investments indicate substantial potential value in CRISPR-enabled products. Market projections for gene editing, including CRISPR-Cas9, show growth in areas such as human therapeutics, research tools, crops, livestock, and more. Research and Markets estimated a CAGR of 33.26% for the global gene editing market, reaching $3.087 billion by 2023. The global gene editing market is projected to reach $3.087 billion by 2023, with North America leading due to technology awareness and early adoption. Asia follows with government funding and relaxed regulations, while Europe lags behind due to strict regulations. The market is expected to grow to $6.28 billion by 2022, with CRISPR technology leading the way. The CRISPR gene editing market was valued at $477 million in 2017 and is projected to reach $4.271 billion by 2024, with a CAGR of 36.8%. Private investments in CRISPR research are increasing, with companies like Editas Medicine raising significant funds through public offerings. Editas Medicine raised significant funds through public offerings in 2017 and 2018, totaling approximately $96.7 million and $57.2 million. They also received net proceeds of $48.5 million in January 2018. The company holds CRISPR and gene editing patent rights from various institutions. Editas has partnerships with Allergan and Juno Therapeutics for research programs, receiving upfront payments and research support. Editas Medicine has received up to $22 million in research support for three programs over five years. They have also engaged in a three-year R&D collaboration deal with San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy to research and develop stem cell and T-cell therapies for rare diseases. CRISPR Therapeutics AG, founded by Emmanuelle Charpentier, has raised almost $140 million, including financing rounds in 2016 and subsequent offerings in 2018. They also founded Casebia Therapeutics with Bayer AG for joint research ventures. CRISPR Therapeutics, in collaboration with Bayer and Vertex Pharmaceuticals, is conducting a clinical trial for a therapy targeting the genetic causes of blood disorders. The company has received significant funding for research and development, with a market capitalization of $1.89 billion as of November 15, 2018. Caribou Biosciences, Inc., founded by Jennifer Doudna and other scientists, raised $30 million in private financing in May 2016 for CRISPR technology development. The Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy received a $250 million grant to sponsor clinical trials using CRISPR-modified T-cells to treat cancer. The trial for CRISPR technology has been approved by the National Institutes of Health and is awaiting final approval from review boards and the FDA. Monsanto secured a license agreement for agricultural applications of CRISPR technology. Calyxt, Inc. has exclusive rights to patents for engineering plant genomes. The University of Minnesota owns patents for engineering plant genomes focusing on products like low trans-fat soybean oil, cold storable potato, gluten reduced wheat, and low saturated canola oil. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing has seen a significant increase in federal research funding and scientific publications. NIH funding for CRISPR-related research grew from $5 million in FY2011 to $1.1 billion in FY2018, with the number of scientific publications rising from 87 in 2011 to 3,917 in 2018. The Coordinated Framework for the Regulation of Biotechnology guides the regulation of biotechnology products, including those developed using CRISPR-Cas9. The Coordinated Framework for the Regulation of Biotechnology was established in 1986 by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). It ensures that genetically engineered products are regulated based on their characteristics, not their production method. The framework involves three primary agencies - the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). EPA regulates genetically engineered products that qualify as pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. The Coordinated Framework for the Regulation of Biotechnology, established in 1986, involves three primary agencies - the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). USDA regulates biotechnology products that may pose a risk to agricultural plant and animal health under the Plant Protection Act and the Animal Health Protection Act. FDA regulates human and animal drugs, foods derived from genetically engineered plants, and genetically engineered animals under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act. The Obama Administration issued a memorandum in 2015 to update the Coordinated Framework for biotechnology regulation due to new developments in biotechnology and perceived regulatory inadequacies. The memorandum highlighted the need for a more streamlined regulatory structure to address future biotechnology risks. The 1986 White House memorandum called for an update to the Coordinated Framework for biotechnology regulation to enhance federal oversight, increase transparency, and promote innovation. It aimed to clarify agency roles, develop a long-term regulatory strategy, and commission an independent analysis of future biotechnology products. A Biotechnology Working Group was established to achieve these objectives. The Biotechnology Working Group (BWG) was established under the Emerging Technologies Interagency Policy Coordination Committee, including representatives from the White House, EPA, FDA, and USDA. The 2017 update to the Coordinated Framework by the three primary regulatory agencies discussed their roles and coordination of oversight responsibilities. It concluded that the existing regulatory structure was effective in protecting health and the environment but noted challenges such as uncertainty in agency jurisdiction and unpredictable review timeframes, impacting small and mid-size companies and academe. The Biotechnology Working Group (BWG) published the National Strategy for Modernizing the Regulatory System for Biotechnology Products in September 2016. The goal is to efficiently assess risks of future biotechnology products, support innovation, protect health and the environment, promote public confidence, increase transparency, and reduce unnecessary costs. EPA, FDA, and USDA commissioned a study in early 2016 by the National Academy to assess the future landscape of biotechnology products. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) conducted a study in early 2016 for EPA, FDA, and USDA to identify advances in biotechnology products over the next 5 to 10 years. The NAS emphasized the potential overwhelm of regulatory agencies by new products from genomic research and proposed a strategic risk management approach. The study highlighted the challenges posed by CRISPR-Cas9 technology and gene-editing systems. The Coordinated Framework, CRISPR-Cas9 technology, and other gene-editing systems pose regulatory challenges for products that may not fit existing categories. The 2017 NAS report highlighted the difficulty regulators face in overseeing new biotechnology products beyond traditional uses. Issues in regulating CRISPR-Cas9 products are discussed in detail, with examples of current and potential applications. The following sections provide examples of current and potential uses of CRISPR-Cas9 technology, including medical applications like treating genetic forms of diabetes. Experts believe CRISPR-Cas9 could lead to significant cost savings and improvements in health outcomes. CRISPR technology is being used to treat Type I diabetes by replacing insulin-producing cells with the patient's own cells, reducing the risk of transplant rejection. This approach may also offer treatment for non-autoimmune diabetes. The American Diabetes Association reports that diabetes affects nearly 30 million Americans, with significant economic costs. CRISPR is also being explored to combat malaria by modifying or eliminating the Anopheles mosquito. CRISPR technology is being used to combat malaria by modifying or eliminating the Anopheles mosquito, the primary vector for malaria transmission. Gene drives could make the mosquitos infertile or resistant to the malaria parasite, potentially reducing or eliminating the mosquito population. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is investing in CRISPR-based gene drive technologies to address malaria. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has awarded $75 million to Target Malaria, a non-profit consortium focused on reducing female Anopheles mosquitos responsible for malaria transmission in Africa. Malaria accounts for significant public health expenditures and global costs, with discussions on using similar approaches for other mosquito-borne diseases like Zika and dengue fever. In October 2018, the FDA accepted the application of two biotechnology companies for an experimental gene therapy treatment for sickle cell disease using CRISPR-Cas9. The treatment aims to modify stem cells to produce high levels of fetal hemoglobin to counteract severe pain caused by the sickle cell mutation. SCD affects approximately 100,000 Americans, with annual medical care costs exceeding $1.1 billion. Researchers have also shown the ability to use CRISPR-Cas9 to make genetic repairs in cells to produce dystrophin, a protein. CRISPR-Cas9 can make genetic repairs in cells to produce dystrophin, a protein crucial for patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. The absence of dystrophin leads to severe health issues and high annual costs. Additionally, CRISPR-Cas9 shows promise in combating antibiotic resistant pathogens, which cause significant mortality rates each year. CRISPR-Cas9 has been proven effective in targeting and eliminating bacterial species, including antibiotic resistant strains, while preserving beneficial bacteria. Resistance to CRISPR-based antimicrobials is difficult for bacteria to develop, making it a promising alternative to traditional antibiotics. The main challenge lies in finding an efficient delivery method. The potential applications of CRISPR-Cas9 in gene editing are vast, including the modification of genes to treat diseases and the possibility of altering genes in early human embryos or gametes. Gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 can modify genetic material in somatic cells or germline cells. Changes in somatic cells affect only the individual, while changes in germline cells are heritable. This distinction is crucial ethically and in regulatory discussions regarding gene editing techniques applied to human embryos. China and the United States are leading research in CRISPR-Cas9 for non-heritable genetic modification. China conducted the first human trial in 2016, focusing on safety. Additional trials have been initiated in both countries, targeting cancer and sickle cell disease. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania are recruiting for a trial where human T-cells will be modified using CRISPR-Cas9 and introduced into cancer patients. The FDA has lifted a clinical hold on an investigational new drug application for a trial testing CRISPR-modified cells in patients with sickle cell disease. This study is now recruiting participants. The FDA authorized a third trial by Editas Medicine using CRISPR to treat a rare genetic disease causing blindness. CRISPR-Cas9 has been used in research on human embryos in other countries and the US, including attempts to modify genes for beta-thalassemia and HIV-resistance. In August 2017, researchers at Oregon Health and Science University used CRISPR in viable human embryos to correct a genetic defect causing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The experiment showed 72.4% of modified embryos had the healthy gene, sparking debate in the scientific community over the repair mechanism used. The study using CRISPR in viable human embryos to correct genetic defects has sparked debate in the scientific community. Chinese scientists have also conducted similar studies targeting genes for beta-thalassemia and Marfan Syndrome, with promising results. The use of CRISPR-Cas9 was first described in 2012, and next-generation versions like base editing are being developed for more efficient gene editing. The use of CRISPR technology in human embryos has reignited debates and raised concerns about genetic engineering. Recent claims of CRISPR-modified babies have further fueled discussions on regulation and oversight in the United States. Recent developments in U.S. regulation reflect the growing importance of federal oversight in this type of research. Federal oversight of biomedical and clinical research involving CRISPR-Cas9 technology is triggered by the federal government's role as a funder and regulator of medical products. The FDA regulates clinical research for new medical products, while the NIH oversees government funding for biomedical research. Congress can also influence funding for research through appropriations. The NIH and FDA receive funding from Congress through annual appropriations. Oversight mechanisms and regulations for CRISPR-Cas9 research are in place at both agencies, with specific requirements and limitations outlined in appropriations bills. The NIH and FDA have regulatory requirements for CRISPR-Cas9 research, including restrictions on funding for gene-editing in human embryos. NIH-funded research using CRISPR-Cas9 must comply with NIH Guidelines. The NIH Guidelines require registration and approval for research involving recombinant nucleic acid molecules in human participants, including review by the RAC, IRB, and IBC. However, proposed changes aim to eliminate protocol registration, reporting, and RAC review to streamline oversight of gene transfer clinical trials. The NIH and FDA no longer see gene therapy as needing special oversight due to safety concerns. Changes are proposed to align gene transfer research oversight with other protocols under NIH Guidelines, while RAC will continue as an advisory board for emerging biotechnologies. The NIH is considering changes to guidelines for gene transfer research, including synthetic biology, gene editing, and neurotechnology. The Dickey-Wicker amendment prohibits the use of federal funds for research involving human embryos, genetic modification, or CRISPR-Cas9. The FDA is prohibited from using funds for research involving human embryos and gene editing technologies like CRISPR-Cas9. Congress has acted to prevent FDA approval of medical products based on these technologies in human embryos. FDA regulatory requirements apply to all clinical research investigating new medical products like drugs, devices, and biologics. CRISPR-Cas9 products are considered human gene therapy products and require FDA acceptance of an IND for clinical research. Somatic applications of CRISPR-Cas9 raise fewer ethical issues than germline applications in humans. The use of CRISPR-Cas9 in somatic cells for non-disease applications raises ethical issues related to enhancement, while using it for treating diseases primarily raises safety concerns such as accuracy of DNA cuts, integration of replacement genetic material, and off-target activity. Ethical concerns arise with the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology, particularly in modifying human embryos and the human germline. Safety issues, such as off-target effects and unintended genetic modifications, have been common in early research. The debate on the ethics of genetic modification in humans dates back to the advent of recombinant DNA technology and has continued through gene therapy and gene transfer research. Ethical concerns surrounding CRISPR-Cas9 technology focus on potential inequities in access, unintended genetic alterations in future generations, and the possibility of using gene modification for enhancement rather than solely for medical purposes. Some research aims to avoid these ethical dilemmas by studying genes without modifying human embryos, while early studies have attempted to address concerns by modifying non-viable embryos. The first study using CRISPR-Cas9 in human embryos sparked a debate on germline modification in the scientific community. The International Summit on Human Gene Editing in December 2015 addressed the ethical and governance issues associated with human gene-editing research. The committee released a statement on gene editing, supporting basic research and clinical use with qualifications. The NAS report on Human Genome Editing aligns with the International Summit's findings, proposing criteria for germline genetic modification. The criteria for germline genetic modification have not been met yet, as stated in the 2017 NAS report. Recent reports suggest that genome editing for influencing future generations could be ethically acceptable under certain conditions. In November 2018, the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing rejected a moratorium on germline gene editing research and recommended a \"translational pathway to germline editing.\" CRISPR-Cas9 technology has potential for biomedical research, clinical innovations, and global agriculture by allowing precise genetic modifications in plants and livestock. CRISPR-Cas9 technology offers the capacity to engineer changes in major food crops by substituting existing plant DNA sequences with desired ones or enhancing/suppressing gene expression. It allows breeders to insert specific genes from wild species into target plants, reducing breeding cycles and providing unprecedented control over plant genetic material. Future crops created through CRISPR-Cas9 technology could have higher plant-pest control, enhanced nutrition, and the ability to grow in poor soils. This technology allows for precise genetic modifications, including multiple gene insertions, offering unprecedented control over plant genetic material. The global acreage planted with genetically engineered crops like corn, cotton, soybean, and canola mainly feature pest resistance and herbicide tolerance traits. CRISPR-Cas9 technology allows for precise genetic modifications in plants and livestock, offering a new method of creating novel cultivars. Chinese researchers have developed wheat resistant to powdery mildew using CRISPR, and it has been used in other crops like rice, soybeans, and tomatoes. Livestock genes are also being altered to provide immunity to diseases like swine flu. These advancements could lead to substantial economic benefits. A trial is underway to replace a gene in domestic pigs with a gene from warthogs that provides resistance to a deadly form of swine flu. Other CRISPR-enabled livestock advancements include beefier Brazilian cattle, chickens producing only female chicks for egg-laying, cattle reproducing only males for feed-to-meat efficiency, and hornless dairy cattle for economic benefits and improved animal welfare. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service regulates the importation and testing of genetically engineered plants and organisms. The regulatory oversight of genetically engineered plants and organisms falls under different agencies such as the USDA, FDA, and EPA. APHIS reviews applications for GE plants to determine if they are plant pests. Various gene-editing systems, including CRISPR-Cas9, have been used in over 30 applications submitted to APHIS since 2011. Genetically engineering plants often involves using Agrobacterium tumefaciens to introduce foreign DNA. The presence of A. tumefaciens DNA in the resulting plant can trigger regulation under the PPA. Uncertainty in regulating genome editing has been seen as a barrier to innovation. Secretary of Agriculture Perdue stated in March 2018 that USDA will not regulate plants developed through CRISPR-Cas9 if they could have been created through traditional breeding methods, as long as they are not plant pests or developed using plant pests. This includes plants with genetic deletions, single base pair substitutions, or insertions from compatible plant relatives. CRISPR-Cas9 technology was used to create genetically modified crops like browning-resistant mushrooms and specialty corn with unique starch characteristics. These crops were developed without inserting genetic material from donor organisms, meeting the criteria to not be considered plant pests by APHIS. APHIS approved the first crops created by CRISPR-Cas9 in April 2016, determining they were not plant pests. FDA regulates genetically engineered animals as new animal drugs, overseeing the approval of GE salmon and mosquitoes. In 2017, FDA proposed guidelines for genome-editing in animals, treating each edit as a new drug requiring individual safety assessments. This regulatory approach has raised concerns about inhibiting innovation in animal genomic research. The FDA released a plan in October 2018 to provide guidance on regulating intentional genomic alterations in animals, gene-edited animals used in research, and establishing a repository for early-stage products or pure research. This plan aims to clarify the agency's regulatory oversight in animal genomic research. The FDA announced a new pilot program, the Veterinary Innovation Program, to assist in the regulatory pathway for gene-edited animals. Discussions on CRISPR-Cas9 technology echo past optimism in genetic engineering, with potential social and environmental concerns noted. The promise of technology and global advancements in gene editing, like CRISPR-Cas9, have raised social and ethical concerns. The use of CRISPR-Cas9, including gene-drive technology, has sparked debates on labeling GE foods and potential environmental impacts. The study's authors highlighted the need for careful assessment of ecological effects when reversing pesticide and herbicide resistance in insects and weeds, as well as controlling invasive species. Concerns about human and environmental safety, as well as the unknown effects of CRISPR-Cas9 technology in open environments, may impact the wider social acceptance of genome engineering. Perceptions of risk influence CRISPR-Cas9 development. Labeling for gene-edited plants is undecided. USDA's bioengineered food policy is pending. USDA will not regulate genome edited plants, potentially exempting them from disclosure. The US leads in planting GE crops, while acceptance varies globally. EU has minimal GE crop acreage. GE crops make up 1% of crop acreage, mainly pest-resistant GE corn in Spain. Some EU countries ban GE crop cultivation, with strict rules on trade and labeling. Public opinion in the EU is against GE food. Latin America has more approved GE crops than Africa. Only a few African countries grow GE crops commercially. India, China, and other countries also have commercial GE crops. Sudan is the only African country where GE crops are grown commercially. India, China, and Pakistan are major producers of GE cotton. The Philippines is the only Asian country to have approved a GE crop other than cotton for cultivation. The EU is moving towards regulating plants created through genomic editing, following a similar path as with transgenic organisms. The Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that organisms obtained by mutagenesis are GMOs and fall under the GMO Directive. The Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that new mutagenesis techniques like CRISPR-Cas9 could pose similar risks to transgenesis, and excluding organisms created from these techniques would compromise the objectives of the GMO Directive. Harmonization of international trade regulations for genetically engineered products is also a challenge due to varying approval processes and labeling issues. Intellectual property issues surrounding CRISPR-Cas9 agricultural organisms are likely to continue to be a controversial issue in international agriculture, as ownership of gene-edited raw materials and sharing of genome editing in global food crops remain uncertain. The emergence of CRISPR-Cas9 suggests that whole genomes could potentially receive intellectual property protection. Agricultural productivity relies on biodiversity for developing improved cultivars, raising questions about how gene editing will impact seed development and international trade regulations. The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (PGRFA) focuses on conservation, sustainable use, and fair sharing of benefits. CRISPR-Cas9 technology could complicate implementation by affecting the rights of contracting parties. It also broadens the use of microorganisms in industrial production and makes strains resistant to viruses. CRISPR-Cas9 technology is used to make industrially relevant strains resistant to viruses and increase production of chemicals for biofuels and manufacturing. Researchers at the University of California, Riverside, have developed a yeast strain for producing useful lipids and polymers, potentially leading to new biofuels and specialty polymers. This innovation aims to create long-chain hydrocarbons using yeast instead of synthetic processes, offering a more efficient and safer bio-manufacturing process. CRISPR gene editing is also proposed as a control method for invasive species. The use of a CRISPR-based gene drive has been proposed to manage invasive species and agricultural pests by spreading a trait through populations. This method could make species more susceptible to control agents or bias gender ratios to decrease populations. Invasive species pose a threat to island biodiversity, with over 80% of islands having invasive rodent species. Conventional control methods are costly and can harm native species. CRISPR-based gene drive offers a specific and targeted approach to control invasive species. Some researchers also plan to use CRISPR-Cas9 for de-extinction projects, like recreating the wooly mammoth and passenger pigeon by editing modern animal DNA. The use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology allows for editing the DNA of contemporary animals to include lost traits, such as increasing hair growth and subcutaneous fat in the case of the wooly mammoth. Anticipation of benefits to human health, agriculture, and the environment is accompanied by concerns over potential negative consequences to other species and ecosystems. The fast-moving nature of this field is both encouraging and concerning, with gene-drive modified organisms showing promise in addressing challenges like eradicating vector-borne diseases and conserving endangered species, although based on limited proof-of-concept studies. The efficiency of gene-drive modified organisms may lead to calls for their release in crisis situations before adequate knowledge of their ecological effects and mitigation plans for unintended consequences are in place. Organisms invasive in one area may be normal or at risk in their native habitats. Transfer of organisms with inserted genes could have unpredictable effects. Experts call for regulatory reform and clarity in federal agency oversight. Environmental release of gene-drive modified organisms will likely fall under the Coordinated Framework for the Regulation of Biotechnology. The Coordinated Framework for the Regulation of Biotechnology assigns regulatory responsibilities to federal agencies like the FDA, EPA, and USDA based on the product's intended use. However, there is a lack of clarity on which agency should regulate various applications of genetically engineered organisms. Regulatory reform and clarity are needed for the environmental release of gene-drive modified organisms. The National Academy recommends developing an interagency process to determine regulatory jurisdiction for gene-drive modified organisms. FDA guidance clarifies regulation of genetically modified mosquitoes based on intended use: as a pesticide for population control or as a new animal drug for disease reduction. The FDA's guidance on regulating genetically modified organisms, such as mosquitoes, for population control or disease reduction should be expanded to cover all animal populations. Environmental risk assessments for gene-drive-modified organisms released into the environment are determined by federal agencies like FDA, USDA, and EPA under specific regulatory processes. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) requires an environmental impact statement (EIS) for major federal actions affecting the environment. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) mandates analysis of environmental effects for projects with uncertain impacts, leading to either an environmental assessment (EA) or a Finding of No Significant Impact. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires agencies to assess environmental impacts before making decisions. NEPA does not prioritize environmental concerns over other factors but mandates a thorough evaluation of environmental consequences. The NEPA process includes clear reporting requirements, public input, and the collection of extensive information about proposed activities. The NEPA process includes clear reporting requirements and provisions for public input. However, it lacks a quantitative cause-effect model and probabilistic analysis, making it difficult to create testable hypotheses for research on gene-drive modified organisms. In contrast, ecological risk assessment allows for quantification of outcomes and identification of sources of uncertainty, making it a more thorough tool according to the National Academy of Sciences. Ecological risk assessment is seen as a more thorough tool for supporting public policy decisions about gene drive technologies. However, industry may argue that the NEPA process is sufficient and requiring risk assessments could lead to delays and costs. The National Academy of Sciences states that more research is needed before releasing gene-drive modified organisms into the environment, with a focus on identifying and studying potential risks. The potential risks of gene drive technologies need to be carefully studied and identified to support public policy decisions. However, there are concerns that requiring risk assessments could lead to delays and costs. The National Academy of Sciences emphasizes the need for more research before releasing gene-drive modified organisms into the environment. One example is the potential negative consequences of suppressing an invasive plant species, which could result in habitat loss for native animals and the possible emergence of even more resilient invasive species. Gene drives could be used to modify mosquito populations to reduce the spread of diseases like Zika, but unintended consequences could lead to the emergence of more harmful viruses. Scientists suggest developing reversal or immunization gene drives to counter these risks by reverting organisms to their original genetic state or making them immune to the gene drive. The use of gene drives raises questions about societal acceptance and ethical considerations, with varying views on their use for public health benefits or species eradication. Societal tolerance may differ based on community impact and ethical beliefs. The need for public engagement and dialogue before field testing or releasing gene-drive modified organisms is crucial. Concerns about environmental justice, responsibility for addressing harms, and engaging stakeholders are key. The National Academy of Sciences emphasizes the importance of engagement for mutual learning, decision-making, and exploring ethical questions related to gene drive technologies. The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) governs genetically modified organisms, focusing on conservation, fair benefit sharing, and technology transfer. CBD requires engagement before releasing gene-drive modified organisms into the environment, emphasizing the importance of effort, resources, and planning. The Cartagena Biosafety Protocol, completed in 2000, is a key component of the CBD. The Cartagena Biosafety Protocol, completed in 2000, applies to the transboundary movement, handling, and use of genetically modified organisms that may affect human health, the environment, or biological diversity. It requires notification of potential adverse effects on biological diversity. The protocol has been extended to synthetic biology and gene drives. In November 2018, government officials considered a resolution to prohibit the release of organisms modified using gene drives, but it was ultimately rejected. Some in the scientific community opposed the ban, stating that it would limit research opportunities. Environmental groups supported the ban, citing concerns about the potential spread of engineered genes in natural systems. The CBD is based on the precautionary principle, which suggests caution in the absence of scientific certainty. Critics fear trade restrictions based on this principle. The US is less strict on scientific uncertainty and innovation. The National Academy of Sciences notes the US lacks a clear policy due to not being a party to the CBD. The National Academy of Sciences report highlights concerns about countries lacking capacity to assess safety of gene drive research and engage in public dialogue. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing offers flexibility in basic research, making the development of animal disease models more efficient and cost-effective. The CRISPR technology has revolutionized the creation of animal models, reducing time and cost significantly. It is expanding the types of animals used for research, such as the tree shrew for studying the human brain. Countries like China and Japan are using CRISPR to advance primate-related research, creating models for diseases like autism and cardiovascular disease. CRISPR-Cas9 is not only editing genomes but also regulating gene expression, providing insights into cellular systems and diseases. Epigenetics studies gene expression changes without altering DNA. CRISPR-Cas9 can precisely modify the epigenome by attaching to genes to control expression. This technology can create on-off switches and fluorescent molecules for visualizing gene expression. Genetic engineering advancements raise national security concerns due to potential risks from different regulatory standards. The rapid development of dual-use technology like CRISPR-Cas9 poses national security risks due to the potential misuse of gene editing for creating harmful biological agents. Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats has expressed concerns about the unintentional negative health effects and deliberate misuse of biotechnologies. The technology's affordability and accessibility could lower the barrier for biological weapons programs, leading to far-reaching economic and security implications. Advances in gene editing could be used for creating novel pathogens or altering existing ones in biological weapons programs. However, the complexity of traits in pathogens may make desired changes challenging without causing unintended effects. Despite modest implications for weapons relevance, gene editing technologies would likely be incorporated into any biological weapons program. Concerns about inadvertent ecological effects of CRISPR-Cas9 technology also apply to its potential deliberate misuse. The United States addresses dual-use technologies through export controls and international measures. Advances in gene editing, particularly CRISPR-Cas9 technology, pose national security concerns due to their dual-use nature in biological weapons programs. Export controls and international agreements may not effectively address these risks, and current mitigation strategies could be circumvented. Gene editing could enhance the development of medical countermeasures against traditional and genetically engineered biological weapons. In July 2017, DARPA announced the \"Safe Genes\" program with a $65 million investment over four years to understand gene editing technologies, ensure safe and responsible use, and address health and security concerns related to misuse. Research teams will work on developing genetic constructs for controlling genome editors and creating drug-based countermeasures to limit genome editing. The \"Safe Genes\" program by DARPA aims to develop countermeasures for genome editing to protect genome integrity and eliminate unwanted engineered genes."
