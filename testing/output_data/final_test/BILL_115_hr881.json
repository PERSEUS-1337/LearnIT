    "content": "The \"Allocation for Music Producers Act\" or the \"AMP Act\" is the short title of this legislation. It pertains to the payment of statutory performance royalties. The \"AMP Act\" amends Section 114(g) of title 17, United States Code, to allow a collective to accept instructions from a payee to distribute payments to a producer, mixer, or sound engineer involved in creating a sound recording. This is known as a 'letter of direction'. The AMP Act allows a collective to accept a 'letter of direction' for payment distribution to individuals involved in creating a sound recording. This letter designates the payee as the rightful recipient of the payment during its validity. The AMP Act allows a collective to deduct 2 percent of receipts from pre-1995 sound recordings for payment distribution to recording artists or rights holders without a letter of direction. The AMP Act allows a collective to distribute 43 percent of total receipts to recording artists or rights holders after deducting costs, if certain requirements are met, including certification of attempt to obtain a letter of direction. The AMP Act requires a person to make efforts to contact the artist payee for a letter of direction instructing the collective to pay royalties, and the artist payee must not have certified to the collective during that period. The artist payee did not definitively affirm or deny the request for a letter of direction, and the collective attempted to contact the artist payee for at least 4 months before the first distribution. No objection to the distribution has been received. No objection to the distribution has been submitted by the artist payee to the collective 10 business days before the first distribution. Eligibility for payment requires a written contract with a record company or recording artist involved in the relevant sound recording. The curr_chunk discusses the eligibility criteria for individuals to receive royalty payments based on their contribution to a sound recording. This includes having a contractual agreement with a record company or recording artist, making a copyright-protected contribution to the creation of the recording, and being entitled to royalties from the exploitation of the recording. The curr_chunk outlines the process for individuals to receive royalty payments for their contribution to a sound recording. It involves meeting eligibility criteria, submitting a written certification, and potentially sharing distribution among multiple eligible persons. The process for receiving royalty payments involves distributing 2 percent equally among eligible persons. If an objection is raised within 10 days, further payments will cease, but previous distributions will not be affected. The distribution of royalty payments involves allocating 2 percent equally among eligible individuals. If objections are raised within 10 days, future payments will stop, but past distributions will remain unaffected. The term \"artist payee\" refers to someone who owns the right to receive receipts for a sound recording. In cases with multiple artist payees for a sound recording, objections by one payee only affect their share of receipts, not others'. Amendments to Section 114(g) of title 17, United States Code clarify the role of a collective designated by the Copyright Royalty Judges. Amendments to Section 114(g) of title 17, United States Code clarify the role of a collective designated by the Copyright Royalty Judges by replacing \"agent designated\" with \"collective designated\" and \"agent\" with \"collective\" throughout the text."
