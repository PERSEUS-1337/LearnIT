    "content": "Border security concerns have evolved from issues like drug smuggling to potential terrorist threats post-9/11. Congress faces the challenge of balancing effective border control with free trade and economic growth, needing to allocate resources wisely while maintaining the flow of commerce and travel. Several bills have been introduced to overhaul the U.S. immigration system and tighten enforcement of U.S. immigration laws. Border management involves securing the border at ports of entry and patrolling between ports of entry, particularly along the southwest border. Border management, especially along the southwest border, includes enforcing immigration laws within the country. This report discusses border security programs impacting the southwest border, focusing on enforcement efforts at ports of entry, between ports of entry, and within the interior of the United States. It also covers initiatives to facilitate the flow of people and goods across the border and those aimed at controlling potential threats to national security. The report compares the southwest and northern borders, details the U.S.-Mexico relationship regarding border security, and discusses major control points like inspections, border patrol, and interior enforcement. The U.S. border with Mexico is approximately 2,000 miles long, featuring desert land, mountain ranges, and the Rio Grande River. The border with Canada is more than twice as long, covering seven Canadian provinces and 10 U.S. states. The U.S. southwest border is shorter than the northern border but sees more travelers, with 173 million inspections in FY2004 compared to 52 million at the northern border. It has a history of illegal migration, human smuggling, and drug activities, accounting for over 94% of all illegal alien apprehensions each year. Efforts to strengthen both borders focus on stemming illegal migration and human smuggling. The southwest border focuses on stemming illegal migration, human smuggling, and drug interdiction, while the northern border emphasizes information sharing, policy streamlining, and trade facilitation between the United States and Canada. The relationship between the United States and Mexico is crucial, with extensive connections through trade, investment, migration, tourism, and cultural ties. Mexico is the second most important trading partner of the United States and a major source of undocumented migrants. Mexico is crucial for cooperation on migration, drug trafficking, and border security due to its population of 105 million people and GDP of $657 billion. It is a leader in Latin America and the world, with extensive trade partnerships through NAFTA. Under NAFTA, Mexico plays a significant role in the world's largest free trade area alongside the United States and Canada. Mexico's trade with the United States has grown substantially since NAFTA's implementation in 1994, with the US being Mexico's top trading partner. Mexico's GDP is comparable to Canada's, and it is a key player in the NAFTA agreement. Since NAFTA came into effect in 1994, trilateral trade has more than doubled to $621 billion, with Mexico-U.S. trade tripling to $266 billion. Critics argue that the United States has seen a growing trade deficit and lost jobs. U.S. direct investment in Mexico has declined from $20.4 billion in 2001 to $5.3 billion in 2003. The U.S. and Mexico have various mechanisms for consultation and cooperation, including presidential meetings, Binational Commission meetings, and congressional delegations. Since NAFTA came into effect in 1994, trilateral trade has more than doubled to $621 billion, with Mexico-U.S. trade tripling to $266 billion. U.S. direct investment in Mexico has declined from $20.4 billion in 2001 to $5.3 billion in 2003. The U.S. and Mexico have various mechanisms for consultation and cooperation, including presidential meetings, Binational Commission meetings, and congressional delegations. Additionally, Presidents Bush and Fox have engaged in discussions and agreements on migration and border security issues, joined by Prime Minister Martin of Canada for a trilateral meeting in 2005. These discussions have fallen under the Bilateral Migration Talks, Bilateral Partnership for Prosperity, Bilateral Border Partnership Agreement, and Trilateral Security and Prosperity Partnership. President Bush and President Fox discussed migration issues, with Mexican officials concerned about migrant deaths during unauthorized entry into the US. President Fox proposed legalizing undocumented Mexican workers through amnesty or guest worker arrangements to protect their human rights. The two presidents agreed to engage in high-level negotiations to address migration and labor issues between the two countries. During President Fox's visit to Washington, DC in 2001, the Presidents reviewed progress on migration issues. Talks stalled after the 9/11 attacks, focusing on border security. In 2002, Presidents Bush and Fox noted progress in enhancing migrant safety and charged a migration group to continue working on the issues. In 2003, President Fox appointed Luis Ernesto Derbez as Mexico's new Foreign Minister amid frustrations over lack of progress on a migration accord with the United States. Disagreements arose over U.S. military action in Iraq, leading to increased security measures at border points. Both countries took action against smugglers and warned of the dangers of illegal entry. In 2004, President Bush proposed an immigration system overhaul. President Bush outlined an immigration system overhaul to match foreign workers with U.S. employers, offering temporary legal status for up to three years. Incentives were included to encourage workers to return to their home countries. This proposal was launched during President Fox's visit to Washington, DC in September 2001. The Partnership for Prosperity initiative was launched by U.S. and Mexican leaders to boost economic development in Mexico, focusing on reducing remittance costs, promoting private investment, supporting small businesses, farmers, and infrastructure, and fostering collaboration between institutions. Entrepreneurial Workshops were held in 2003 and 2004 to facilitate networking among businesses, with progress reports presented at annual Binational Commission meetings. Secretary Powell highlighted the success of P4P programs in lowering transfer fees. Secretary Powell highlighted the success of P4P programs in lowering transfer fees, bringing together business and government leaders, and financing infrastructure projects. Major accomplishments include the establishment of a Peace Corps program and OPIC in Mexico, providing financing and insurance to U.S. businesses. The U.S.-Mexico Border Partnership Agreement, also known as the \"Smart Border Agreement,\" aims to enhance security and facilitate the transit of people and goods across the border. The U.S.-Mexico Border Partnership Agreement aims to enhance security and facilitate the transit of people and goods across the border by strengthening infrastructure, facilitating the secure flow of people, and easing the safe flow of goods through joint actions and technology sharing programs. Progress was noted in 2003 by former Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge and Secretary of Government Santiago Creel. In 2004, U.S. and Mexico signed the Action Plan for Cooperation and Border Safety, as well as a Memorandum of Understanding on the Repatriation of Mexican Nationals. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell highlighted growing cooperation on border security, including a new Working Group on Cyber-Security. In 2005, President Bush, President Fox, and Canadian Prime Minister Martin established the trilateral Security and Prosperity Partnership (SPP) of North America to enhance common security and prosperity. The Security and Prosperity Partnership (SPP) of North America was established in 2005 to enhance common security and prosperity among the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. Ministerial-led working groups were created to develop goals and initiatives, with a focus on common border security and bioprotection strategies. On June 27, 2005, initial results and proposed initiatives were released in a Report to Leaders during a meeting in Ottawa, Canada. The countries agreed to implement common border security and bioprotection strategies, enhance infrastructure protection, improve aviation and maritime security, and intelligence cooperation against transnational threats. They also highlighted the development of common screening methods for individuals and cargo, a trusted traveler program, and a collective approach to protecting infrastructure. In the prosperity area, efforts were made to enhance North American competitiveness and improve quality of life through regulatory cooperation and harmonization. The ministers agreed to enhance cross-border cooperation on health, food safety, and environmental protection projects, promote sectoral collaboration in energy, transportation, and financial services, and reduce trade costs. They also cited agreement on common principles for electronic commerce, liberalization of rules of origin, and collaboration in the steel, automobile, and energy sectors. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is now the primary agency responsible for border security-related responsibilities. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security oversees various agencies involved in border security, including the U.S. Coast Guard, CBP, and ICE. CBP includes the U.S. Border Patrol and inspections activities, while ICE handles investigative and detention activities. Congress established the U.S. Customs Service in 1789 to collect duties on imported goods, and immigration inspectors were formally created in 1891 under the Bureau of Immigration. The Bureau of Immigration was formally created in 1891 by Congress to regulate immigration at U.S. ports of entry. This specialized group of inspectors oversees the duties of immigration inspectors and customs inspectors. There is a growing concern over what is entering the country at southwest land ports of entry. The Bureau of Immigration was established in 1891 to regulate immigration at U.S. ports of entry, overseeing immigration and customs inspections. Efforts have been made to consolidate inspections into CBP and present a unified front at land ports of entry. The southwest border has the highest volume of travelers entering the U.S., with 25 land POE and over 800,000 people arriving from Mexico daily. San Ysidro land POE is consistently the busiest for passenger travel. The majority of travelers at southwest land ports of entry are Mexican nationals with a border crossing card. U.S. citizens and Legal Permanent Residents also seek entry. A U.S.-Mexico Border Partnership agreement was endorsed in 2002, focusing on immigration and border security measures like the SENTRI program. The U.S. and Mexico are collaborating on border security measures, including expanding the SENTRI program and enhancing efforts to detect dangerous third-country nationals. Progress has been made in implementing immigration-related border management items. The United States and Mexico are working together to enhance border security measures, including expanding the SENTRI program and implementing the Advanced Passenger Information System (APIS). They plan to increase border safety collaboration by adding personnel and life-saving equipment along the border. The SENTRI program facilitates the quick passage of low-risk frequent travelers at southwest land ports of entry. Unlike NEXUS, SENTRI is a unilateral initiative based on specific criteria for selection of ports of entry. The SENTRI program allows low-risk frequent travelers to pass quickly through southwest land ports of entry. Participants must be citizens or legal residents of the US, Mexico, or Canada, pass a background check, pay a fee, and follow program rules. They receive a radio transponder for automated border inspections. Discussions are ongoing about merging SENTRI with its northern counterpart, NEXUS. The 9/11 Commission recommended consolidating frequent traveler programs into a single program integrated with US-VISIT databases. Congress mandated integrating all databases processing alien information in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. This act also requires developing a plan to expedite registered traveler processing through a single program integrated into the biometric entry and exit data system. The focus at the southwest border is on illegal migrants and commercial trade. In FY2003, over 4 million commercial crossings occurred at the southwest border, with trucks accounting for the majority. Laredo, TX POE was the busiest crossing, surpassing Otay Mesa POE by 657 thousand commercial crossings in 2003. The U.S.-Mexico Border Partnership Agreement addresses customs-related items under \"Securing the\" heading. Border Partnership Agreement focuses on customs-related actions to secure the flow of goods, including public/private sector cooperation, electronic data exchange, secure in-transit shipments, technology sharing, secure railways, and combatting fraud. The U.S.-Mexico Border Partnership Agreement aims to secure the flow of goods by combatting fraud, expanding joint investigative activities, and continuing efforts to combat contraband. Three working groups have been created to implement initiatives identified in the plan. The U.S.-Mexico Border Partnership Agreement includes initiatives such as harmonizing hours of service at border POEs, deploying gamma ray inspection machines, expanding partnerships with private sector programs, exchanging core data electronically, testing electronic seals, conducting joint investigations on fraudulent trade, and monitoring in-transit shipments. The U.S.-Mexico Border Partnership Agreement includes updates on progress such as rail security, harmonizing port operation schedules, information exchange, and implementation of FAST lanes at border crossings. CBP uses non-intrusive inspection technologies like x-ray and gamma ray systems for secondary inspections at ports of entry. These technologies include Vehicle and Cargo Inspection Systems (VACIS) for containers, truck x-ray systems, Mobile Sea Container Examination Systems, and Pallet Gamma Ray System. Additionally, CBP deploys nuclear and radiological detection equipment for security purposes. CBP deploys various equipment at ports of entry, including personal radiation detectors, radiation portal monitors, and canine teams trained to detect contraband. Along the southern border, CBP and Mexican Customs are deploying Rail Vehicle and Cargo Inspection Systems to screen rail traffic. Radiation portal monitors are also installed at several ports of entry to passively detect radiation emitted from vehicles. The C-TPAT program offers importers expedited processing of cargo by complying with CBP requirements for securing the entire supply chain. Membership in C-TPAT reduces a company's overall risk score in the ATS, with eligibility open to air, rail, and sea carriers, brokers, freight forwarders, and more. The C-TPAT program includes various participants such as brokers, freight forwarders, carriers, and port authorities. Mexican manufacturers were included in the program in 2003. The FAST program aims to enhance trade efficiency and security between the US and Mexico through common risk management principles and advanced technology. It offers expedited clearance to C-TPAT members by reducing information requirements and streamlining the registration process for drivers and carriers. The FAST program aims to streamline the registration process for drivers, carriers, and importers, ensuring only low-risk participants are enrolled. To qualify for expedited processing, shipments must contain goods from a C-TPAT approved manufacturer, be transported by a C-TPAT certified carrier, and be destined for a C-TPAT approved importer. Manufacturers, importers, and carriers must secure containers with high-security seals. FAST is operational at six POE on the southern border. FAST is operational at six POE on the southern border: Laredo, TX; Hidalgo/Pharr, TX; El Paso, TX; Otay Mesa, CA; Brownsville, TX; and Calexico, CA. Plans are in place to expand FAST to eight additional POE by summer 2005. These ports handle 92% of commercial traffic and 15% of U.S.-Mexico trade is cleared through FAST lanes. CBP has negotiated CMAAs with 49 countries for mutual assistance in customs matters. The agreements signed by CBP with various countries allow for the exchange of information and intelligence to prevent customs offenses. The agreements are tailored to each country's customs administration and are beneficial to ICE and CBP foreign attache offices. There are ongoing debates regarding the inspection process at the southwest border, including what and who should be inspected, the extent of inspections, and the technology used at ports of entry. In 1996, Congress mandated the implementation of an automated entry and exit data system (U.S.-VISIT program) to track the arrival and departure of aliens, with a focus on tracking nonimmigrants who overstayed their visas. After 9/11, border security became the top priority, overshadowing concerns about tourism and commerce disruptions. Some concerns remain about the implementation of the U.S.-VISIT program, with doubts about its cost, infrastructure, and purpose. Critics suggest focusing on immigration enforcement instead. Despite these concerns, the program has shown successes since 1953, benefiting both the U.S. and Mexican governments economically. Mexican nationals need a visa or Laser Visa to enter the US, while Canadian nationals are waived from documentary requirements. The Laser Visa allows short-term entry for business or tourism. Mexican citizens can obtain a laser visa for short-term entry into the US for business or tourism, valid for 10 years. They may need to obtain a Form I-94 if traveling further inland or staying longer than 30 days. Critics argue for equal treatment with Canadian nationals who are not required to present travel documentation. Some Mexican nationals with border crossing cards have been known to overstay their terms. The overstay of Mexican border crossing cards has led to concerns about fraud and the need for biometrics. While Mexican nationals with a Laser Visa are currently exempt from U.S.-VISIT program requirements, the permanency of this exception is uncertain. Security concerns persist despite the alleviation of border delay worries. Security concerns have been raised regarding the exclusion of travelers with a border crossing card from the US-VISIT program. Mexican nationals with a Laser Visa are currently exempt from the program due to extensive background checks and document scanning at entry points. The US-VISIT program provides an extra layer of security at POEs, but equipment to read and scan documents is not available at every location. The BVS is not integrated with other critical data systems. CBP announced a unified inspection force at the border in 2003 to increase law enforcement responsibilities. Questions have been raised about the effectiveness of the initiative to cross-train customs and immigration inspectors for border security. The federal inspections process was established in the 1700s and 1800s, with the border patrol formally created in 1924 to address illegal entries between ports of entry. The border patrol was formally created in 1924 to address illegal entries between ports of entry. The Office of Air and Marine Operations (AMO) was recently transferred to CBP to monitor the border. AMO's mission is to protect the American people and critical infrastructure by deterring acts of terrorism and smuggling. AMO has branches and units located across the southern border. The Office of Air and Marine Operations (AMO) has branches, Surveillance branches, Air Units, and Marine units across the southern border and Puerto Rico. AMO's operations are threat-driven and influenced by the success and failures of counter-narcotic operations. Smugglers adapt to interdiction successes, shifting from air to water routes. 96% of cocaine movement from South America involves a maritime component, with the threat environment being fluid due to smugglers' adaptability. The Office of Air and Marine Operations (AMO) in northern Mexico is involved in air drug smuggling of marijuana and cocaine to the US border. AMO was transferred to CBP in 2005, raising questions about asset consolidation with border patrol and mission alignment. The border with Mexico remains a key area for illegal migration. The southwest border with Mexico is a major hotspot for illegal migration into the United States, with 97% of apprehensions occurring there. The USBP deploys 90% of their agents along this border, divided into nine sectors. The majority of illegal migration happens between ports of entry, making the border patrol crucial in securing the area. This section discusses their activities, strategy, and authority to stop and question individuals in vehicles passing through. The southwest border with Mexico is a major hotspot for illegal migration into the United States, with 97% of apprehensions occurring there. The USBP deploys 90% of their agents along this border, divided into nine sectors. The majority of illegal migration happens between ports of entry, making the border patrol crucial in securing the area. This section discusses their activities, strategy, and authority to stop and question individuals in vehicles passing through one of its interior checkpoint stations. Additionally, it covers the authority of the border patrol to remove aliens from the United States without a formal court proceeding. A 1993 study commissioned by the Office of National Drug Control Policy highlighted the issues of illegal immigration and drug smuggling along the southwest border, recommending a shift in focus towards preventing entry rather than arresting illegal migrants within the country. The former INS implemented the National Strategic Plan (NSP) in 1994 to strengthen enforcement of U.S. immigration laws by focusing on decreasing illegal immigration at the borders. The strategy targeted popular urban entry points, leading illegal migrants to less desirable remote areas. The NSP had four phases starting with border patrol sectors with high illegal migration activity, including San Diego, CA and El Paso, TX in Phase I. The National Strategic Plan (NSP) implemented in 1994 focused on preventing illegal immigration at the borders through the \"Prevention Through Deterrence\" strategy. This involved placing border patrol agents directly on the border to deter illegal entry, rather than apprehending migrants after entry. Congress supported this strategy by directing the INS to hire new agents and reallocate resources. The buildup in agents and resources led to about 90% of border patrol being stationed at the border. The NSP led to a massive buildup in agents and resources, with 90% of border patrol agents deployed along the southwest border. Agents are concentrated in nine corridors, rerouting illegal border traffic to less populated areas. Enforcement efforts have improved quality of life in border communities, with evidence of decreased border-related crimes. The crime rate in border communities decreased between 1990 and 2000, with San Diego and El Paso showing the most improvement. However, most border counties did not see as significant a decline in crime rates compared to the national average. This reduction is attributed to the \"Prevention Through Deterrence\" policy, which some believe is deterring illegal immigration and associated crimes. Crime rates fell in San Diego and El Paso compared to the national average, while increasing in less populated border communities. It is uncertain if illegal migration has decreased along the southwest border. Apprehensions rose in targeted areas by border patrol but decreased with increased enforcement. Some argue that the rise in apprehensions is due to concentrated manpower, while others believe the policy is working and shifting illegal migration to more challenging terrain. The Administration's strategy to secure San Diego and Tucson has shifted illegal immigration to more open areas like Western Arizona, posing dangers for migrants in rough terrain and extreme weather conditions. Critics argue that migrants risk their lives to avoid border patrol, facing dangers like swimming through the Rio Grande River in Texas. The Border Patrol focuses on preventing terrorist entry by targeting known smuggling operations along the Rio Grande River in Texas and other high-risk areas. This strategy involves joint operations with ICE and CBP to disrupt smuggling activities from significant interest countries. The emphasis on preventing terrorist entry does not change the Border Patrol's mission of stopping unauthorized aliens from entering the country. The USBP's new National Border Patrol Strategy (NS) aims to prevent unauthorized aliens from entering the country and has five main objectives: apprehending terrorists and weapons of mass destruction, deterring illegal entries, combating smugglers, utilizing \"Smart Border\" technology, and reducing crime in border communities. The strategy also focuses on different strategic priorities for each theater of operation, with a particular emphasis on the Southwest border. The National Border Patrol Strategy (NS) aims to combat the threat of terrorists using smuggling networks and illegal aliens as cover for cross-border penetration. To address this, the strategy calls for the expansion of Prevention Through Deterrence with sensoring technologies, enhanced intelligence gathering, cooperation with law enforcement agencies, and more mobile personnel and air support. Apprehension statistics are used as a performance measure but may be misleading due to focusing on events rather than individuals and the unknown number of aliens evading capture. The number of apprehensions at the southwest border is the only way to track trends in illegal migration, but it is difficult to establish a correlation with the actual number of people attempting to enter. Mexican nationals make up the majority of apprehensions, but there is a growing concern about nationals from other countries. The total number of unauthorized aliens apprehended steadily increased through the late 1990s, reaching a peak in FY2000. The number of apprehensions at the southwest border increased in FY2000 despite a doubling of personnel and resources. This rise could be due to increased border presence or more aliens attempting to enter the US. However, apprehensions have since declined, possibly due to successful deterrence strategies or economic factors. The increase in apprehensions at the southwest border in FY2004 suggests that unauthorized migrants have not been deterred despite increased manpower and resources. The \"Prevention Through Deterrence\" strategy has redirected migrant traffic from populated to remote areas. The data show a shift in unauthorized migrant traffic from populated areas to remote areas in the late 1990s, particularly to the Arizona desert along the Tucson sector. Apprehensions in Tucson and Yuma sectors increased in FY2004, indicating that the Prevention Through Deterrence strategy has changed the focal point of illegal migration. The Prevention Through Deterrence strategy has successfully shifted illegal migration from populated areas to more remote and challenging areas like the Tucson and Yuma sectors. Overall apprehensions increased by 27% from FY2003 to FY2004, with 76% of the increase occurring in Arizona due to the Arizona Border Control initiative. In FY2004, overall apprehensions increased by 27%, with the majority of the increase in Arizona due to the Arizona Border Control initiative. The San Diego sector also saw a significant increase in apprehensions, but they remain below pre-NSP levels. The border patrol apprehended 1.1 million people, with 94% being Mexican nationals. The agency distinguishes between Mexicans and Other Than Mexicans (OTM). In FY2004, apprehensions increased by 27%, mainly in Arizona due to the Arizona Border Control initiative. The San Diego sector also saw a rise in apprehensions. OTM apprehensions have more than doubled over the past three years, with the majority coming from five countries. Despite concerns about terrorist infiltration, apprehensions from Middle Eastern countries have actually declined. The border patrol is concerned about the number of aliens illegally entering the United States between official ports of entry. Immigration checkpoints serve as the third layer of defense, verifying the immigration status of individuals in passing vehicles. Three types of traffic-checking operations are conducted: permanent checkpoints, temporary checkpoints, and roving patrols, authorized by regulations empowering border patrol agents to interrogate and inspect vehicles for aliens. The Supreme Court allows traffic-checking programs in the interior to control illegal immigration. Tucson Border Patrol Sector is restricted from having permanent checkpoints due to Congressional limitations. CBP must relocate checkpoints in Tucson every 14 days to prevent predictability. CBP faces challenges due to Congressional restrictions on permanent checkpoint locations in the Tucson sector, requiring relocation every seven days to prevent national security vulnerabilities and aid border control efforts. The challenges faced by CBP in establishing permanent checkpoint locations in the Tucson sector make it difficult to determine the effectiveness of these checkpoints. Congress must balance the need for uncertainty in location to prevent illegal migrants from evading fixed points with the administrative requirements for permanence. CBP measures success by the number of arrests made, but this may not be a reliable indicator due to resource concentration and the unknown number of evaded captures. The 9/11 Commission expressed concerns about terrorists entering the US through land borders with the help of human smuggling networks. In response, DHS announced in 2004 that border patrol officers could use expedited removal authority to deny entry to aliens without proper documentation. Expedited removal is used to deny entry to aliens without proper documentation or who arrive fraudulently. Those seeking asylum or fearing persecution can receive a hearing before an immigration judge. People removed under expedited removal are barred from re-entry for five years but can apply for a waiver. This process has been traditionally used at air and sea ports of entry since 1997. The Immigration and Nationality Act allows expedited removal proceedings for two categories of aliens: those arriving in the United States and those who have entered without being admitted or paroled. The Secretary can designate expedited removal for aliens who have not established continuous physical presence in the US for the two-year period prior to determination of inadmissibility. The DHS has extended expedited removal to the border patrol, applying it to aliens encountered within fourteen days of entry without inspection and within 100 air miles of any U.S. international border. The new authority is only applied to third-country nationals and Mexican/Canadian nationals with criminal or immigration violations. Non-Mexican nationals apprehended along the southern border cannot be returned to Mexico. Non-Mexican nationals apprehended along the southern border are either voluntarily returned to their country of citizenship or placed in formal removal proceedings due to a lack of resources. Many are released in the United States with a notice to appear for removal proceedings, leading to some staying illegally. Concerns exist about the limitations of the new expanded authority and deficiencies in training and due process protections. The DHS is expanding expedited removal procedures between ports of entry to deter unlawful entry and improve border security. Physical barriers were first constructed in the early 1990s as part of the \"Prevention Through Deterrence\" strategy, primarily to deter drug smuggling. The border patrol chief in the San Diego sector initiated the construction of a 10-foot high welded steel fence covering 14 miles of the border. Congress expanded the existing fence by requiring the border patrol to construct a triple-layered fence along fourteen miles of the US-Mexico border near San Diego. Today, the border patrol maintains 96.7 miles of border fencing along the southwest border. A possible issue for Congress to consider concerns the potential tradeoff between preserving the environment in border regions and the requirements of domestic security. Environmental activists argue that border fencing does not significantly enhance national security but harms the environment. Others believe the fences are effective in deterring illegal crossings, despite causing environmental damage. The USBP's \"Prevention Through Deterrence\" strategy has led to an increase in accidental migrant deaths along the border as migrants attempt to cross in remote desert regions. The issue gained national attention after tragic events, such as the discovery of 19 dead migrant workers in Texas in 2003. Data on migrant deaths has been collected since 1998, with previous data compiled by the University of Houston's Center for Immigration Research. The data on migrant deaths along the border may not be accurate due to various jurisdictions represented. The number of fatalities is likely undercounted as it does not include information from the Mexican side. Migrant deaths decreased from 1988 to 1994 but sharply increased after the \"Prevention Through Deterrence\" strategy in 1995. Despite a slight decrease in deaths by FY2003, the overall mortality rate per attempted border crossing seems to have increased. The mortality rate per attempted border crossing seems to have increased despite the overall reduction in deaths, supporting the idea that border crossings have become more hazardous since the \"Prevention through Deterrence\" policy in 1995. The ratio of migrant deaths to border patrol apprehensions more than doubled from FY1999 to FY2003, but declined in FY2004. The decrease in border patrol apprehensions in FY1998-FY1999 may be linked to efforts to reduce migrant deaths. However, as unauthorized migration shifts to remote areas, the fatality rate has increased significantly since 1999. Critics argue that the border patrol undercounts fatalities by excluding certain cases, leading to inconsistencies in reporting migrant deaths. Border patrol officials dispute the inclusion of all deaths in counties within 100 miles of the US-Mexico border, citing lack of communication with local law enforcement. Despite debates over numbers, USBP has implemented the Border Safety Initiative (BSI) with Mexico to address migrant deaths by warning about border crossing dangers through media campaigns. The USBP collaborates with Mexico to address migrant deaths by warning about border crossing dangers through media campaigns and training Mexican firefighters and law enforcement. BORSTAR teams, composed of agents with specialized rescue training, respond to incidents involving distressed people along the border. In almost three years, border patrol agents have rescued 3,977 people along the southwest border. There are nine BORSTAR teams with 141 specially trained agents. Humanitarian organizations like Humane Borders provide services to decrease dangers for unauthorized migrants, including water stations in the desert and medical supplies. Humanitarian organizations like Humane Borders and faith-based groups maintain water stations and camps in the Arizona desert and California's Imperial Valley to provide aid to unauthorized migrants. The \"No More Deaths\" campaign operates 24-hour camps in southern Arizona to offer food, water, and medical attention to migrants. Despite concerns about aiding unauthorized immigrants, providing humanitarian aid is deemed legal by authorities. Some groups provide humanitarian aid to migrants in the desert, while others fear that increased aid may lead to more deaths as migrants rely on it. Civilian patrol groups assist border patrol, using technology like unmanned planes to identify unauthorized aliens. These groups have faced criticism for their tactics, including the use of firearms. In 2003, Ranch Rescue and Citizen Border Patrol scaled back activities on the Arizona border due to concerns about their tactics. The Minuteman Project in Arizona drew national attention for reducing illegal immigration flow in eastern Arizona near Douglas. The project involved hundreds of volunteers monitoring the border, but its success is disputed by the USBP. Apprehensions in eastern Arizona decreased from 24,842 in April 2004 to 11,128 in April 2005, while apprehensions in western Arizona increased from 18,052 in 2004 to 25,475 in 2005. Volunteers were unintentionally setting off border sensors, leading to false alarms and disrupting USBP operations. There is debate over the impact of groups patrolling the border, with some seeing them as vigilantes and others as helpful in identifying unauthorized migrants. Several Indian reservations near the U.S.-Mexican border, like the Tohono O'odham Reservation in Arizona and the Kickapoo Reservation in Texas, present unique challenges to border patrol due to their quasi-sovereign status. The jurisdictional issues between state, federal, and tribal law enforcement authorities in these areas can vary depending on the nature of the offense. The Supreme Court ruling in Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe limited tribal criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians, leading to questions about tribal police authority to arrest non-Indians. Tribal adjudicatory jurisdiction is restricted by federal statutes and Supreme Court cases, often yielding to state and federal authorities. Tribal law enforcement authorities have the power to expel non-members from reservations for violating trespassing restrictions and detain suspected offenders for pick-up by state or federal authorities. However, they often lack resources, funding, and training compared to state and federal officials, especially in remote locations near the U.S.-Mexico border. In remote reservations, tribal officials may be cross-commissioned by state or federal authorities to arrest non-Indian criminal suspects. On the Tohono O'odham Reservation in Arizona, a special unit of American Indian CBP officers, known as the \"Shadow Wolves,\" patrols the U.S.-Mexican border for drug interdiction since 1972. The Shadow Wolves, a special unit of American Indian CBP officers, originally focused on drug interdiction but now deal more with immigration issues, particularly on the Tohono O'odham Reservation. The Reservation, the second-largest in the country, extends into Mexico, creating challenges for border patrol due to members holding both U.S. and Mexican citizenship. Border-crossing within the Reservation became difficult after a fence was erected in the mid-1980s to deter drug smugglers. The Tohono O'odham Reservation, located on the border, is a popular route for illegal migration and smuggling due to its remote location. The impact of illegal migrants on the land is significant, prompting the USBP to enter into a MOU with the Natural Resources Conservation Service to address these concerns. The USBP entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in 2001 with the Natural Resources Conservation Service and the Environmental Protection Agency to address the impact of illegal migration on public lands in Arizona and New Mexico. Despite efforts to mitigate environmental degradation, a report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found insufficient coordination between federal agencies. The Bureau of Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) is responsible for immigration and customs-related investigations in the interior of the country. ICE has 22 field offices nationwide, with activities including apprehending and deporting unauthorized foreign nationals, interdicting illegal substances, and managing detention and removal programs. ICE conducts various investigative activities to counter terrorist activities, human and drug smuggling, and immigration-related violations. Prior to September 11, 2001, their focus was on national security threats, criminal acts, fraudulent activities, alien and substance smuggling, and work-site violations. ICE conducts investigative activities to counter various crimes, including illegal immigration, money laundering, cyber crimes, and terrorism. The ABC Initiative, launched in 2004, involves multiple law enforcement agencies in Arizona to detect and prevent terrorist activities and smuggling operations. Additional border patrol and special operations agents were deployed for this mission. In 2004, additional permanent border patrol agents and special operations agents were assigned to the Tucson sector, along with UAVs and helicopters. The ABC initiative led to a 56% increase in apprehensions of unauthorized aliens, with 351,700 apprehended in the first six months. ABC agents uncovered 225 drop houses and initiated investigations resulting in the prosecution of 1,431 felony cases. In FY2004, the ABC initiative in Tucson led to a significant increase in felony and misdemeanor cases prosecuted, with a 47% and 144% rise respectively over FY2003. Agents confiscated over 388,000 pounds of marijuana and 5,242 pounds of cocaine. Despite deploying more BORSTAR agents, migrant deaths increased by 7%. Alien smuggling into the U.S. mainly occurs along the U.S.-Mexico border, with Mexico serving as a staging area for illegal entry attempts. Alien smuggling into the United States poses a significant risk to national security and public safety, with smuggling pipelines potentially being used by terrorists. The international alien smuggling and sex trafficking trade generates $9.5 billion for criminal organizations worldwide, funding other criminal activities. The exact number of people smuggled into the U.S. annually is unknown. Border patrol efforts in certain areas have led smugglers to shift operations elsewhere, contributing to an increase in smuggling in Arizona. Smuggling organizations are attracted to the Arizona corridor due to challenging terrain, a major transportation hub, extensive staging areas, and a robust financial services infrastructure. Alien smuggling can lead to collateral crimes such as kidnapping, homicide, assault, rape, robbery, and identity theft. Smugglers may hold aliens hostage for ransom and establish \"safe houses\" for keeping aliens until they are moved. \"Smugglers often establish unsafe 'safe houses' for aliens, leading to health and safety risks. Vehicles used by smugglers are often unsafe, contributing to motor vehicle casualties. Border deaths are linked to smuggling, as some smugglers mislead migrants about the journey. The federal government has implemented initiatives to combat the billion-dollar illicit drug trade.\" The illicit drug trade, a billion-dollar business, involves violent crimes and potential terrorist exploitation. Mexico is a major corridor for drug transport to the US, leading to numerous drug seizures at and between ports of entry. DHS focuses on anti-drug trafficking efforts at the border and interior, with over 56,321 drug seizures in FY2004 totaling two million pounds worth over two billion dollars. Border patrol and ICE agents seize illicit drugs at ports of entry and in the interior. ICE agents and border patrol seize drugs at and between ports of entry, totaling over 1.9 million pounds in FY2004. They work to dismantle transnational smuggling organizations, targeting those that pose a threat to national security. Operation ICE Storm aims to disrupt violent smuggling organizations responsible for illegal transportation. ICE Storm is a part of the effort to dismantle violent smuggling organizations bringing unauthorized migrants into the US through the southwest border. In Phoenix, Arizona, ICE Storm has led to a decrease in homicides and over 1,526 arrests. By May 18, 2004, ICE Storm had prosecuted over 190 defendants for various crimes, seized weapons and over $5.2 million. It became a part of the ABC on March 16, 2004. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has a presence in the southwest to combat drug trafficking. The OCDETF program, created in 1982, involves multiple DOJ agencies, IRS, ICE, and the U.S. Coast Guard. It faces challenges due to differing priorities among member agencies. The OCDETF program lacks a single mission and needs a consolidated budget for effective management and proper use of resources. Congress consolidated appropriations into a single fund in FY2004 and FY2005, but concerns remain about funding for DHS and the Department of the Treasury's OCDETF-related activities. These issues raise questions about management, control of funds, and coordination within OCDETF. The OCDETF program manages and controls funds and resources, coordinates program priorities, and faces congressional oversight. The SWBPI funds local prosecution offices in southwest border states for drug cases and pre-trial detention costs. It supports enforcement of federal and state laws, targeting border criminal enterprises. The SWBI initiative targets Mexican trafficking organizations along the southwest border. The HIDTA program, established in 1988, designates areas for drug control efforts. The HIDTA program, established in 1988, partners with law enforcement agencies to combat drug trafficking in designated areas within the United States. The program provides federal resources to assist in eliminating drug trafficking, with HIDTA sites in southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, and west and south Texas. The President's FY2006 budget proposes moving HIDTA to the Department of Justice to enhance law enforcement's ability to target the drug trade. ICE oversees the custody and deportation of detained aliens as part of its responsibilities. ICE is responsible for overseeing the custody and deportation of detained aliens, including those who are inadmissible or deportable on criminal, terrorist, or national security grounds. They measure success by locating and removing aliens, with a total of 5,500 interior investigators compared to over 9,500 Border Patrol agents. ICE apprehends a significant number of deportable aliens, with investigators stationed throughout the United States. In FY2000 to FY2004, ICE located and removed a significant number of aliens, with a focus on the southwest jurisdictions. In FY2004, 53% of removed aliens were criminal, and 47% were non-criminal. The majority of aliens removed were Mexican nationals, with over 90% from Mexico in FY2001 to FY2003. In FY2001, ICE expelled over one million aliens, with 91% removed by southwest units. In FY2002, expulsions dropped by 50% due to terrorism targeting, but increased by 52% in FY2003. Southwest units led in removals. Issues faced by ICE relate to the high number of illegal aliens in the US, especially in the southwest border region. Since 1996, Congress has authorized funding to increase immigration investigators, especially after 9/11. Despite efforts to boost interior investigators, numbers have remained the same since the merger with the U.S. Customs Service. The U.S. Customs Service established the Shadow Wolves unit in 1972 to patrol the Tohono O'odham Indian Reservation border, comprised of Native Americans. The Shadow Wolves, a unit established in 1972 to investigate drug smuggling on the Tohono O'odham Indian Reservation, was merged with the border patrol in 2003. Their mission now includes intercepting illegal migrants crossing the border. ICE is the only investigative presence on the reservation, with a field office in Sells, Arizona. Concerns exist about potential terrorist exploitation of the porous southwest border. The Shadow Wolves, a unit established in 1972 to investigate drug smuggling on the Tohono O'odham Indian Reservation, was merged with the border patrol in 2003. Their mission now includes intercepting illegal migrants crossing the border. Congress is considering whether there are enough resources on the reservation to combat drug trafficking, as evident in the amount of drug trafficking taking place. An amendment to H.R. 1817 would transfer the Shadow Wolves back to ICE. The enforcement of U.S. immigration law is increasingly focused on the interior, particularly in Arizona. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has limited authority to prevent illegal border crossings between ports of entry. They have a small number of interior investigators compared to state and local law enforcement officers. DHS has agreements with localities to deputize officers for immigration law enforcement, but this policy is met with mixed reactions. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) was amended to allow the Attorney General to enter agreements with states for enforcement of immigration law. The Attorney General was given authority to enter agreements with states for immigration law enforcement after 9/11. Some states and localities have deputized officers to assist in enforcing immigration law, with proponents arguing it helps DHS in their mission. Opponents of these agreements argue that they undermine the relationship between local law enforcement agencies and immigrant communities, potentially discouraging reporting of crimes. They believe it could lead to a reduction in local law enforcement resources and create inconsistency in enforcement. The use of state and local law enforcement to enforce immigration law is a controversial subject, with legislation introduced in Congress to define their proper role. The Immigration and Nationality Act grants the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority to arrest and detain aliens in the US. While most detained aliens have committed crimes, others are detained for attempting to enter the country fraudulently. The Department of Homeland Security faces challenges with the detention of aliens, particularly due to a shortage of bed space. In FY2003, 231,500 aliens were detained, with nearly half being criminal aliens. Mexican nationals made up the majority of detainees. Critics argue that the increase in mandatory detention classes has impacted space availability for lower priority detainees. The Department of Homeland Security faces challenges with detention space for lower priority detainees. Concerns have been raised about the release of aliens based on space availability rather than individual case merits, leading to disparities in policies across different geographic areas. A study found that detained individuals with final removal orders were more likely to be deported compared to those not detained. The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 mandated the integration of immigration databases to assist CBP and ICE officials in identifying potentially inadmissible aliens and high-risk commercial goods. Several data systems and databases need integration for better accessibility and security. Legislation and the 9/11 Commission have called for this integration. Questions arise about potential difficulties, access levels, and privacy safeguards. The southwest border lacks sufficient surveillance, prompting Congress to authorize increased border patrol personnel since 1994. Since 1994, Congress has authorized more border patrol agents and funding for technology at the southwest border. Resources for border patrol and inspectors increased after the terrorist attacks. Critics argue that more needs to be done, as highlighted in a 2003 GAO report citing concerns about staffing shortages. A needs assessment determined that 22,000 border patrol agents were necessary to double security. In 1998, the former Customs Service addressed staffing for CBP customs functions. In 1998, the former Customs Service commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers to develop a resource allocation model (RAM) to determine the most effective deployment of its inspectors and canine enforcement officers at international ports of entry. The RAM report recommended increasing Customs staffing by 14,776 positions to meet its mission in FY2002, with the largest increases in inspector, special agent, and canine enforcement officer positions. Despite some weaknesses found by GAO in the RAM study, it remains the most comprehensive staffing analysis to date. The appropriate staffing level for various missions under CBP is unknown, and Congress may continue to be interested in the issue of staffing and resources. One option is to conduct a study to determine the proper staffing level and resources needed to secure the border. The adequacy of infrastructure at ports of entry has been a long-standing concern, with reports indicating that resources have not kept pace with the growth in workload and staffing, leading to infrastructure weaknesses. Improving infrastructure at land ports of entry is challenging due to limited space, environmental challenges, and lengthy review processes by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The majority of facilities at the nation's land border have spatial limitations, making it difficult for the federal government to expand existing facilities. Improving infrastructure at land ports of entry is challenging due to limited space, environmental challenges, and lengthy review processes by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Issues such as insufficient roadways and lack of coordination among agencies also hinder efforts to expand port infrastructure. CBP officials may face resource competition at the northern and southwest border. The 109th Congress may follow up on required studies on port infrastructure. Repatriation of Mexican nationals has a long history, with recent DHS programs aimed at facilitating the process. In September 2003, DHS piloted a program to airlift unauthorized migrants from the Arizona border to Texas to deter them from re-crossing. The program involuntarily repatriated aliens laterally from Arizona to Texas, where the Rio Grande river and border patrol agents posed challenges for border crossers. The pilot program cost $1.3 million and aimed to make it harder for illegal aliens to return to the United States. The pilot program in Tucson cost $1.3 million and ran for 24 days in September 2003, repatriating over 6,200 unauthorized migrants to cities along the Texas border. It resulted in an 18% decline in apprehensions in the Tucson sector and only one migrant death, compared to 10 in 2002. Proponents claim it effectively deters re-entry and saves lives, but the Mexican government objected, stating that the Texas border cities were ill-equipped to handle the returnees. In 2004, the White House announced an interior repatriation program with Mexico, moving away from lateral repatriations. This program aimed to return unauthorized Mexican migrants to the interior of their country, addressing concerns about the handling of returnees on the Texas border. The interior repatriation program with Mexico aims to reduce recidivism rates of illegal aliens by returning them voluntarily to the interior of Mexico. The pilot phase of the program repatriated 14,058 aliens at a cost of $15.4 million. DHS has requested $39 million to fund the program in FY2006. Border patrol has the authority to repatriate certain Mexican nationals. ICE, with resources for detention and transportation, handles repatriation of illegal aliens to Mexico. Organizational issues within ICE, including budget shortfall and low morale, mirror past problems in legacy agencies like INS criticized for poor enforcement and management. The current concerns regarding the immigration enforcement agencies, CBP and ICE, include questions about their organizational structure and the feasibility of combining their functions. Proposals to restructure them include creating a new agency or consolidating them into one bureau to improve coordination and information sharing. Critics argue that consolidating CBP and ICE could enhance their effectiveness. The organizational concerns impacting the southwest border involve the interdependence of CBP and ICE in carrying out unique initiatives. Congress is considering whether reorganization would address systemic issues or further destabilize the agencies. Concerns about the southwest border have shifted from illegal drugs to illegal migration, especially after the 9/11 attacks. The concern over potential terrorist exploitation of the southwest border has led to a debate on the effectiveness of current immigration policy in addressing illegal migration. Some suggest allowing more illegal aliens to attain legal status as a solution to the issue. Supporters argue for a legal alternative for foreign workers to reduce unauthorized migration, while critics fear it may worsen the problem. Immigration interior enforcement is seen as crucial, with ICE's resources increasing post-9/11 attacks. ICE's resources have increased post-9/11 attacks, partly due to counterterrorism efforts and agency consolidations. The Mexican economy plays a crucial role in stemming illegal migration to the US, with partnerships in place to enhance economic growth. More efforts are needed to stabilize economically deprived regions in Mexico. Unlike the southwest border, issues at the northern border are minimal due to differences between the US and Canada. The United States and Canada do not face the same issues at the northern border as they do at the southern border. Despite efforts by DHS to apprehend illegal aliens, the flow of illegal migration continues. Debate surrounds enforcement of immigration laws and inter-agency cooperation. Comprehensive solutions addressing push factors in sending countries and pull factors in the US are needed. Since 1993, legislation has been passed to increase border personnel and resources at the southwest border, including the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 which authorized funding for the Immigration and Naturalization Service's border patrol programs. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) aimed to enhance border security by authorizing the hiring of 1,000 new border patrol agents annually for FY1997 through FY2001. It also called for an increase in border patrol support personnel by 300 a year during the same period. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) aimed to address long delays at ports of entry by hiring inspectors, establishing inspection projects with fees, and expanding border barriers to reduce illegal immigration into the United States. It also authorized the expansion of the Automated Biometric Fingerprint Identification System nationwide. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) expanded the Automated Biometric Fingerprint Identification System nationwide to include fingerprints of illegal or criminal aliens. It also required biometrics in border crossing cards with a machine-readable biometric identifier matching the card holder. The act mandated the development of an Automated Entry and Exit Data System (US-VISIT) to record the entry and exit of aliens, with concerns about potential delays leading to amendments in the FY1999 Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act. In response to the September 11 attacks, the 107th Congress directed resources towards the immediate development and implementation of an automated entry and exit control system at all ports of entry. In response to the September 11 attacks, the 107th Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act, which called for the immediate implementation of an integrated entry and exit data system and the inclusion of a biometric identifier in travel documents for foreign nationals seeking entry to the United States. The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-173) mandated the implementation of an integrated entry and exit data system with biometric data readers at all ports of entry. It also required border crossing identification cards to contain a biometric identifier matching the card holder's characteristics. Additionally, the act authorized an increase in immigration inspectors and support staff. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-458) was passed to implement 9/11 Commission recommendations. It calls for the development of an automated biometric entry and exit data system, integration with other databases, and a plan for expedited processing of registered travelers. The act also authorizes 2,000 additional border patrol agents each year from FY2006 through FY2010. The REAL ID Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-13) includes provisions for border security at the southwest border, such as conducting a study on needed technology and allowing waivers for expedited construction of barriers. The construction of barriers at the southwest border has been delayed by legal issues raised by California."
