    "content": "The mental health of veterans, especially those from Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, is a concern for Congress. This report from the VA addresses the number of veterans with depression, PTSD, and substance use disorders, along with VA's screening and treatment efforts. Veterans need to enroll in the VA health care system for medical care. From FY2002 through FY2012, 1.6 million OEF/OIF veterans became eligible for VA health care, with 56% enrolling by the end of FY2012. The VA publishes data on mental disorders among OEF/OIF veterans using VA health care, but information on veterans not using VA care is lacking. Data on OEF/OIF veterans using VA care should not be generalized to the broader veteran population. The VA's data on mental disorders among OEF/OIF veterans using VA health care is limited and should not be generalized to the broader veteran population. Depression and bipolar disorder are both mood disorders, with the VA presenting prevalence figures for affective psychoses and depressive disorder NEC. The data does not include dysthymic disorder. The VA presents prevalence figures for affective psychoses and depressive disorder NEC among OEF/OIF veterans using VA health care. Depression and bipolar disorder may be treated with medication, psychosocial interventions, or both, and annual depression screening is required for veterans. The data does not include dysthymic disorder. Suicide prevention efforts for veterans, including those with mood disorders, are detailed in the CRS Report R42340. All veterans can access the Veterans Crisis Line, online chat service, and suicide prevention resource center. Reports evaluating mental health programs and recommendations are listed. PTSD, a common issue among OEF/OIF veterans, requires specific criteria for diagnosis. The diagnosis of PTSD requires a minimum number of symptoms in three categories: reexperiencing, avoidance, and arousal. Symptoms must persist for at least one month and result in distress or impairment. The VA reports a 29% prevalence of PTSD among OEF/OIF veterans receiving VA health care. Prevalence estimates from other sources vary widely, ranging from 1% to 60% among OEF/OIF servicemembers. PTSD prevalence among OEF/OIF servicemembers and veterans ranges from 13% to 20%. VA policy mandates PTSD screening for new patients, with treatment options including medication and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Congressional concerns have been raised about the implementation of these policies. The VA offers specialized PTSD treatment programs of varying intensity and duration, including day hospitals, evaluation and brief treatment units, inpatient units, and residential rehabilitation programs. Veterans can also receive PTSD treatment at VA community-based outpatient clinics or Vet Centers. Reports evaluating the VA's PTSD screening and treatment efforts are available. Substance use disorders, including drug and alcohol dependence, are also addressed. The prevalence of drug dependence and abuse among OEF/OIF veterans using VA health care during FY2002\u2013FY2012 is shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5. Alcohol dependence is more common than drug dependence or abuse, with alcohol abuse prevalence not provided. VA policy addresses substance use disorders, including drug and alcohol dependence. VA policy does not mandate routine drug screening but requires annual alcohol screening, waived for non-drinkers. The VA provides medication and psychosocial interventions for substance use disorders, including detoxification care. Interventions range from brief counseling to long-term relapse prevention and referral to programs like Alcoholics Anonymous. Several reports evaluate the VA's efforts and offer recommendations. The VA identifies PTSD and substance use disorders through diagnosis codes in veterans' electronic medical records. Data limitations include potential overstatement of conditions due to provisional or noncurrent diagnoses. Some conditions in veterans' electronic medical records may be noncurrent or understated, as veterans may choose not to disclose symptoms to avoid diagnosis of mental illness. Veterans using VA health care services may also receive additional services outside the VA without the department's knowledge. The VA's numbers should not be generalized to all OEF/OIF veterans or the broader veteran population, as those using VA health care may differ from those who do not in various ways. Selected evaluations of VA services since 2008 are listed in Appendix B, focusing on mental health efforts for veterans."
