    "content": "Title XII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to become the School Facilities Improvement Act. The Congress finds that a significant number of public school buildings in the United States are in need of replacement or extensive repairs. This includes buildings built before World War II, with many being in inadequate condition due to maintenance issues, obsolescence, environmental hazards, overcrowding, and structural unsoundness. Approximately 14 million students attend schools with buildings requiring significant repair or replacement. Large numbers of local educational agencies struggle to secure financing for school facility improvement, often requiring extensive repair or replacement. The purpose of this title is to help local educational agencies finance school facility improvements. Federal assistance is provided in the form of loans. The Secretary may make loans to local educational agencies for the construction, reconstruction, or renovation of schools that are 50 years old or older. Assistance is provided to eligible agencies in an economical manner and must not be elaborate or extravagant in design or materials. The Secretary may approve loans for school construction, reconstruction, or renovation based on the applicant's difficulty in securing affordable financing, the threat to student safety posed by the physical plant, the demonstrated need for the project, and the age of the facility. Preference is given to applicants from states that have previously provided a loan of at least 25% of the total amount. Loans to local educational agencies must be in an amount not exceeding the total development cost of the facility, secured and repaid within 30 years. The interest rate will cover the cost of the loan and administrative costs to the Federal Government. Federal assistance in the form of debt guarantees is provided under Section 12004. The Secretary may guarantee debt for construction, reconstruction, or renovation of schools over 50 years old for eligible local educational agencies. Assistance is limited to specific agencies and projects meeting economical criteria. The Secretary may guarantee debt for school construction, reconstruction, or renovation for eligible agencies prioritizing safety, need, and age of the facility. Applicants facing financing challenges will receive preference. The Secretary may guarantee debt for school construction, reconstruction, or renovation for eligible agencies, with preference given to applicants from States that have provided a loan for the project. Guarantees are limited to the total development cost of the facility, secured as determined by the Secretary, and only for debt instruments with a 30-year maturity and maximum interest rate set by the Secretary.

The Secretary has legal powers to prescribe rules, sue, foreclose on property, and bid for purchases in connection with the functions under this title. Funds for administrative expenses are authorized by Congress annually. The Secretary has the authority to acquire, manage, remodel, dispose of, lease, and deal with properties purchased in connection with loans made under this title.

The Secretary under this title must adhere to labor standards for contractors and subcontractors working on projects financed by grants, loans, or debt guarantees. Wages must meet the standards set by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis Bacon Act. The authority and functions outlined in Reorganization Plan Number 14 of 1950 and section 276c of title 40 do not apply to individuals who volunteer services to local educational agencies for civic, charitable, or humanitarian reasons without compensation, except for expenses, benefits, or a nominal fee for personal pleasure. The individual volunteering must provide service freely without pressure from any employer, not benefit any contractor on the same project, and not be employed by a contractor or subcontractor working on a project financed by a loan or debt guarantee. Payments of expenses, benefits, or fees to volunteers must comply with regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor, considering factors like the total amount of payments and economic realities. Payments for expenses to volunteers may include uniform allowances, protective gear, reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses, meals, and transportation. Reasonable benefits may involve group insurance or pension plans, while nominal fees cannot substitute for compensation and should not be tied to productivity. The determination of what constitutes a nominal fee is context-dependent. The Secretary of Labor determines payment for expenses, benefits, or fees for volunteers based on economic realities to avoid undermining labor standards. No successive loans or bond guarantees to local educational agencies until 5 years after a previous loan or bond guarantee.
