    "content": "Lending is risky for banks due to potential borrower defaults and funding risks. Banks borrow short-term liquidity to fund long-term customer loans, generating profits from interest rate spreads. If borrowers default, banks may struggle to repay their own liabilities. Capital is the difference between a bank's assets and liabilities, crucial for avoiding default. The capital buffer protects bank creditors from loan defaults by bank customers. A bank is considered solvent as long as it maintains capital above a minimum threshold level. Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) guidelines establish the proportion of a bank's asset or lending portfolio to its capital reserves. The first Basel Capital Accord, Basel I, aimed to promote consistent safety and soundness in banking regulation. The first Basel Capital Accord aimed to establish safety and competition standards for banks internationally. It set capital-to-asset ratios for financial institutions based on risk-weighted assets. The U.S. banking system currently follows this framework. The second Basel Accord, Basel II, focuses on improving credit risk assessment methods. The Basel II framework aims to improve credit risk assessment methods for core banks in the United States. Core banks must use advanced approaches to determine credit risks, while non-core banks can continue using Basel I or general risk-based capital rules. Basel II regulations for core banks were implemented on April 1, 2008. In response to the global financial crisis, Basel II.5 was issued as an amendment to Basel II. The BCBS issued Basel II.5 as an amendment to Basel II, increasing requirements on banks' risk evaluation models and disclosures on securitization activities. Basel III revises regulatory capital definitions, increases required bank reserves, and mandates a higher percentage of assets in cash or easily convertible assets. Basel III requirements were approved by 27 jurisdictions and 44 central banks, with a deadline for compliance by 2019. Basel III, approved by 27 jurisdictions and 44 central banks, mandates higher bank reserves and cash assets by 2019. The Dodd-Frank Act also addresses capital reserve requirements, with the Collins Amendment establishing minimum capital and leverage requirements. Dodd-Frank removes the need for credit ratings in evaluating financial securities, requiring regulators to find alternative risk assessment standards. The report discusses how Basel II.5 and Basel III implementation in the United States may be complicated by mandatory capital requirements. Bankers may adjust asset portfolios in response to new rules. The report also analyzes the incorporation of credit ratings in the regulatory framework and potential challenges in adopting Basel II.5 and Basel III due to the Dodd-Frank Act. Enhanced capital and liquidity requirements are also summarized. The report summarizes the enhanced capital and liquidity requirements associated with Basel III and compares them to provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act. Basel I introduced a risk-weighting system for bank assets, equating lower credit risk with liquidity by assigning lower weights to more liquid assets. The risk weight assigned to different assets affects a bank's capital-asset ratio. Cash and U.S. Treasury securities have a risk weight of 0%, while loans have higher risk weights. Banks holding loans with higher risk weights must increase their capital reserves. Academic research shows that banks may shift towards low risk-weighted assets to maintain their capital-asset ratio when it is low. The risk weight assigned to assets influences a bank's capital-asset ratio. Basel I's weighting system may not adequately differentiate between varying degrees of risk, leading banks to potentially hold lower quality loans to maintain capital reserves. This could result in institutions being undercapitalized despite their default risk exposures. The risk weight assigned to assets can impact a bank's capital-asset ratio. Concerns exist that the weighting system may incentivize banks to hold government securities like U.S. Treasuries instead of extending loans, potentially leading to reduced lending in areas with severe credit shortages during economic downturns. This could result in banks holding more OECD country sovereign debt rather than making new loans, further limiting lending to segments with greater credit needs. Basel I weighting system in emerging market economies or private sector may lead to \"procyclical\" capital requirements, incentivizing risk taking during expansions and hindering economic recovery in downturns. Basel II, with Pillars, revised the weighting system for more risk differentiation and proposed using external credit assessments for risk weight assignment. The risk weight assignment under Basel II allows for more differentiation based on credit quality, such as lower weights for highly rated securities and higher weights for risky loans like those with low downpayments. Mortgage insurance and credit default swaps can help reduce risk weights on riskier loans. Basel II introduced pillars two and three to monitor unintended outcomes of the risk-weighting system. Basel II introduced pillars two and three to monitor misaligned incentives and operational risks in banks. Pillar two requires ongoing internal risk evaluation, while pillar three focuses on market discipline and reporting. Basel II.5 was issued to capture credit risk in the trading book of a bank. Security held to maturity is accounted for in the \"banking book\" at its original values unless sold, then moved to the trading book for fair market value treatment. Basel II.5 aims to prevent regulatory arbitrage and ensure proper accounting. Federal regulators issued a notification for Basel II.5 implementation in 2011. The December NPR amended the January NPR to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act, proposing alternative approaches for risk-weighting bank traded debt and securitization positions. Section 939A of the Act aims to reduce reliance on credit ratings and encourages investors to conduct their own analysis. Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act requires federal agencies to review regulations that rely on credit ratings and remove such references within one year. Agencies can use alternative standards of creditworthiness and must report all regulatory modifications to Congress. Implementation of Basel II.5 and Basel III presents challenges for U.S. regulators due to the reduced reliance on external credit ratings. Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act mandates the removal of credit rating references in regulations within one year. This poses challenges for U.S. regulators in implementing Basel II.5 and Basel III, affecting the adoption of international safety and soundness standards. The December NPR proposed assigning risk weights based on seven issuer categories, deviating from Basel I's four risk categories. The December NPR categorizes entities for risk weights, including banks, supranational entities, government-sponsored entities, depository institutions, foreign banks, credit unions, public-sector entities, corporate entities, and financial securities meeting securitization definitions. It applies to bank holding companies or banks with aggregated trading assets. The December NPR applies to bank holding companies or banks with trading assets equal to 10% of total assets or $1 billion. It does not apply to small banking organizations and is estimated to affect fewer than 20 large banking organizations. The proposed rules may indicate the asset risk-weighting approach for Basel III implementation. Specific risk weights for seven categories of exposures in bank trading books are detailed in the Appendix. Basel III enhances regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, with the Dodd-Frank Act potentially imposing higher standards. Challenges arise from implementing both frameworks simultaneously in the US. Basel III introduces changes to Tier I capital definition, common equity requirements, capital conservation buffer, countercyclical buffer, leverage ratio, and liquidity ratios. The quantitative requirements and phase-in schedules for Basel III have been approved. The quantitative requirements and phase-in schedules for Basel III were approved by 27 jurisdictions and 44 central banks on September 12, 2010. Basel III narrows the definition of Tier 1 capital to predominantly common equity and retained earnings to improve regulatory capital quality. The financial crisis highlighted the importance of Tier 1 capital, which now includes tangible common equity and other liquid assets like mortgage servicing rights. Basel III requires banks to maintain a minimum common equity capital of 4.5% by 2015, up from 2% under Basel II. The central bank governors approved a capital requirement policy to increase the total minimum capital requirement to 8% by January 1, 2015, with three quarters of it being Tier 1 capital. By 2019, the total minimum capital requirement will rise to 10.5% at a rate of 0.0625% per year starting from January 1, 2016. The BCBS established a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, which must be Tier 1 capital to improve banks' resiliency to unexpected losses. Meeting this requirement may involve reducing discretionary earnings distribution, dividends, and bonuses. The central bank governors set a capital conservation buffer at 2.5% of risk-weighted assets to prevent banks from distributing capital when their buffers are depleted. The buffer must mainly consist of common tangible equity and increase annually. By January 1, 2019, the conservation buffer must reach 2.5%. Additionally, a policy on countercyclical buffers was approved to address procyclicality in lending practices. The central bank governors approved a policy on countercyclical buffers, allowing national regulatory authorities to determine when lending growth poses a risk to financial stability. The buffer should be between 0 and 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, growing during economic expansions and decreasing during contractions. There is no set deadline for implementation, but Basel III suggests adding 0.625% of risk-weighted assets per year between 2016 and 2018 to reach a 2.5% buffer by 2019. The minimum total capital requirement for U.S. banks would be 13.0% of risk-weighted assets if the countercyclical capital buffer is fully implemented. Measures have been introduced to adjust the capital requirement over the business cycle, with a focus on requiring more capital during economic expansions. The leverage ratio, defined as gross capital divided by average total consolidated on-balance sheet assets, aims to highlight financial risks that could lead to significant losses, regardless of risk weights. Institutions used financial conduits to fund mortgages off bank balance sheets, issuing debt obligations to investors without traditional capital requirements. Banks guaranteed payment if the conduit faced liquidity issues, but with lower weight than holding assets in portfolio. A 3% leverage ratio was required to maintain capital levels and prevent falling below a minimum threshold. The BCBS announced a phased-in arrangement on July 26, 2010, without specifying a leverage ratio. Rigorous reporting processes will monitor the ratio, with adjustments planned in the first half of 2017. The minimum leverage ratio will be determined and applied on January 1, 2018. Liquidity is the ability to sell an asset immediately without losses. Bank portfolios consist of illiquid assets funded by shorter-term loans. Uncertainty can lead to distress for financial institutions due to increases in short-term rates relative to long-term rates. Financial institutions may face distress when short-term rates rise relative to long-term rates. This can lead to competition for liquid assets, making it difficult to repay short-term funding obligations. Having sufficient liquidity is crucial to buffer against cash flow reversals and prevent asset \"fire sales,\" as seen in the 2007 financial crisis. The BCBS introduced new liquidity risk measures, including the 30-day liquidity coverage ratio, to improve resilience to liquidity stress after the 2007 financial crisis. The ratio consists of high-quality liquid assets and net cash outflows over a 30-day period. The central bank governors implemented the liquidity coverage ratio requirement on September 12, 2010, with an observation period from January 1, 2011, to December 2014 to monitor its impact on financial markets, credit extensions, and economic growth. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) aims to encourage banks to rely more on medium- and longer-term funding for loans. It calculates the ratio of banks' stable funding sources to assets that require stable funding. Different assets receive different weights based on their maturity, with longer-term sources receiving higher weights. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) assigns weights to bank assets based on their maturity, with longer maturities receiving higher weights. Cash assets receive a 0% weight, while loans with shorter maturities receive an 85% weight and those with longer maturities receive a 100% weight. Banks must maintain a NSFR of at least 100% by adjusting their capital reserves or diversifying their liabilities. The NSFR will become a minimum requirement in 2018. In 2019, the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio will be 6.0%, and the minimum total capital plus capital conservation buffer increase to 10.5%. The Dodd-Frank Act calls for higher capital and liquidity requirements for banks, which may be stricter than those in Basel III. Federal banking regulators have not yet announced a proposed rule for the adoption of Basel III. The Collins Amendment of the Dodd-Frank Act provides for the development of capital requirements for insured depository institutions and holding companies. Small bank holding companies with less than $500 million in assets are exempt from the Collins Amendment. The Collins Amendment sets minimum capital requirements for U.S. bank holding companies, excluding foreign parents and Federal Home Loan Banks. It mandates federal banking agencies to establish leverage and risk-based capital requirements for U.S. subsidiaries of non-U.S. banks, ensuring they are not lower than pre-Dodd-Frank Act levels. The requirements are based on Tier 1 capital ratios and regulatory capital components. The Collins Amendment establishes minimum capital requirements for U.S. bank holding companies, setting leverage and risk-based capital requirements for U.S. subsidiaries of non-U.S. banks. Basel III requires perpetual securities like common stock with no maturity date, excluding trust preferred securities and preferred stock purchased under TARP. The Collins Amendment sets capital requirements for U.S. bank holding companies, including Tier 1 capital like common stock. Small institutions under $500 million in assets are exempt. Dodd-Frank Act requires a countercyclical buffer and a leverage ratio, different from Basel III's unweighted capital-asset ratio. Banks have three years to comply. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates a debt-to-equity ratio of 15-to-1 for bank holding companies and nonbank financial companies supervised by the Federal Reserve. Federal Reserve Governor Daniel K. Tarullo mentioned changes to the liquidity coverage ratio and other liquidity alternatives, which could impact banks' profitability by requiring them to hold more liquid assets instead of higher yielding, illiquid loans. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates a debt-to-equity ratio of 15-to-1 for bank holding companies and nonbank financial companies supervised by the Federal Reserve. Federal Reserve Governor Daniel K. Tarullo mentioned changes to the liquidity coverage ratio and other liquidity alternatives, impacting banks' profitability by requiring them to hold more liquid assets instead of higher yielding, illiquid loans. This could lead to a decrease in bank lending during economic downturns due to undercapitalization. The liquidity ratios will have longer time horizons prior to implementation as regulatory officials assess the impact on credit and financial markets. During the recession, U.S. banks faced undercapitalization due to a surge in loan defaults, hindering their ability to originate new loans. Even adequately capitalized banks reduced lending activity due to higher defaults and unemployment rates affecting borrower qualifications. The implementation of Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act further slowed lending decisions as bankers awaited clarity on new capital requirements. Specific risk weights for exposures in bank trading books were also detailed. The risk-weighting factors for sovereign debt positions in bank trading books are based on OECD membership. OECD member entities have a zero percent risk-weighting factor, while non-OECD entities have an 8.0% risk-weighting factor. Banks may determine risk-weighting factors based on OECD's Country Risk Classifications. This approach aims to avoid conflicts of interest seen in credit rating agencies. The OECD is not like NRSROs as it doesn't have conflicts of interest due to not producing credit assessments for clients. The December NPR suggests a 12.0% risk-weighting factor for sovereign debt if default occurred in the past five years. Default is defined as noncompliance with debt obligations. Multilateral Development Banks and supranational entities are also included in the proposal. Entities Bank trading book exposures to certain supranational entities and multilateral development banks (MDBs) may have a zero percent specific risk-weighting factor under the December NPR. This lenient treatment is justified by the high-credit quality and shareholder bases of these entities. Additionally, exposures to specific supranational entities like the Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund would also have a zero-specific risk weighting. Bank exposures to government-sponsored entities (GSEs) are assigned risk-weights between 0.25% and 1.6% based on debt maturity. GSE equity would have a risk-weight of 8.0%. Exposures to banks in OECD and non-OECD countries are currently treated differently, but the December NPR aims to standardize risk-weighting based on the country's CRC and exposure maturity. Exposures to banks in different CRC rated countries are assigned specific risk-weighting factors based on maturity. Public Sector Entity Debt Positions also have varying risk-weights depending on maturity and location. The December NPR aims to standardize risk-weighting based on the CRC of the sovereign nation and exposure characteristics. The December NPR proposes risk-weighting factors for bank-held corporate debt positions based on issuer type, credit rating, and remaining maturity. Different risk weights are assigned for financial, nonfinancial, publicly traded, and private corporations, with factors ranging from 8.0% to 12.0%. The NPR also seeks feedback on alternative methods, such as bond spreads, for determining minimum capital requirements. The December NPR proposes risk-weighting factors for bank-held corporate debt positions based on issuer type, credit rating, and remaining maturity. Banks must determine a risk capital factor for securitization positions using a standardized methodology, multiplying the market value by a specified risk-weighting factor. The NPR also includes a simplified supervisory formulaic approach (SSFA) to assign higher capital requirements to riskier securitization tranches and lower requirements to safer tranches. The December NPR proposes risk-weighting factors for bank-held corporate debt positions and securitizations based on issuer type, credit rating, and remaining maturity. Banks can determine the riskiness of their securitizations using formulas that assign higher capital requirements to riskier tranches and lower requirements to safer tranches."
