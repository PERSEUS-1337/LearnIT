    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Emergency Rural and Small Railroad Preservation Act\". Congress recognizes the critical importance of a well-developed transportation and infrastructure system for the economic well-being of the United States. There is a national emergency threatening essential rail transportation infrastructure, especially in rural areas. Failure to address this crisis will lead to rail line abandonments, increasing highway costs and congestion, compromising safety, causing environmental damage, and economically disadvantaging rural areas. Traditional funding methods are insufficient to meet the investment needs for rural rail infrastructure. The need to upgrade track and bridges for safety and to accommodate heavier freight cars is crucial. The inequity of railroads paying a 4.3-cent diesel fuel tax into the general fund while other modes of transportation benefit from similar taxes is highlighted. A temporary federal program using the proceeds of this tax to address the national emergency and preserve freight rail service is deemed in the national interest. The establishment of a program is deemed necessary to address the national emergency and preserve freight rail service. The Secretary of Transportation will establish a program to preserve and improve rail tracks and bridges for Class II and III freight railroads. Funds will be allocated to eligible recipients such as State and local governments, government-sponsored authorities, and Class II and III railroads, prioritizing applications for rehabilitation and improvement of track and bridges. The Secretary of Transportation will allocate funds for the preservation and improvement of rail tracks and bridges for Class II and III freight railroads. Funds will be used for capital rehabilitation and improvement projects, ensuring equitable distribution to diverse geographic regions. The Secretary of Transportation will allocate funds from the Railroad Trust Fund for capital rehabilitation and improvement projects on Class II and III rail freight lines. Funding may be used to upgrade track and bridges to accommodate 286,000 pound freight cars or to promote essential service and enhance safety. Grants may be provided directly or to supplement loans and loan guarantees under the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new section under Subchapter A of chapter 98 related to trust fund code. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to establish the Railroad Trust Fund in the Treasury of the United States. Amounts equivalent to taxes on trains are appropriated to the Trust Fund for expenditures under the Emergency Rural and Small Railroad Preservation Act. The Railroad Trust Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States to support projects under the Emergency Rural and Small Railroad Preservation Act. The Secretary prioritizes economically viable projects with a 10% non-Federal matching contribution requirement. Grants must be available within 90 days of appropriations for each fiscal year. A study is conducted on projects assisted under the Act."
