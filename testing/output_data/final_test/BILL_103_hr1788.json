    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Small Business Lending and Credit Availability Act of 1993\" and includes provisions for loan guarantees in qualified states. The Small Business Act of 1993 includes provisions for loan guarantees in qualified states, with the Administration participating on a guaranteed basis in loans to small businesses in these states, ensuring a minimum guarantee amount of 90 percent of the outstanding loan balance at the time of disbursement. The Small Business Act of 1993 guarantees loans to small businesses in qualified states, with a minimum guarantee amount of 90 percent of the outstanding loan balance at disbursement. For loans between $200,000 and $500,000, at least 95 percent of the balance is required. Additionally, guarantee fees are waived for the first 2 fiscal years after the enactment of this provision. The Administration may collect a guarantee fee of up to 1% of the outstanding balance of a loan for the 4th and 5th fiscal years after the enactment. Lending institutions can retain a percentage of the fee to encourage loans to small businesses in qualified states. The Administration allows lending institutions to retain half of any fee on loans of $200,000 or less. Any doubts about the applicant's ability to repay such loans are resolved in favor of the applicant. These provisions are effective for the first 5 fiscal years after enactment and override any conflicting sections during this period. Definitions for this paragraph are provided for clarity. The term 'insured depository institution' includes insured credit unions. 'State' refers to all states and the District of Columbia. 'Qualified State' is any state meeting specific criteria. During a 12-month period, insured depository institutions with combined assets of $100,000,000 or more or $150,000,000 or more may close due to an inability to meet depositor demands."
