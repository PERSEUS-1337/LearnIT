The International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) is a global organization that assists in locating individuals missing due to various involuntary reasons such as war, human rights violations, natural disasters, trafficking, and drug-related violence. There are over a million reported cases globally, with an estimated 150,000 missing from natural disasters annually. The International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) was created in 1996 to address the issue of missing persons from conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. With 15 years of experience, ICMP uses a unique DNA-led process to identify over 18,000 individuals. The organization has a headquarters agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina, providing privileges and immunities. ICMP, recognized as equivalent to an inter-governmental organization, works with governments to locate missing persons from conflicts. Governments are urged to clarify the fate of missing persons through rule of law mechanisms, building public trust and fulfilling obligations to surviving families. ICMP also collaborates with associations of families of missing persons to enhance their capacity. ICMP's work includes supporting post-conflict societies, contributing to truth and reconciliation, providing evidence for war crime prosecutions, and assisting in disaster victim identification. ICMP's operational success has surpassed expectations. ICMP's operational success has exceeded expectations, with its law-based approach extended to Colombia and Iraq. Technical assistance has been provided to Chile, South Africa, the United States, Thailand, and the Philippines in cases of conflict, human rights, and natural disasters. Increased demand for ICMP's work includes addressing missing persons from trafficking, drug-related violence, and other scenarios. ICMP has a special status in Bosnia and Herzegovina, allowing it to maintain operations. ICMP, a quasi-international organization, has a database with 150,000 genetic profiles in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Moving its headquarters could impact its ability to maintain core technical activities. The International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) operates in Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia, and Serbia with unclear legal recognition outside these countries. Meetings in 2002 and 2004 discussed the need for a permanent legal status, resulting in a draft framework agreement that remains unratified. The International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) produced a draft framework agreement, expanding its global work to assist governments in locating missing persons from natural disasters, wars, and human rights violations. The International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) produced a draft framework agreement to assist governments in locating missing persons from various circumstances. SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.
