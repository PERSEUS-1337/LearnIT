    "content": "Animal agriculture in the United States is a $100 billion industry with livestock and poultry raised on 1.3 million farms, including 238,000 animal feeding operations. Most AFOs are small businesses raising fewer than 300 animals, while CAFOs house 300 or more animals. The industry has seen organizational changes leading to larger confined production facilities, raising concerns about the management of animal wastes. Animal agriculture has raised concerns about the management of animal wastes and potential impacts on environmental quality, particularly on water resources. In addition to water quality issues, animal feeding operations can also emit particles and gases into the air, contributing to air pollution. The lack of credible data on air emissions from AFOs hinders the resolution of questions regarding their ecological and public health effects. The report discusses the lack of scientifically credible data on air emissions from animal feeding operations (AFOs) and the need for this data to assess potential adverse impacts and implement control measures. It reviews the types of air emissions from AFOs, their impacts on human health and the environment, and the provisions of federal laws such as the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act that address these issues. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has authority to regulate AFO air emissions under several laws, including CERCLA and EPCRA. The report discusses the lack of data on air emissions from animal feeding operations (AFOs) and the need for this data to assess impacts and implement control measures. It reviews types of emissions from AFOs, their impacts on health and the environment, and federal laws addressing these issues. Agricultural emissions of greenhouse gases related to climate change are also discussed, along with key research questions needed to evaluate animal agriculture emissions. AFOs can affect air quality through emissions of gases, particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, hazardous air pollutants, microorganisms, and odor, as well as gases associated with climate change. The generation rates of odor, manure, gases, particulates, and other constituents from animal feeding operations vary with various factors. Emission sources include barns, feedlot surfaces, manure storage units, and silage piles. Air emissions mostly come from the microbial breakdown of manure. Pollutants like ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and particulate matter have environmental and health impacts. Each emission source has a different profile of substances emitted, with fluctuating rates throughout the day and year. The health effects of ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and particulate matter, as well as ecological effects of ammonia, particulates, methane, and oxides of nitrogen from animal manure are significant. Ammonia can be converted to NH3 and contribute to the formation of ambient particulate matter like ammonium nitrate and sulfate. Ammonia emissions can harm surface waters, aquatic life, and contribute to oxygen depletion and algae growth in aquatic systems. Emissions from animal waste contribute significantly to ammonia pollution in the United States, with health effects including irritation and potential lethality at high concentrations. Particulate matter, including coarse and fine particles, is a complex mixture emitted from various sources such as agriculture and unpaved roads. Fine particles, like PM 10 and PM 2.5, are formed in the atmosphere through chemical interactions of precursor emissions. AFOs contribute to particulate matter through various mechanisms, including animal activity and emissions of ammonia, nitrogen oxides, and hydrogen sulfide. Particle formation is influenced by atmospheric temperature and humidity. Particle formation in the atmosphere is influenced by various factors such as temperature, humidity, and precursor compounds. Different sized particles have health effects, with smaller particles causing respiratory issues and contributing to regional haze. Long-term exposure to particles is linked to higher mortality rates from cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, particles contribute to haze and decreased visibility by absorbing and scattering light. Hydrogen sulfide is a colorless gas with environmental implications. Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is a colorless gas with a strong rotten egg odor, produced in oxygen-deprived environments. It can cause respiratory and cardiovascular irritation. Methane and nitrous oxide are greenhouse gases contributing to global warming, with agriculture, especially livestock production, being a major source. Livestock production accounts for over 30% of the nation's methane emissions. Livestock production contributes over 30% of the nation's methane emissions, with agricultural methane coming from ruminant animals and microbial degradation. Manure management in the United States accounts for 5% of nitrous oxide emissions and 7.5% of methane emissions. Odor from AFOs is caused by various compounds including ammonia, VOCs, and hydrogen sulfide. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can irritate the skin, eyes, nose, and throat, and can lead to the formation of PM 2.5 and ozone. Ozone in the troposphere, from both natural and human sources, can damage respiratory tissue and harm the environment. Agricultural operations emit VOCs, nitrogen oxides, and other pollutants, including biologically active agents. Manure management methods vary depending on factors like climate and farm size. Land application is the primary method for disposing of manure. Design objectives focus on odor and dust control rather than minimizing gaseous emissions. Emissions from livestock production facilities arise from buildings, manure storage, and land application. Control technologies can reduce emissions but not eliminate them entirely. Technologies like biofilters and scrubbing can help reduce emissions from buildings. Frequent manure removal is also important in reducing emissions. Manure management techniques include frequent removal, bedded solid manure, chemical additives, and diet manipulation. Different types of manure storage include deep pits, outdoor slurry storage, anaerobic lagoons, and solid stacks. Outdoor storage is a significant source of odors, with effective controls such as covers and manipulation techniques to minimize emissions. Separating solids from liquid manure can reduce the load on anaerobic lagoons but creates a second waste stream to manage. Proper aeration eliminates odors from outdoor storage but is expensive. Anaerobic digesters reduce odors but are not cost-effective. Emission control during land application is best done by direct injection of liquid manure below the soil surface. Solid manure is less odorous than liquid and should be rapidly incorporated into the soil to minimize odors. Various treatment technologies are available to mitigate emissions, but their effectiveness is not well quantified. Research programs in the US and Europe are evaluating cost-effective options for livestock emission mitigation. Experts from various universities are conducting research on livestock emission mitigation, focusing on control measures and strategies for agricultural sources of air pollution. The primary barriers to adoption of emission-reducing technologies by poultry and livestock producers are cost, management requirements, and a lack of incentives. The animal agriculture sector in the US has seen significant changes in recent decades, with approximately 238,000 animal feeding operations in the country. The livestock and poultry industry in the US has undergone significant structural changes, with larger confined production facilities becoming more common. This shift towards larger operations is driven by technological innovation and economies of scale. Between 1982 and 1997, the number of small livestock operations decreased while the number of large feedlots increased significantly. This trend has led to a shift from small, isolated farms to large industrial-scale farming operations. The size and regional concentration of livestock and poultry operations have raised concerns about managing animal wastes and their impact on the environment. Agriculture is often exempt from many environmental laws, such as the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act, allowing farms to avoid regulatory requirements. Certain large animal feeding operations are subject to environmental regulation, primarily focusing on protecting water resources under the Clean Water Act. Facilities emitting large quantities of air pollutants may also be regulated under the Clean Air Act. Some livestock operations may be subject to release reporting requirements of the Superfund law. The Clean Water Act (CWA) regulates water quality by setting standards, limiting effluent discharges, and requiring permits. It distinguishes between point sources (regulated by discharge permits) and nonpoint sources (such as agricultural activities). The Clean Water Act regulates water quality by setting standards and requiring permits for point sources like large animal feeding operations (CAFOs). These operations are treated similarly to industrial sources of pollution and must obtain permits to prevent discharging pollutants into water bodies. EPA revised regulations in 2003 to define CAFOs and specify effluent limitations, which were later challenged in federal court. The 2003 rules on pollutant discharges from regulated feedlots were challenged in federal court, leading to revised regulations issued by the EPA in 2008. These regulations aim to address concerns about the environmental impact of animal waste, including surface runoff, direct discharges to water bodies, leaching into soil and groundwater, and releases to air. Nutrients, organic matter, solids, pathogens, and odorous compounds are the primary pollutants associated with animal wastes. Agriculture is identified as the leading contributor to water quality impairments in rivers and lakes. The Clean Water Act CAFO rule applies to large animal feeding operations, aiming to control water quality impairments caused by agriculture. It covers permits, annual reports, and plans for manure and wastewater management, with a performance standard prohibiting discharges except in specific circumstances. The Clean Water Act CAFO rule aims to control water quality impairments caused by large animal feeding operations. Scientists recognize that managing animal waste can impact air quality in complex ways not fully understood. Environmental policies often do not consider interactions between different media, such as the volatilization of nitrogen from manure storage systems contributing to air pollution and potentially hastening global climate change under the Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act regulates air pollution from stationary and mobile sources, focusing on controlling \"major sources\" emitting regulated pollutants. While farms typically do not exceed emission thresholds, livestock producers and agricultural sources are not exempt. The EPA designates criteria air pollutants and sets ambient air quality standards, including pollutants associated with animal feeding operations. The Clean Air Act regulates emissions from various sources, including AFOs that emit VOCs and nitrogen oxide compounds. EPA regulates hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), including VOCs emitted by livestock facilities. Methanol, a HAP emitted from cows and manure, is regulated. Livestock facilities emit ozone and PM 2.5 precursors, regulated pollutants. The CAA determines if a source is subject to regulations based on its size. The Clean Air Act classifies nonattainment areas based on pollution levels, with more stringent control requirements for areas with worse pollution. A major source is defined as emitting 100 tons per year or more of any pollutant, or 10 tons per year of an individual hazardous pollutant in serious nonattainment areas. States play a crucial role in implementing Clean Air Act (CAA) requirements to ensure that air quality meets federal standards. The State Implementation Plan (SIP) translates national standards into emission limitations and control measures for individual sources of pollution, enforceable as both state and federal law. SIPs include emission limits, control measures, monitoring requirements, and compliance schedules, governing facilities through preconstruction permits for new sources or modifications. The Clean Air Act requires major stationary sources to obtain operating permits with emission limitations and standards. States have flexibility in adopting additional requirements to achieve national air quality standards beyond federal regulations. Agricultural operations are often considered minor sources of air pollution, with limited compliance with permit requirements. Some argue that large livestock facilities emitting over 100 tons of pollutants should be regulated. However, regulating agricultural sources is not a priority due to a lack of monitoring data. EPA's NAAQS for particulates has increased focus on agricultural air pollution in nonattainment areas. Ammonia emissions from AFOs are precursors to secondary particulate formation. Other agriculture pollutants, such as dust, diesel emissions, and emissions from activities like crop burning, contribute to secondary particulate matter formation. Enforcement of environmental laws requires accurate emissions measurement to ensure compliance with specified thresholds. The EPA's Air Compliance Agreement aims to monitor animal agriculture emissions from select farms while providing a \"safe harbor\" from liability under certain federal environmental laws. Some industry sectors, like pork and egg producers, strongly support this agreement. The EPA's Air Compliance Agreement, supported by pork and egg producers, faced opposition from other industry groups, state and local air quality officials, and environmental groups. A emissions monitoring study was conducted from 2007 to 2009, with reports released in January 2011. Fugitive emissions are not counted in calculating major sources but are considered for NAAQS compliance. EPA has issued guidance on accounting for fugitive emissions in evaluating industries. Some groups are concerned that EPA may exclude emissions from waste lagoons and barns in animal confinement systems from Clean Air Act requirements, creating inequities in regulation between different sectors. This could significantly impact the ability of states and localities to address air pollution. Advocacy groups have urged the EPA to address air pollutants from livestock operations under the Clean Air Act, petitioning for emissions from CAFOs to be listed as endangering public health. This would trigger new regulations and standards for CAFOs, including setting NAAQS for ammonia and hydrogen sulfide. Environmental Integrity Project petitioned EPA under CAA Sections 108 and 109 to regulate ammonia as a criteria pollutant. EPA officials were reviewing the petitions while gathering CAFO emissions data. In January 2015, environmental organizations filed lawsuits to force EPA to act on the petitions. The court dismissed one lawsuit for lack of advance notice, while the second challenged EPA's delay in responding. In a related lawsuit, Iowa residents sought to require EPA to regulate AFOs under the CAA and list ammonia and hydrogen as criteria pollutants. The federal court dismissed the lawsuit in June 2014, stating that EPA does not have a duty to list a specific pollutant until a policy determination is made on its impact on public health. The Supreme Court denied a petition to review the ruling in November 2015. The Supreme Court denied a petition to review a lower court ruling in November 2015 regarding a 2004 lawsuit brought by environmentalists in federal court. The lawsuit argued that feedlots must be regulated under the CAA and obtain a permit to construct under provisions of the Idaho SIP. The court ruled that the state's plan did not allow exemptions for key pollutants from agricultural sources, requiring any facility with sufficient emissions levels to obtain a permit. The case was settled in 2005, leading to a rulemaking process for CAA permitting of dairies in Idaho. Industry officials believe the case has limited implications. In response to a 2004 lawsuit, Idaho finalized a rule in 2006 requiring dairies and CAFOs to obtain air quality permits if they emit 100 tons or more of ammonia per year. This made Idaho the first state to regulate such emissions. The interest in agriculture's impact on air quality stems from California's progress in implementing Clean Air Act provisions. California faces severe air pollution issues, prompting stricter emission controls on regulated sources like factories and cars. State officials in California are focused on reducing emissions from all sources of air pollution to meet state and federal requirements. Efforts to improve air quality in agriculture have targeted the South Coast and San Joaquin Valley Air Basins, which are in extreme nonattainment for ozone and particulate matter pollution. These areas regulate all emission sources, including small ones, to address significant air quality impacts. In California, efforts to reduce emissions from all sources of air pollution are focused on the South Coast and San Joaquin Valley Air Basins, which are in extreme nonattainment for ozone and particulate matter pollution. Both regions regulate all emission sources, including agriculture, which is a significant source of air emissions in the San Joaquin Valley Basin. California law exempted agriculture from environmental permitting requirements for over 30 years, but in 2003, a measure (California SB 700) removed this exemption and set timelines for existing facilities to apply for clean air permits and install control technologies. SB 700 regulates various agriculture-related businesses in California, making them subject to air quality permitting and emission mitigation requirements based on facility size, emissions level, and region's attainment status. The state and local air quality management districts are implementing the law, which mandates permits and emission reductions. Best available retrofit control technology is required in severe and extreme ozone nonattainment areas, while moderate and serious areas have different regulations. In federal ozone attainment areas, regulated facilities must use reasonably available control technology (RACT) to reduce air contaminants. Emission mitigation plans were required to be prepared and complied with by July 1, 2008. The state board is collaborating with local air districts and researchers to develop emissions factors for livestock operations. Industries are closely monitoring the research studies and standards set by local air districts. California SB 700 removes the exemption for existing agricultural sources from the state Health & Safety Code, subjecting new and modified agriculture sources to permit and regulatory requirements of the California State Implementation Plan. New or modified sources in nonattainment areas must obtain New Source Review permits with best available control technology and purchase emission reduction credits. Local district rules enforce federal and state requirements for agricultural operations. States with high livestock populations, particularly in the West Coast, Southwest, Midwest, and Southeast regions, have significant numbers of large animal agriculture operations. The evaluation and management of emissions from these facilities are primarily regulated by states, with a focus on protecting water resources rather than air quality. Several states have recognized the need to regulate air emissions from animal agriculture facilities. Several states have recognized the need to regulate air emissions from agricultural operations. State programs, under statutes and regulations, implement and supplement federal Clean Air Act requirements. These programs include air emission testing, monitoring, manure management, inspections, and testing to abate pollutant emissions. Some states have regulatory programs for odor and certain pollutants like hydrogen sulfide. In states with significant animal production, facility management statutes often govern. States with significant animal production often have facility management statutes that govern construction and operation of AFOs to protect water quality, with some provisions for air quality. Various techniques are used to control air emissions from livestock facilities, including emission limits, best management practices, and other requirements. Minnesota, for example, mandates permits and air emission plans for large livestock facilities to address hydrogen sulfide and odor emissions. Iowa and Missouri have regulations for air quality standards and odor emission limitations for large livestock facilities. Iowa conducts a field study to measure hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, and odor levels for health effects. Missouri's CAA permit program includes operational requirements to prevent air pollution, with a hydrogen sulfide emission standard and an ambient acceptable level for ammonia. Texas has a consolidated program for water and air quality general permits. In Texas, a consolidated program governs water and air quality general permits, controlling emission of odors and air contaminants from AFOs. Illinois uses setback distances and numerical standards to regulate odor emissions. Colorado's water quality rules govern facilities treating animal wastes and have separate regulations for odor emissions. North Carolina focuses on regulating odor emissions from swine operations, requiring management practices to control odors and submission of odor management plans. The state does not have air emission standards for H2S, ammonia, or odor, unlike some states like Nebraska which have standards for hydrogen sulfide based on various factors. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) have reporting requirements triggered by specified quantities of substances released to the environment, including ambient air. These laws aim to increase information available to the government and citizens about chemical releases. The focus is on how these laws apply to poultry and livestock operations. The CERCLA and EPCRA laws require notification of hazardous substance releases from facilities. CERCLA addresses cleanup of hazardous waste sites and assigns liability for cleanup costs. EPCRA mandates emergency planning and notification for hazardous chemical storage and releases. Owners must report releases exceeding specified quantities to authorities. The term \"release\" under CERCLA and EPCRA includes various actions like spilling, emitting, or discharging substances into the environment. Both laws require reporting of hazardous substance releases, with CERCLA focusing on cleanup and liability, and EPCRA on emergency planning. Livestock facilities may release reportable substances like hydrogen sulfide and ammonia. The EPA can assess civil penalties for failure to report releases of hazardous substances like sulfide and ammonia, with a reportable quantity of 100 pounds per day or 18.3 tons per year. Citizens can enforce reporting requirements under CERCLA and EPCRA, with penalties of up to $37,500 per day. CERCLA also allows federal cleanup of hazardous substance releases that pose a danger to public health or welfare. The EPA enforces reporting requirements under CERCLA and EPCRA for releases of hazardous substances from animal agricultural sources. In a case involving Premium Standard Farms and Continental Grain Company, agreements were made to monitor air emissions for various pollutants. In September 2006, Seaboard Foods and PIC USA settled claims for environmental law violations, agreeing to apply for CAA permits if pollutant levels exceed thresholds. They also funded a $300,000 project to reduce emissions from swine barns. Environmental advocates have used citizen suit provisions to address violations by AFO operators. In 2005, poultry producers petitioned EPA for exemption from reporting requirements under CERCLA and EPCRA, citing minimal risk to public health and burden on industry. EPA proposed exempting releases of hazardous substances from animal waste at farms from notification requirements in 2007. EPA proposed exempting releases of hazardous substances from animal waste at farms from reporting requirements under CERCLA and EPCRA, citing industry burden and minimal risk to public health. The proposal faced opposition from environmental advocates and state air quality officials, who argued that emissions from animal wastes are not trivial and that an exemption could undermine ongoing research on emissions levels. Critics noted that the exemption would cover ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, nitrous oxide, and volatile organic compounds released from animal wastes. State air quality officials opposed a blanket regulatory or legislative exemption for hazardous substance releases from animal waste at farms. They recommended a narrow exemption based on a size threshold for farms. EPA finalized the CERCLA/EPCRA administrative reporting exemption in December 2008, exempting livestock operations from reporting hazardous substance releases to federal officials. The final rule also provides a partial exemption for reporting releases to state and local emergency officials, with large CAFOs still subject to EPCRA reporting requirements. The final rule exempted livestock operations from reporting hazardous substance releases to federal officials under CERCLA/EPCRA in December 2008. Large CAFOs are still subject to EPCRA reporting requirements. Environmental advocates and industry groups challenged the rule in federal court, leading to a remand request by the federal government in 2010. As of June 2016, EPA has not proposed a new or revised rule, and the 2008 exemption rule remains in effect. Legislation in the 112th Congress aimed to exclude \"manure\" from the definition of hazardous substance under CERCLA and remove reporting liability under CERCLA and EPCRA. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found in 2008 that EPA lacks data on pollutants released by CAFOs, hindering its ability to assess environmental and health impacts. GAO recommended EPA develop a national inventory of CAFOs and improve air emissions monitoring. EPA's current monitoring activities were criticized for being limited in scope. GAO also questioned EPA's basis for the CERCLA/EPCRA exemption proposed in 2007. Congressional interest in clarifying reporting requirements for emissions from animal feeding operations has been ongoing since 2007. The House Appropriations Committee has urged the EPA to provide clarity on the extent to which laws like CERCLA and EPCRA cover emissions from poultry, dairy, or livestock operations. Producers are seeking guidance from the EPA to meet their environmental obligations, emphasizing the need for a prompt resolution of this issue. In the 109th and 112th Congress, legislation was introduced to clarify that manure is not a hazardous substance under CERCLA. Witnesses at a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing emphasized the need for policy direction on the issue arising from litigation related to reporting requirements for emissions from animal feeding operations. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to clarify that manure is not a hazardous substance under CERCLA and to remove emissions reporting liability under CERCLA and EPCRA. Supporters seek to block EPA from revising the exemption rule to require reporting of releases. Some Members of Congress were critical of EPA's proposal to exempt routine animal waste air releases from reporting requirements, questioning potential environmental impacts. Members of the Energy and Commerce subcommittee expressed skepticism about the EPA's blanket exemption authority. Some suggested exempting small farms from reporting emissions, as their impact is minimal. EPA and USDA witnesses supported the proposal, stating it would only affect reporting for emergency response, not other hazardous substance releases. Agriculture is a significant source of greenhouse gases, offsetting emissions by absorbing carbon dioxide. Livestock activities directly contribute to GHG emissions through digestion and manure management. Agriculture is a modest source of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for approximately 8.3% according to the EPA. Methane and nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture have a greater impact on climate change than carbon dioxide. Between 1990 and 2014, methane emissions from U.S. agricultural activities increased by 10.1%, while nitrous oxide emissions increased by 5.9%. In 2014, agricultural activities in the United States contributed significantly to methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Livestock-related categories and land management practices were the main sources of these emissions. The Obama Administration and the 111th Congress took actions to address greenhouse gases and climate change, but the agriculture sector has been largely excluded from regulatory and legislative proposals. The EPA's actions on GHG emissions in connection with Massachusetts v. EPA have drawn attention from agricultural stakeholders. In July 2008, the Bush Administration published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) to comply with the Supreme Court's ruling on regulating emissions from new motor vehicles based on climate change impacts. EPA discussed various Clean Air Act authorities and programs in response to the ruling. In response to the Supreme Court's ruling on regulating emissions, the EPA discussed Clean Air Act authorities and programs in an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR). Agricultural stakeholders, particularly those in livestock operations, were concerned about potential economic impacts and the possibility of Title V permits. EPA officials reassured that there were no plans to tax livestock or implement new regulations. The public comment period on the ANPR ended in November 2008 with no further action taken. In December 2009, the EPA Administrator signed findings that greenhouse gases threaten public health and welfare. The endangerment finding is a prerequisite for greenhouse gas emission standards for light-duty vehicles, implemented in January 2011. In 2010, the light-duty vehicle rule triggered CAA requirements for stationary sources emitting GHGs. EPA issued the GHG Tailoring Rule on May 13, 2010, setting thresholds for when Title V and NSR permits are required. The rule established a threshold of 75,000 tons per year of CO2 equivalent of GHG emissions to limit the number of facilities needing permits. EPA estimated the rule would cover 67% of emissions. The EPA's GHG Tailoring Rule, issued in 2010, set thresholds for when permits are required for stationary sources emitting GHGs, with a limit of 75,000 tons per year of CO2 equivalent emissions. The rule aimed to cover 67% of the nation's largest emitters while exempting small businesses and agriculture operations. Animal agriculture operations were not subject to CAA permitting under the rule due to high thresholds and exemptions for \"fugitive emissions.\" Legal challenges to the rule were dismissed in 2012, but the Supreme Court partially vacated it in 2014, limiting sources required to obtain permits. The Court ruled that EPA cannot consider greenhouse gases as an air pollutant for permitting requirements under the Clean Air Act, but can still impose limits on GHG emissions based on conventional pollutants. The ruling did not change the application of these requirements to agricultural operations. EPA is working on setting a de minimis threshold for when GHGs trigger regulatory review, with a new proposal expected by August 2016. Another EPA action of interest to agriculture was a 2009 proposal to require reporting of GHG emissions by certain facilities and suppliers, in response to a congressional directive. The EPA proposed a rule for reporting emissions of CO2 and other GHGs from major U.S. sources, including manure management systems. Less than 50 beef cattle, dairy cattle, and swine operations would be affected, along with some poultry operations. Agriculture stakeholders criticized the proposal, questioning why manure management systems were included when they only account for 1% of total U.S. GHGs. The EPA's final reporting rule on emissions from manure management systems, signed in September 2009, applies to facilities with the same reporting requirements as proposed. Other agricultural sources emit larger amounts of CH4 and N2O, but were not included in the proposal due to the lack of direct GHG emission measurement methods and the high uncertainty and burden of compliance. Some stakeholders raised concerns about the costly burden of compliance with minimal benefits for reporting by manure management systems. The final rule on emissions from manure management facilities applies to those with a reporting threshold of 25,000 metric tpy of CO2 equivalent of GHGs. EPA removed manure sampling requirements and will allow the use of default values for estimating emissions. Approximately 100 livestock facilities will be subject to the reporting rule, including 73 beef feedlots, 27 dairies, and 8 swine operations. Facilities below certain population threshold levels are not required to report emissions. Reporting will begin annually in 2011. In FY2010 appropriations, Congress barred EPA from using funds for mandatory GHG reporting by manure management facilities. The Paris Agreement aims to limit global temperature rise below 2\u00b0C by 2100. Livestock emissions account for 14.5% of global GHG emissions, highlighting their significant role in climate change mitigation efforts. Research has identified GHG mitigation options for the livestock sector to help achieve the global target of the Paris Agreement. Various approaches show promise, but no single option has significantly reduced emissions without negative impacts on animals or production. Adoption of efficient technologies and practices, such as better feed quality and manure management, is crucial for emission reduction. Technologies like feeding additives and vaccines can also help reduce emissions from cows. Technologies like feeding additives, vaccines, and genetic selection methods have the potential to reduce emissions from cows. The livestock sector's contribution to climate change is a global research and investment priority. The 111th Congress showed interest in exempting agriculture from potential regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. Legislation was introduced to amend the Clean Air Act in response to concerns about EPA regulations on agriculture emissions. In response to concerns about EPA regulations on agriculture emissions, H.R. 1426 aimed to amend the Clean Air Act to prevent the issuance of permits for controlling certain emissions from livestock production. Congress included similar prohibitory language in the FY2010 appropriations bill for EPA, blocking the agency from implementing rules on GHG emissions from livestock production and manure management operations. Since FY2010, Congress has extended prohibitions on EPA developing rules for Title V permits for livestock production emissions and mandating GHG emissions reporting from manure management systems each year in the agency's appropriations bill, including for FY2016 (P.L. 114-113). The 111th Congress debated climate change bills, including regulation of agricultural GHG sources, passing the American Clean Energy and Security Act in 2009. The House passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act (H.R. 2454) which included a cap-and-trade system to reduce GHG emissions from covered entities. Agricultural enterprises emitting less than 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent per year were excluded from the legislation. Animal agriculture sources were also excluded due to their minimal impact on climate change. The House-passed bill included a carbon offset provision for agricultural and forestry activities, allowing covered entities to purchase emission reductions from non-covered sources to meet compliance obligations. The legislation proposed establishing the offset program under USDA instead of EPA, similar to the Senate's Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act. The Senate bill, S. 1733, set a threshold for cap-and-trade and excluded animal agriculture from covered entities. The Clean Energy Partnerships Act of 2009 (S. 2729) aimed to expand agricultural and forestry carbon offset provisions but did not progress further. Congress has not revisited comprehensive climate change legislation since the 111th Congress. During the development of the revised Clean Water Act CAFO rules in 2003, EPA also considered air emissions from CAFOs. Certain animal waste management practices can increase or decrease emissions of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide. Regulatory options like anaerobic lagoons and waste storage ponds can lead to higher air emissions. Nitrous oxide emissions can occur from land application of animal waste on cropland. Environmental groups urged EPA to address or restrict these emissions. In 2003, EPA considered air emissions from CAFOs during the development of revised Clean Water Act rules. Some animal waste management practices can increase ammonia and hydrogen sulfide emissions. Nitrous oxide emissions can occur from land application of animal waste on cropland. Environmental groups urged EPA to address or restrict these emissions. EPA asked the National Research Council to evaluate scientific knowledge and approaches for estimating air emissions from AFOs due to insufficient data. EPA and USDA requested the study to identify research needs and recommend science-based approaches for estimating emissions. EPA was under a court order to revise water quality rules at the time. The NRC report recommended developing strategies to decrease nitrogen emissions from production areas and initiating coordinated research by EPA and USDA to eliminate undesirable air emissions from AFOs. Feasible management practices should be implemented without delay, such as incorporating manure into soil. EPA was under a court order to revise water quality rules. The report focused on estimating air emissions from AFOs using model farms and emissions factors. EPA aimed to develop model farms based on manure management systems and apply emission factors to estimate annual mass emissions in the absence of extensive monitoring data. Emission factors relate pollutant quantity released to activities, aiming to provide average emissions per unit. The NRC recommended a more complex process-based approach for estimating air emissions from AFOs, as direct measurement at all facilities is not feasible. The current method of estimating livestock emissions is expressed per head per year, but the model farm construct described by EPA was found to have weaknesses in data and not consider variations in factors that could affect emissions. The NRC recommended a process-based approach for estimating air emissions from AFOs, emphasizing the need for scientifically sound protocols and standardized methodology for measuring emissions and odors. They suggested broadening emission factor approaches to include impacts of animal and crop production systems both on and off the AFO. The USDA manages programs related to food, forests, rural development, and conservation. Agencies like NRCS provide assistance for implementing conservation practices, including controlling AFO runoff. ARS conducts research on climate change, soils, and emissions. The USDA manages programs related to food, forests, rural development, and conservation. ARS's national program addresses climate change, soils, and emissions, supporting projects on assessing emissions from livestock operations and improving soil and water management practices. ARS also participates in climate change research to develop technologies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural sources. In 2015, ARS initiated research on managing emissions from livestock, including projects on emissions processes, pathways, and mitigation strategies. Another USDA agency, NIFA, uses extramural funding to manage manure nutrients through research and education programs. NIFA, a USDA agency, conducts research and education programs on managing manure nutrients. They support projects to develop emissions data, improve odor control, and reduce pollutants and greenhouse gases. NIFA collaborates with EPA on issues concerning agriculture and the environment, including a Unified National Strategy for Animal Feeding Operations to protect water quality and public health. The USDA has implemented Nutrient Management Plans since 2009 to protect water quality and public health. The importance of the relationship between air quality and agriculture has been recognized, leading to the creation of the Agricultural Air Quality Task Force. This task force, advised by the NRCS chief, works on determining agriculture's role in air pollution and developing cost-effective pollution reduction approaches. The 2002 farm bill also addressed air quality issues in USDA conservation programs. The Agricultural Air Quality Task Force, chaired by the NRCS chief, includes members from USDA, EPA, industry, and science. It ensures data quality for policy recommendations on agricultural air pollution. Stakeholders seek more research to resolve disputes on AFO emissions and control strategies. Federal agencies support research on various topics. Research on a wide range of topics is supported by federal agencies, states, academic institutions, and industry without coordination. Critics question the utility of EPA's monitoring study on air compliance and suggest researching mitigation techniques and health effects of air pollutants emitted by AFOs. The National Research Council recommends substantial research efforts in the short and long term to improve modeling capabilities. The National Research Council recommends substantial research efforts in the short and long term to improve modeling capabilities for measuring and estimating air emissions from animal production. Coordinated research is needed to determine harmful emissions, develop technologies to decrease releases, and prioritize fundamental and technology research. The National Research Council recommends substantial research efforts to improve modeling capabilities for measuring and estimating air emissions from animal production. This includes the need for standardized methodology to assess emissions from AFOs on different scales and to understand the impacts of exposure to AFO emissions at the community level. EPA has started developing emissions estimating methodologies for animal sectors based on a monitoring study completed in 2011. Peer reviewed studies suggest that AFO air emissions may pose a public health hazard, requiring public health precautions and larger population-based studies to fully understand the impact on community health. Standardized measurement technologies for pollutants and odorous compounds emitted by AFOs, as well as effective and economically feasible technologies to reduce emissions, are needed according to experts. Experts emphasize the need for innovative treatment processes to reduce AFO emissions from confinement buildings, manure storage areas, and land application. The National Research Council criticizes EPA and USDA for not allocating enough resources to estimate air emissions and develop mitigation technologies, calling for a change in research priorities. Experts stress the importance of innovative treatment processes to reduce AFO emissions. The National Research Council criticizes EPA and USDA for not prioritizing research on air emissions, highlighting the need for a change in research focus. Congressional interest in funding federal research activities on related issues remains unclear. In the 112th Congress, legislation was introduced to clarify that manure is not a hazardous substance under CERCLA. Congress has shown interest in the impact of federal regulations, especially by the EPA, on the agriculture sector, conducting oversight hearings on regulatory impacts on agriculture."
