    "content": "The Act titled \"Older Driver and Pedestrian Safety and Roadway Enhancement Act of 2009\" establishes a Roadway Safety Enhancement Program for older drivers and pedestrians. The Secretary of Transportation will establish a program to improve roadway safety for older drivers and pedestrians, aiming to reduce fatalities and injuries among those aged 65 and older on public roads. The Secretary will apportion funds among states based on vehicle miles traveled and population of individuals 65 years or older. The apportionment of funds among states is based on the ratio of fatalities and serious injuries among drivers and pedestrians 65 years or older on public roads to the total per capita population of individuals in that age group. In the latest fiscal year, all states had drivers 65 years or older on public roads. Each state receives a minimum of one percent of funds apportioned. States can use the funds for safety projects like improving intersections and roadway segments. To improve roadway safety for older drivers and pedestrians, states must use funds to address hazardous sections of public roads. States need to analyze crash data and develop effective policies to prioritize safety projects. The legislation requires the documentation of traffic-related fatalities and injuries for individuals aged 65 and older. It also mandates consultation with various agencies and organizations to identify dangerous road locations for older drivers and pedestrians. Additionally, it aims to assess the severity of hazardous road elements for this age group. The legislation aims to analyze crash and injury data for drivers and pedestrians aged 65 and older to prioritize funding for projects correcting hazardous road conditions. This includes addressing hazardous intersections and utilizing Handbook recommendations to improve safety for older individuals. The legislation requires the establishment of a schedule for roadway safety improvement projects, evaluation of project results, and reporting annually. The legislation mandates annual evaluations of roadway safety improvement projects and sets the Federal share of project costs at 90 percent. Definitions for \"public road\", \"State\", and \"State transportation department\" are provided. $500 million is authorized for this section annually from 2010 to 2015. The funds allocated for roadway safety improvement projects will be treated as if appropriated under title 23, United States Code, and will not be transferable, remaining available until expended. The Secretary must issue regulations within 9 months of the Act's enactment to implement section 101. Additionally, there will be a revision of the Highway Design Handbook for older drivers and pedestrians. The Secretary of Transportation will finalize the revision of the Handbook to incorporate traffic safety recommendations for older drivers and pedestrians within one year. This includes supplemental lighting at intersections, wet-night visibility of pavement markings, and design of intersection curbs and curb ramps. The Secretary of Transportation will issue guidance on pedestrian safety improvements for public roads, including intersection design elements like lane width, channelization, left-turn lane geometry, curb radius, and pedestrian crossing design. Ongoing research will lead to an updated Handbook by December 31, 2014. SEC. 201. MISCELLANEOUS CONFORMING AMENDMENTS. The text chunk discusses amendments to traffic injury and fatality data collection for older drivers and pedestrians. It includes identifying hazardous locations in terms of accidents, injuries, and deaths involving individuals aged 65 and older. Additionally, a repeal of existing law related to transportation is mentioned. SEC. 202. COORDINATION AND OVERSIGHT OF OLDER DRIVER SAFETY. The Secretary appoints a Special Assistant for Older Driver and Pedestrian Safety to oversee transportation safety programs for individuals age 65 and older. National goals for increasing safety for older drivers, passengers, and pedestrians are established, with the Special Assistant responsible for planning and coordination. The Special Assistant for Older Driver and Pedestrian Safety is responsible for implementing policies to achieve national safety goals for individuals age 65 and older. This includes overseeing data collection, coordinating research, revising handbooks, and making recommendations for safety features in traffic control devices. The Special Assistant for Older Driver and Pedestrian Safety oversees research on safety features for drivers age 65 and older, including testing crash dummies and revising injury quantification systems. The Secretary will report to Congress annually on the progress of research on safe mobility options for individuals aged 65 and older, including any obstacles and recommendations for further action. Authorization of Appropriations: $250,000 from the Highway Trust Fund is authorized for each fiscal year from 2010 to 2015 to carry out specific subsections. These funds will be available for obligation in the same manner as under title 23, United States Code, and will not be transferable. The Secretary of Transportation must establish a minimum level of retroreflectivity for pavement markings by October 1, 2010, applying to all public roads."
