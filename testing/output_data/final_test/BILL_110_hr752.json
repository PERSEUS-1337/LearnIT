    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Electronic Equipment Donation Act of 2008\" requires the transfer of useful federal electronic equipment to educational recipients. Each Federal agency must identify excess electronic equipment and transfer it to educational recipients through the Administrator of General Services or report it as excess property if transfer is not feasible. The Administrator of General Services manages nontransferable equipment in accordance with specific codes. Equipment transferred under a different act is exempt from these requirements. Federal agencies must report excess electronic equipment in advance for possible direct transfer to educational recipients. The Act requires transferring agencies to convey equipment to nonprofit refurbishers for upgrade before transferring to educational recipients. Data must be removed from equipment before transfer according to accepted sanitization procedures. Highest preference is given to educational recipients in equipment transfers. The Act mandates that transferring agencies prioritize educational recipients in enterprise communities, empowerment zones, small towns, or counties. Transfers must be at the lowest cost allowed by law, with ownership of equipment transferring to the recipient. The General Services Administrator must notify educational recipients of available federal electronic equipment, and regional Federal Executive Boards facilitate the process. Regional Federal Executive Boards will help facilitate the transfer of Federal electronic equipment to educational recipients under this Act. The Administrator of General Services will establish rules and procedures for implementing the Act, which supersedes Executive Order No. 12999. This Act does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its agencies, officers, or employees. The Act defines terms such as \"Federal agency,\" \"educational recipient,\" \"school,\" and \"community-based educational organization.\" These definitions are crucial for understanding the scope of the Act. The Act defines terms related to collaborative projects in education with schools, small towns, counties, or libraries, and providing free computer and Internet access to the community. Qualifying small towns have a population of 24,999 or less with 20% earning below the poverty threshold, while qualifying counties have the same poverty threshold criteria. The term \"useful Federal electronic equipment\" includes computers, peripherals, fax machines, and other electronic equipment deemed useful by a Federal agency for educational recipients. It also covers computer software where license transfer is allowed. \"Classroom-usable\" equipment refers to Federal electronic equipment that does not require hardware or software upgrades. The term \"nonprofit refurbisher\" refers to an organization exempt from income taxes that upgrades Federal electronic equipment for educational recipients at no or low cost. SEC. 7. PREFERENCE IN DONATION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY THROUGH STATE AGENCIES. Section 549(e)(3)(B) of title 40, United States Code is amended to give the highest preference for electronic equipment to eligible institutions located in designated enterprise communities or empowerment zones with a population of not more than 24,999 individuals. In areas with a population of not more than 24,999 individuals, 20 percent or more of the residents earn less than the poverty threshold defined by the Bureau of the Census. SEC. 8. REPORT TO CONGRESS. The Administrator of General Services must submit a report to Congress within 18 months of the enactment of this Act. The report will include an inventory of Federal electronic equipment deemed excess by agencies in the first year, detailing the transfer of items to educational recipients, other Federal agencies, organizations, and State agencies. The Administrator of General Services will submit a report to Congress within 18 months of the Act's enactment, including an inventory of excess Federal electronic equipment and recommendations for transferring it to educational recipients. The House of Representatives passed the Act on May 21, 2008, as attested by LORRAINE C. MILLER, Clerk."
