    "content": "Federal programs for low-income individuals are a key focus for Congress, with billions of dollars spent annually. Lawmakers regularly review and consider legislation related to these programs, looking at individual programs and overall spending. Questions arise about the total federal spending on low-income programs, changes over time, and allocation among different categories of benefits and services. These inquiries are complex and addressed in a series of CRS reports. The report focuses on identifying federal low-income programs and analyzing spending trends by category. It addresses challenges in categorizing programs and obtaining consistent spending data. Previous versions provide more detailed programmatic information. The report discusses trends in low-income spending from FY2008 to FY2015, focusing on aggregate trends, categories, and the 10 largest programs. Medicaid is the largest program, with health care dominating spending. Non-health low-income programs are also analyzed. Appendices provide methodology and program spending details. The report provides spending information for various programs, excluding social insurance and welfare programs. Social insurance benefits are earned through work, while welfare typically refers to assistance for those with low incomes. Low-income programs in the report are broader than traditional welfare, including in-kind benefits, education, social services, and community development. Most programs are discretionary and target populations such as the elderly, disabled, and families with children. Families with children and those with a disabled member received 78% of the funding in FY2012 from large programs. In FY2012, families with a disabled member received 78% of the funding from low-income programs. Other target populations included veterans, students, homeless people, refugees, and Indians. Low-income programs use various criteria for eligibility, with benefits being highest for households with the lowest incomes. Non-federal spending, primarily from state and local sources, is also associated with some programs. The curr_chunk discusses trends in federal low-income spending from FY2008 to FY2015, focusing on programs targeted at people with low incomes. The period includes the \"Great Recession\" of 2007-2009, with the national unemployment rate peaking at 10% in October 2009. The spending amounts cited are nominal dollars and not adjusted for inflation. During the period from FY2008 to FY2015, the national unemployment rate peaked at 10% in October 2009 and gradually declined to 5.1% by September 2015. The poverty rate increased from 13.2% in 2008 to 15.1% in 2010, then slightly decreased to 14.8% in 2014. Federal spending for low-income programs rose from $561 billion in FY2008 to $707 billion in FY2009 due to the recession. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 contributed nearly 60% of the increased spending on low-income programs. Federal low-income spending increased from $561 billion in FY2008 to $848 billion in FY2015. The rise was influenced by the recession, Medicaid expansion under the ACA, and health care being a significant portion of the spending. Federal low-income spending increased significantly from $561 billion in FY2008 to $848 billion in FY2015. Health care spending accounted for nearly half of the total spending each year, with a peak in FY2011 at $352 billion. Cash aid was the second largest category, steadily rising from $116 billion in FY2008 to $155 billion in FY2015. Low-income spending increased from $561 billion in FY2008 to $848 billion in FY2015. Cash aid totaled $155 billion in FY2015, down slightly from previous years. Food assistance reached $103 billion in FY2015, up from $59 billion in FY2008. The remaining categories saw higher spending levels in some years, primarily due to ARRA. Total federal obligations for low-income programs increased from FY2008 to FY2015, with some categories seeing higher spending levels due to ARRA. However, the bottom five categories, which are discretionary and more likely to be affected by sequestration, saw somewhat lower spending in FY2013. In FY2015, the top four programs made up 68% of federal low-income spending, increasing from 61% in FY2008. The top 10 programs accounted for nearly 83% in FY2015, up from over 78% in FY2008. Medicaid alone represented almost 45% of low-income spending in FY2015, rising from 38% in FY2008. Medicaid spending surged by almost 24% between FY2008 and FY2009 due to more people becoming eligible and the temporary increase in federal share under ARRA. In FY2015, federal Medicaid obligations totaled $379 billion, a 77% increase from FY2008. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) nearly doubled in size from FY2008 to FY2015, reaching $74 billion in spending. SNAP peaked at almost $80 billion in FY2013 due to the recession of 2007-2009 and temporary expansions under ARRA. In FY2015, SNAP benefits peaked at almost $80 billion, while Supplemental Security Income (SSI) grew by 27% to $62 billion. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) increased by 48% between FY2008 and FY2015. Pell Grants also saw a 56% growth during the same period. The top 10 programs in descending order of FY2015 obligations are Pell Grants, Medicare Part D low-income drug subsidy, Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC), and Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers, all showing growth in funding over the years. Pell Grants peaked in FY2011 at $42 billion before declining to $28 billion in FY2015. ARRA provided temporary funding for Pell Grants in FY2009 and FY2010. Medicare Part D subsidy increased by 43% to $26 billion in FY2015. ACTC spending grew by 23% to $21 billion in FY2015. Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers increased by 24% to $19 billion in FY2015. Among the top 10 programs, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Education for the Disadvantaged Grants to Local Educational Agencies (Title I-A) saw changes in funding from FY2008 to FY2015. TANF spending declined slightly, while Title I-A education grants increased. TANF received additional funds through ARRA in FY2009 and FY2010, reaching its peak at $22 billion. Title I-A also saw a spike in funding due to ARRA, totaling $21.5 billion in FY2009. Seven out of the top 10 programs are funded by mandatory spending. Among the 10 largest programs, seven are funded by mandatory spending. These programs are open-ended entitlements to individuals, except for TANF, which is a capped entitlement to states. The remaining three programs are discretionary and funded annually by Congress. Health care dominates federal low-income spending, accounting for 45%-52% of all low-income spending from FY2008 to FY2014. Between FY2008 and FY2015, low-income spending increased significantly, with health care accounting for two-thirds of the new spending. Medicaid was the main driver of this increase, comprising 83% in FY2008 and 85% in FY2015. Other health care programs saw a decline in their share of spending during this period. During the period from FY2008 to FY2015, low-income health spending increased significantly, with Medicaid being the main driver of this increase. Most health care programs saw a decline in their share of spending, except for Consolidated Health Centers and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) which slightly increased. The Affordable Care Act aimed to increase access to health care by requiring individuals to maintain health insurance coverage or pay a fine. The Affordable Care Act provides subsidies to eligible individuals to make insurance affordable, including premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies. These subsidies, along with the individual mandate, took effect in 2014. The ACA premium tax credit is refundable and can be used towards purchasing a private health plan through a health insurance exchange. Cost-sharing subsidies can reduce out-of-pocket expenses and deductibles for plans bought through an exchange. The Affordable Care Act provides subsidies to eligible individuals to make insurance affordable, including premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies. These subsidies are based on income eligibility levels ranging from 100% to 400% of the federal poverty guidelines. In FY2014, federal spending on ACA premium credits and cost-sharing subsidies totaled $13 billion, increasing to $30 billion in FY2015 and projected to reach $58 billion in FY2017. If included in the spending amounts, the health category would total $474 billion. The health category in the report would total $474 billion, comprising 54% of all low-income spending in FY2015. ACA provisions have income eligibility limits, excluding those below the poverty level. Insufficient information is available to determine the extent of benefits for lower-income individuals. In FY2015, low-income spending totaled $474 billion, with health care comprising 54% of the total. Non-health low-income programs saw federal obligations rise from $302 billion in FY2008 to $404 billion in FY2015, a 33% increase. The majority of this growth occurred in the first year of the period. Non-health low-income spending grew by 28% between FY2008 and FY2009, reaching its peak in FY2011. It declined by 4% in FY2012 and remained relatively flat in subsequent years. In FY2015, non-health low-income spending was almost 2% lower than the FY2011 peak. Food assistance was the only category that saw an increase in obligations as a share of non-health spending from FY2008 to FY2015, representing almost 26% of spending in FY2015. The food assistance category, including SNAP, nearly doubled in spending from $59 billion in FY2008 to $103 billion in FY2015, with a peak of $107 billion in FY2013. SNAP accounted for over 70% of all food assistance obligations in FY2015. Cash assistance, the largest non-health category, made up 38% of all non-health spending in both FY2008 and FY2015. Spending for cash assistance under TANF remained largely unchanged in nominal dollars over the period. The remaining programs in the non-health low-income spending category saw some growth, but cash assistance remained the same as a share of spending in FY2008 and FY2015. The bottom five categories collectively accounted for a smaller share of spending in FY2015 compared to FY2008. Education, housing, social services, employment, and energy assistance represented 42% of spending in FY2008, which decreased to 36% by FY2015. ARRA-related spending increases occurred in FY2009 but tapered off. Four out of five categories had higher nominal spending in FY2015 compared to FY2008, except for social services and employment when adjusted for inflation. Federal spending for low-income programs increased by 51% from FY2008 to FY2015, driven initially by responses to the recession. The growth was fueled by ARRA stimulus spending and the ACA expansion of Medicaid. Health care now makes up over half of low-income benefits spending, with its growth rate second only to food assistance. Medicaid and food assistance saw significant growth in low-income spending from FY2008 to FY2015, with health care growing slightly faster than food assistance. Other non-health categories also increased but at a slower rate, mainly in response to the recession. Food assistance was the only category to increase its share of spending, while others remained flat or declined. Congressional decisions do not directly influence the overall low-income spending, as programs were created independently at different times. Their size is determined by design and budgetary classification. The size of policy problems is influenced by design, budget classification, congressional processes, external factors, and various economic, demographic, and social factors. Low-income programs have important distinctions, with Medicaid being a major component but also including programs for specific groups like elderly individuals, veterans, women, children, and others. Each state operates its own Medicaid program within federal guidelines, providing a range of healthcare services to a diverse population. Cash aid, including TANF, EITC, ACTC, SSI, and pensions for veterans, provides financial assistance to low-income elderly, disabled individuals, and working families with children. SNAP, although not cash-based, subsidizes food assistance. The programs in the report provide income support through cash or near-cash benefits, along with services aimed at improving the well-being and self-sufficiency of low-income individuals and communities. Housing assistance, like SNAP, frees up income for basic necessities, but serves a smaller fraction of eligible households through discretionary programs. The report highlights the diversity of low-income programs, which are delivered through various entities and have different eligibility criteria. Low-income spending has increased, mainly on healthcare. Generalizations about these programs require additional information and caution. Programs were selected based on their focus on low-income individuals. Most low-income programs target resources towards people at the low end of the income distribution, using measures like federal poverty guidelines. Some programs serve low-income populations disproportionately, such as the Indian Health Service and Homeless Assistance Grants. Title I Migrant Education, Indian Human Services, Adult Basic Education, and Social Services Block Grant are programs targeting low-income populations. Federal student loan programs were initially considered for inclusion but were not included due to lack of specific targeting. Deliberations about including the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) reached a different conclusion than the regular Child Tax Credit (CTC). The Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) is a refundable credit that benefits lower-income families, with 89% of claims in 2013 coming from families with AGI below $40,000. The ACTC is included in the report, unlike ACA premium credits and subsidies. Data on FY2014 spending for these provisions are not yet available. The report includes provisions on income eligibility for benefits, ranging from below 100% to 400% of the federal poverty guidelines for premium credits and 250% for cost-sharing subsidies. Tax provisions are not included except for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC). Two new programs have been added since the previous report in 2015, including Guardianship Assistance under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. Preschool Development Grants were added to spending totals in all relevant years, with some programs easily categorized while others require disaggregation for accurate reporting. Some programs are difficult to categorize and may be assigned to a single category, such as Transitional Cash and Medical Services for Refugees categorized as health care. The social services category is not well-defined, with programs like Head Start supporting a broad range of activities that can be collectively characterized as social services. Foster Care and Adoption Assistance provide cash to families but their main purpose is not income support. The purpose of Foster Care, Adoption Assistance, and Guardianship Assistance is to provide support for children in need of permanent homes. Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting is categorized under social services due to its diverse intended purposes. Spending for these programs is measured by new obligations incurred in the fiscal year. The President enacts budget authority through appropriations or authorizing laws, allowing federal agencies to incur obligations for contracts, personnel, and purchases. Outlays are the actual payments of these obligations. Obligations data is sourced from the U.S. Budget Appendix for the relevant fiscal year. In cases where obligations data is not available, appropriations are used instead. The U.S. Budget Appendix shows obligations for various programs like Transitional Cash and Medical Services for Refugees, Breast/Cervical Cancer Early Detection, and Veterans' medical care. Data for Priority Group 5 veterans was obtained directly from the VA for this report. The U.S. Budget Appendix does not show obligations solely for the low-income subsidy portion of the Medicare Part D prescription drug program. This report uses aggregate reimbursements for the low-income subsidy for the calendar year, available from the annual report of the Medicare trustees. TANF obligations provided in the U.S. Budget Appendix were disaggregated into cash aid, social services, and employment and training based on states' reporting to the Department of Health and Human Services. Loan subsidy budget authority was used for the Section 502 program in the 2015 report. The U.S. Budget Appendix does not show obligations solely for the low-income subsidy portion of the Medicare Part D prescription drug program. This report uses aggregate reimbursements for the low-income subsidy for the calendar year. Loan subsidy budget authority was used for the Section 502 program in the 2015 report. The 2011 report used loan subsidy outlays adjusted for re-estimates. The 2015 report and this report use obligations from the U.S. Budget Appendix for the ACTC. Data from the Internal Revenue Service Statistics of Income for tax year 2007 are used to provide more accurate information. The Internal Revenue Service Statistics of Income for tax year 2007 are used to provide a more accurate picture of the ACTC in FY2008. Spending Threshold Programs included in this report had obligations from FY2008 through FY2015 of at least $100 million. Smaller programs were excluded to simplify the analysis. Spending totals cited in the report include programs with obligations totaling at least $100 million in each year. The Cash and Noncash Benefits report series from 1979 to 2006 was replaced by a new series in 2011. The new series uses different methodologies and includes programs not covered in the older series. The new report cannot be considered an update of the old series due to these differences. The older series of Community Development Block Grants included smaller programs with no minimum spending threshold and different categorizations for programs like Head Start and Foster Care. It used different measures of spending and provided estimates of state-local spending, which are not included in the new series. The new series uses obligations wherever possible and does not trace spending back to 1968 like the older series. Changes in programs and appropriations accounts over time make it difficult to trace obligations backward. Changes in programs and appropriations accounts over time make it virtually impossible to trace obligations backward with precision. Detailed Program Tables provide specific information about programs included in the report, organized by category and listed with their CFDA number. Tables show obligations for each program from FY2008 through FY2015 and identify budgetary classification. Target populations and income eligibility concepts are also detailed for each program. The table in the report shows the general concept used for determining income eligibility and targeting federal resources based on need. Specific details such as percentage of federal poverty guidelines or formula allocation factors are not provided in the table but can be found in CRS reports or agency websites. Table B-4 outlines the type of federal assistance provided and the immediate recipients of this assistance. The table in the report outlines federal assistance and its recipients. Immediate recipients receive federal grants directly, which may then be further distributed to other units or organizations. Some programs allow participation by U.S. territories or residents. Specific details can be found in statutory language or federal agency websites. The current report series discusses federal benefits and services for people with low income, including spending trends, individual program fact sheets, history of federal low-income policy, and eligibility criteria. It also covers mechanisms used to target resources based on need. The report discusses federal grants, including formula allocation factors and cost-sharing rules, as well as types of federal grants used for assistance. It also includes a brief discussion of budgetary classification of low-income programs and spending analysis under the 10 largest programs by population group. The CRS Report R44327 examines major programs in FY2012 to estimate eligibility and benefit receipt by families and individuals. It also analyzes the types of families more likely to receive benefits, the amounts typically received, and the likelihood of receiving benefits under multiple programs. Additionally, the CRS Report R44211 provides detailed statistics on poverty in the United States in 2014, comparing measures of poverty under federal guidelines and a supplemental poverty measure. The CRS Report R43731 discusses major themes in past poverty debates and current proposals. The curr_chunk provides a short history of federal policies addressing poverty, recurring themes in antipoverty policy debates, and current proposals. It describes federal programs targeting low-income individuals, their characteristics, and research on how these programs may affect work incentives."
