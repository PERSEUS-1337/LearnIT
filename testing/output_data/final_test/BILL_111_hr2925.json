    "content": "The \"Communities Building Access Act\" may be cited as the short title of this Act. The Congress finds that two effective community programs for the uninsured have emerged, providing care and coverage while avoiding displacement of private coverage and duplication of Federal programs. These models also show economic benefits for employers and reduce financial burdens on State and local budgets, offering potential national solutions for certain uninsured populations. Community models for uninsured populations have shown success in providing care and coverage without displacing private insurance or duplicating federal programs. Lessons learned include the need for subsidies to encourage small employers to offer coverage, effective marketing of access programs, and managing chronic care for lower-income individuals. While these models have raised funding, they lack financial stability and could benefit from a stable funding stream from the Federal Government. If partnered with the Federal Government, these models could be more accountable for ROI and share expertise with similar communities. SEC. 3. Grants for multi-share health care coverage projects for uninsured working individuals are added to the Public Health Service Act. The Secretary will provide grants to public or nonprofit private entities for demonstration projects to offer health care coverage to qualifying employees and self-employed individuals who have not had coverage in the previous 12 months. The grant program provides funding for projects that define a service area, form a consortium of employers and healthcare providers, and ensure coverage for qualifying employees and self-employed individuals without previous coverage. The grant program funds projects that establish unified goals, conduct demographic research on uninsured businesses and individuals, and assess the potential value of the project based on data such as uncompensated care rates, lack of prenatal services, immunization rates, and employer-provided health insurance. The grant program funds projects that establish unified goals, conduct demographic research on uninsured businesses and individuals, and assess the potential value of the project based on data such as uncompensated care rates, lack of prenatal services, immunization rates, and employer-provided health insurance. Eligibility criteria will be established for employers to participate in the project, including location within the service area and maximum average income earned by employees. The project will establish criteria to avoid incentivizing discontinuation of health plans, form a network of healthcare providers for qualifying individuals, and negotiate fees for services provided. The project will cover 30 percent of health care costs with grant funds, while the employer, employee, and other sources will cover the remaining 70 percent. A minimum benefit package will include physician services, prescription drugs, and in-patient hospital care. The project's minimum benefit package includes in-patient hospital services, out-patient services, emergency room visits, emergency ambulance services, and diagnostic laboratory tests and x-rays. Services performed outside the project's service area are not required to be covered, except if not available within the service area. Pre-existing conditions cannot be excluded from coverage. The consortium will select an entity to handle administrative and accounting functions for the health care coverage project, including billings, enrollment, and utilization management. A utilization management program will ensure appropriate care delivery. Plans will be in place to measure outcomes. A plan will be implemented to measure quality and efficiency of care, manage care for enrollees with chronic illness, employ cost-control initiatives, protect the project from high risks, and evaluate the project on an interim basis. The grant application process for the project requires submission to the Secretary with necessary information. $36,000,000 is authorized for grants from 2010 to 2016, with specific amounts allocated for each fiscal year. \"Grants for volunteer specialty provider networks are authorized for a specific period with allocated amounts for each fiscal year.\" The Secretary will provide grants to public or nonprofit entities for demonstration projects to create networks of health care specialists offering volunteer services to eligible individuals without employer coverage, unable to obtain coverage through family, below a specified poverty level, and not eligible for Medicare, Medicaid, or other health programs. The Secretary will provide grants for projects to assist specialists in providing services to eligible individuals through various means such as paying administrative fees, training primary care practitioners, recruiting specialists, and operating community services. The project involves assisting with operating a community clinic staffed by volunteer network specialists, helping with installing or operating beneficial information technology for patients, covering necessary prescription drug costs, and other means as authorized by the Secretary. To receive a grant for a project, the applicant must define a service area and form a consortium of community members and organizations. The project requires a consortium to establish unified goals, conduct demographic research, manage care for individuals with chronic illness, and evaluate the project annually. Matching funds of at least one-third of project costs must be provided by the applicant. Non-Federal contributions for grants must be at least one-third of project costs, in cash or in kind. Applications for grants must meet specific requirements. Authorization of appropriations is necessary for grant funding. Authorization of appropriations totaling $9,000,000 for grants under subsection (a) from 2010 to 2016, with specific amounts allocated for each fiscal year. The text chunk discusses the establishment of a clearinghouse for information on community-initiated projects to provide health care coverage to uninsured individuals. The Secretary will award a grant for a clearinghouse to collect and provide information on community-initiated health projects. This includes identifying technical assistance experts and tracking the success of these projects. The Secretary will award grants for community health projects to assess the impact on coverage, chronic conditions management, economic benefits for businesses, and savings for healthcare providers in the communities. Applications must be submitted to the Secretary for consideration. The Secretary may request agreements, assurances, and information deemed necessary for this section. A program may be implemented to encourage entities involved in access projects to submit reports to the Clearinghouse. The term 'Clearinghouse' refers to the clearinghouse mentioned in subsection (a). Appropriations are authorized for awards under subsection (a) for fiscal years 2010 through 2016."
