    "content": "Recent economic fragility in Europe is raising concerns about a potential \"double-dip\" recession in the United States. This type of recession occurs when the economy briefly recovers from a downturn but then falls back into recession before fully recovering. Policy questions are being raised about the need for additional economic stimulus. The 2007-2009 recession was severe, but not as extreme as the Great Depression. The economy experienced a moderate slowdown in the first half of 2008, followed by a major financial crisis that worsened the economic decline. By the second half of 2009, the economy had hit its lowest point before starting to recover. The economy hit its lowest point in the second half of 2009 with a 5.1% contraction in real GDP. The output gap widened to 8.1%, a sharper decline than previous recessions. Recovery began in mid-2009, but growth was slow and uneven, sustained by temporary factors initially. Sustainable growth started to emerge in 2010 from consumer and business spending. In 2011, economic growth fluctuated, starting with a sharp slowdown in the first quarter due to decreased consumer and government spending. Concerns arose about a possible return to recession. However, growth improved throughout the year, reaching a 3.0% annual rate in the fourth quarter, driven by increased business investment and net exports. Despite this, growth slowed again in the first quarter of 2012 to 1.9%, raising worries about closing the output gap and rising unemployment rates. The current economic situation in the United States poses a risk of a double-dip recession, with factors such as economic weakness, potential negative spillovers from Europe, and looming fiscal restraint in early 2013. A report by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco estimates a 1-in-2 chance of a second recession in the first half of 2013. The role of deleveraging by households and businesses in shaping economic recovery is also discussed. The report discusses the likelihood of a double-dip recession in the United States due to a negative economic shock to an already weak economy. Despite regaining pre-recession output levels in the third quarter of 2011, it took longer than previous post-war recoveries. Consumer spending remains low as households continue to rebuild lost net worth from the housing crisis and recession. Unemployment and decreased household net worth are also constraining factors. Consumer spending was constrained by high unemployment, underemployment, and a surge in energy prices in the first half of 2012. While there was a slight improvement in consumer spending in the first quarter of 2012, it was mainly due to a decrease in the household saving rate, which is not sustainable. Despite a decrease in the unemployment rate from 10.1% in 2009 to 8.2% in May 2012, there was little improvement in 2011 and the first quarter of 2012. The slow economic growth in 2011 barely prevented the unemployment rate from rising further. An unemployment rate of 8.2% after more than three years of recovery is concerning to many. The labor market is a source of concern, with the unemployment rate falling due to discouraged workers leaving the labor force. The employment to population ratio remains low, indicating a stagnant labor market. The housing market is still depressed, with foreclosures rising and house prices falling. This weakness in the housing market has negative effects on households and banks. The sharp fall in household net worth due to declining house prices has negatively impacted consumer spending and economic recovery. Fiscal austerity measures in Europe have led to slower growth, affecting the U.S. as well. The unresolved sovereign debt crisis in the Euro area poses a significant near-term risk, with economic growth in Europe slowing substantially. The economic slowdown in Europe, possibly leading to a recession, could impact the U.S. economy. Slower growth in Europe would reduce the demand for U.S. goods, and a European debt default or bank failure could affect U.S. credit markets. The impending \"fiscal cliff\" in the U.S. could also slow economic growth in 2013, as warned by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. The scheduled fiscal events in 2013 include the end of tax cuts, AMT adjustment, end of payroll tax cut, Medicare payment reductions, and sequestration spending cuts. CBO estimates a 5.1% deficit reduction in GDP. A 30% oil price increase from 2011 to 2012 affected consumer spending. This fiscal shock could lead to a 1.3% GDP contraction in the first half of 2013, potentially causing a recession. Consumer spending may decrease as households and businesses spend more on imported energy, slowing economic growth. Oil prices have stabilized since April 2012, but remain volatile. China's economy is expected to slow in 2012 due to government efforts to dampen inflation. This, combined with recession in Europe, could further dampen economic growth. A double-dip recession in the United States would worsen the global economic downturn, with historical examples in 1937-1938 and 1981-1982. These recessions were caused by changes in economic policy, highlighting the importance of policy persistence during challenging economic times. The U.S. economy rebounded from the Great Depression in the 1930s with expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. In 1937, the U.S. economy experienced a second recession due to a premature switch to contractionary monetary and fiscal policies. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates to prevent inflation, causing a halt in the economic recovery. In 1936, the Fed raised banks' reserve requirements to sop up excess reserves, leading to a contraction of credit-supported spending. The federal government also implemented fiscal contraction measures, including not renewing the veterans bonus and collecting Social Security taxes for the first time in 1937, equal to about 3% of GDP. In 1937, a fiscal contraction equal to about 3% of GDP, combined with contractionary monetary policy, led to a recession with a 4.5% GDP drop and 19% unemployment rate. Economic policy shifted in 1938, but the error prolonged the Great Depression. In the late 1970s, inflation became a major issue for the US, reaching over 13% by 1979. Paul Volcker initiated a disinflation policy to address this. In the late 1970s, the Fed implemented a policy of disinflation by raising the federal funds rate aggressively. This led to a short recession in 1980 despite efforts to control inflation. The economy briefly recovered in the second half of 1980 but faced another contractionary monetary policy in early 1981 to combat inflation. The Fed implemented a second round of contractionary monetary policy in the early 1980s, raising the federal funds rate to over 19%. This led to a longer recession lasting through the third quarter of 1982, resulting in successful disinflation but at the cost of a 2.7% contraction in real GDP and a peak unemployment rate of 10.8% in November 1982. During a recession, there is typically a \"snap back\" relationship where a sharp contraction is followed by a robust recovery, leading to above normal growth as households and businesses increase spending. This excess capacity and high unemployment allow the economy to grow faster than its long-term trend rate. As the economy approaches full employment, growth slows to its trend rate governed by labor growth. The recent recession saw a sharp contraction, but the recovery has been slow and uneven. Real GDP fell 5.1% over 18 months, a post-war record. In the first year of recovery, GDP grew by 3.3%, slower than previous post-war recoveries. In the aftermath of the recent recession, the slow and uneven recovery has led to a deceleration in economic growth, with real GDP growing at a slower rate of 1.6% in the second year and 2.0% in the third year. The recovery has been hampered by sustained unemployment, which is a common outcome following a deep financial crisis according to Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff. This crisis not only reduces actual output but also has the potential to lower the economy's capacity to produce output. As a result, a quick return to pre-crisis levels of output and growth is unlikely. The IMF analyzed the impact of banking crises on output, finding that seven years after a crisis, output had declined by nearly 10% on average. There was variation in outcomes across different countries. The economic crisis in the United States was caused by excessive leverage in households and financial institutions, leading to an asset bubble that eventually burst. The aftermath includes resetting asset values, deleveraging, and repairing balance sheets, resulting in higher saving, weakened domestic demand, slow recovery, and high unemployment. Counter-cyclical policy can help mitigate these effects, but the rebuilding process will take time, leading to moderate economic growth even with fiscal and monetary stimulus. The collapse of the housing and stock markets in 2008 and 2009 led to a substantial decrease in household net worth, pushing the household debt burden to potentially unsustainable levels. Households are diverting income from consumption to debt reduction, which could continue for several years, slowing down economic recovery. The household saving rate has generally increased since 2008 but fell to about 3.5% in the first quarter of 2012. Business investment is likely to be weaker than normal until consumer demand returns. Banks and financial institutions are deleveraging and rebuilding their balance sheets, leading to tighter lending standards. Large firms have access to credit on favorable terms, but smaller firms may struggle to obtain credit. Strong net exports could help offset the impact of reduced consumer demand. Strong net exports could help offset the impact of reduced consumer demand, as the dollar is competitive and supports U.S. exports. However, uncertainty remains about the recovery of foreign economies that are key markets for U.S. exports. Increasing U.S. net exports requires a decrease in the trade deficit, which necessitates a rebalancing of domestic and external demand between deficit and surplus economies. Effective global rebalancing involves adjustments by deficit and surplus economies like the United States, Germany, Japan, and China. Constraints may limit these economies from saving less and spending more, impacting currency appreciation and net exports to the US. Mainstream macroeconomics suggests using monetary and fiscal policy to boost aggregate spending and stimulate economic activity. The Fed can enter the federal funds market and make open-market purchases of Treasury securities to achieve this. The Fed stimulates the economy by purchasing Treasury securities in the open-market, increasing bank reserves and lowering interest rates. Stimulative fiscal policy involves increasing the budget deficit through lower taxes and higher government spending. Both monetary and fiscal policies were used to combat the 2008-2009 recession. Discussions on the need for further stimulus are ongoing, with critics of stimulative policies. Other reports delve into policy responses to economic downturns. The U.S. economy's recovery faces uncertainty due to balance sheet deterioration, potential output reduction, and global economic weakness post-financial crisis. Economic forecasters lowered growth projections for 2012, expecting a slower pace of recovery with GDP projected to advance between 2.1% to 3.0% in 2012 and 2.4% to 3.8% in 2013. Unemployment rate projections are also discussed. The IMF projects real GDP in the United States to increase 2.0% in 2012 and 2.6% in 2013. Globally, the IMF expects an unbalanced expansion with growth of advanced economies at 1.5% in 2012 and emerging developing economies at 6.3%. Global Insight forecasts real GDP to advance 2.1% in 2012 and 2.3% in 2013, with unemployment rates projected at 8.0% in 2012 and 7.4% in 2013. The difficulty in forecasting the economy is especially high due to the unique characteristics of the current business cycle, including a sharp financial crisis and strong policy responses."
