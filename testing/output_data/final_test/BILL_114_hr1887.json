FINDINGS.\" Congress finds that since 1954, the Plum Island Animal Disease Center has conducted scientific research on infectious animal-borne diseases, including foot-and-mouth disease, with a strong safety record. $23.2 million in Federal funds have been spent on upgrades and maintenance since January 2012. Plum Island also holds cultural, historical, ecological, and natural resources of regional and national significance. Plum Island, located at the meeting point of Long Island Sound and Peconic Bay, holds significant environmental and economic value. The Federal Government has invested millions in conservation efforts for these estuaries. The Department of Homeland Security is studying options for Plum Island's future, considering conservation, remediation, legislative changes, and costs. The Department of Homeland Security is studying options for Plum Island's future, including the need for legislative changes, cost considerations, and potential revenues from alternatives. The Department of Homeland Security is studying options for Plum Island's future, including clean up and alternative uses, requiring a report on the study. The Comptroller General of the United States will assess the Department of Homeland Security's study on Plum Island's future options, focusing on alternative uses and ownership transfer possibilities for education, research, or conservation purposes. The Comptroller General of the United States will report on the possible issues, implications, and costs related to alternative uses for Plum Island, as well as the coordination between the Department of Homeland Security and other relevant agencies.
