    "content": "The growth of the Internet for personal, government, and business purposes may be impacted by various technology policy issues debated by Congress, including broadband access, Internet security, privacy, spam, and concerns about children's online safety. The report provides overviews of these issues, along with appendices listing acronyms and discussing past legislation. Other non-technology related issues like intellectual property rights and Internet taxation are not covered. The Internet has become a crucial part of social life, especially for children and teenagers. A survey found that 48 million Americans, mostly with high-speed internet at home, have posted content online. The Digital Future Project highlights new trends in online use for political campaigns. The Digital Future Project reveals new trends in online use for political campaigns, showing that Internet users are forming more online friendships. Users report meeting an average of 4.65 friends online whom they have never met in person. While the Internet increases contact with family and friends for many users, it has no effect on face-to-face time with close friends or family. The FCC issues biannual reports on broadband. In July 2006, the FCC reported a 33% increase in high-speed Internet lines in 2005, reaching 50.2 million lines. Rural Americans lag behind in home broadband adoption but have shown significant growth in the past two years, narrowing the gap with non-rural areas. As of March 2006, 39% of adult rural Americans had high-speed Internet at home. According to a 2004 report by the U.S. Department of Commerce, 39% of adult rural Americans had high-speed Internet at home, compared to 42% in urban and suburban areas. The report examined the reasons for the lower broadband adoption in rural areas despite similar internet penetration rates. According to various sources like ITU, OECD, and market research firms, the global number of Internet users is estimated to be 1.08 billion in January 2006, with expectations to reach 2 billion by 2011. Growth is driven by countries like China, India, Brazil, Russia, and Indonesia. Broadband subscribers in OECD countries reached 181 million by June 2006, showing a 33% increase from the previous year. The future trend includes more users accessing the Internet through mobile devices. Broadband subscribers in OECD countries grew by 33% from 136 million in June 2005 to 181 million in June 2006, increasing penetration rates to 15.5 subscriptions per 100 inhabitants. Denmark led with a rate of 29.3 subscribers per 100 inhabitants, while the United States had the largest total number of subscribers at 57 million. The U.S. Census Bureau released quarterly retail e-commerce statistics on November 17, 2006. E-commerce sales in the third quarter accounted for 2.8% of total sales, reaching approximately $27.5 billion, with a forecasted total online spending in 2006 of $170 billion. ComScore Networks estimated that non-travel e-commerce would surpass $100 billion for the first time. Total e-commerce spending in the first three quarters of 2006 exceeded $100 billion for the first time, with a 19% increase compared to the previous year. Non-travel spending saw a 24% increase to $69.1 billion. Broadband Internet access, including cable modem, DSL, satellite, wireless, and fiber, is being widely deployed, but some rural and low-income areas still lack sufficient access. The 109th Congress considered legislation to address federal broadband financial assistance programs. The 110th Congress is expected to focus on the scope and impact of federal broadband financial assistance programs, regulatory policies, and new technologies on broadband deployment. Policymakers are concerned about disparities in broadband access and the potential economic and social consequences of a \"digital divide.\" Legislation in the 109th Congress aimed to provide financial assistance for broadband deployment in underserved areas. The debate over federal intervention in broadband deployment revolves around the existence of the \"digital divide\" and the need for timely and equal access to broadband services for all U.S. citizens. Policymakers are examining the necessity of present laws and regulatory policies to promote competition and consumer benefits, while also considering if these regulations may hinder investment and deployment of broadband services. The regulatory debate on broadband services focuses on legacy regulations for traditional and new providers, including open access requirements for incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) like Verizon and SBC. These regulations aim to promote competition in the local telephone network and are detailed in Section 251 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The debate also considers applying these regulations to non-dominant services like broadband connections and new market entrants such as cable television companies. The ongoing regulatory debate surrounding broadband services includes discussions on net neutrality, extending legacy regulations to new market entrants, and determining the appropriate regulatory framework for new technologies like VoIP and bundled service offerings. The regulatory debate on broadband services includes discussions on net neutrality, extending regulations to new market entrants, and determining the appropriate framework for new technologies like VoIP and bundled service offerings. The treatment of broadband technologies by different providers is a major focus, with cities and states considering open access requirements on local cable franchises. Court rulings have addressed the jurisdiction of the FCC over cable modem services, culminating in a Supreme Court decision in 2005. The FCC ruled that cable broadband service should be classified as an \"interstate information service,\" resulting in less rigorous regulatory treatment under Title I of the 1934 Communications Act. Wireline broadband services, including DSL technology, were also defined as information services, granting regulatory parity with cable modem services. Regulatory parity was extended to broadband over power line (BPL) service as well. The FCC classified broadband over power line (BPL) service as an \"interstate information service\" subject to Title I regulation in November 2006. Emerging broadband technologies like fiber, wireless (3G, wi-fi, Wimax), and BPL are being developed and deployed, potentially impacting regulatory and market landscapes. The 110th Congress and the FCC may address policies for new broadband technologies, including debates on applying social regulations like 911 requirements and universal service support. Municipal broadband networks, mainly wireless and fiber-based, are also a topic of discussion regarding unfair competition. The debate over municipal broadband networks (mainly wireless and fiber-based) as unfair competition with the private sector has become a significant policy issue. Concerns about Internet security have grown due to incidents like distributed denial of service attacks and viruses like Melissa, Love Bug, Code Red, Nimda, Slammer, and Blaster worms. Hackers using Trojan horses and other techniques have also raised security concerns. Hackers have been using Trojan horses and keylogging software to access personal accounts and manipulate stock prices for profit. Unauthorized access to computers is a common problem, with individuals ranging from juveniles to criminals attempting to gain access for various reasons. The extent of the issue is unknown, with many reported attacks actually being probes conducted with easily accessible software. Unauthorized access to computers is a common problem, with instances increasing according to the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) at Carnegie-Mellon University. The number of reported incidents has grown from 132 in 1989 to over 137,000 in 2003. The number of reported incidents of unauthorized access to computers has grown significantly over the years, but the impact on society remains unknown. Trust in systems may decrease, proprietary information could be compromised, and financial losses may occur. It is challenging to quantify these losses, but they are not zero. Financial losses due to unauthorized access vary and can include theft from accounts, extortion, lost sales, and adverse publicity affecting stock prices. Estimates range from billions to tens of billions of dollars internationally. In a 2005 survey, financial losses totaled $130 million in the previous year, with viruses causing the most losses followed by proprietary information breaches and denial of service attacks. Denial of service attacks resulted in $7 million in losses, while two online brokers spent $22 million compensating customers affected by a \"pump-and-dump\" scheme. Concerns also arise regarding unauthorized access to computer systems posing a national security risk by disrupting critical infrastructures. The President's Critical Infrastructure Board released a National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace in 2003, assigning responsibilities to the Department of Homeland Security. The National Cyber Security Division plays a key role in raising awareness of computer security risks and facilitating information exchange through cooperative efforts like U.S.-CERT. The National Cyber Security Division and Carnegie Mellon's CERT collaborate to produce alerts and guidelines for preventing cyber attacks. Congress has a strong interest in computer and internet security, holding hearings and passing legislation like the Computer Fraud and Abuse statute. Legislation focuses on protecting personal information in possession of government and private sector entities, indirectly impacting computer security. Acts like Gramm-Leach-Bliley, HIPPA, and Sarbanes-Oxley require entities to have programs in place to safeguard financial and health-related information. Certain firms are required to certify the integrity of their financial control systems as part of annual reporting. Congress supports programs for computer security education and research at universities. Efforts to improve internet security have not shown clear results, with a need for more action due to increasing threats. Major vulnerabilities in information networks include software and interconnected systems. Two major sources of vulnerabilities in highly interconnected information networks are software and network configuration. Developers are focusing on designing better security in their products, but vulnerabilities are still common post-market release. Patches are often needed to fix these vulnerabilities, but many system administrators do not keep their software up to date. There are no industry standards for determining or assessing the security of a firm's computer system. Some observers believe computer system owners may be held responsible for third-party damage due to inadequate protection. There are no agreed-upon standards for software security, but the government and other countries have developed International Common Criteria for evaluating security products. The security community debates whether requirements should be imposed on the private sector, while users and vendors argue that the market can address security effectively. The Bush and Clinton Administrations used engagement over regulation to improve security, but did not rule out regulation if needed. Legislation in the 109th Congress primarily focused on privacy issues with indirect impact on computer security. Bills were introduced to extend requirements to safeguard personal information in response to fraud and unauthorized access. In the 109th Congress, legislation focused on privacy issues with indirect impact on computer security. Bills were introduced to safeguard personal information and address security breaches, such as the theft of a laptop containing data of military veterans. The House passed the Veterans Identity and Credit Security Act of 2006, but the Senate did not take up the bill. Concerns about Internet privacy in the 110th Congress revolve around data collection and transfer risks, including spyware installation and identity theft. Identity theft occurs when personal information, such as Social Security numbers, is used by someone else for criminal activities. Spyware, which collects information about computer usage and sends it back to the software manufacturer, is also a concern for Congress. The debate centers around the need for new laws or industry self-regulation to address these issues. The 109th Congress passed the US SAFE WEB Act in 2005, allowing the FTC to share information with foreign law enforcement agencies to investigate unfair and deceptive practices in foreign commerce. Identity theft involves using personal information for fraudulent acts, often in conjunction with other crimes. Identity theft is often committed as part of fraud or white-collar crime, involving illegally obtaining credit, taking over financial accounts, establishing phone service, and more. It can also lead to other crimes like drug trafficking and terrorism. High-profile data breaches have brought attention to the issue, such as the theft of information from 26 million veterans. The theft of information from 26 million veterans highlighted the ease of obtaining personal data. Phishing scams involve misrepresenting identity to extract PII over the Internet. The FTC issued a consumer alert on phishing in June 2004, warning about the risks of identity theft. Various laws, such as the Federal Trade Commission Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, and Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, aim to protect consumer information. Congress has also passed laws specifically targeting identity theft, including the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act, Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, and Identity Theft Penalty Enhancement Act. For more details on state laws and pending federal legislation, refer to CRS Report RL34028. The CAN-SPAM Act (P.L. 108-187) was passed by Congress in 2003 to address the issue of spam, which includes unsolicited commercial emails containing fraudulent or pornographic content. The act preempts state laws specific to spam but not general laws like trespass or tort law. Spam is not only a problem on personal computers but also in text messaging on wireless devices. The CAN-SPAM Act allows marketers to send commercial emails as long as they comply with the law, including providing an option for recipients to opt-out. It does not require a centralized \"do not email\" registry, as the FTC found that it would not effectively reduce spam without proper email authentication. The CAN-SPAM Act includes provisions for marketers to comply with the law, such as providing an opt-out option. Email authentication is being studied as a technical solution to control spam. Some argue that legislation alone is not enough to solve the spam problem, and consumer education is also necessary. Assessing the effectiveness of the CAN-SPAM Act in reducing spam is challenging due to varying definitions of spam. The CAN-SPAM Act aims to reduce fraudulent emails through civil and criminal penalties. However, skeptics argue that legitimizing commercial emails may lead to an increase in unsolicited messages. A report submitted to Congress in December 2005 found that the act has been effective in promoting best practices among legitimate online marketers and providing tools for law enforcement against spam. The report highlighted the international dimension of the spam problem and the inclusion of malware in spam messages. It recommended legislative improvements for tracing spammers operating outside the U.S., consumer education, and advancements in anti-spam technologies. The 109th Congress passed the US SAFE WEB Act in 2005 to enhance enforcement against spam, spyware, and fraud across borders. The FTC collaborates with foreign law enforcement agencies to investigate unfair practices in foreign commerce, raising privacy concerns. Congress has passed laws like the CDA, COPA, and CIPA to protect children online. Recent focus is on safeguarding children from online exploitation and predators, especially on social networking sites like MySpace. Social networking sites like MySpace have become popular among teenagers and young adults, but there have been incidents of children being abducted or lured by adults through these platforms. In response, Congress considered the Deleting Online Predators Act of 2006 (DOPA) to restrict minors' access to such sites. The proposal was controversial as it could limit access to harmless or educational websites. Although the bill did not pass, the issue is expected to continue in the 110th Congress. Data retention, the practice of ISPs keeping electronic records of subscriber activity, is a topic of interest in the 110th Congress. Law enforcement agencies want data to be retained for longer periods to prosecute online predators and child pornography offenders. Proposals range from tracking website visits to storing data for one to two years. The 110th Congress is monitoring issues related to data retention by ISPs, which involves storing subscriber activity such as website visits and email contents. Concerns include cost, privacy risks, and potential access to private communications by law enforcement. Privacy advocates worry about police obtaining discarded records of online activity. The Internet's domain name system allows users to access websites using easy-to-remember names instead of complex IP numbers. The management of domain names has been a controversial issue, with no formal regulations governing it. The NSF was initially responsible for registering nonmilitary domain names before entering into an agreement with Network Solutions, Inc. in 1993. The Clinton Administration explored transferring DNS administration to the private sector due to the NSI-NSF agreement expiring in 1998. The DOC issued the \"White Paper\" in June 1998, stating readiness to work with a new not-for-profit corporation formed by Internet stakeholders. The DOC accepted the proposal for ICANN on October 2, 1998, and signed an MOU with ICANN on November 25, 1998. On November 25, 1998, DOC and ICANN signed an MOU to transition DNS management to a private-sector entity, aiming to introduce competition while maintaining stability. NSI committed to developing a Shared Registration System for multiple registrars in gTLDs. VersiSign will administer the root server system until further government instructions. On November 10, 1999, ICANN, NSI (now VeriSign), and DOC signed an agreement requiring NSI to sell its registrar operation by May 10, 2001 to allow multiple registrars. In April 2001, VeriSign reached a new agreement with ICANN to keep its registry and registrar businesses together. The formal agreement was signed on May 25, 2001, and in September 2003, ICANN and the Department of Commerce extended their MOU. On September 17, 2003, ICANN and the Department of Commerce extended their MOU until September 30, 2006. The MOU outlined transition tasks for ICANN, including selecting new Top Level Domains, improving multi-lingual communications, and developing a contingency plan for operational disruptions. Michael Gallagher of NTIA affirmed the U.S. Government's commitment to preserving the security and stability of the DNS. The NTIA statement reaffirmed the US commitment to the security and stability of the DNS, maintaining its historic role in authorizing changes to the root zone file. ICANN is recognized as the appropriate technical manager of the DNS, and dialogue on Internet governance should continue. NTIA sought public comment on the transition of DNS management to the private sector, leading to a new Joint Project Agreement with ICANN in September 2006. The Joint Project Agreement with ICANN extends through September 30, 2009, focusing on transparency and accountability mechanisms. Congressional Committees oversee the Department of Commerce's management of ICANN. The UN debated international involvement in Internet governance at the 2003 World Summit on the Information Society. The UN's Working Group on Internet Governance (WGIG) released a report in July 2005 proposing further internationalization of Internet governance and the creation of a new global forum for stakeholders. The report suggested four models, including two involving new Internet governance bodies linked to the UN. US officials and Congress opposed transferring control of the domain name system from ICANN to any international body. Congress supported maintaining U.S. control over ICANN, with resolutions passed in the House and Senate. The EU initially backed the U.S. position but later shifted during preparatory meetings in September 2005. During September 2005 preparatory meetings, the EU shifted its support towards an enhanced international role in governing the Internet. Conflict at the WSIS Tunis Summit over control of the domain name system was averted by an Internet governance agreement announced on November 15, 2005, involving the U.S., the EU, and over 100 other nations. ICANN and the U.S. will retain control of the domain name system, while a new international group, the Internet Governance Forum, will provide a forum for stakeholders to discuss Internet policy issues without binding authority. The group held its first meeting in Athens, Greece in 2006. The ICANN conference in Athens, Greece in 2006 did not address international DNS governance. A new .com registry agreement was approved between ICANN and Verisign, allowing Verisign to run the .com registry until 2012 and increase domain registration fees by 7% in four of the next six years. Verisign will pay ICANN $625,000 as a one-time sum and a yearly registry fee starting at $6 million per year. The ICANN-Verisign settlement agreement includes a yearly registry fee starting at $6 million per year, increasing to approximately $12 million over two years. Critics argue it creates a monopoly for Verisign over the .com registry, allowing them to raise fees without justification. Defenders claim it ensures Internet stability and security by supporting ICANN financially and allowing Verisign to upgrade infrastructure. The agreement was approved by NTIA/DOC on November 30, 2006, with NTIA retaining oversight over any changes. The Dot Kids Implementation and Efficiency Act of 2002 was signed into law on December 4, 2002, authorizing NTIA to require the .us registry operator to establish a domain for minors. Legislation in the 108th Congress, P.L. 108-21/S. 151 (PROTECT Act), aimed to create a kids-friendly top-level domain. In the 108th Congress, the PROTECT Act made it a crime to use misleading domain names to deceive people into viewing obscenity online, with increased penalties for minors. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 increased the maximum sentence for deceiving minors into viewing harmful material. ICANN also announced negotiations for a voluntary \".xxx\" domain for adult websites. The announcement of a .xxx domain for adult websites was controversial, with the Department of Commerce and ICANN requesting more time to address concerns about the impact of pornography on families and children. Despite negotiations, the ICANN Board voted against accepting the proposed agreement in May 2006. The ICANN Board voted 9-5 against accepting the proposed .xxx domain agreement, but did not rule out a revised agreement. A revised agreement with additional safeguards for children online was published for public comment. Senator Baucus introduced the Cyber Safety for Kids Act of 2006, which would require a new top-level domain exclusively for material harmful to minors. The act was not enacted, leading to an increase in conflicts over trademarked names and resulting in lawsuits. The White Paper called for WIPO to develop recommendations for trademark/domain name dispute resolutions, adopted by ICANN in 1999. Registrars must follow a uniform dispute resolution policy, with exceptions for abusive registrations. Implementation began on December 9, 1999, amidst an increase in lawsuits over trademarked names. The Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, passed by the 106th Congress, allows courts to order the forfeiture, cancellation, or transfer of domain names registered in \"bad faith\" that infringe on trademarks. It also requires domain name registrants to provide contact information in the WHOIS database, which has been a contentious issue regarding privacy concerns. Property interests, law enforcement agencies, and the U.S. Government support the accessibility of complete and accurate WHOIS information. ICANN's GNSO is developing policy recommendations on the public display of WHOIS data, with a narrow technical definition favored by privacy advocates and other constituencies. At ICANN's June 2006 meeting, opponents urged reconsideration of limiting access to WHOIS data. The GNSO will decide on public access to data based on a working definition. The House Committee on Financial Services held a hearing on ICANN and the WHOIS database in July 2006. Registrants seeking privacy have used proxy services to register anonymously. The NTIA notified Neustar in February 2005 that proxy registrations for .us domains will no longer be allowed. The NTIA announced that proxy registrations for .us domain names will no longer be allowed, and registrars must provide accurate WHOIS information for all customers by January 26, 2006. This decision has been met with opposition from privacy groups and registrars like Go Daddy, who argue that it compromises the privacy and safety of domain name registrants. Additionally, the Fraudulent Online Identity Sanctions Act, included in the Intellectual Property Protection and Courts Amendments Act of 2004, increases penalties for providing false contact information when registering a domain name used for criminal activities. The evolving role of the Internet in the political economy of the United States attracts congressional attention to government information technology management issues. Key challenges include FCC regulation of converging technologies, funding for IT research, oversight of e-government initiatives, and the use of open source software by federal agencies. The FCC is facing challenges due to the evolution of the communications industry towards a digital, broadband world, leading to blurred distinctions between services. Despite restructuring to reflect convergence, the agency must still adhere to the statutory requirements of the Communications Act of 1934. As newer technologies emerge, applying legacy regulations may become more difficult. The FCC is addressing issues related to convergence, such as regulatory classification of Internet protocol services and law enforcement's wiretapping capabilities. Legislation for a national franchising system for video service providers may be introduced in Congress. The FCC is also focused on broadband deployment, encouraging new providers to offer services and promoting deployment in underserved areas and populations. The FCC faces challenges in addressing broadband issues that intersect, such as VoIP, CALEA, and BPL, tied to broadband convergence and reliance on the Internet. Effectively addressing these issues is a significant challenge for the FCC and Congress. Funding for information science and technology at the federal level is part of the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development program (NITRD). The Networking and Information Technology Research and Development program (NITRD) coordinates IT research advancements across agencies, focusing on high-performance computing, software, hardware, networks, and training. The FY2007 budget allocates $3.074 billion to NITRD, emphasizing eight program component areas. The NITRD program focuses on eight program component areas, including High-End Computing, Cyber Security, and Software Design. Key issues for policymakers include assessing the program's effectiveness, funding levels, and the private sector's role. E-government is a concept with relevance in governance areas such as service delivery. E-government encompasses key governance areas like service delivery, information provision, procurement facilitation, and agency exchanges. Policymakers must address issues such as security, privacy, technology management, and accessibility in coordinating federal e-government initiatives. E-government initiatives face challenges in maintaining accountability and public access while performing governance functions online. Concerns have been raised about the U.S. government potentially becoming a publicly funded market competitor through fee-for-services. Initiatives vary in breadth and depth, with the FirstGov website being a well-known federal example. The U.S. government has various e-government initiatives, such as the FirstGov website and Grants.gov, which provide a single portal for accessing federal information and grants online. The IRS also offers the Free File initiative for free online tax preparation. The E-Government Task Force, established in 2001, identified 23 interagency initiatives known as the Quicksilver projects to integrate agency operations and IT investments. These initiatives include projects like e-authentication, GovBenefits.gov, and One-Stop Business by various government agencies. The E-Government Task Force identified 23 interagency initiatives to integrate agency operations and IT investments. The Small Business Administration's One-Stop Business Compliance project aims to help businesses navigate legal requirements. A government-wide payroll process project was added, bringing the total initiatives to 24. The e-Clearance initiative was established as a separate project in 2002. The e-Authentication initiative was reclassified as a separate initiative, providing secure authentication services to the 24 initiatives. OMB has focused on consolidating IT systems in nine functional areas. The E-Government Task Force identified 23 interagency initiatives to integrate agency operations and IT investments. OMB has focused on consolidating IT systems in nine functional areas, including financial management, human resource management, grants management, case management, federal health architecture, information security, budget formulation and evaluation, geospatial systems, and information technology infrastructure. These initiatives are expected to save $5 billion over 10 years. President Bush signed the E-Government Act of 2002 into law, which includes provisions for federal government information technology management and the creation of an Office of Electronic Government within OMB. The creation of an Office of Electronic Government within OMB is a key provision of the E-Government Act. The Administrator oversees various information resources management functions and administers the E-Government Fund. Oversight for Quicksilver projects, implementation of the Act, and funding for e-government initiatives are primary concerns for the 110th Congress. Other issues include developing a federal enterprise architecture, recruiting and retaining IT managers, and balancing competing demands. The federal government and Congress are debating the use of open source software, which intersects with issues like homeland security, e-government initiatives, IT management practices, computer security, and intellectual property protection. State and local governments are also exploring adopting open source software, while regional health information organizations may use it to promote e-health records. In the 110th Congress, the debate over open source software focuses on information security, intellectual property rights, cost, and quality. Open source software allows the public to improve or modify the source code, while closed source programs are proprietary and updates are controlled by the software manufacturer. Examples of open source software include Linux and Apache Web server software. Open source software allows users to modify the source code, while closed source software updates are controlled by the manufacturer. Examples of closed source software include Microsoft Word and Corel WordPerfect. The debate over open source software in the 110th Congress focuses on information security, intellectual property rights, cost, and quality. Critics see open source software as a threat to intellectual property rights, while proponents view it as a way to reduce dependence on a few companies and improve security. There is no conclusive analysis comparing the security of closed source and open source software. Computer security is dependent on application configuration, maintenance, and monitoring. The costs of implementing open source solutions vary based on factors like hardware/software acquisition, training, maintenance, and data conversion. Experts suggest that open source and closed source software cannot be conclusively deemed more secure or cost-efficient. The U.S. federal government's policy on open source software is outlined in a 2004 Office of Management and Budget memorandum. The 2004 Office of Management and Budget memorandum outlines the U.S. federal government's policy on technology investment decisions, emphasizing the importance of information security, licensing requirements, and total cost of ownership. Agencies are instructed to make technology choices consistent with enterprise architecture and the Federal Enterprise Architecture, with a growing emphasis on open source solutions for improved security and critical infrastructure protection. The changing computer environment may lead to a combination of open source and closed source applications being used. The use of a combination of open source and closed source applications is emphasized in technology investment decisions by the U.S. federal government. Legislation passed by the 105th-109th Congresses is summarized in this report, covering various topics of congressional interest. Some issues remain unresolved, while others have been addressed. The report includes a list of laws passed by topic in each Congress. The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 authorizes loans for broadband service in rural areas. The National Science Foundation is directed to study broadband access for schools and libraries. The Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act aims to allocate more spectrum for wireless broadband. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 sets a deadline for the digital TV transition. The Computer Crime Enforcement Act establishes grants for investigating and prosecuting computer crimes. The Department of Defense Authorization Act includes provisions for government system security. The Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act addresses penalties for identity theft. The FY2001 Transportation Appropriations Act and the FY2001 Treasury-General Government Appropriations Act address website information collection practices by federal agencies. Prohibitions include using funds to collect personally identifiable information about individuals' access to federal websites, with exceptions. Inspectors General of covered agencies must report to Congress. The Internet False Identification Prevention Act (P.L. 106-578) requires agencies to report to Congress on the collection of personal information from individuals accessing their websites. The USA PATRIOT Act (P.L. 107-56) expands law enforcement's authority post-9/11 attacks. The Cyber Security Enhancement Act, part of the Homeland Security Act, amends the USA PATRIOT Act to give law enforcement more authority to monitor Internet activities. Concerns about overstepping authority with software like Carnivore were addressed with new provisions requiring notification to Congress. The E-Government Act and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Protection Act address privacy concerns in government information systems. The latter establishes a Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board to ensure privacy and civil liberties are upheld in implementing terrorism-related laws. The 9/11 Commission recommended the creation of this Board. The 9/11 Commission recommended the creation of a Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board due to concerns about the balance of power shifting to the government after the USA PATRIOT Act. The CAN-SPAM Act sets penalties for senders of unsolicited commercial e-mails engaging in deceptive or fraudulent practices. Spam is defined as unwanted or fraudulent commercial e-mails. The CAN-SPAM Act regulates unsolicited commercial emails and preempts state laws related to electronic mail. It authorizes the FTC to establish a \"do not email\" list but the FTC has deemed it not feasible. The US SAFE WEB Act allows the FTC to share information with foreign law enforcement agencies for investigating unfair and deceptive practices in foreign commerce. The Next Generation Internet Research Act directs a study on the effects of new top-level domains on trademark rights. The Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act allows courts to order forfeiture, cancellation, or transfer of domain names registered in bad faith. The Dot Kids Implementation and Efficiency Act requires the establishment of a restricted second-level domain under .us. The PROTECT Act prohibits the use of misleading domain names to deceive individuals into viewing harmful material online, with increased penalties for deceiving minors. The Fraudulent Online Identity Sanctions Act increases penalties for providing false contact information when registering a domain name. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 increases penalties for using misleading domain names to deceive minors into viewing harmful material online. The Child Online Protection Act makes it a crime to send harmful material to children over the internet. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requires parental consent for collecting information from children under 13. The Protection of Children from Sexual Predators Act addresses concerns about sexual predators, including increased penalties for using a computer to engage in prohibited sexual activity with a child. The Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) mandates schools and libraries receiving federal funding to use technology protection measures to block certain websites from minors. This includes filtering software to reduce children's exposure to online pornography. The Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) requires schools and libraries receiving federal funding to use technology protection measures to block certain websites from minors, including filtering software to reduce exposure to online pornography. The E-Government Act of 2002 amends Title 44 U.S.C. by adding provisions related to information technology management and e-government services. Authorized persons can disable the technology protection measure for lawful purposes. The E-Government Act of 2002 establishes an Office of Electronic Government to support innovative internet and electronic projects with a $345 million fund. It also amends the Government Information Security Reform Act, promotes technology worker exchange programs, Share-In-Savings procurement contracts, and policies for protecting confidential information. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (P.L. 105-304) implements WIPO treaties for copyright protection on the Internet, limiting liability for online service providers. The Government Paperwork Elimination Act (P.L. 105-277) directs the use of electronic signatures by executive branch agencies. The Millennium Digital Commerce Act (P.L. 106-229) regulates Internet electronic commerce and recognizes electronic signatures. The Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act extended the e-commerce tax moratorium and defined Internet access. It grandfathered Internet access taxes before certain dates and excluded VoIP services."
