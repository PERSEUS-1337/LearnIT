The Congress recognizes the importance of freedom of speech and press, essential for democracy and public policy formation. Supreme Court precedents like New York Times v. Sullivan uphold the value of promoting free expression. Some individuals are impeding Americans' free speech rights and access to information by suing them in foreign jurisdictions with less free-speech protection, based on allegedly defamatory statements about public figures. Some defamation actions in foreign countries aim to suppress free speech rights of individuals and intimidate publishers, leading to prohibitive lawsuits and speech-suppressing relief. Some defamation lawsuits are brought against Americans in foreign countries by non-citizens, often without jurisdiction. Plaintiffs strategically avoid U.S. courts to circumvent First Amendment protections, forcing Americans to deal with costly legal battles abroad. Journalists, academics, commentators, and experts facing defamation lawsuits abroad risk costly judgments that can be enforced in other countries where they travel or own property. This has led to financial and professional damage for individuals engaging in protected conduct under the US Constitution, impacting the free flow of information essential for sound public policy formulation in the US. The United States respects other countries' right to enact their own speech laws and aims to protect Americans' First Amendment rights within the country. The Federal Cause of Action is outlined in Section 3. The Federal Cause of Action allows a US person sued for defamation in a foreign country to counter-sue in a US district court if the speech in question is not defamatory under US law. Jurisdiction can be established if the foreign lawsuit is against a US person or if the US person has assets in the US that could be targeted in the foreign judgment. The Federal Cause of Action allows a US person sued for defamation in a foreign country to counter-sue in a US district court if the speech is not defamatory under US law. If the cause of action is established, the district court can bar enforcement of the foreign judgment in the US and award damages to the US person based on the amount of the foreign judgment and legal fees incurred. The Federal Cause of Action allows a US person to counter-sue in a US district court for costs incurred in a foreign lawsuit, including legal fees, harm caused by decreased opportunities, and may award treble damages if the foreign lawsuit intentionally suppresses First Amendment rights. The Federal Cause of Action allows a US person to counter-sue in a US district court for costs incurred in a foreign lawsuit, including legal fees, harm caused by decreased opportunities, and may award treble damages if the foreign lawsuit intentionally suppresses First Amendment rights. Expedited discovery and venue restrictions apply to such actions, with a specific timing and statute of limitations outlined for filing. The cause of action for defamation in a foreign country accrues on the date the lawsuit is filed, as per the statute of limitations under section 1658(a) of title 28, United States Code. This Act applies to foreign lawsuits described in section 3(a) brought before or after the enactment date. It does not limit the right of foreign litigants in good faith defamation actions against those who publish false information maliciously or recklessly. In this Act, defamation is defined as false speech causing damage to reputation. A foreign country is any nation other than the United States. A foreign judgment refers to a ruling from a foreign court in a defamation case. The United States includes states, DC, and territories. A US person includes citizens and lawful aliens. A \"person\" in this context refers to a United States citizen, a lawful permanent resident alien, or a business entity operating legally in the United States."
