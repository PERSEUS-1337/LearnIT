    "content": "The Act titled \"Fraudulent Prescription Prevention Act of 2011\" aims to prevent fraudulent prescriptions. The \"Fraudulent Prescription Prevention Act of 2011\" amends the Controlled Substances Act to require practitioners to comply with specific reporting requirements when prescribing controlled substances in schedule II or III. This includes submitting patient information to the Attorney General through a web portal. The \"Fraudulent Prescription Prevention Act of 2011\" mandates practitioners to provide specific details when prescribing controlled substances, including patient information, prescription details, DEA registration number, contact information, and prescription pad number if applicable. Exceptions include medical emergency situations and inconvenience. Practitioners can submit required information for prescribing controlled substances up to 7 days after if web portal access is unavailable. Before dispensing schedule II or III substances, practitioners must submit necessary information to the Attorney General via the web portal. Practitioners must provide specific details when dispensing controlled substances, including purchaser information, dispensing date and time, substance name and amount, refill status, DEA registration number, and contact information. When declining to dispense a schedule II or III substance, practitioners must also submit necessary information to the Attorney General. Practitioners dispensing schedule II or III substances must submit detailed information, including purchaser details and reasons for suspicion of fraud, through a web portal established by the Attorney General. Practitioners must submit detailed information through a web portal established by the Attorney General. The system alerts practitioners if patients repeatedly refill the same prescription, attempt to obtain multiple prescriptions for the same controlled substance within 30 days, purchase controlled substances at multiple pharmacies, or have a history of purchasing schedule II or III substances. The Attorney General establishes a database to track information on patients or purchasers exhibiting suspicious behavior when attempting to purchase controlled substances. This includes history of purchasing in multiple states, using missing or stolen prescription pad numbers, or any other circumstance indicating potential unlawful diversion or misuse. The Attorney General can disclose information reported on suspicious behavior related to controlled substances only for alerts to practitioners or to law enforcement agencies involved in investigations of unlawful diversion or misuse of controlled substances in schedule II or III. The Attorney General can disclose information reported on controlled substances in schedule II or III to assist investigations or proceedings, with funding from the Diversion Control Fee Account. The Diversion Control Fee Account, established by the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1993, is funded to assist investigations or proceedings related to controlled substances in schedule II or III. The applicability date for certain sections of the Controlled Substances Act depends on the operational status of a web portal and database determined by the Attorney General."
