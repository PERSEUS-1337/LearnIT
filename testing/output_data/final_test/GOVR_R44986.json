    "content": "The Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN Act; P.L. 114-322) primarily focuses on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, but also includes provisions affecting western water infrastructure owned by the Bureau of Reclamation. Subtitle J of the WIIN Act, consisting of sections 4007, 4009, and 4011, makes alterations applicable to Reclamation's service area in 17 western states. Specific provisions in Subtitle J pertain to the Central Valley Project in California. These provisions were derived from bills considered in previous Congresses due to the importance of federal water infrastructure in the West. The WIIN Act focuses on federal water infrastructure in the West, with Subtitle J containing controversial provisions that may be debated in the 115th Congress. Observers will monitor the act's implementation and potential litigation, especially regarding the Central Valley Project and new water supply projects. Legislation like H.R. 23 may propose changes to the WIIN Act. The WIIN Act, specifically Subtitle J, contains provisions related to drought and water issues. The Bureau of Reclamation, under the Department of the Interior, is responsible for managing dams and water structures in the western U.S. Congress may be interested in issues and questions regarding the WIIN Act's authorized changes. For more background on California water issues, refer to CRS reports R40979 and R44456. The Bureau of Reclamation, founded in 1902, manages dams and water projects in the western U.S., providing water to farmland and millions of people. It is the largest water supplier in the West and a major hydroelectric power producer. Reclamation's operations have benefits like flood control, recreation, and wildlife support, but can be controversial due to impacts on species and conflicts among water users. The Central Valley Project in California is one of its largest water systems. The Central Valley Project (CVP) in California extends from the Cascade Range to Bakersfield, delivering water to farms, municipal and industrial users, wildlife refuges, and fish and wildlife needs. It consists of 20 dams, 11 power plants, and 500 miles of canals. The State Water Project (SWP) delivers water to urban users and for irrigation, with 34 storage facilities and reservoirs. The State Water Project (SWP) in California consists of 34 storage facilities, reservoirs, pumping plants, hydroelectric power plants, and canals. It is crucial for addressing water shortages in the state and is connected to federal Central Valley Project (CVP) operations. Delivery cutbacks during droughts can affect both CVP and SWP users, with debates on the reasons behind these cutbacks, including environmental and regulatory factors. SWP primarily serves urban or M&I contractors, while CVP serves agricultural water contractors. The SWP and CVP in California serve different types of water contractors, with some overlap. Water deliveries are complicated by state water rights prioritization. The Bay Delta is a key hub for water availability, supplying drinking and agricultural water to millions of people. The enactment of Subtitle J of the WIIN Act was driven by factors like the multiyear drought in California, which significantly reduced water allocations to agricultural areas and municipalities south of the Delta. Efforts to maximize water supplies included water conservation, infrastructure repairs, and new water storage projects. Some perceive a lack of federal investment in new water supplies as exacerbating the impacts of drought, leading to legislative efforts to facilitate such investment. Federal regulations under ESA, including biological opinions for species like the Delta smelt and Chinook salmon, play a significant role in water availability debates during drought conditions. Several bills were introduced to address the California drought, with the House passing bills from 2012 to 2016 aimed at providing more flexibility in federal environmental restrictions on pumping from the Bay Delta to Central and Southern California. The Senate did not advance any of these bills. The WIIN Act combined Army Corps of Engineers water development authorizing provisions with drinking water, water resources, and ecosystem-related provisions. It included provisions specific to the Bureau of Reclamation and the California Central Valley Project. New provisions were included that combined elements from multiple previous bills. The WIIN Act included provisions related to water issues in the Central Valley Project, Reclamation provisions on a West-wide basis, and savings clauses. It addressed drought in California and operational changes in the Central Valley Project, focusing on increasing flexibility in water supply operations. One key aspect discussed was the Delta Cross Channel Gates Operations. The Delta Cross Channel Gates Operations play a significant role in diverting water from the Sacramento River to the Mokelumne River, affecting water quality, species listed under ESA, and water flow to pumping facilities. The gates impact salinity levels in the Delta, with open gates allowing more water flow to pumps but increasing salinity, while closed gates improve salmon migration but can raise salinity. The Inflow-to-Export Ratio (I:E) measures the ratio of water flowing into the Delta to water exported south at pumping stations. The I:E ratio manages water exports from the Delta through pumps, with different ratios specified in BiOps. Water transfers are advocated to stretch supplies during shortages, with CVP users transferring water to urban agencies. Some argue for changes in water transfer restrictions due to lengthy environmental reviews and limited transfer periods. Criticisms include outdated data used to calculate incidental take limits for Delta smelt, leading to proposals for monitoring alterations. Some propose dynamic monitoring changes to address outdated data limitations in water transfer restrictions. The WIIN Act authorizes temporary projects for maximizing water supplies quickly, including real-time monitoring for the Delta Cross Channel operation. Accelerated approval deadlines may apply for projects under this section. The WIIN Act allows for accelerated approval deadlines for water projects, including a 1:1 inflow-to-export ratio for water transfers. The ratio can increase up to 4:1 in wet years, and the law streamlines the approval process for water transfers to expedite allocations. The WIIN Act allows for accelerated approval deadlines for water projects, including a 1:1 inflow-to-export ratio for water transfers. Section 4001 of the Act requires expedited processing of written transfer proposals by the Fish and Wildlife Service and the commissioner of Reclamation. Approval of transfers is aimed at maximizing water supplies while ensuring compliance with federal laws. Governor of California may request expedited procedures for projects providing additional water supplies during emergencies. The WIIN Act allows for accelerated approval deadlines for water projects, including expedited procedures for projects providing additional water supplies during emergencies in California. The agency responsible for the project must convene a final decision meeting with other federal agencies within 10 days, with approval required for proposed new federal projects or operational changes that comply with applicable law. Section 4001 of the Act also authorizes actions to improve monitoring of Delta smelt and salmon and maximize water supplies for users. The WIIN Act's Section 4001 aims to increase water supplies for users while complying with federal laws and regulations. It directs agencies to maximize water supplies through projects and actions, potentially limiting water managers' discretion. Some argue that this focus on maximizing water supplies may not account for unforeseen environmental impacts on listed species. Section 4001 of the WIIN Act aims to increase water supplies for users by accelerating project decision-making and implementing provisions for real-time monitoring of species populations. Efforts to maximize water usage and hold managers accountable are also emphasized, with the effectiveness of these provisions dependent on how they are interpreted and implemented by water managers and upheld by courts. The WIIN Act's Section 4001 aims to accelerate project decision-making and implement real-time monitoring of species populations to increase water supplies. The effect of directives on project requests is uncertain, as agencies may deny requests for not meeting deadlines or approve with limited analysis. The law does not explicitly waive NEPA requirements for permits or grants on federal land, but establishes procedures for Reclamation to coordinate environmental compliance without directing changes to DOI or USDA procedures. Reclamation's interpretation will determine integration with existing agency procedures and differences from NEPA. The WIIN Act's Section 4001 aims to streamline project approval processes and enhance water supplies through real-time species monitoring. The law introduces new project-coordination procedures that may add steps to the approval process. The authority to maximize water supplies through various projects is broad, but constraints related to water quality and species considerations may impact the benefits to water users. Ultimately, the outcome will depend on available water supplies and operational changes. The WIIN Act's Section 4001 aims to streamline project approval processes and enhance water supplies through real-time species monitoring. It establishes a standard for measuring the effects of water operations on listed species, allowing certain actions to proceed unless they cause \"additional adverse effects.\" The interpretation and implementation of this standard, particularly regarding the Old and Middle Rivers, remain uncertain. When the CVP and SWP pumps operate at certain levels, negative flow rates increase, raising the risk of fish being drawn into the pumps. Observers monitor these rates closely. The WIIN Act directs the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior to manage water supplies at the most negative flow rate allowed under BiOps to maximize water for users, unless it causes additional adverse effects on listed fish species. The law requires conditions for implementing a lower flow rate, including real-time monitoring and evidence from salvage models. Factors to consider when managing flows below the maximum include species distribution, entrainment effects, and water temperature. The law requires justification for implementing a lower flow rate, including real-time monitoring and evidence from salvage models. Water managers are directed to provide water supplies at the most negative flow rate allowed under the applicable BiOps, which is -5,000 cubic feet/second (cfs). Supporters believe this approach will benefit users and can be implemented within existing BiOps framework. Justification to reduce flows must be documented in writing. The enacted bill may deviate from existing BiOps in managing flows, raising concerns from stakeholders. The flow rate of -5,000 cfs could harm Delta smelt and other species, with some arguing that setting a high baseline first could have short-term negative effects. Section 4002 of the WIIN Act aims to maximize flows for users. The WIIN Act implements a management strategy to maximize flows for users, potentially affecting listed species in the Delta. Uncertainty surrounds how managers will assess the adverse effects of increased flow rates on species beyond BiOps expectations. It is also unclear how short-term impacts on species will influence long-term survival and conservation. Modeling the long-term effects of flow rates on species could be challenging. Additionally, it is uncertain if maximizing water flows under BiOps will result in additional flows for users due to water-quality concerns. Some users are concerned about limitations on flows due to water quality issues. In 2016-2017, hydrological conditions did not allow for the implementation of these provisions. Observers have noted that pumping limits during high-flow events may not benefit listed species and could lead to water shortages. There is debate about classifying winter storm periods as temporary, allowing for flexibility in pumping limits. However, this could have negative impacts on species like salmon during migratory periods. Section 4003 of the WIIN Act authorizes pumping operations of the CVP and SWP at levels that allow higher OMR flows under certain circumstances, aiming to capture peak flows during storm-related events while considering the impact on listed species. Flows are authorized unless there are additional adverse effects on the species beyond what is anticipated for the duration of the smelt BiOp. Actions to increase flows must comply with state regulatory requirements. The effects of CVP and SWP operations on water quality and flows for species are addressed by the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) to comply with state regulatory requirements. Three factors are considered when determining the effects of flows on listed species, including the Delta outflow index, physical parameters, and species distribution. Reclamation, in coordination with FWS, NMFS, and the California Department of Fish and Game, undertakes monitoring programs during high flow periods to identify any negative impacts on species. The Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior have the flexibility to capture peak flows without counting them towards certain running averages under the Delta smelt and salmon BiOps. This flexibility is allowed to avoid adverse effects on fish species. Freshwater flows to the ocean help maintain a salinity gradient in the Delta and dilute water pollutants. Increased pumping of water for users may reduce water flows to the ocean, potentially shifting the salinity gradient eastward into the Delta. This could impact freshwater availability for other purposes and harm the ecosystem and water quality. Stakeholders are concerned that exporting additional water during high flow periods could lead to ecosystem changes affecting water quality, salinity levels, and sedimentation. Obama Administration officials have acknowledged the potential effects of increased pumping on water quality. The effects of increased pumping on water quality and ecosystem health are monitored and regulated under existing law. Federal agencies must consult with FWS or NMFS to assess potential harm to endangered species and critical habitats, issuing a BiOp if necessary. Consultation is required for coordinated operations of the CVP and SWP, with guidelines for cooperation with state and local agencies. Public water agencies with contracts for water from CVP and SWP have opportunities to provide input and receive information on the development of BiOps. They can submit information for consideration, be informed of schedules, review draft BiOps, discuss alternatives, and understand how RPAs contribute to species conservation. The Secretaries are instructed to involve stakeholders in the process of preparing biological assessments and BiOps, soliciting input and considering recommendations from relevant teams. Quarterly stakeholder meetings are to be held to provide updates on the development of assessments and BiOps, aiming to actively involve and inform stakeholders throughout the process. The law allows stakeholders to contribute to the creation of biological assessments and BiOps, increasing transparency and giving them opportunities to provide recommendations. Some argue that this involvement gives stakeholders a larger role in the process and could delay project implementation. Some California water users are concerned about the impact of proposals to increase water supplies on other users. Water rights holders in Northern California want assurances that their access to water will not be affected by legislative changes. They seek to receive as much water as contractors in Central and Southern California. Section 4005 of the WIIN Act aims to provide protections to certain state water rights holders in California. It ensures that if SWP water supplies need to be reduced due to inconsistencies with the California Endangered Species Act, additional CVP yield will be made available to SWP contractors. Existing state water rights laws will not be affected by these provisions. Section 4005 of the WIIN Act ensures that existing state water rights laws, including \"Area of Origin\" water rights, are not affected. It prohibits federal actions that would reduce water available to SWP or CVP contractors and specifies minimum water allocations for Sacramento Valley water service contractors based on different water-year types. These assurances aim to maintain status quo protections and allocations for priority water rights holders under state law. The WIIN Act's Section 4005 protects existing state water rights laws, including \"Area of Origin\" water rights, and ensures minimum water allocations for certain contractors. It aims to maintain protections for priority water rights holders under state law and address concerns about negative repercussions for certain users. The accountability of the Administration for violations of these protections is unclear due to a lack of reporting mechanisms. The WIIN Act's Section 4010 proposes provisions for improved implementation of BiOps, including real-time monitoring, habitat restoration, and removal of invasive species. It calls for continuous updates using the best scientific data and supports real-time decision-making for maximizing fish and water supply benefits. Section 4010 of the WIIN Act authorizes increased data collection on Delta smelt population, habitat improvement for salmon rearing, and real-time monitoring to benefit fish populations. NOAA is granted broad authority to implement projects for fish recovery and conservation. Section 4010(b)(5) of the WIIN Act authorizes conservation hatchery programs to augment salmon and smelt populations, protect native anadromous fish in the Stanislaus River, and implement invasive species control programs. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to acquire land, water, or interests to benefit listed species, meet water quality requirements, and protect the environment. Real-time monitoring and use of scientific data are encouraged to refine conservation actions. The WIIN Act authorizes conservation hatchery programs to augment salmon and smelt populations, protect native fish, and implement invasive species control. It encourages real-time monitoring and data use to refine conservation actions. The provision in the Delta smelt BiOp aims to collect data on smelt distribution to minimize salvage and maximize pumping, potentially leading to modifications in RPAs. It is uncertain if these modifications would trigger reconsultation under ESA regulations or be implemented immediately. Increased monitoring and surveys could uncover hidden smelt populations, affecting water supplies for users. The WIIN Act authorizes conservation hatchery programs to augment salmon and smelt populations, protect native fish, and implement invasive species control. It encourages real-time monitoring and data use to refine conservation actions. Surveys could uncover hidden populations of Delta smelt, potentially increasing abundance estimates and affecting water supplies for users. Monitoring and surveys may show declines in species, putting pressure on lowering flow rates. Provisions in the bill address dual objectives of maximizing fish populations and water supply benefits, raising questions on how to balance these objectives in real-time decisions. Additionally, three sections of the bill address Reclamation operations and programs more generally, expanding Reclamation's role beyond federally authorized water storage projects. The WIIN Act has funded construction costs for Reclamation projects, repaid by beneficiaries over 40-50 years. Calls for changes in federal financing due to limited funds and moratorium on specific authorizations. Section 4007 of the WIIN Act alters Reclamation's role in developing new water projects. The WIIN Act authorizes $335 million for federal and nonfederal water storage projects approved before January 1, 2021. Federal cost share for federally authorized projects is limited to 50%, and for state-led projects, it is limited to 25%. The WIIN Act authorizes $335 million for federal and nonfederal water storage projects approved before January 1, 2021, with cost share limited to 50% for federal projects and 25% for state-led projects. Section 4007 contrasts traditional Reclamation financing by providing partial federal funding for projects designated in appropriations legislation, aiming to stretch federal funds and encourage local involvement in storage projects. Section 4007 of the WIIN Act allows for increased federal funding for water storage projects, with cost shares limited to 50% for federal projects and 25% for state-led projects. It also grants authority to move forward with construction without congressional approval, shifting the responsibility to appropriators. This provision aims to encourage local involvement in storage projects but may deter those unable to afford upfront payments. The WIIN Act's Section 4007 allows for increased federal funding for water storage projects with cost shares limited to 50% for federal projects and 25% for state-led projects. It grants authority for construction without congressional approval, shifting responsibility to appropriators. This provision aims to encourage local involvement in storage projects but may deter those unable to afford upfront payments. Additionally, only projects approved before 2021 are eligible for this support, while traditional Reclamation project approval and finance remain an option. Reclamation also supports water desalination and water reuse/recycling programs. Reclamation has been supporting desalination research since the 1950s through its Desalination and Water Purification Research Program. They provide research grants and funding for testing brackish desalination technologies. The Title XVI program also offers federal support for water reuse and recycling projects in western states. Section 4009 of the WIIN Act expands federal support for brackish and seawater desalination facilities providing drinking water in the 17 western states. Reclamation's Title XVI program offers cost-shared funding for studies and construction projects that recycle or reuse agricultural drainage water, wastewater, brackish surface water, and groundwater. The WIIN Act expanded federal support for desalination facilities in western states. Reclamation's Title XVI program funds projects that recycle or reuse various sources of contaminated water. Prior to the WIIN Act, geographically specific congressional authorization was required for new projects, leading to a lack of new construction authorizations. Limited funds for federal participation in feasibility studies have led to calls for nonfederal entities to fully fund studies, reducing the Secretary of the Interior's role to review and approval. The WIIN Act expanded federal support for desalination facilities in western states, with nonfederal entities funding feasibility studies and the Secretary of the Interior's role limited to review and approval. Grants are provided for water and energy efficiency improvements, focusing on conservation, renewable energy, endangered species protection, and addressing climate-related impacts on water. Section 4009 of the WIIN Act makes changes to Reclamation's water desalination activities, the Title XVI Water Reclamation and Reuse program, and increases funding for DOI's WaterSMART grants program. Section 4009 of the WIIN Act increases federal funding for desalination projects, allowing the Secretary of the Interior to provide up to 25% of the total project cost for seawater and brackish water facilities in Reclamation states. There is no per-project limit, with an authorization of $30 million for all activities under this section. Additionally, new Title XVI studies and projects are now considered under Section 4009(c), without affecting ongoing projects authorized before the WIIN Act. Section 4009(c) of the WIIN Act allows nonfederal entities to submit feasibility studies at full nonfederal cost to the Secretary of the Interior for review and approval. The Secretary must publish guidelines within 60 days of enactment for these studies. The Secretary is required to send these nonfederal feasibility studies and recommendations to Congress within 180 days, with no further congressional action needed for construction funding under the new Title XVI competitive grant program. Reclamation has submitted an initial list of 38 qualifying studies to Congress. The WIIN Act allows nonfederal entities to submit feasibility studies for review and approval by the Secretary of the Interior. A new competitive grant program prioritizes areas experiencing severe drought or designated as disaster areas. The Title XVI grant program is authorized at $50 million. Funding for DOI's WaterSMART grant program is increased from $350 million. The legislation increases funding for DOI's WaterSMART grant program from $350 million to $450 million. $50 million of the new authorization is reserved for projects on the Colorado River to increase storage in Lake Mead. A new program provides federal financial assistance for desalination facilities in Reclamation states, offering a reliable freshwater supply independent of weather conditions. Desalination is gaining interest in various states across the United States, including water-constrained inland areas and coastal communities. Adoption of brackish desalination technology in states like Florida, Texas, and California has made the U.S. a global leader, while municipal seawater desalination facilities are limited. Limited municipal seawater desalination facilities operate in the United States, with factors like high operating costs and environmental impacts hindering widespread adoption. The desalination authority in Section 4009(a) may provide federal funding to overcome barriers to desalination for drinking water. Changes to Title XVI studies under Section 4009(c) aim to address previous requirements. The WIIN Act's changes to Title XVI studies under Section 4009(c) remove previous requirements for federal involvement in a project, allowing projects meeting new feasibility study guidelines to be eligible for federal construction funding. This could lead to more projects being funded and increased competition for Title XVI funds. The WIIN Act's changes to Title XVI include a new competitive grant program for construction projects, potentially increasing funding competition. The program allows for selection of newly approved projects from a separate funding pool, raising questions on how funds will be awarded while meeting legislative requirements. The legislation for the new Title XVI construction program is unclear and will depend on Administration guidelines. The priority of the two parallel construction processes and the long-term structure of the program are still unknown. Reclamation law has historically focused on project repayment through agreements with water users, governed by water service or repayment contracts with different terms. Repayment contracts typically last 40 years with capital costs repaid in annual installments. Costs for project operations and maintenance, along with fixed annual repayments to the U.S. Treasury, are made by project beneficiaries for water service contracts. Contractors pay a combined capital repayment and operations and maintenance rate for each acre-foot of water delivered. Congress has authorized contract conversion and repayment provisions for individual Reclamation project units. The WIIN Act allows for contract conversion and prepayment for certain CVP contractors in the Friant Division. This provision enables contractors to repay construction costs in full, freeing them from certain restrictions under the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982. The legislation authorizes contractors to prepay outstanding construction cost obligations in a lump sum or installments, with repayment at the current value discounted at one-half of the 20-year Treasury securities rate. Once repayment is complete, contractors are no longer subject to acreage limitations and full-cost pricing of the RRA. M&I contractors can also convert to repayment contractors or prepay outstanding balances. These provisions apply to all Reclamation contractors. The legislation allows Reclamation contractors to prepay their obligations to the federal government, either through conversion to repayment contracts or optional prepayment. It is uncertain how many contractors will take advantage of these provisions, but previous estimates suggest around 35% may convert to repayment contracts. The potential impact and limitations of these payments, along with the savings clauses and sunset dates, are crucial to understanding the legislation's effects. The WIIN Act discusses the use of savings clauses and sunset dates, which were contentious during its consideration. Some argued for temporary provisions while others believed permanent changes were necessary due to broader problems with water delivery systems. Section 4012(a) of the WIIN Act addresses these issues. Section 4012(a) of the WIIN Act includes general savings clauses that prevent preemption of state law, modification of obligations under the CVPIA, ESA, BiOps for CVP or SWP, and adverse effects beyond anticipated range. It also maintains the obligation of the Pacific Fisheries Management Council. Section 4012(b) of the WIIN Act extends provisions to successor BiOps if consistent with ESA, while Section 4013 sets expiration dates for most changes after five years, except for specific projects authorized indefinitely. Section 4012 of the WIIN Act includes provisions to ensure water supplies to CVP and SWP users south of the Delta are maximized without affecting senior water users. It also addresses existing obligations to comply with state law, protect endangered species, and adhere to the CVPIA. The act's savings clauses related to state law, the CVPIA, and ESA are noteworthy, as earlier bills had proposed changes in those areas. The WIIN Act includes provisions to maximize water supplies to CVP and SWP users south of the Delta without affecting senior water users. The addition of savings clauses related to state law, the CVPIA, and ESA could complicate potential alterations. President Obama's signing statement emphasized the importance of maintaining the balance between state and federal law, particularly regarding drought provisions. The Act's five-year window of effectiveness raises questions for Congress. The WIIN Act's provisions under Subtitle J, initially intended as a short-term response to drought conditions, are now set to remain in effect for almost five years longer due to wet winter conditions. This has sparked debate on whether these provisions should be revisited before they expire, with some advocating for a more aggressive approach to Delta exports. Congress is likely to continue monitoring the implementation of Subtitle J, particularly focusing on the interpretation of these provisions by the Trump Administration. The WIIN Act's provisions under Subtitle J, initially intended as a short-term response to drought conditions, are now set to remain in effect for almost five years longer due to wet winter conditions. Congress may consider amending, extending, or repealing these provisions, with a focus on their interpretation and application to the operations of the CVP and federal support for new surface water storage projects. Reclamation has faced challenges in implementing some operational authorities of the WIIN Act due to wet hydrology, while some changes authorized by the act have been implemented. The WIIN Act's provisions, initially a response to drought, have been extended due to wet conditions. Consultation authorities like Section 4004 have improved communication, resulting in reduced pumping restrictions. Section 4001 allowed for increased water transfers, and Section 4003 raised export pumping levels during a storm event. Efforts are underway to extend these authorities set to expire in December 2021, with bipartisan support but opposition from some Members of Congress and environmental groups. Some Members of Congress and environmental groups oppose extending certain authorities under the WIIN Act, fearing increased Delta pumping and potential harm to the environment. Congress has allocated around $576 million for Reclamation projects authorized by the WIIN Act from FY2017 to FY2019. Some authorities have reached their funding limits and may need extension or amendment."
