    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Beneficiary Access to Care Act of 2002\". The Congress states that payments for drugs and biologicals under the Medicare outpatient hospital prospective payment system should cover all costs associated with outpatient pharmacy therapy. The current payment rates do not fully account for these costs. The methodology used to estimate acquisition costs for drugs and biologicals under the Medicare outpatient hospital prospective payment system is flawed. It derives estimates from hospital charges on patient bills without proper adjustments, leading to underestimation of costs for newer, more expensive products. The rates produced are erratic and unreliable, with some payment rates increasing significantly above average wholesale prices. The Medicare outpatient hospital payment system has proposed rate reductions of 50 to 90 percent for nine cancer therapy drugs. This could jeopardize beneficiary access as payments may fall below delivery costs. Most drug payment rates for 2003 are lower than in 2002, with reductions exceeding 30 percent in many cases. SEC. 3. DURATION OF PERIOD FOR TRANSITIONAL, PASS-THROUGH PAYMENTS FOR DRUGS AND BIOLOGICALS. Extension of period of payment for drugs and biologicals under Section 1833(t)(6) of the Social Security Act, allowing additional payments to continue beyond the 3-year limitation specified in subparagraph (C)(i). The Secretary may extend the payment period for drugs and biologicals under Section 1833(t)(6) of the Social Security Act, beyond the 3-year limitation, by engaging an outside contractor to study prospective payment systems. The Secretary can extend the payment period for drugs and biologicals under Section 1833(t)(6) of the Social Security Act by studying alternative methodologies for determining relative weights to reflect cost variation more accurately and equitably. The report with recommendations for changes in the methodology must be made public. The Secretary must certify the availability of adequate data reflecting all costs of outpatient pharmacy therapy in the hospital setting, including acquisition, storage, handling, processing, quality control, disposal, and pharmacy overhead costs. The methodology used to determine payment weights for drugs and biologicals ensures accurate and equitable Medicare OPD fee schedule payments. Findings are reported to Congress, data is made public, and a notice of proposed rulemaking on payment weights is published. The Medicare OPD fee schedule payment amount for drugs or biologicals is determined by a relative payment weight, with a 90-day public comment period. The amendments made by this subsection are effective as if included in the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999. SEC. 4. AMBULATORY PAYMENT CLASSIFICATIONS FOR DRUGS AND BIOLOGICALS AFTER TRANSITIONAL PASS-THROUGH PAYMENTS. The amendment to Section 1833(t)(2) of the Social Security Act specifies that the Secretary will treat drugs and biologicals as a separate group of covered OPD services for payment determination after transitional pass-through payments cease. The amendment specifies that drugs and biologicals will be treated as a separate group for payment determination after transitional pass-through payments end. The effective date of the amendments is retroactive to the enactment of the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999. Study of pharmacy services for cancer drug therapies in hospital outpatient setting. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on payments for pharmacy services and related costs in acquiring chemotherapy drugs for cancer patients in hospital outpatient departments. The study will identify pharmacy costs, review payment methodology adequacy, and suggest necessary changes for appropriate payment recognition. The Comptroller General will conduct a study on payments for pharmacy services and chemotherapy drugs in hospital outpatient departments, aiming to ensure appropriate recognition and payment for cancer treatment services. A report will be submitted to Congress within 12 months, with recommendations for necessary legislative changes. SEC. 6. LIMIT ON REDUCTIONS FOR TRANSITIONAL, PASS-THROUGH PAYMENTS FOR DRUGS AND BIOLOGICALS. Section 1833(t)(6)(E) of the Social Security Act is amended to adjust payments for covered OPD services before and after 2003. The paragraph discusses adjusting payments for covered OPD services without limitations on total payments, by adjusting the conversion factor for the year based on budget neutrality percentage. The paragraph discusses adjusting payments for covered OPD services by applying an applicable percentage specified by the Secretary, not exceeding 2.0 percent from 2004 onwards."
