Established by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 and further funded by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the program aims to ensure families and health professionals work together in decision-making for care and service delivery. The ACA, ATRA, PSRA, PAMA, and MACRA Acts provided funding for Family-to-Family Health Information Centers from FY2009 to FY2017. Funding for FY2018 and beyond has not been enacted. Abstinence Education Grants were established under the PRWORA in 1996, with funding of $50 million per fiscal year from FY1998 to FY2002. The funding was extended through FY2003 and March 31, 2004. Unused grants awarded before October 1, 2017, will remain available. The funding for Abstinence Education Grants was extended multiple times, with extensions through June 30, 2007, and December 31, 2007, among others. The funding for Abstinence Education Grants has been extended multiple times, with appropriations ranging from $50 million to $75 million for various fiscal years. The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting program provides grants for evidence-based home visiting programs. The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting program supports in-home visits by health or social service professionals with at-risk families. Program funding includes research, evaluation, and grants to tribal entities. The program is administered by HRSA and ACF. Funding for the program has been allocated for various fiscal years, with appropriations ranging from $100 million to $400 million. The MIECHV program funds for FY2016 and FY2017 are available, but not for FY2018 onwards. Unused grants awarded before October 1, 2017, can be used in the following fiscal year. The PREP program is a state grant program supporting abstinence, contraception, and adulthood education for adolescents. It includes state formula grants, competitive grants, tribal grants, innovative strategies grants, and funding for training and evaluation. ACA Section 2953. The PREP program was established with appropriated funds totaling $375 million from FY2010 through FY2017. Funding for FY2018 and subsequent years has not been enacted, but funds appropriated prior to FY2018 are still available. States can receive state PREP formula grants for five years, with the Secretary of HHS having the authority to repurpose unused funds for competitive state PREP grants. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 mandated the establishment of a beneficiary assistance program to help Medicare beneficiaries access healthcare services. This program, later renamed the State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP), received annual appropriations of $10 million from FY1991-FY1993 for grants to states. Additionally, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) also supported SHIPs. The State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) received annual appropriations for grants to states. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) also received assistance from other HHS divisions for outreach to low-income Medicare beneficiaries. ACL administers federal grant programs for Area Agencies on Aging (AAA) and Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs). Congress makes annual appropriations to ACL programs, including funds for SHIPs since 2014. MIPPA Section 119 authorized $25 million for low-income Medicare beneficiary outreach and education activities through SHIPs, AAAs, and ADRCs. The ACA, ATRA, and PSRA extended funding and authority for low-income Medicare beneficiary outreach and education activities through SHIPs, AAAs, and ADRCs. Funding amounts varied from $25 million to $45 million for FY2010 through FY2014. For FY2014 and FY2015, PAMA and MACRA extended funding for outreach programs like SHIPs, AAAs, ADRCs, and National Center for Benefits. Funding levels were set at $25 million for each year. MACRA further extended funding through FY2017 at $37.5 million. For FY2016 and FY2017, MACRA allocated $37.5 million annually for Benefits and Outreach Enrollment, with specific amounts for SHIPs, AAAs, ADRCs, and the National Center for Benefits. Funding for low-income outreach programs under MACRA has not been enacted for FY2018 onwards, but prior funds can still be used. SSA Section 1139A established requirements for child health quality measurement, including the Pediatric Quality Measures Program (PQMP). The Pediatric Quality Measures Program (PQMP) was established to improve children's healthcare quality, with seven Centers of Excellence working to fill measure gaps. States must submit annual reports on children's healthcare quality, which the Secretary collects, analyzes, and makes publicly available. A grant program for demonstration projects to enhance children's healthcare quality was also established. Funding for PQMP was extended by PAMA Section 210. PAMA Section 210 extended funding for the Pediatric Quality Measures Program (PQMP) until September 30, 2014, using $15 million from Medicaid adult quality measures. MACRA Section 304(b) allocated $20 million for FY2016-FY2017 for PQMP, excluding funds for childhood obesity, electronic health records for children, and pediatric health quality studies. Funding for child health quality measures beyond FY2017 is uncertain. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 established annual payment limits for Medicare-covered outpatient therapy services, initially set at $1,500 and later re-implemented with an exceptions process in 2006. Providers can request exceptions for services exceeding the therapy caps if they are deemed reasonable and necessary. The exceptions process for Medicare-covered outpatient therapy services has been extended and modified through various legislative acts since 2006. The annual threshold was set at $3,700 by the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 set the annual threshold for therapy services at $3,700, applied separately for different categories. Manual medical review is required for exceptions requested after reaching the threshold. Various legislative acts extended the cap and exceptions process for therapy services. MACRA Section 202 extended the exceptions process for therapy services through December 31, 2017. The HHS Secretary is required to implement a new medical review process for outpatient therapy services, targeting providers with high claims-denial rates, questionable billing practices, newly enrolled providers, providers treating specific medical conditions, or part of a group with identified issues. The authority for therapy caps exceptions will expire after December 31, 2017. The authority for therapy caps exceptions will expire after December 31, 2017. Medicare bonus payments for ground ambulance services in super-rural areas will end on January 1, 2018, with a 22.6% increase in base rate. Payments for ground ambulance services in low population density rural areas were increased by 22.6% from July 1, 2004, to December 31, 2009, and extended through CY2010 for super-rural ambulance payments. The super-rural ambulance payments were extended multiple times, with the latest extension until December 31, 2017. The Medicare ambulance fee schedule rates were temporarily increased for ground ambulance services in rural areas. The Medicare ambulance fee schedule rates were increased for ground ambulance services in rural areas, with additional payment increases extended multiple times until January 1, 2013. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) was required to update a report on ambulance providers' costs and Medicare margins by October 1, 2012. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) recommended against extending ambulance add-on payments in November 2012, with this recommendation included in a report to Congress in June 2013. The 2% urban and 3% rural add-on payments were extended until January 1, 2014, and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was tasked with studying cost reports for ambulance services provided by hospitals. The HHS study found limitations in using cost reports to inform ambulance payment policy. It is technically feasible to collect more detailed cost data periodically, but developing a standard reporting tool is challenging due to the variety of ambulance providers. Payment increases under MIPPA were extended multiple times, with the temporary increases to Medicare's ambulance fee schedule set to expire after December 31, 2017. The fee schedule for rural and urban ground ambulance transports will expire after December 31, 2017. Medicare payments for physician services are based on a fee schedule adjusted geographically for physician work, practice expense, and medical malpractice insurance. Geographic Practice Cost Indices (GPCIs) are used to calculate payment rates under the Medicare physician fee schedule (MPFS). MMA Section 412 increased the work geographic index to 1.0 for services provided from January 1, 2004, through December 31. The geographic practice cost indices (GPCIs) are used to calculate payment rates under the Medicare physician fee schedule (MPFS). Various legislative acts have extended the floor for the work geographic index, with adjustments made for Alaska. The most recent extension was through December 31, 2012, with a requirement for MedPAC to assess the appropriateness and impact of any work geographic adjustment to the MPFS. The MPFS GPCI floor has been extended multiple times through legislative acts, with the most recent extension expiring after December 31, 2017. Medicare-dependent hospitals (MDHs) receive special treatment under the IPPS if they meet certain criteria, such as having no more than 100 beds and a high percentage of Medicare patients. The MDH program provides special Medicare payments to small, rural hospitals with a high proportion of Medicare patients. It was reinstated in 1997 and extended multiple times through legislative acts, with the most recent extension expiring after September 30, 2011. The program also saw changes in payment rates and DSH payment adjustments. The MDH program provides special Medicare payments to small, rural hospitals with a high proportion of Medicare patients. It has been extended multiple times through legislative acts, with the most recent extension expiring after September 30, 2011. Under the Medicare IPPS, qualifying hospitals receive increased payments to account for higher incremental costs associated with a low volume of discharges. The HHS Secretary determines an appropriate percentage increase per discharge for low-volume hospitals more than 25 road miles from an acute-care hospital. CMS determined that hospitals with fewer than 200 total discharges and located more than 25 road miles from another acute-care hospital qualify for a 25% increase per discharge. ACA Section 3125, modified by Section 10314, eased the requirements for hospitals to receive increased Medicare IPPS payments for FY2011 and FY2012. The low-volume standards changed to no more than 1,600 Medicare discharges and more than 15 road miles from another acute-care hospital. Qualifying hospitals with 200 or fewer Medicare discharges receive a 25% payment increase per discharge. The enhanced low-volume adjustment for hospitals with 1,600 or more Medicare discharges was extended through various legislative acts until September 30, 2017. After this date, the original standards of less than 800 discharges and more than 25 road miles from another acute-care hospital will apply. Additionally, under SSA Section 1890, the HHS Secretary is required to contract with a consensus-based entity for performance improvement and measurement duties. The funding for performance improvement and measurement duties under SSA Section 1890 was transferred from various legislative acts, including MIPPA, ATRA, PSRA, PAMA, and MACRA, with amounts ranging from $5 million to $30 million for different fiscal years. The funding for performance improvement and measurement duties under SSA Section 1890 was transferred from various legislative acts, including MIPPA, ATRA, PSRA, PAMA, and MACRA, with amounts ranging from $5 million to $30 million for different fiscal years. Funds appropriated under MACRA for FY2015 replaced PAMA funding, totaling $30 million. Funds for the consensus-based entity contract have not been enacted for FY2018 onwards, but prior funds are available until expended. SSA Section 1890A mandates the HHS Secretary to establish a pre-rulemaking process for selecting quality measures for Medicare. The consensus-based entity gathers stakeholder input annually for the Secretary to consider and disseminate selected quality measures for Medicare programs. The NQF disseminates quality measures through its MAP, which convenes stakeholder groups to select measures for Medicare. Funding from various acts supports this process, with MACRA providing $30 million for FY2015. Funds for the consensus-based entity contract are available until expended. HHS Secretary is mandated to establish a pre-rulemaking process for selecting Medicare quality measures. Funds from MACRA Section 207 totaling $30 million for FY2015 were allocated to carry out SSA Section 1890 and SSA Section 1890A(a)-(d). This funding replaced the previous year's appropriation under PAMA. Funds for measure selection activities beyond FY2017 have not been enacted, but prior appropriations remain available. Medicare offers increased payments for home health care in rural areas, with a 10% rate increase established by BIPA 2000. Medicare has provided rate increases for home health care in rural areas through various legislative acts, starting with a 10% increase in 2001 under BIPA 2000. Subsequent acts like MMA Section 421, DRA Section 5201, ACA Section 3131, and MACRA Section 210 extended and adjusted these increases, with the latest being a 3% increase until December 31, 2017. The authority for these rate increases will expire after that date. LTCHs treat patients discharged from acute-care hospitals needing prolonged inpatient care. Patients stay over 25 days on average. LTCHs can be freestanding, colocated with another hospital, or a satellite facility. CMS implemented a payment regulation in FY2005 to prevent inappropriate patient shifting for financial reasons. In FY2005, CMS implemented a payment regulation for LTCHs to prevent patient shifting for financial reasons. The policy stated that if an LTCH received over 25% of its Medicare patients from a single referring hospital, it would be reimbursed the lower of the LTCH PPS or IPPS reimbursement for discharges exceeding the threshold. This policy was expanded to include all LTCHs in FY2008. MMSEA Section 114(c)(1) delayed the 25% patient threshold adjustment for freestanding LTCHs and \"grandfathered hospitals-within-hospitals\" LTCHs for three years. MMSEA Section 114(c)(2) delayed the adjustment for LTCHs or satellite facilities colocated with another hospital under certain conditions. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 modified the delays in Medicare regulations for LTCHs and satellite facilities colocated with hospitals. The changes included adjusting the start and end dates for the delays under MMSEA Section 114(c)(1) and 114(c)(2). The delays in Medicare regulations for LTCHs and satellite facilities colocated with hospitals were extended by various legislative acts, including the ACA Section 3106, PSRA Section 1206(b)(1), and the 21st Century Cures Act. These delays affected the 25% patient threshold adjustment, with different expiration dates specified for different types of facilities. The LTCH PPS was established under the BBRA 99 to provide per-discharge reimbursement based on average costs and patient mix. This led to higher Medicare reimbursement rates for LTCHs compared to the IPPS. A moratorium was enacted on new LTCH development and beds due to rapid growth in LTCHs and reimbursement rates. The moratorium expired after December 29, 2010. The LTCH PPS was established under the BBRA 99 to provide per-discharge reimbursement based on average costs and patient mix, leading to higher Medicare reimbursement rates for LTCHs compared to the IPPS. A three-year moratorium was enacted on new LTCH development and beds due to rapid growth in LTCHs and reimbursement rates, with exceptions for certain circumstances. The moratorium expired after December 29, 2010. The LTCH PPS was established under the BBRA 99 to provide per-discharge reimbursement based on average costs and patient mix, leading to higher Medicare reimbursement rates for LTCHs compared to the IPPS. A three-year moratorium was enacted on new LTCH development and beds due to rapid growth in LTCHs and reimbursement rates, with exceptions for certain circumstances. The moratorium expired after December 29, 2010. In beds following the closure or decrease in the number of beds of another LTCH in the state. ARRA Section 4302, amended the three-year moratorium on the increase in beds in existing LTCHs by providing an exception to LTCHs that had obtained a certificate of need for such an increase in LTCH beds on or after April 1, 2005 and before the enactment of MMSEA. ACA Section 3106(b) extended the moratoria established under MMSEA an additional two years (expiring after December 29, 2012). PSRA Section 1206(b)(2) reinstated the moratoria under MMSEA beginning January 1, 2015, and expiring after September 30, 2017; however, PSRA did not allow any exceptions to the reinstated moratoria. PAMA Section 112(b) amended the moratoria reinstated by PSRA to begin with enactment of PSRA (December 26, 2013) rather than January 1, 2015. Further, this section provided the same exceptions on the development of new LTCHs that had been provided under MMSEA but did not provide exceptions for the expansion of. The Cures Act amended MMSEA to reinstate exceptions for the expansion of LTCH beds, effective from April 1, 2014, to coincide with exceptions for new LTCHs. The moratorium on new LTCH development and bed increases will expire after September 30, 2017. Medicare covers durable medical equipment when medically necessary and prescribed by a physician, with payment determined through competitive bidding or estimates outside bidding areas. Payments for durable medical equipment (DME) are determined through competitive bidding in certain areas, resulting in lower payment amounts. Not all DME items are competitively bid, so not all fee schedule payments are adjusted based on competitive bidding information. Some DME items, like Group 3 power wheelchairs, are excluded from competitive bidding, while Group 2 power wheelchairs were competitively bid in the first round. The HHS Secretary published final regulations on November 6, 2014, adjusting fee schedule payments for wheelchair accessories based on competitive bidding information, effective January 1, 2016. PAMPA Section 2 prohibited using competitive bidding data to adjust fee schedule payments for accessories furnished. The Cures Act delayed the use of competitive bidding information to adjust fee schedule rates for accessories used with Group 3 power wheelchairs until July 1, 2017. Medicaid is the payer of last resort under third-party liability rules. Starting July 1, 2017, payments for accessories will be based on competitive bidding data. The DRA strengthened Medicaid third-party liability rules by clarifying entities considered third parties and requiring states to pass laws for compliance. States must recover Medicaid payments from judgments awarded to beneficiaries, limiting recovery from third parties in recent court cases. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 amended the SSA to allow states to recover all portions of judgments received by Medicaid beneficiaries, including imposing liens on their property. The effective date for beneficiary liability settlements was delayed multiple times, with state Medicaid programs able to recover all settlements starting on October 1, 2017. States can recover beneficiary liability settlements from October 1, 2017. Medicaid and CHIP programs can rely on Express Lane agencies for eligibility determinations. Previous legislation allowed states to use Express Lane eligibility determinations until September 30, 2015. The authority for Express Lane eligibility determinations was extended through September 30, 2017, but will expire after that date. Federal funding for CHIP is provided with appropriation amounts in statute, with overall annual ceiling on federal CHIP spending to states, the District of Columbia, and territories. CHIP was established as part of BBA 97, with additional years of appropriation amounts provided by other federal laws. The funding for CHIP has been provided through various legislative acts, with appropriations available for specific fiscal years. The funding amounts have been extended through FY2017, with no appropriations enacted for FY2018 or beyond. The funding for CHIP has been extended through FY2017 with no appropriations for FY2018 or beyond. If a state's CHIP allotment is insufficient, shortfall funding sources like Child Enrollment Contingency Fund payments, redistribution funds, and Medicaid funds are available. Not all states with funding shortfalls are eligible for Child Enrollment Contingency Fund payments. The Child Enrollment Contingency Fund provides payments to states based on CHIP enrollment and spending growth. The fund was established by CHIPRA Section 103 and extended through FY2017 by ACA Section 2101 and MACRA Section 301(d). However, appropriations for FY2018 and beyond have not been enacted. Some states use federal CHIP funding to cover Medicaid expenses, especially those that expanded Medicaid eligibility for children before CHIP was enacted in 1997. Some states use federal CHIP funding to cover Medicaid expenses for children above 133% of the federal poverty level. 11 states have the authority to use CHIP funds to finance the difference between Medicaid and CHIP matching rates. This is known as the qualifying state option. Some states have the authority to use available CHIP funds for certain Medicaid expenditures, with various legislative acts permitting the use of funds from FY2001 to FY2013 for qualifying states. The CHIP qualifying state option, authorized by various legislative acts, allowed states to use CHIP funds for certain Medicaid expenditures until FY2017. Additionally, outreach and enrollment grants were provided for eligible entities to increase participation of Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children. The CHIP outreach and enrollment grants aim to increase participation of underserved child populations, with a focus on Native American children and rural areas. Funding was allocated for FY2009 through FY2017, but no appropriations were made for FY2018 onwards. The Community Health Center Fund provided mandatory funding for health centers in medically underserved areas. The Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) provides primary care, dental care, and other health services in underserved areas regardless of ability to pay. CHCF appropriations comprised 70% of health center programs' funding in FY2016. ACA and MACRA allocated billions annually to CHCF from FY2011 to FY2017, but no funds were enacted for FY2018 onwards. The Special Diabetes Program provides funding for research into Type I diabetes and services for American Indians and Alaska Natives. Funding was initially transferred from CHIP funds and later increased to $70 million annually. The Special Diabetes Program's annual appropriations were increased to $150 million through various legislative acts from FY2001 to FY2017. However, funding for FY2018 and subsequent years has not been enacted, and funds appropriated for FY2017 will no longer be available for obligation. The ACA created the CHCF, providing funding for the NHSC. The NHSC offers scholarships and loan repayments to health professionals in shortage areas. CHCF funds have been the sole NHSC funding source since FY2011. ACA Section 10503 appropriated $1.5 billion annually for NHSC from FY2011 to FY2015. MACRA Section 221 appropriated $310 million. The Teaching Health Center program receives funding for direct and indirect graduate medical education (GME) payments to support medical and dental residents training at qualified teaching health centers. ACA Section 5508(a) and MACRA Section 221 appropriated funds for this program. The Teaching Health Center program receives funding for direct and indirect graduate medical education (GME) payments to support medical and dental residents training at qualified teaching health centers. Appropriated funds for the Teaching Health Center GME payments have not been enacted for FY2018 or subsequent fiscal years. The program is currently funding existing Teaching Health Center programs with FY2016 MACRA funds and imposes an annual fee on certain health insurance issuers. The aggregate fee is set to increase annually based on U.S. premium growth. The Internal Revenue Service imposes an annual fee on certain health insurance issuers based on their net premiums written. The fee is calculated on a sliding scale, with a moratorium on collection for CY2017. The fee is set to resume in CY2018. The excise tax on certain medical devices, equal to 2.3% of the sales price, was imposed starting January 1, 2013. It was suspended from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2017, but will resume on January 1, 2018. The tax was created by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and is funded through the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control program. The Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control (HCFAC) account, authorized by HIPAA, funds programs to combat health care fraud and abuse. It finances activities for HHS, the Department of Justice, and the FBI, as well as Medicare program integrity activities through the Medicare Integrity Program (MIP). Congress authorizes annual mandatory appropriations from the Medicare HI Trust Fund for these programs. The HCFAC account receives annual mandatory appropriations from the Medicare HI Trust Fund to fund the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program and the MIP. Appropriations were allocated for FY1997-FY2006 with increases based on previous year amounts. TRHCA extended appropriations for FY2007-FY2010 with inflation adjustments based on CPI-U changes. HCFAC appropriations are available until expended. The HCFAC account receives annual appropriations from the Medicare HI Trust Fund for the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program. Additional funding was allocated for FY2011-FY2016, with inflation adjustments and appropriations available until expended. However, the authorized $20 million for FY2016 has not been enacted for FY2017 onwards. LTCHs are reimbursed by Medicare under the LTCH PPS, which has higher rates than the IPPS. The PSRA established patient criteria for reimbursement and a site-neutral payment rate for LTCH patients who do not meet these criteria. Patients must have had a prior three-day ICU stay or be assigned to a case-mix group based on ventilator services to qualify for LTCH PPS reimbursement. Psychiatric or rehabilitation-related discharges do not qualify. LTCHs are reimbursed under the LTCH PPS, with higher rates than the IPPS. Patients must meet specific criteria for reimbursement, with a site-neutral payment rate for those who do not qualify. Psychiatric or rehabilitation-related discharges do not qualify for LTCH PPS reimbursement. The site-neutral policy provides a blended payment amount or the site-neutral payment rate, depending on the year. A temporary third criterion was introduced for reimbursement before January 1, 2017. The Cures Act reinstated the exception for severe wound discharges in LTCHs, applying only to grandfathered hospital-within-hospital LTCHs in rural areas. The exception is limited to discharges during an LTCH's cost-reporting period starting in FY2018, with modifications to the definition of severe wounds from previous legislation. The Cures Act reinstated the exception for severe wound discharges in LTCHs, limited to grandfathered hospital-within-hospital LTCHs in rural areas. The exception applies to discharges during an LTCH's cost-reporting period starting in FY2018, with modifications to the definition of severe wounds. The reinstated exception only applies to LTCH discharges occurring during an LTCH's cost-reporting period beginning in FY2018. The moratorium on enforcement of direct supervision requirements for outpatient therapeutic services was extended through CY2016 by various legislative acts. The moratorium on enforcement of direct supervision requirements for outpatient therapeutic services in CAHs and small rural hospitals expired after December 31, 2016.
