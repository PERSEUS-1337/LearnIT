The conference agreement provided $30.0 million for FY2006. In FY2005, the MBDA received $29.9 million, an increase of $1.5 million over FY2004. For FY2006, Congress approved $40.1 million for the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), exceeding the Bush Administration's request of $23.5 million. The Bush Administration requested $23.5 million for the NTIA budget, but the Senate approved $62.3 million for FY2006. The House-Senate conference agreement provided funding consistent with past budgets. NTIA is the principal advisory office on telecommunications and information technology, aiming to increase access to services and support U.S. market openings. The NTIA manages federal use of radio frequency spectrum domestically and internationally, advises on international telecommunications negotiations, funds research grants for new technologies, and assists non-profit organizations transitioning to digital transmission. There are calls to expand NTIA's role in spectrum management with increased coordination and resources. The NTIA budget has two main components: Salaries and Expenses, with funding at $18 million for FY2006. The NTIA budget for FY2006 includes $18 million for Salaries and Expenses. The Senate approved $20.3 million, with $7 million allocated for managing the federal government's use of radio spectrum. The NTIA will use existing funds for spectrum management until exhausted. The budget also allows the Secretary of Commerce to collect reimbursements from other Federal agencies. Additionally, the Public Telecommunications Facilities, Planning and Construction program has a budget of $22 million for FY2006. The Bush Administration requested funding for this program to end in FY2006, except for a $2 million carryover. The PTFPC program ended in FY2006, with a $2 million carryover for current functions. The House approved the request, while the Senate approved $22 million for continued funding. The House noted that 93.9% of public television stations were transmitting digital signals by March 2005. The Technologies Opportunities Program (TOP) was eliminated in FY2005, with the Senate restoring $15 million for FY2006, but it was not included in the final appropriations act signed by President Bush. The National Technical Information Service (NTIS) did not receive funding for FY2006 from congressional policymakers, drawing from its Revolving Fund instead. NTIS achieved a positive net income of $508,000 for FY2004, part of the Department of Commerce's Technology Administration. Established in 1970, NTIS' origins trace back to World War II. The National Technical Information Service (NTIS) was established in 1970, with origins dating back to World War II. It serves as the federal government's central source for the sale of scientific, technical, engineering, and related business information. NTIS aims to support economic growth and job creation by providing access to information that stimulates innovation and discovery. The NTIS holds approximately 3 million government information products, with 600,000 available through its online database. It offers fee-based services to federal agencies including distribution of information products, support services, web development, multimedia production, and custom research services. The growth of the Internet and electronic documents has led to a decline in NTIS sales as more documents are available online for free from other sources, raising questions about the relevance of NTIS services. President Bush requested $877.4 million for the Bureau of the Census in FY2006, with $657.4 million allocated for periodic programs, including the decennial census. This request exceeded the FY2005 enacted amount by $132.6 million, mainly due to accelerated planning for the 2010 census. The NTIS is responsible for maintaining a \"permanent repository\" of information, in contrast to the dynamic nature of online content that can disappear without notice. The Bureau of the Census requested funding for the 2010 census and the American Community Survey (ACS) in FY2006. Challenges were faced in securing funding for these programs, with amendments to eliminate funding for the short-form census and prohibit the use of funds for the ACS being defeated in Congress. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $832.2 million for the Census Bureau in FY2006, with $208 million for salaries and expenses and $624.2 million for periodic programs. Representative Baird proposed cutting $10 million from salaries and expenses and $10 million from funds for short-form census redesign during House consideration of H.R. 2862. Representative Baird proposed diverting $20 million from the Census Bureau to the Department of Justice for fighting crime, specifically drug-related crime. Despite opposition, the Baird amendment was approved in a roll-call vote. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $727.4 million for the Census Bureau in FY2006, $150 million less than requested by the Administration. The salaries and expenses account would receive $183 million, while periodic programs would get $544.4 million. The committee expressed concern about timely issuance of reports on manufacturing, economic statistics, and foreign trade. $390 million was recommended for the decennial census, with $79.8 million designated for the Master Address File/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $727.4 million for the Census Bureau in FY2006, $150 million less than requested by the Administration. The committee expressed concern about timely issuance of reports on manufacturing, economic statistics, and foreign trade. $390 million was recommended for the decennial census, with $79.8 million designated for the Master Address File/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing. The committee noted its support for the Bureau's efforts to maximize the accuracy and cost effectiveness of the 2010 census. The bill would increase the lifecycle cost of the 2010 Census by over $1 billion, jeopardize the accuracy of national income accounts, and eliminate important economic data series. The conference report on H.R. 2862 included a total operating level of $812.2 million for the Census Bureau, with $453.6 million designated for 2010 census-related expenses. The Bureau was directed to submit a financial operating plan within 60 days to address its highest priority needs. The conferees directed the Census Bureau to prioritize short-form census redesign, the ACS, and MAF/TIGER in the budget request. They also emphasized the importance of clear survey questions for accurate responses and commended efforts to enumerate Hispanic subgroups. Additionally, the Bureau was instructed to study using prisoners' permanent homes for census enumeration within 90 days. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) examines and approves applications for patents and trademarks, funded by user fees. The Administration's FY2006 budget request included $1.703 billion for the USPTO, a 10.2% increase from FY2005. Prison populations are counted where prisons are located for census purposes, leading to objections from some jurisdictions losing representation and federal funds. The FY2006 budget for the USPTO was initially proposed at $1.703 billion, with full access to fee collections. However, the final appropriations legislation (P.L. 109-108) authorized $1.683 billion for the USPTO, a decrease due to revised fee collection estimates. In FY2005, the USPTO had $1.545 billion in budget authority, mainly from fees. The Omnibus Appropriations Act created a new fee structure to generate $219 million in FY2005, a 27% increase over FY2004. There is controversy over limiting the USPTO's use of fees collected each year, with opponents arguing for immediate financing and proponents supporting fee appropriation to balance the budget. The Technology Administration advocates for national policies fostering technology development. The Office of the Under Secretary for Technology in the Department of Commerce promotes technology development for economic growth, manages the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Technical Information Service. The FY2006 budget requested $4.2 million, but the final appropriations legislation allocated $6.0 million. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a Department of Commerce laboratory focused on supporting U.S. companies with technology development. The President's FY2006 budget requested $532 million for NIST, a 24% decrease from FY2005 due to cuts in funding for programs like the Advanced Technology Program. The FY2006 budget for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) included $426.3 million for the Scientific and Technology Research and Services (STRS) account, a 12.5% increase from the previous year. The Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) funding was cut to $46.8 million, 56% lower than FY2005. The construction budget was set at $58.9 million. H.R. 2862 proposed $548.7 million for NIST, 21% less than FY2005, with $397.7 million for the STRS account and $106 million for MEP. No funding was allocated for the Advanced Technology Program (ATP). The Senate initially funded NIST at $844.5 million in H.R. 2862, with $399.9 million for the STRS account and $106 million for MEP. ATP received $140 million in funding, while construction budget totaled $198.6 million. The final FY2006 appropriations legislation provided $761.8 million for NIST, an increase of almost 9% from FY2005. In FY2006, NIST received $761.8 million in funding, with $399.9 million for the STRS account and $106 million for MEP. The Quality Program received $7.1 million. The Advanced Technology Program was funded at $80 million, a 41% decrease from the previous year. The construction budget more than doubled to $175.9 million. In FY2006, NIST received $761.8 million in funding, with $399.9 million for the STRS account and $106 million for MEP. The Manufacturing Extension Partnership was funded at $107.5 million, an increase of 178%. The Advanced Technology Program received $136.5 million, 20% below FY2004 levels. The construction budget received $72.5 million. The legislation also rescinded $3.9 million of unobligated balances from prior year funds in the ATP account. Continued support for the Advanced Technology Program has been a major funding issue. Opponents criticize the Advanced Technology Program as \"corporate welfare,\" arguing that the private sector should conduct applied research. Supporters defend ATP, stating it helps businesses develop crucial technologies. Funding for ATP has fluctuated, with Congress sometimes decreasing support. The Manufacturing Extension Partnership budget was also a concern in past appropriations. The Administration's FY2004 budget request substantially decreased federal funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP), but funding was restored in FY2005 and maintained in FY2006. NOAA accounted for about 61% of the Department of Commerce's budget request in FY2006. In FY2006, President Bush requested $3.58 billion for NOAA, with the House appropriating $3.38 billion and the Senate recommending $4.47 billion. The Senate approved an additional $0.5 million for the National Weather Service. H.R. 2862 was reported out of conference on November 7, 2005, with $3.94 billion approved for NOAA. President Bush requested $3.58 billion for NOAA for FY2006, which is $210 million more than the previous year. The funding requested for NOAA's various offices and accounts totaled $2.44 billion for Operations, Research, and Facilities, $965.1 million for Procurement, Acquisition, and Construction, and $85 million for Other Accounts, including $90 million for the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund. The House passed H.R. 2862, SSJC Appropriations on June 16, 2005, providing $3.38 billion for NOAA. This included $90 million for the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund, a $3 million transfer from the Coastal Zone Management Fund, and a $2 million cut for U.S. fishery obligations. President Bush had proposed savings of $427.0 million in discretionary funding through NOAA-wide terminations of programs he identified as \"unauthorized earmarks.\" The largest funding cut was proposed for the National Ocean Service's Ocean Health Initiative. The Administration also proposed increases for NOAA satellite hardware, ecosystems activities, completion of a third authorized fisheries research vessel, and procurement of a fourth. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $3.43 billion for NOAA, which is $500 million less than the President's request for FY2006. The House appropriation is also about $480 million less than the FY2005 House appropriation. The committee recommended specific allocations for various NOAA accounts, including transfers and additional budget authority. On June 14, 2004, the House agreed to a cut in committee recommendations for ORF by $50 million. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $3.43 billion for NOAA, which is $500 million less than the President's request for FY2006. On June 14, 2005, OMB released a statement supporting the passage of H.R. 2862 with specific funding levels for climate research, ocean programs, and fishery research. The Senate passed H.R. 2862 with an additional $0.5 million for the NWS National Hurricane Center, bringing the total NOAA budget to $4.48 billion. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $4,476.0 million for NOAA. The Senate-passed H.R. 2862 allocated $3.21 billion for ORF, $1.20 billion for PAC, and $78.0 million for NOAA's other accounts. Additionally, $666.2 million was recommended for NOAA-wide implementation of U.S. Oceans Commission report recommendations, exceeding FY2005 funding by $147 million. President Bush expressed concerns about the funding in a September 8, 2005 \"Statement of Administration Policy.\" President Bush expressed concern about the Senate Appropriations Committee's funding for the \"Ocean Commission Initiative,\" which exceeded the Ocean Action Plan budget by $890 million. Factors affecting NOAA's FY2006 budget included additional funding post-Hurricane Katrina, disagreement over funding for the initiative, and restoration of funding for programs cut by the House. Congress deliberated on legislation to authorize all of NOAA's programs and activities under a single legal authority, known as an organic act. H.R. 50 (Ehlers) would re-establish NOAA in the Department of Commerce, reorganize its administration, and include the National Weather Service and programs for data collection and services. NOAA, NASA, and DOD faced challenges with deployment schedules for the National Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) and ground-based systems architecture. The Weather Service programs include data collection, satellite observations, research, and education. H.R. 337 (Maloney) aims to amend existing law regarding the term of office. H.R. 337 (Maloney) proposes amending the term of office for the Director of the Census to five years and requiring direct reporting to the Secretary of Commerce. H.R. 449 (Camp) aims to establish the position of Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Job Retention and Creation. H.J.Res. 53 (Miller-MI) suggests amending the U.S. Constitution to base House of Representatives apportionment on U.S. citizens, not persons. S. 14 (Stabenow) seeks to revise and extend current law requirements. S. 14 (Stabenow) aims to amend current law by revising and extending requirements related to trade expansion priorities and establishing the position of Chief Enforcement Negotiator. It also includes provisions for assisting workers affected by international trade. S. 50 (Inouye) seeks to enhance the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's tsunami detection and warning program. S. 148 (McCain) would establish the United States Boxing Commission within the Department of Commerce to regulate the sport and industry of boxing. It was passed by the Senate without amendment and referred to the House Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer. S. 1224 (Boxer) reintroduced the National Ocean's Protection Act of 2005 to establish NOAA as an independent agency, transferring authorities from the Secretary of DOC to the NOAA Administrator. The bill was referred to the Senate Science Commerce and Transportation Committee on June 9, 2005. The curr_chunk provides a list of CRS reports on various government programs and agencies, including the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Export Administration Act, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, industrial competitiveness, and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was established in 1958 by the National Aeronautics and Space Act. NASA conducts civilian space and aeronautics activities from its headquarters in Washington, D.C., with nine major field centers across the country. Dr. Michael Griffin became NASA's 11th Administrator in April 2005. NASA requested $16.456 billion for FY2006, a 2.4% increase over the previous year's budget. The total budget for NASA did not change, only how it is distributed within the agency. Congress approved a net $500,000 increase above the request in the FY2006 Science, State, Justice, Commerce Appropriations Act. In FY2006, Congress approved a $500,000 increase for NASA, totaling $16,456.8 million. Hurricane Katrina damaged two NASA facilities, costing the agency $760 million for recovery. The Bush Administration allocated $325 million for NASA in a rescission and reallocation package. In FY2006, Congress approved a $500,000 increase for NASA, totaling $16,456.8 million. President Bush's \"Vision for Space Exploration\" focused on returning humans to the Moon by 2020 and eventually sending them to Mars and beyond. NASA was directed to develop a Crew Exploration Vehicle for this purpose. NASA's Vision for Space Exploration aimed to return humans to the Moon by 2020 and eventually send them to Mars. The estimated cost for the Moon mission was $104 billion, with additional funds needed for crew transportation to the International Space Station. Funding for the Vision was to come from reallocating funds from other NASA activities, sparking debate over national priorities and NASA's budget. The original FY2006 NASA request did not specify funding allocations. The original FY2006 NASA request did not specify funding allocations. $6 billion was identified for \"exploration specific\" activities, $6.4 billion for the space shuttle and space station programs, and $4.1 billion for \"Earth Science, Aero & Others.\" Supporters argue that NASA's budget is a small percentage of federal spending, while skeptics view it as a luxury compared to other domestic programs. Proponents of the Vision argue that NASA should prioritize it, even if it means cutting back on other activities. The new NASA Administrator, Dr. Griffin, has assured that space science, earth science, and aeronautics programs will not be affected by the Vision's funding. NASA's budget remains tight due to the Vision's funding requirements and costs related to the space shuttle's return to flight status after the 2003 Columbia tragedy. Costs for returning the space shuttle to flight status following the 2003 Columbia tragedy, cost growth in other NASA programs, a shortfall of $3-5 billion for the shuttle program in the five-year budget plan, and costs associated with funding congressional directed items are impacting NASA's human space flight programs. The space shuttle and the International Space Station (ISS) will be terminated earlier than planned to make funding available for the Vision. The President directed the shuttle to be retired in 2010 after ISS construction is completed, while the new CEV is expected to be available by 2014, leaving a multi-year gap in U.S. space capabilities. Dr. Griffin aims to speed up the development of the CEV to close the gap in U.S. space capabilities by 2012. Some Members of Congress suggest continuing the shuttle program until the CEV is ready. S. 1281, the Senate version of the NASA authorization bill, initially directed NASA not to retire the shuttle until a replacement is available, but was later modified to prioritize assured human access to space. The Senate bill (S. 1281) adds funding for ISS research and enhances its research role, while the House bill (H.R. 3070) directs 15% of ISS research funding to be used for non-Vision related research. NASA is restructuring its ISS research program to align with the Vision for Space Exploration. NASA's budget for the ISS includes funding for research not related to the Vision for Space Exploration. The initial FY2006 request was $2.180 billion, with $1.857 billion for construction and operations, $324 million for research. Congress later cut $80 million from the ISS program, including $60 million from ISS Crew/Cargo Services and $25 million from research funding. The authorization bills do not specify the amount for the ISS, but $25 million was cut from the research funding account. NASA's budget assumes a decrease in civil service full-time equivalents by almost 2,500. Congress is facing issues on how to \"right size\" NASA and ensure the necessary skill mix for the Vision for Space Exploration. Issues facing Congress include skill mix for the Vision, restrictions on RIFs at NASA, and the debate over servicing the Hubble Space Telescope. NASA initially decided against using the shuttle for servicing missions due to safety concerns post-Columbia tragedy, leading to consideration of a robotic mission instead. NASA initially considered a robotic servicing mission for the Hubble Space Telescope but later decided on a deorbit mission. After completing two \"Return to Flight\" missions, NASA planned to revisit the possibility of a shuttle servicing mission. Conferees added $50 million for a potential Hubble servicing mission. The National Science Foundation (NSF) was created in 1950 to support science and engineering research at U.S. colleges and universities. NSF funds basic research across various disciplines and promotes academic research and education. They provide almost 30% of federal support for science. The National Science Foundation (NSF) provides significant federal support for science and mathematics education, academic institutions, research facilities, and centers. It supports Antarctic research stations, oceanographic vessels, and national research centers. The NSF also fosters university-industry relationships and U.S. participation in international scientific ventures. The agency is independent, led by a presidentially appointed Director and a National Science Board (NSB) that sets policy. The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) conducts audits and investigations for the NSF. The NSF conducts audits and investigations, promotes efficiency, and reports to the NSB and Congress. The FY2006 appropriation for NSF was $5,653.4 million, showing significant growth over the years. The NSF's priority areas include biocomplexity in the environment, human and social dynamics, mathematical sciences, and nanoscale science and engineering. They also focus on strengthening core disciplinary research, broadening participation in the science and engineering workforce, and sustaining organizational excellence. An investment of $509 million in cyberinfrastructure will enhance modeling, simulation, visualization, and data storage capabilities. NSF aims to increase grant size and duration to support research, with the funding rate for research grants expected to rise to 21% in FY2006. The NSF will increase the funding rate for research grants to 21% in FY2006, with investments in international research partnerships, the National Nanotechnology Initiative, the Plant Genome project, Climate Change Science Program, homeland security, and Networking and Information Technology Research and Development. The FY2006 appropriation includes $35 million for the Office of International Science and Engineering, $343.8 million for the National Nanotechnology Initiative, and $100 million for the Plant Genome project. Total funding for R&RA is $4,387.5 million, $54 million above the request and $166.9 million above the FY2005 level. The FY2006 appropriation for R&RA is $4,387.5 million, which is $54 million above the request and $166.9 million above the FY2005 level. This funding includes Integrative Activities (IA) for research instrumentation at U.S. colleges and universities. The Office of Polar Programs is also funded in the R&RA, with up to $425 million allocated for Polar research and operations support. The Senate Committee directs the NSF to take over polar icebreaking activities from the Coast Guard, but expresses concerns about the long-term modernization costs. Language in the legislation directs NSF to seek alternative funding sources for the icebreaking fleet beyond 2006. The NSF is considering a Memorandum of Understanding with the Coast Guard for reimbursement for maintenance and operation of U.S. Polar research activities. Studies are ongoing to assess long-term icebreaking needs in support of Antarctic research. The MREFC account is funded at $193.4 million in FY2006, supporting projects like the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, EarthScope, IceCube Neutrino Observatory, and Scientific Ocean Drilling Vessel. No support is provided for the Rare Symmetry Violating Processes. The Committee is concerned about cost increases in projects. The Committee is concerned about cost increases in projects and suggests altering or descoping the RSVP proposal. The FY2006 appropriation for the Education and Human Resources Directorate is $807 million, focusing on increasing technological literacy and closing achievement gaps in scientific fields. $64 million is allocated for the President's Math and Science Partnerships program, a 19.4% decrease from the FY2005 estimate. Funding will support ongoing awards, data collection, evaluation, and dissemination. The Education and Human Resources Directorate's FY2006 appropriation is $807 million, with funding for various programs including the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation and Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program. The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research receives $100 million in FY2006. The NSB released a report on February 2, 2004, as mandated by Section 22. The NSB released a report on February 2, 2004, recommending a $19 billion investment for the NSF to support programmatic expansion through FY2007. The report suggested focusing funding on key strategic areas and the FY2006 request for NSF was 34% below the recommended amount. The NSB recommended a $19 billion investment for the NSF to support programmatic expansion through FY2007, but the FY2006 request was 34% below the recommended amount. There has been a debate about the management and oversight of major projects funded by the NSF, with a focus on increasing the number and length of research awards. The agency's ability to fund proposals has decreased, leading to discussions about prioritization of projects in the Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction account. The NSF was directed to improve oversight of large projects by developing comprehensive guidelines and project review processes. In February 2004, the National Academies released a study recommending a more open process for project selection in the MREFC account. In September 2005, the NSB released guidelines for the development, review, and approval of major projects supported by the National Science Foundation, emphasizing the need for flexibility in reconsidering facilities due to changes in science and technology. The NSF emphasizes the need for flexibility in reconsidering facilities at various stages of development and in response to changes in interagency participation or funding. Project planning is encouraged across different disciplines, with some concepts evolving into MREFC candidates while others may not be feasible for major support. The facility plan will be updated as necessary. The Administration of Foreign Affairs makes up the bulk of the State Department budget\u201476% in the FY2005 State Department enacted funds. The Administration's FY2006 request for State's Administration of Foreign Affairs was $6,766.1 million, 6.5% above the FY2005 enacted level.
