FINDINGS.\" Congress finds that the premature exhaustion of telephone area codes causes economic dislocation and inconvenience, and efficient allocation of telephone numbers is essential for competitive markets in telecommunications services. Technology and procedures for efficient allocation are in place, but rapid growth in competition and inefficient allocation of numbering resources may lead to problems. The potential exhaustion of telephone area codes within the North American Numbering Plan could lead to adding digits to all US telephone numbers, causing disruptions and costs similar to the Year 2000 computer problem. Efficient number conservation measures can prevent this issue. State regulatory authorities are interested in addressing this problem. State regulatory authorities have the interest and capability to tailor mechanisms for conserving telephone numbers to the needs of the telecommunications markets without impeding competition for services. SEC. 2. EFFICIENT ALLOCATION OF TELEPHONE NUMBERS. The Federal Communications Commission must develop a plan by December 31, 2000, for efficient allocation of telephone numbers, ensuring full portability among services and providers within rating areas. The plan should also include rules for service providers not complying with number portability requirements. The Federal Communications Commission must develop a plan by December 31, 2000, for efficient allocation of telephone numbers, ensuring full sharing among carriers and considering societal costs. The Commission may delegate numbering jurisdiction to State commissions until the plan is fully implemented. The Federal Communications Commission may delegate numbering jurisdiction to State commissions under the Communications Act of 1934 to implement measures for conserving telephone numbers, including establishing use requirements, conducting audits, requiring carriers to return unused codes, implementing number pooling, rationing codes, and developing dialing protocols. The Federal Communications Commission may delegate numbering jurisdiction to State commissions under the Communications Act of 1934 to implement measures for conserving telephone numbers, including establishing use requirements, conducting audits, requiring carriers to return unused codes, implementing number pooling, rationing codes, and developing dialing protocols applicable for calls within the same area code or local calling area. Additionally, State commissions may develop and implement area code relief measures involving overlay area codes for telecommunications service providers to support number conservation measures. The Federal Communications Commission delegates numbering jurisdiction to State commissions to implement measures for conserving telephone numbers, including establishing use requirements, audits, returning unused codes, number pooling, rationing codes, and developing dialing protocols. This includes implementing overlay area codes and ensuring calls within a calling party's home area code remain dialable on a 7-digit basis."
