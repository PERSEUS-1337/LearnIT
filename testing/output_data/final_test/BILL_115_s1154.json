    "content": "The \"Military Family Stability Act\" allows for housing treatment for certain members of the Armed Forces, their spouses, and dependents during a permanent change of station within the United States. The \"Military Family Stability Act\" amends Chapter 7 of title 37, United States Code to provide housing treatment for certain members of the Armed Forces, their spouses, and dependents undergoing a permanent change of station within the United States. The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations for eligible members to request housing treatment during the covered relocation period. The \"Military Family Stability Act\" provides housing treatment for members with spouses or dependents in specific situations during a covered relocation period. This includes spouses who are employed or in a program, dependents in school or the Exceptional Family Member Program, and those caring for a family member with an illness. During a covered relocation period, spouses or dependents of military members approved for relocation may continue residing in Government-owned or Government-leased housing. Spouses or dependents eligible for such housing following a permanent change of station within the United States can start residing in it at any time during the relocation period. During a covered relocation period, spouses or dependents of military members approved for relocation may reside in Government-owned or Government-leased housing. If a spouse or dependent relocates separately from the member, the member may be assigned to housing for members without a spouse or dependent until the detachment date or the spouse's arrival, without displacing others. The basic allowance for housing can be based on the duty station area, the area where the spouse or dependent resides, or the former duty station area if different from where the spouse or dependent resides. The regulations ensure that relocation assistance programs include education about housing treatment available under this section for members of the armed forces during a covered relocation period. The regulations may extend the covered relocation period for members of the armed forces, starting 180 days before and ending 180 days after a permanent change of station. The term 'dependent' and 'permanent change of station' are defined in specific sections of the title. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections in the chapter. The amendments in this section provide housing treatment for certain members of the armed forces and their spouses and dependents during a permanent change of station within the United States. The effective date of these amendments is upon the enactment of the Act and applies to changes of station occurring on or after October 1 of the fiscal year following the enactment. Additionally, the Comptroller General of the United States is required to submit a report to Congress within one year of the Act's enactment on potential actions by the Department of Defense to improve the well-being of military families during a permanent change of station. The report required by paragraph (1) will compare current and past percentages of working spouses in military families, assess the impact on families, evaluate the effects of relocation on employment, education, and licensure of spouses, and identify potential Department actions to enhance the well-being of military families during a permanent change of station. The report will assess the utilization rate of housing treatment for military families, include other relevant matters, and compare the annual spending on recruitment and retention bonuses by each Armed Force over a five-year period. The report will evaluate recruitment and retention bonuses and special pays for members of the Armed Forces, as well as the average annual spending on programs for military families and their support."
