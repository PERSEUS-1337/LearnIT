The \"Catalyst to Better Diabetes Care Act of 2006\" includes provisions for an advisory group on diabetes wellness, a national diabetes report card, a Medicare screening program, and improving diabetes mortality data collection. Congress finds that diabetes is a growing public health issue in the US, with alarming statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2005, 20.8 million Americans had diabetes, with 1.5 million new cases diagnosed in adults. 6.2 million Americans are undiagnosed, and certain ethnic groups have higher diabetes rates. Diabetes is a costly and deadly disease. In 2002, the total costs were estimated at $132 billion, with 18% of Medicare patients having diabetes but consuming 32% of the budget. Diabetes contributed to 224,092 deaths in 2002, but this number is likely underreported. Diabetes complications are underreported, with only 35-40% of decedents having it listed on the death certificate. It contributes to over 224,000 deaths annually and increases the risk of stroke. Additionally, diabetes is the leading cause of new blindness in America. Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure in America, with 44% of new cases in 2002 attributed to diabetes. In the same year, 44,400 Americans with diabetes started treatment for end-stage kidney disease, and 82,000 amputations were performed on individuals with diabetes. Poorly controlled diabetes during pregnancy can lead to birth defects and spontaneous abortions. Diabetes complications are preventable with medical treatment. Primary care for diabetes could have saved $2.5 billion in hospital costs in 2001. Lifestyle interventions reduced diabetes development by 58-71%. Research shows benefits of detecting and treating diabetic complications. Research shows that detecting and treating diabetic eye disease can reduce severe vision loss by 50-60%. Comprehensive foot care programs can decrease amputation rates by 45-85%. Detecting and treating early diabetic kidney disease by lowering blood pressure can reduce kidney function decline by 30-70%. SEC. 2. ADVISORY GROUP ON DIABETES AND CHRONIC ILLNESS EMPLOYEE WELLNESS INCENTIVES AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT BEST PRACTICES. The Secretary of Commerce will establish an advisory group with representatives from public and private sectors, including the Departments of Commerce and Health and Human Services, the Small Business Administration, and entities experienced in employee wellness programs. The group will examine best practices for chronic illness wellness programs to provide improved information on cost savings and quality of life for patients. The advisory group will submit a report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, House Speaker, House minority leader, Senate majority leader, and Senate minority leader within one year of the enactment of the Act. SEC. 3. NATIONAL DIABETES REPORT CARD. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in collaboration with the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, prepares a national diabetes report card for the Nation and each State biennially. The report includes health outcomes for individuals with diabetes such as HbA1c level, LDL, blood pressure, and complications. The Secretary submits the report to Congress and makes it available in print and electronically to each State and the public. Each Report Card can be adapted by State and local agencies to rate local diabetes care, costs, and prevalence. Updated Report Cards include trend analysis for the Nation and States to track progress in meeting national goals for improving diabetes care, costs, and prevalence. MEDICARE DIABETES SCREENING COLLABORATION AND OUTREACH PROGRAM. Establishment of an outreach program to increase awareness and utilization of Medicare diabetes screening tests in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Consultation with relevant parties required. The Director must consult with various federal government units and entities interested in diabetes to establish an outreach program for Medicare diabetes screening tests. Improvement of diabetes mortality data collection. The Secretary, in collaboration with relevant agencies, conducts biennial data collection on diabetes prevalence and incidence. This includes assessing diabetes-related deaths and addressing under-reporting on death certificates. The Secretary collaborates with relevant agencies to collect data on diabetes prevalence and deaths, including addressing under-reporting on death certificates by potentially adding language to improve the collection of diabetes mortality data. Annual reports are submitted to relevant committees detailing the activities undertaken in this regard. The Secretary and the Director collaborate to collect data on diabetes-related deaths and prevalence, aiming to provide accurate estimates and projections on trends. Reports are made publicly available through the CDC website. The Secretary, in collaboration with the Institute of Medicine and other relevant bodies, will conduct a study on the impact of diabetes on medical practice in the US and the necessary level of diabetes education for licensure and certification. A report on the study's findings will be submitted to specific Congressional committees within 2 years of the Act's enactment."
