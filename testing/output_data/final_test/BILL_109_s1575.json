    "content": "The Nurse Faculty Education Act of 2005 may be cited as such. The Act includes findings. Congress finds that the Nurse Reinvestment Act has supported nurse educators, but nursing schools still face faculty shortages. The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts a need for over 1,000,000 nurses by 2012. In the 2004-2005 academic year, thousands of qualified applicants were denied entry into nursing programs. The National League of Nursing reported in 2004 that over 123,000 qualified applicants were unable to be accepted into nursing programs due to a lack of faculty. This shortage is primarily attributed to insufficient funds, difficulty in recruiting faculty in a competitive job market, and limited availability of nursing faculty in different regions. Despite the high demand for nurses, only 400 graduates from doctoral nursing programs annually, which is inadequate to meet current needs. The shortage of nurse faculty is a significant issue, as the annual graduation rate of doctorally-prepared faculty is insufficient to meet current needs. With the average age of nurse faculty at retirement being 62.5 years and the average age of doctorally-prepared faculty at 53.5 years, the healthcare system is facing challenges with shortages of deans, nurse educators, and nurses. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section on Nurse Faculty Education (SEC. 832). This addresses the shortage of nurse faculty, which is a critical issue due to insufficient doctorally-prepared faculty to meet current needs. The Nurse Faculty Education Program, established by the Secretary through the Health Resources and Services Administration, aims to address the shortage of nurse faculty by awarding grants to eligible nursing schools offering doctoral degrees. The grants support faculty hiring, retention, educational resources, increasing enrollment and graduation rates, and assisting graduates in becoming nurse faculty. The Nurse Faculty Education Program requires applicants to submit an application, develop a plan, submit annual reports on student enrollment, retention, graduation rates, and employment in nursing faculty positions, and allow on-site inspections by the Secretary. The Nurse Faculty Education Program requires compliance with Secretary requests for information, meeting additional requirements as determined by the Secretary, and developing a plan for fund usage within a year of receiving a grant. This plan should include partnering opportunities with academic institutions for doctoral education and research experiences, as well as with educational institutions for hiring graduates into nurse faculty positions. The Nurse Faculty Education Program offers opportunities for students to gain hands-on experience in nurse faculty roles through internship programs. It also promotes cooperative education programs among nursing schools to share resources for distance learning. Additionally, the program provides support for minority and diverse student populations interested in pursuing doctoral education, as well as pre-entry preparation programs for returning students. The Nurse Faculty Education Program offers various tools for program enrollment, including a nurse faculty mentoring program, a baccalaureate to Ph.D. program, career path opportunities for 2nd degree students, and marketing outreach activities. Priority is given to entities from states with fewer employed nurses per population. Grants of $100,000 each are awarded in fiscal years 2006 and 2007. In fiscal years 2007 to 2010, the Secretary will award grants of $100,000 each to existing grantees and additional grants to new recipients. Payments under a grant shall not exceed 5 years. Failure to use funds properly may result in remittance of 80% of the grant amount. The Secretary will evaluate grant activities and submit reports to Congress within specified timelines. The Secretary will submit a final report to Congress on the evaluation of the nurse educator program within 6 months of its completion. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on increasing participation in the program, including an examination of nursing schools' capacity and sustainability options for continuing programs. The final report will include an examination of successful doctoral degree programs in nursing faculty placement, program design impact on faculty retention, compensation disparities, and recommendations to enhance faculty retention and the nursing workforce. Authorization of appropriations is also included for program costs. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the costs of carrying out the section, with specific amounts allocated for fiscal years 2006 to 2010. Administrative costs, including evaluation and reporting, are also authorized for the same fiscal years."
