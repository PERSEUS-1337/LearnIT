    "content": "This report discusses how international terrorists and insurgents use the Internet for their political agendas, focusing on terrorist information operations in cyberspace. It also touches on the government's response to these activities. Information warfare involves using technology to influence adversaries, with a key area being cyberspace. This report focuses on how terrorists use the Internet, particularly jihadist websites, to spread their ideology and recruit followers. Al Qaeda and other violent Islamist groups leverage the Quran and Islamic religious texts to justify their actions. Al Qaeda and other violent Islamist groups use the Internet for recruiting and propaganda, leveraging the Quran and historical events. Extremists utilize various online platforms for recruitment, organization, training, and fundraising through cybercrime. YouTube channels and Facebook pages of Taliban and Al Qaeda supporters can radicalize sympathizers and facilitate communication between individuals and larger terrorist networks. The Internet is used by both \"lone wolf\" actors and organized terrorist networks for coordinating attacks and sharing coded plans. Arabic-language websites provide instructions on building weapons and evading law enforcement. Cybercrime, including Ponzi schemes and identity theft, is now a major source of terrorist financing, surpassing international drug trafficking. Cybercrime, including Ponzi schemes and identity theft, is a major source of terrorist financing. Terrorist organizations may use the Internet for funding and coordinating attacks. Some believe that the term \"cyberterrorism\" is inappropriate as cyberattacks may not instill terror like traditional weapons. Cyberterrorism is defined by the effects of computer attacks causing disruption, fear, and civilian deaths comparable to traditional terrorism. It can be effects-based, generating fear, or intent-based, politically motivated attacks to intimidate or coerce. Al Qaeda leaders have acknowledged the importance of media in their battle. Terrorist organizations utilize the Internet to spread propaganda, recruit operatives, and promote their cause. They maintain websites with graphic content, lists of martyrs, and forums for discussing ideology. Groups like the Quetta Shura Taliban and Al Qaeda Central distribute multimedia products online through various platforms. Inspire, an English-language terrorist propaganda magazine, is a recent example of online extremist content. The English-language terrorist propaganda periodical Inspire is linked to Al Qaeda in Yemen and features articles by Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical imam known for inspiring terrorist plots such as the Times Square bombing and the Fort Hood shooting. Al-Awlaki's online lectures have influenced individuals like Faisal Shahzad, who attempted a car bomb in Times Square. Some experts question the authenticity of Inspire. Some experts question the authenticity of the periodical Inspire and its link to Al Qaeda. The effectiveness of violent images used to reach its mainstream target audience is debated, as they may only appeal to a small segment of the population. Websites associated with Al Qaeda provide instructions on building and detonating weapons, including cyber weapons and kinetic weapons like bombs. These sites also offer tools for launching cyberattacks to overwhelm targeted websites. The Internet is used for transmitting information and material support for terrorism. Cybercrime has increased, with terrorist events funded through online credit card fraud. Extremist hackers use identity theft and credit card fraud to support terrorist activities. Terrorist groups may hire cybercriminals through underground digital chat rooms. Reports suggest that terrorists in the Middle East and South Asia are collaborating with cybercriminals for money laundering, arms smuggling, and drug trafficking. This partnership allows terrorists to enhance their computer skills and gain access to skilled programmers. While terrorists excel in online propaganda, their offensive cyber capabilities are limited, with attacks mainly consisting of unsophisticated methods like email bombing and denial-of-service attacks. The FBI warns that terrorists are increasingly using the internet for communication, planning, recruitment, and financial support. They may also be looking into cyberattacks on U.S. critical infrastructure. A future targeted cyberattack on U.S. critical infrastructure could be effective if timed to coincide with a physical or chemical terrorist attack. The objectives may include loss of integrity and availability of information systems. A terrorist cyberattack aims to disrupt critical information systems through unavailability, loss of confidentiality, and physical harm. Publicity is a key objective, as media coverage highlights the vulnerability of U.S. infrastructure. Even a marginally successful attack could lead to widespread disruption and concern among citizens. Reports of a recent disruptive computer worm spreading through government networks, possibly linked to a Libyan hacker group with intentions to penetrate U.S. agencies. The Stuxnet worm, a piece of malware targeting industrial control systems, has raised concerns about future cyberattacks. While the worm's code has been found, it does not conclusively prove involvement as email addresses can be spoofed. The sophistication of Stuxnet suggests nation-state involvement, but the code has been released, potentially enabling others to develop similar capabilities. The U.S. government organizations monitor terrorist websites and conduct activities to counter them. Information on these organizations is classified. They are responsible for monitoring and infiltrating jihadist websites. The U.S. government organizations, including the CIA, NSA, DOD, DOJ, and FBI, conduct surveillance and analysis of terrorist websites to counter terrorism-related activities. This includes monitoring, rendering websites inaccessible, and developing policies for interacting within these websites. The FBI and DHS monitor websites for possible terrorist threats to U.S. security interests. Other federal agencies focus on cybersecurity, policy development, and coordination efforts. Information gathered may be used to advise non-federal entities on safeguarding against online jihadist forums. The FBI and DHS monitor websites for possible terrorist threats related to international jihadist activity that pose a threat to U.S. security interests. These websites are used for spreading propaganda, recruiting new members, communicating plans counter to U.S. interests, and facilitating terrorist-related activities. Monitoring these websites can provide early indicators of extremist elements within the jihadist community. For example, increased chatter on international jihadist websites was observed following a controversy in the United States regarding the proposed burning of copies of the Quran on the ninth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks. The FBI disseminated an intelligence bulletin regarding online threats to the pastor and church planning the event, as well as more general threats to U.S. global security. The federal government assesses whether to monitor, infiltrate, or shut down websites inciting harmful actions against U.S. security interests. Factors include ownership by a U.S. corporation, participation of U.S. citizens, and adherence to constitutional rights. If a suspected jihadist website is confirmed to facilitate terrorism, national security may consider various responses like shutting it down permanently or temporarily. The federal government considers options for responding to websites inciting harmful actions, such as shutting down the website permanently or temporarily, monitoring for intelligence, or covertly engaging members for information gathering. Interagency consensus is needed before action, and there are discussions about establishing a monitoring database for government and private networks, but privacy concerns and questions about DOD's role in cybersecurity make implementation unlikely. A memorandum of agreement between DHS and DOD aims to increase cooperation. The memorandum of agreement signed in October 2010 between DHS and DOD aims to enhance coordination in protecting civilian critical infrastructure and military networks. DOD may play a larger role in defending privately owned critical infrastructure using DHS's EINSTEIN 2 and 3 network monitoring systems. The terms \"strategic communications,\" \"public diplomacy,\" \"global engagement,\" \"information operations,\" and \"propaganda\" are often used interchangeably, causing confusion in programmatic activities. There is no overarching definition of strategic communications for the federal government. The U.S. Government focuses on understanding and engaging key audiences to advance its interests through coordinated programs and messages. The Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications and the Senior Director for Global Engagement oversee this process. The Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications and the Senior Director for Global Engagement oversee the coordination of strategic communication efforts within the U.S. Government, ensuring that message-value and communicative impact are considered in decision-making by the National Security Council and Homeland Security Council. Public Diplomacy within the State Department is led by the Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, distinguishing between Public Affairs and Public Diplomacy in promoting the national interest of the United States. The Department of Defense (DOD) utilizes strategic communication to promote the national interest of the United States by engaging foreign publics and fostering mutual understanding. This involves integrating capabilities such as Information Operations (IO), Psychological Operations (PSYOP), Public Affairs (PA), Defense Support to Public Diplomacy (DSPD), Military Diplomacy (MD), and Visual Information (VI) to synchronize efforts that enhance U.S. credibility, influence adversary credibility, and persuade audiences to support U.S. objectives. The Department of Defense (DOD) supports national objectives through Defense Support to Public Diplomacy (DSPD). Government policies are adapting to utilize social media like Facebook and Twitter for strategic communications, despite concerns about terrorist misuse. Social media can be exploited by terrorist groups to spread propaganda and malware, enabling quick organization and action. The Department of Defense has banned certain social networking sites due to security concerns, but the federal government is now using these tools to spread democratic values and combat misinformation. In 2010, DOD issued a memo outlining a new social media policy, which is set to expire in 2011 with no plans for a replacement. Some worry that the WikiLeaks issue may lead to more restricted internet access. The recent WikiLeaks issue may lead to more restricted internet access and less information sharing between organizations. The U.S. Air Force and U.S. Central Command have been developing deceptive online identities to gather information about potential adversaries. Critics are concerned about the potential loss of credibility in these programs. Critics are concerned about the potential loss of credibility in information operations, citing the example of the former Office of Strategic Influence (OSI) planting false news stories. Information operations also include computer network operations (CNO) such as cyberattack capabilities and cyber defense. Various military units have responsibilities for DOD cybersecurity. The DOD Cyber Command and JIOWC are responsible for defense against cyberattacks. JIOWC coordinates military information operations, while JTF-GNO defends the Global Information Grid. JIOWC assists combatant commands with information operations like operations security, military deception, and electronic warfare. They also handle computer network operations and network warfare, which will fall under US Cyber Command, led by General Keith Alexander. General Keith Alexander, who heads USCYBERCOM and NSA, oversees information assurance, signals intelligence, and offensive cyber operations. USCYBERCOM integrates defensive and offensive cyber capabilities under one command, emphasizing the importance of offensive cyber operations for defense. The classified nature of USCYBERCOM's capabilities raises questions about their authorities and operations. Questions have been raised in the executive branch and Congress regarding the authorities and oversight of cyber operations. The Senate Armed Services Committee discovered that the Department of Defense (DOD) had not included cyber operations in its quarterly report on clandestine military activities. The nominee for Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence clarified that the reporting requirements only related to human intelligence. Discussions continue on how USCYBERCOM and NSA relate to each other and the private sector, which owns most of the U.S. telecommunications infrastructure. While USCYBERCOM is developing defensive plans for the .mil domain, there is still no unified federal response policy for coordinating offensive cyber operations at the national level. Collaboration between DOD, DHS, and the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center is ongoing. The Department of Defense (DOD) has been collaborating with DHS and the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center to develop a National Cyber Incident Response Plan. USCYBERCOM Chief of Staff Major General David Senty mentioned that the command might lead in defending military networks before handing over to U.S. Northern Command. Challenges in countering violent extremists online include conflicting interpretations of laws and competing agency interests. Some organizations may lack the technical capability to fulfill their mission despite having legislative and policy authority. Entities with the capacity to address cyber attacks may be legally constrained due to privacy concerns. Tensions exist between the Global Internet Freedom Initiative and counterterrorism objectives. Lack of clarity in definitions related to information operations and terrorism raises questions about federal government coordination. The effectiveness of U.S. government's strategic communications is hindered by the Smith-Mundt Act. The Smith-Mundt Act directs that information intended for foreign audiences should not be disseminated within the United States. Amendments in 1972 and 1998 clarified legal obligations, with presidential directives setting up structures and procedures. Some argue that these policies create a barrier between domestic and foreign audiences, limiting information distribution to counter extremists in cyberspace. The global nature of cyberspace makes it challenging to target specific regions, effectively imposing a ban on government actions. Some critics argue that the Smith-Mundt Act creates a barrier between domestic and foreign audiences, limiting information distribution to counter extremists in cyberspace. There are questions over what constitutes propaganda and confusion over information operations programs within the DOD. PSYOP, focused on influencing foreign attitudes, is often misunderstood and its budgetary process and management are questioned. The Public Affairs Office (PAO) works with media outlets to \"inform\" rather than \"influence\" in a manner favorable to U.S. objectives. The term \"propaganda\" has been replaced with Military Information Support Operations (MISO) to avoid negative connotations. The name change was approved by the Secretary of Defense in June 2010. Some see it as elevating the importance of information support, while others view it as a source of pride for PSYOP servicemembers. The January 2011 DOD memorandum acknowledges the focus on countering violent extremism and global networks through strategic communications and information operations. It outlines organizational changes for better integration and coordination, placing the JIOWC under the Joint Staff. New requirements for resource managers to track MISO costs and develop budget methodologies are in response to congressional concerns about military propaganda spending. The Department of Defense Appropriations Acts from FY2002 to FY2010 prohibit the use of funds for unauthorized publicity or propaganda. Title 10 of the United States Code allows combatant commanders to conduct psychological operations in support of military missions, but does not define PSYOP or clarify DOD's authority for information operations. Some private citizens, like Shannen Rossmiller, have assisted in gathering information on potential terrorist suspects, leading to arrests. Shannen Rossmiller, a self-taught private citizen, assists in gathering information on potential terrorist suspects, leading to arrests. Rita Katz of SITE Institute also provides intelligence from online extremist chat rooms to government officials. The nature and use of the shared information by intelligence agencies remain undisclosed. Operational capabilities to counter jihadist websites are determined by the balance between intelligence value and threat level. The CIA and Saudi Arabian government created a \"honey pot\" jihadist website to monitor terrorist activities. Intelligence analysts used the collected information to track jihadists' plans, leading to arrests. However, the website was also used to transmit operational plans for attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq. Debates among intelligence agencies led to the decision to dismantle the website due to the greater threat to troops than the intelligence value gained. This raised questions about the authority and classification of computer network attacks on websites. The operation to target and dismantle the honey pot jihadist website inadvertently disrupted servers in Saudi Arabia, Germany, and Texas, highlighting the risk of collateral damage in a networked world. There are debates on the futility of offensive attacks on websites as dismantled sites can easily be relocated. The 2010 National Security Strategy emphasizes the importance of the Internet for commerce and cybersecurity but lacks a specific strategy for combating violent extremism online. Hearings have been held to address this issue, with efforts to form a new Strategic approach. Members of the House of Representatives formed the Strategic Communications and Public Diplomacy Caucus to address challenges in communication. They introduced the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2010 to allow the dissemination of foreign influence products domestically. Another bill, the Protection of Cyberspace as a National Asset Act, has sparked discussions on internet protection. The \"Internet Kill Switch\" debate in Congress questions the President's authority to disconnect the U.S. from the internet during crises. Critics fear it infringes on freedom of speech, while others worry about economic consequences. The bill's sponsors argue existing laws allow the President to compel ISPs to suspend service. The Cybersecurity and Internet Freedom Act of 2011 aims to limit presidential emergency powers over the Internet by amending the Communications Act of 1934. The proposal states that no government official shall have the authority to shut down the Internet. The Communications Decency Act of 1996 was created to regulate indecency and obscenity online, particularly concerning lewd or pornographic material. YouTube's terms of use prohibit lewd, violent, and hateful content, which is monitored through a user-feedback system. However, Section 230 of the CDA protects ISPs and Internet administrators from liability for third-party content. In September 2010, General Alexander mentioned the White House leading an effort to review the legal framework for operations in cyberspace and telecommunications infrastructure protection. The review will provide Congress with legislative recommendations for new statutes or revisions to facilitate effective cyberspace operations, as outlined in the 2011 National Military Strategy."
