    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 23151 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to adjust the tax rates for corporations doing business in California. The tax rate is set at 7.6 percent for most corporations, with exceptions for banks and financial corporations. However, for years after 1973, the rate increases to 9 percent, and for years between 1980 to 1986, the rate is 9.6 percent. For income years starting in 1987 to 1996, the tax rate is 9.3%. From January 1, 1997, onwards, the rate is 8.84%. Starting in 2000, the tax imposed is 8.84% of net income, with a minimum tax specified in Section 23153. The tax rate for income years starting in 2000 is 8.84% of net income, with a minimum tax specified in Section 23153. For taxable years starting on or after January 1, 2015, the tax imposed on publicly held corporations will be based on net income at varying rates determined by the compensation ratio. The tax rates range from 7% to 10% based on different income thresholds. For taxable years starting on or after January 1, 2015, the tax rates for publicly held corporations are based on net income at varying rates determined by the compensation ratio. The rates range from 7% to 13% based on different income thresholds. The compensation ratio for a taxable year is calculated based on the total compensation of the chief operating officer or highest paid employee compared to the median compensation of all employees in the United States. For taxpayers included in a combined report, the compensation ratio is calculated by treating them as a single entity. A contracted employee is defined as someone who works for a labor contractor, who supplies workers to perform labor for a client employer. Taxpayers subject to this rule must provide a detailed compensation report to the Franchise Tax Board with their original return. If a taxpayer in the United States reduces full-time employees by more than 10% compared to the previous year and increases contracted or foreign full-time employees, the tax rate will be increased by 50%. This applies to new businesses in the state as well. In the state, if the number of full-time employees is reduced by more than 10% compared to the previous year and contracted or foreign full-time employees are increased, the tax rate will be increased by 50%. For tax purposes, \"annual full-time equivalent\" is calculated based on hours worked by hourly or salaried employees. A \"foreign full-time employee\" is someone employed by the taxpayer outside the US. A \"full-time employee\" is defined as someone paid for at least 30 hours of work per week. The Franchise Tax Board may establish rules for determining wages and compensation for full-time employees. This act constitutes a tax levy and will take immediate effect."
