    "content": "The U.S.-Colombian relations have been heavily influenced by counternarcotics policy since the 1980s due to Colombia's role as a major source of illicit drugs. Colombia became the dominant global cocaine producer in the late 1990s, surpassing Peru and Bolivia. Concern over the crack cocaine epidemic in the U.S. led to increased focus on Colombia as a drug source. Colombia also became a significant supplier of heroin to the U.S. market. U.S. efforts to assist Colombia were driven by alarm over the high volumes of cocaine and heroin being exported to the United States. The United States and Colombia have a close security partnership that began with Plan Colombia in 2000. This partnership aimed to enhance security, fight drugs and terrorism, and strengthen Colombia's democratic development. Over $10 billion in foreign assistance was provided between FY2000 and FY2016. The strategy had bipartisan support in Congress and backing from both Democratic and Republican Administrations. The FARC, a designated foreign terrorist organization, funds itself through drug trafficking in Colombia. They took control of the coca crop by dominating the countryside and taxing traffickers. This involvement in the drug trade began with levying protection fees on various players in the industry. In 2012, the Colombian government initiated peace talks with the FARC, receiving praise for efforts to resolve the armed conflict. In 2016, President Obama's Administration proposed the Peace Colombia initiative, requesting $450 million for post-peace accord cooperation, including aid to reduce drug production and trafficking. Congress finalized foreign operations appropriations for FY2017 in May. In May, Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31) funding Peace Colombia at $391.3 million. Trump Administration proposed reducing foreign aid for Colombia in FY2018 to $251 million. House passed H.R. 3354 in August, funding bilateral programs for Colombia at $335.9 million for FY2018. Congressional passage of a continuing resolution through December 8, 2017, may be followed by another temporary CR before determining the remainder of FY2018 foreign operations funding for Colombia. Peace accord between Colombian government and FARC signed in November 2016 after four years of peace talks. The Colombian government renegotiated a peace accord with FARC after the initial agreement was defeated in a referendum. The revised accord was approved by Congress in late November 2016. In 2017, the government began implementing the revised accord and demobilizing FARC forces under UN monitoring. Colombia saw a significant increase in cocaine production in 2016 during the peace talks. The government also announced a new approach to drug policy. The Colombian government, in response to the FARC peace accord, implemented a new drug policy strategy. The FARC submitted lists of members in disarmament zones, with over 11,200 members demobilized according to the International Crisis Group. Some estimates suggest the number could exceed 12,000. Some FARC members refuse to disarm, linked to drug trade, rejected by central leadership. Others disillusioned with government, leaving peace process. 5-10% of disarmed FARC members in 2017 returned to illicit activities. Colombian authorities also dealing with criminal groups like Bacrim, aiming to control drug trafficking routes. The Bacrim criminal groups are trying to take over FARC drug routes for cocaine trafficking. The ELN, another rebel group heavily involved in the drug trade, has started peace talks with the Santos government. The ELN's negotiations focus on the participation of society in peacebuilding. In October 2017, the ELN and Santos government initiated a temporary ceasefire, the first ever between them. President Santos began peace talks with the FARC in October 2012, leading to agreements on various topics over four years. One critical issue was controlling illegal crops and drug trafficking, a major FARC income source. In May 2014, a partial agreement was reached between the FARC and the Colombian government on controlling illegal crops and drug trafficking, a key source of FARC income. This agreement remained largely unchanged in the final peace accord concluded in November 2016. Government negotiators reached a partial agreement with FARC on drug-related issues, committing to eradicate coca and combat drug trafficking in guerrilla-controlled territories. The agreement, titled \"The Solution to the Problem of Illicit Drugs,\" covered coca eradication, crop substitution, public health, drug consumption, and production. Key points included FARC acknowledging its ties to the drug business, assisting with demining for safer eradication, and cooperating to resolve the drug problem. The Colombian government agreed to prioritize voluntary crop eradication and implement a crop substitution program. The government committed to a crop substitution and alternative development program in line with the rural development accord reached in May 2013 at the peace talks. They also agreed to provide public health programs to prevent addiction and treat drug consumption as a public health issue. In December 2015, the FARC and the Colombian government redefined drug trafficking as a connected crime to the political act of insurgency in a final partial accord. The FARC and the Colombian government redefined drug trafficking as a political crime connected to insurgency, making it eligible for amnesty under the accord. The cessation of aerial spraying in Colombia was seen as a concession to the FARC during negotiations. Concerns arose about FARC combatants joining criminal groups post-disarmament, potentially leading to rival criminal groups taking control of drug production and trafficking routes. The Santos government ended glyphosate spraying on coca crops in 2015. The peace accord allows for potential aerial eradication in the future as a last resort. The focus is now on voluntary crop eradication and substitution, along with interdiction efforts, to reduce drug supply. The Colombian government shifted its counternarcotics strategy in 2015 towards a public health framework, focusing on interdiction, organized crime, and alternative development. This approach includes adopting \"harm reduction\" drug policy rhetoric to reduce human rights violations. Policymakers in Europe and the Western Hemisphere support this reform approach. The Colombian government introduced a new drug policy approach in 2015, focusing on alternative development and crop substitution to combat illicit drug production. Following a finding that the herbicide used for coca aerial spraying may cause cancer, the practice was discontinued. The new counternarcotics strategy aims to reduce drug-related crime, combat drug production supply chain links, and promote social and economic development in cultivation zones. The Colombian government introduced a new drug policy approach in 2015, focusing on alternative development and crop substitution to combat illicit drug production. President Santos outlined a strategy including social investment, crop substitution, enhanced interdiction, and demand reduction. This strategy aimed to reduce drug-related crime, promote social and economic development, and emphasize public health and human rights. The new drug strategy in Colombia, introduced in 2015, included the closure of the aerial eradication program using glyphosate. Instead, a new Agency for Alternative Development in Zones of Illicit Cultivation was established to assist coca growers. Eduardo D\u00edaz Uribe was appointed as the first director of the agency, reporting directly to the President of Colombia. In February 2017, the Colombian government launched a program to replace illicit coca crops with legal crops. The goal was to replace 50,000 hectares of coca with legal crops and provide one-time payments to coca farmers for food security and income alternatives. By May 2017, agreements were made with 100,000 families covering 90,000 hectares of coca, but actual crop removal was lower than expected. Analysts predict that voluntary coca removal may fall short of the annual goal by the end of 2017. The Colombian government launched a program in February 2017 to replace illicit coca crops with legal crops. Families cultivating coca can voluntarily eradicate their crops in exchange for development support and land title after five years. Forced manual eradication is used for non-compliance. A special strategy targets drug cultivation in national parks and protected territories. The Ministry of Health leads a health-focused prevention approach with 10 other federal entities contributing to the National Plan for Use Prevention and Care. President Santos has aligned Colombia's drug strategy with harm-reduction approaches, criticizing traditional counternarcotics tactics. He emphasizes the high cost of ineffective antidrug policies and the need for new approaches. The success of Colombia's new strategy hinges on implementing the peace accord. The State Department's report highlighted the Colombian government's efforts to implement the peace accord with the FARC, emphasizing the uncertainty of the FARC's involvement post-demobilization. President Santos envisioned a post-conflict environment where the demobilized FARC would assist in eradicating illicit crops and fighting against drugs. The Santos Administration's counterdrug strategy in Colombia emphasizes health and harm reduction approaches, enhanced interdiction, and economic programs for crop substitution. Despite declines in coca cultivation from 2007 to 2012, cultivation has been increasing again, reaching 159,000 ha in 2015. Many analysts doubt that this will mark the end of drug production and trafficking in Colombia. Colombia's coca cultivation increased, driving higher cocaine production in 2015. Eradication efforts declined in 2013 due to various reasons, including the suspension of the U.S.-supported spray program and security challenges. In 2013, Ecuador won a settlement over spray drift effects from Colombia. Despite efforts, Colombia became top cocaine producer again in 2014. Both U.S. and UN reported a significant increase in coca cultivation in Colombia in 2014 and 2015. The jump in illicit drug-crop cultivation, mainly coca, in Colombia in 2014 and 2015 led to a surge in cocaine production. In 2015, the UNODC reported 96,000 ha of coca cultivated, resulting in 646 mt of potential pure cocaine, a 46% increase. U.S. estimates indicated that coca cultivation peaked at 188,000 hectares in 2016, with a significant growth in potential cocaine production. In 2015, 37,199 ha were aerially eradicated and 14,267 ha were eradicated by hand in Colombia. In 2016, 17,642 ha of coca crops were manually eradicated. There are concerns about the increase in cultivation and production, with questions on how the Colombian government will address this. U.S. policymakers are worried about Colombia's drug production in light of the peace accord with the FARC and changes to the counternarcotics strategy. Colombia's manual eradication budget has decreased significantly since 2008. The Colombian government has seen a significant decline in manual eradication budget and manpower since 2008. However, in 2017, they trained 20,000 army troops for eradication efforts. The U.S. has historically relied on crop eradication to combat drug production, but eradication policies have been controversial in Colombia. Plan Colombia included both manual and aerial eradication methods. The Colombian government has seen a decline in manual eradication efforts since 2008. Aerial eradication by spray planes was controversial due to potential health and environmental risks. Despite reduced emphasis by the Obama Administration, roughly 24% of the counternarcotics budget went to eradication in FY2015. Colombia shifted focus to coca eradication after a decline in opium crops. The Colombian government shifted eradication efforts to focus on coca between 2007 and 2012, but the downward trend in drug cultivation was not sustained. Factors contributing to increased coca cultivation from 2014 to 2016 include FARC's influence on farmers, decreased eradication efforts, and fluctuating gold prices. In recent years, fluctuating gold prices influenced FARC's shift between illegal mining and coca production. The Colombian government's decision to end glyphosate spraying and adopt a new drug policy in 2015 may have also contributed to increased drug cultivation. Illicit crop farmers and drug producers are using more sophisticated tactics to evade eradication efforts. Policymakers in Colombia and the United States need to evaluate the revised counternarcotics strategy focusing on rural development. The revised counternarcotics strategy in Colombia focuses on rural development, enhanced law enforcement, and public health to control the surge in cocaine production. Colombian policymakers believe that manual eradication, alternative livelihoods programs, and enhanced interdiction can compensate for the elimination of aerial spraying. However, manual eradication may be costly and challenging due to land mines and insecurity in some areas. Alternative livelihoods programs are long-term efforts with delayed results. Aerial or manual eradication alone is not an effective drug-control strategy. The Colombian government promotes interdiction as a key element of its counternarcotics policy, committing to enhancing its role. Efforts include drug seizures, tracking illegal drug flights, capturing transportation used for drug conveyance, dismantling drug labs, and capturing trafficking leaders. Colombia accounted for 56% of cocaine seizures in South America according to the United Nations. In 2016, Colombia seized 421 mt of cocaine and cocaine base, showing strong collaboration with the United States in counternarcotics operations. Analysts predict Colombian interdiction will play a crucial role in reducing outbound flows of cocaine to the United States. Rural development in regions prone to illicit crop cultivation may take decades to succeed. Many analysts suggest that Colombia's underdeveloped rural areas need resources to address poverty caused by lack of land access, infrastructure, and government presence. Plan Colombia included drug-crop eradication and alternative development programs funded by USAID, with limited success. The peace accord with FARC also plays a role in rural development efforts. The Colombian government, in collaboration with the FARC, implemented an alternative development program in Brice\u00f1o, Antioquia, to promote planting alternative crops and reduce coca cultivation. USAID projects like ADAM and MIDAS aimed to provide economic options for poor farmers by supporting smaller-scale, licit crops such as cacao and specialty coffee. In collaboration with the Colombian government, USAID's ADAM and MIDAS projects failed to provide secure alternate livelihoods for coca farmers, leading to criticism for not reaching those involved in coca cultivation. Colombia's Plan de Consolidaci\u00f3n Integral de la Macarena (PCIM) pilot program, supported by USAID, relied on military and police for coca eradication. The PCIM program in Colombia relied on military and police for coca eradication, with additional programs providing cash transfers to disadvantaged groups. Despite initial success in reducing coca cultivation, the program faced challenges due to bureaucratic issues within the government agency overseeing it. The PCIM program in Colombia faced challenges in alternative development due to ongoing war insecurity and the Uribe government's \"zero coca\" policy, which required complete eradication of illicit crops before receiving support. This posed a significant challenge to impoverished coca farmers, leaving them without provisions to feed themselves. The FARC is viewed as a terrorist group by most Colombians. The FARC in Colombia is seen as a terrorist group that funded itself through illicit activities like drug trafficking and kidnapping. With FARC combatants demobilizing, other armed groups are now eyeing the lucrative criminal enterprise. Colombia has a history of illegal groups benefiting from narcotics trafficking, including large cartels like the Medellin Cartel and insurgent groups like the FARC and ELN. In the 1990s, the Self Defense Forces of Colombia emerged, along with new criminal organizations known as cartelitos. After the demobilization of the FARC, paramilitaries and their successors are now vying to fill the void in the narcotics trade. Some former paramilitaries regrouped into criminal groups called Bacrim, potentially competing to dominate trafficking routes previously controlled by the FARC. The emergence of criminal groups called Bacrim, particularly Los Urabe\u00f1os, dominated by former paramilitaries, became a major target of enforcement by the Santos government. Despite efforts to prevent them from taking over former FARC territory, Los Urabe\u00f1os have shown intent to replace FARC in some areas and recruit former FARC combatants. The challenge remains on how to prevent other armed groups from seizing FARC's illegal drug businesses and criminal enterprises in a post-accord situation. The ELN began peace talks with the Santos government in 2017, but public support for the peace process with leftist guerrillas remains mixed. Analysts warn that some FARC members may return to criminal activities, posing a future challenge. The upcoming national elections in Colombia in 2018 could impact the peace efforts. In 2018, Colombia's partnership with the United States expanded beyond counternarcotics to include social and economic programs. Plan Colombia and its successor programs, with bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress, focused on economic stability, human rights, decreased violence, and increased investment and trade. Initially part of the Andean Counterdrug Initiative, Plan Colombia also funded programs in neighboring countries. Many observers saw Plan Colombia as a model for U.S. foreign policy in the region, focusing on state capacity building and counterterrorism. However, its success in drug-control policy was limited. With the implementation of the peace accord with the FARC, the U.S. Congress may evaluate the newer \"post-Plan Colombia\" counterdrug approach, including issues like eradication of drug crops and interdiction. The final peace accord with the FARC, ratified in November 2016, reintroduced aerial spraying for drug eradication as a last resort. Policymakers may also consider alternative development strategies. Policymakers may assess the costs and effectiveness of alternative development and enhanced interdiction as voluntary methods prove unsuccessful in countering drug trafficking. Key questions include the potential for a violent battle of succession among criminal groups, expanding Colombia's role in regional counternarcotics efforts, and the alignment of U.S. and Colombian drug control objectives. Additionally, the synchronization of counternarcotics appropriations by the 115th Congress with a newer Colombian counterdrug strategy is crucial. Colombia received $87.7 million in FY2016 for counternarcotics assistance, with the Obama Administration seeking further funding in FY2017. The Obama Administration's budget request for FY2017 included $95 million in counternarcotics assistance to Colombia for reducing drug production and combating organized crime. USAID's Economic Support Fund also provided $30 million for alternative development efforts. INL adjusted its counternarcotics efforts to align with Colombia's post-FARC drug policy objectives. The State Department shifted funding from aerial eradication to other counternarcotics activities in Colombia post-FARC. Key areas of counternarcotics programming include enhanced interdiction, rural police support, manual eradication, environmental monitoring, and aviation. INL is repurposing aircraft for drug-related detection and monitoring, including fitting some with cameras for real-time imagery. Congress has provided DOD with counternarcotics authorities. The Department of Defense (DOD) has counternarcotics authorities to support Colombia with training, equipment, and other assistance for counterdrug purposes. The FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act revised DOD's authorities for security cooperation, including counterdrug efforts. The impact of these changes on DOD's support to Colombia for counternarcotics purposes is still uncertain. The FY2017 NDAA provisions aimed to simplify and enhance the legal framework for DOD security cooperation. Analysts are assessing if these reforms will affect DOD's authority and funding for counterdrug activities. Congress authorized DOD to use counternarcotics funds for a unified campaign against narcotics trafficking and terrorism in Colombia. The FY2018 NDAA extended the authority for U.S. personnel in Colombia to FY2022. There were discussions on potential changes to DOD's authority if the FARC were delisted as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, but modifications to support other armed groups did not pass. The FY2018 NDAA extended the authority for U.S. personnel in Colombia to FY2022. Discussions on potential changes to DOD's authority if the FARC were delisted as a Foreign Terrorist Organization did not pass. Uncertainty remains on how resources and activities in Colombia would be adjusted if the FARC is delisted, especially with talks starting with the ELN. The U.S.-Colombia Action Plan on Regional Security Cooperation, announced in 2012, focuses on combating organized crime, counternarcotics programs, and strengthening legal institutions. The U.S.-Colombia Action Plan focuses on capacity building for security personnel in Central America and the Caribbean. Colombia conducted numerous activities from 2013 to 2016, training over 11,000 security personnel from Panama, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and the Dominican Republic. Colombia has trained over 30,000 security personnel from 70 countries, with a focus on combating crime and terrorism. Critics raise concerns about human rights issues and lack of transparency in U.S.-funded trainings. Colombia's highly trained security forces are seen as valuable assets in combating drug trafficking and crime in the region. In late 2017, Colombian Vice President proposed creating a naval task force to enhance maritime drug interdiction efforts during a meeting with U.S. officials. Colombia's strategy aims to increase interdiction efforts on the high seas, speedboats, and semi-submersibles in the Pacific, and control fluvial access to the ocean. Discussions with U.S. officials included commitments to raise drug interdiction levels and advance the removal of illicit crops. The success of Colombia's drug strategy may hinge on the implementation of the peace accord with FARC, which involves various development programs impacting political stability, economic growth, and crime management. The FARC and other armed groups in Colombia financed themselves with drug profits and other illicit businesses. The Colombian drug trade is expected to continue meeting large international, especially U.S., drug demand. Other Colombian drug traffickers are trying to replace the FARC, which once controlled a significant portion of Colombia's coca-growing areas and trafficking routes. Post-accord and post-conflict development programs in Colombia could take over a decade and cost up to $42 billion. Colombia faces challenges in funding post-accord peace programs, including reparations and justice system modernization, costing up to $42 billion. The 2018 national elections may impact drug policy and peace process opposition. Achieving peace is difficult with low reserves and a weakened currency. The challenges in Colombia include funding post-accord peace programs, addressing social issues in violence-prone areas, and the need for external financial support for sustainable alternative livelihood programs. Observers emphasize the importance of addressing legal, security, and social conditions for successful crop substitution."
