    "content": "The \"Hospital Price Transparency and Disclosure Act of 2016\" requires public disclosure of hospital data, including data reporting by hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers for public posting. The \"Hospital Price Transparency and Disclosure Act of 2016\" mandates hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers to report data to the Secretary every semiannual period regarding treatment episodes provided in inpatient or outpatient settings. The Act requires hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers to report data on treatment episodes, including total number of episodes, average charges for insured and uninsured individuals, and frequency of occurrence for ambulatory surgical centers. During each treatment episode, a center must report the total number of episodes, average charges for insured and uninsured individuals, and frequency of occurrence. The Secretary will post data on the official website regarding charges for treatment episodes at hospitals and centers, promoting charge comparison among facilities. Hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers must post notices of data availability for treatment episodes on their admission sites. The Secretary will identify treatment episodes for the most frequently treated conditions in both inpatient and outpatient settings. The Secretary will select the 100 most frequently treated conditions and diseases in hospital outpatient and ambulatory surgical center settings. The Institute of Medicine may help define treatment episodes for these conditions. The list of selected conditions will be periodically updated. The Secretary has the authority to impose civil money penalties. The Secretary may impose a civil money penalty of up to $10,000 for each knowing violation by a hospital or ambulatory surgical center. Regulations and guidelines will be prescribed to carry out this section, including rules on the classification of treatment episodes and computation of insured individual average charges. For the computation of insured individual average charges, rates negotiated by hospitals or ambulatory surgical centers with the 5 most used health insurance providers are averaged for a treatment episode, including any applicable cost-sharing fees. The 5 most used health insurance providers are determined based on negotiated rates and patient enrollment numbers at hospitals or ambulatory surgical centers. Uninsured individual average charges are computed for specific subsections. The uninsured individual average charge for a treatment episode at a hospital or ambulatory surgical center is calculated as the average total amount charged for care provided to uninsured individuals during a specific period. An uninsured individual is defined as someone without insurance or third-party benefits covering care costs. The regulations and guidelines specify how hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers report data and post notices. State laws regarding disclosure of charges are not preempted. The section does not regulate hospital or surgical center charges. The section defines 'hospital' and 'ambulatory surgical center' for the purpose of regulating charges."
