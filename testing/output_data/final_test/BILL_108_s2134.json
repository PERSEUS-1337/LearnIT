    "content": "The \"Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004\" is also known as the Tribal Forest Protection Act. It aims to protect tribal forest assets. The definitions in this section clarify that \"Federal land\" includes National Forest System land and public lands, while \"Indian forest land\" is defined as per the National Indian Forest Resources Management Act. The Indian Forest Resources Management Act defines terms like \"Indian tribe\" and \"Secretary\" as per the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. The Act grants authority to protect tribal forest assets upon request submission by an Indian tribe to the Secretary. The Secretary may issue public notice for environmental review or entering into an agreement with Indian tribes to carry out activities on protected forest land. Following environmental analysis, the Secretary can enter into agreements with tribes as described. Under an agreement with an Indian tribe, activities can be carried out to achieve land management goals for Federal land bordering or adjacent to Indian forest land under the tribe's jurisdiction. Selection criteria include whether the Indian forest land borders on or is adjacent to land under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service or the Bureau of Land Management. The criteria for approving tribal requests for land management activities include ensuring that the activities do not pose a threat to Indian forest land or tribal communities, are not covered by existing contracts, and involve unique features or circumstances specific to the Indian tribe. If a tribal request is denied, the Secretary must provide notice of the denial. If the Secretary denies a tribal request, a notice of denial may be issued to the Indian tribe, explaining the specific factors and reasons for the denial, suggesting ways to address issues, and proposing a consultation schedule to develop a forest land protection strategy. When entering into an agreement with an Indian tribe, the Secretary may consider best-value basis and tribally-related factors. When considering a proposal from an Indian tribe, specific factors like tribal status, trust status of forest land, cultural affiliation, treaty rights, indigenous knowledge, and landscape features must be taken into account. The proposal from an Indian tribe must consider factors like tribal status, trust status of forest land, cultural affiliation, treaty rights, indigenous knowledge, and landscape features. The proposal should also address vegetation types, working relationships with Federal agencies, and access to the land by tribe members. The Act does not affect the participation of Indian tribes in stewardship agreements or contracting under existing authorities. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress 4 years after the Act's enactment, detailing Indian tribal requests, agreements, and contracts made under the Act."
