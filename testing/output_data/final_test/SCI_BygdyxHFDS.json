    "content": "Exploration is crucial for successful reinforcement learning, but optimal approaches are computationally challenging. Researchers have focused on designing mechanisms for exploration bonuses and intrinsic rewards inspired by natural systems. A strategy is proposed to encode curiosity algorithms as programs in a domain-specific language, enabling RL agents to perform well in new domains. Pruning techniques are developed to make this approach feasible. The approach involves developing pruning techniques and predicting a program's success based on its syntactic properties. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated empirically, showing competitive and generalizable strategies. The RL agent is augmented with a curiosity module that computes a pseudo-reward at every time step to balance exploration and exploitation in reinforcement learning. Techniques of Bayesian decision theory are not scalable for modern deep RL problems with large state and action spaces. Researchers face challenges in designing exploration strategies for RL systems in complex environments with large state and action spaces and sparse rewards. One approach is to use curiosity or intrinsic motivation to augment or replace extrinsic rewards, but hand-designing these strategies is difficult due to the vast space of possibilities. Drawing inspiration from curious behavior in humans and animals, researchers hypothesize that curiosity plays a crucial role in effective long-term learning and behavior. The text discusses the concept of curiosity as a mechanism for encouraging exploration in young humans and animals. It proposes a meta-learning approach to generating curious behavior by dynamically adapting the agent's reward signal. This process involves an outer loop searching for algorithms for generating curiosity and an inner loop performing reinforcement learning using the adapted reward signal. The text discusses optimizing a policy for proxy rewards and the agent's lifetime return through evolutionary search. It relies on foundational reinforcement learning methods but acknowledges the challenge of finding a complete algorithm for the curious learning agent. The internal RL algorithm must handle nonstationary reward signals. In a meta-learning setting, the objective is to find a curiosity module that performs well across a distribution of environments. Meta-RL has been explored for reducing experience needed and efficient exploration in low-diversity environment distributions. In a meta-learning setting, the objective is to find a curiosity module that performs well across a distribution of environments. This paper focuses on meta-reinforcement learning in diverse environments, requiring different techniques for representation and search. Curiosity strategies are represented in a rich, combinatorial space of programs rather than in a fixed-dimensional numeric parameter space. In a meta-learning setting, the objective is to find a curiosity module that performs well across a distribution of environments. This paper focuses on meta-reinforcement learning in diverse environments, represented in a rich, combinatorial space of programs. The language used includes neural networks, gradient-descent mechanisms, learned objective functions, ensembles, buffers, and other regressors, allowing for the discovery of general curiosity-based exploration methods. This approach enables the search over programs with modest computation, addressing the challenge of finding solutions in a complex program space.

The approach includes neural networks, gradient-descent mechanisms, learned objective functions, ensembles, buffers, and other regressors to discover general curiosity-based exploration methods. To address the challenge of finding solutions in a complex program space, strategies are employed to evaluate candidate programs efficiently and predict algorithm performance early in the search process. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated empirically by discovering curiosity strategies similar to those in published literature and competitive novel strategies. In a meta-learning setting, the focus is on finding a curiosity module that performs well across diverse environments. An agent equipped with an RL algorithm receives states and rewards from an environment, continually learning a policy that changes over time to maximize discounted rewards. A curiosity module adds exploration to the policy by accessing state transitions experienced by the agent. The curiosity module induces the agent to maximize rewards by modifying the rewards received by the RL agent. This allows for efficient exploration in the outer environment while the inner RL algorithm acts exploitatively. The goal is to design a curiosity module that maximizes total rewards over a specified number of time-steps or a global goal. The triplet of environment, curiosity module, and agent forms a dynamical system that induces state transitions and learning updates. The curiosity module induces state transitions and learning updates for the environment and the agent to maximize rewards. The objective is to find C that maximizes the expected original reward obtained by the composite system. Mathematical language has been successful in describing phenomena and algorithms with short descriptions, allowing for accurate predictions in various situations. To enhance exploration in a broad range of tasks, curiosity modules are described as general programs in a domain-specific language. These algorithms map history into a proxy reward, inspired by human-designed systems. The curiosity module is decomposed into two components: I generates intrinsic rewards based on experienced transitions, while \u03c7 combines actual and intrinsic rewards to yield the proxy reward. This approach aims to facilitate generalization across tasks. The curiosity module combines intrinsic and actual rewards to generate a proxy reward. The programs are drawn from a basic class consisting of a directed acyclic graph of modules with polymorphically typed inputs and outputs. Input modules have no inputs and output types corresponding to states, actions, or rewards. The pink box represents the loss to be minimized in the curiosity function. It includes buffer and parameter modules, functional modules, and update modules in a directed acyclic graph. The output node in green is considered the output of the entire program. The output node in green is the final output of the program. Input and parameter values are propagated through functional modules, with FIFO buffers and adjustable parameters updated using gradient descent. Most operations are differentiable for gradient propagation, but some like buffers and \"Detach\" are not. Multiple copies of the same agent run simultaneously with shared policy and curiosity modules, executing reward predictions on a batch. The program uses neural network weight updates via gradient descent as a form of memory. It updates adjustable parameters based on the sum of outputs from loss modules. Different designs for curiosity modules include inverse features, random network distillation, and ensemble predictive variance. The program utilizes neural network weight updates through gradient descent as a memory mechanism. It incorporates various designs for curiosity modules such as inverse features, random network distillation, and ensemble predictive variance. Additionally, the program employs polymorphic data types for inputs and outputs of modules, with instantiation depending on the environment. The program utilizes neural network weight updates through gradient descent as a memory mechanism and incorporates various designs for curiosity modules. It can be applied to different input and output spaces, regardless of whether states are represented as images or vectors, or actions are discrete or continuous. This abstraction enables the meta-learning approach to discover curiosity modules that generalize radically. The program utilizes neural network weight updates through gradient descent as a memory mechanism and incorporates various designs for curiosity modules. Its input is processed by two NNs with parameters \u0398 1 and \u0398 2, generating a 32-dimensional vector output. The intrinsic reward is based on the difference between these outputs, driving the agent to explore new states. The program limits the search space to 7 modules in the computation graph to prioritize short, meaningful programs. The language used is expressive but leads to a large search space, making it challenging to find effective curiosity programs. Strategies are explored to speed up the search process over tens of thousands of programs to work in various environments. Evaluating these programs in expensive environments would require decades of GPU computation. In efforts to speed up the search process for effective curiosity programs, various strategies are employed to quickly discard less promising programs and focus on more potential ones. These strategies include simple tests, filtering out poor-performing programs, and using meta-meta-RL to predict program performance based on syntactic features. Two heuristics are developed to immediately prune obviously bad programs, such as checking for duplicates in the highly expressive language used. To speed up the search for effective curiosity programs, strategies like simple tests and filtering are used. One method involves checking for duplicates by seeding two programs with fake data and comparing their outputs. Another method involves ensuring loss functions cannot be minimized independently of input data. This helps in quickly discarding less promising programs and focusing on more potential ones. The network learns to optimize weights to 0 by disregarding certain elements. The goal is to find algorithms that perform well in various environments. By trying many programs in cheaper environments and only a few in expensive ones, inspired by sequential halving in hyper-parameter optimization, the search focuses on promising candidates. This aggressive pruning may overlook programs that excel in complex environments. The search process aims to find programs that perform well in various environments by predicting program performance directly from program structure. It uses an initial training set to select promising programs to evaluate, encoding each program's structure with features representing the frequency of operations used. A k-nearest neighbor regressor is employed with k = 10 to update and try the most promising programs. The search process uses a k-nearest neighbor regressor with k = 10 to update and try promising programs. An -greedy exploration policy is added to ensure thorough search. Results show that even with moderate correlation (0.54), most top programs are discovered by exploring only half of the program space. Pruning algorithms are used during training to compare candidate program performance with top K programs and stop runs if performance is significantly lower. Our RL agent uses PPO based on the implementation in PyTorch. The code is designed to work with any OpenAI gym environment by specifying the exploration horizon T. Curiosity algorithms are evaluated for multiple trials with shared policy and curiosity modules. Curiosity predictions and updates are batched across rollouts, but not across time. The PPO policy updates are batched across rollouts and multiple timesteps. An intrinsic curiosity program is searched for in an exploratory environment. The environment is an image-based grid world where agents navigate in a 2D room. The goal is to optimize the total number of distinct pixels visited by the agent. Programs with at most 7 operations are searched for and about 52,000 programs are initially considered. After randomly splitting 52,000 programs across 4 machines with Nvidia Tesla K80 GPUs, each machine aims to find the top 625 programs in its search space within 10 hours. Programs with lower learning curve than the top 625 are pruned. Performance is evaluated using a 10-nearest-neighbor regressor, and the next program to evaluate is chosen using an \u03b5-greedy strategy. After randomly splitting 52,000 programs across 4 machines with Nvidia Tesla K80 GPUs, each machine aims to find the top 625 programs in its search space within 10 hours. Performance is evaluated using a 10-nearest-neighbor regressor, and the next program to evaluate is chosen using an \u03b5-greedy strategy, selecting the best predicted program 90% of the time and a random program 10% of the time. This approach allows for trying the most promising programs early in the search, leading to the discovery that most programs perform relatively poorly, with a small percentage of programs showing significantly better performance. The highest scoring program is identified after searching through the space for a total of 13 GPU days. The highest scoring program, named Top, is surprisingly simple and meaningful, consisting of only 5 operations. It uses a single neural network to predict actions and generate high intrinsic reward based on the difference between predictions. This algorithm has not been proposed before, but its simplicity suggests it may have. The program, named Top, is simple and meaningful with only 5 operations. It uses a neural network to predict actions and generate intrinsic rewards based on prediction differences. The network learns to imitate the policy of the internal RL agent. Performance in gridworld correlates with performance in lunar lander and acrobot environments. Most intrinsic curiosity programs that perform well in gridworld also excel in the other two environments. Published works on intrinsic curiosity are compared based on gridworld performance. The top-performing programs in intrinsic curiosity include variations of Top, with some incorporating random network distillation and state-transition prediction. A reward combiner was developed based on the best program from a set of 16,000 programs, resembling Random Network Distillation. Among 2478 candidates, the best reward combiner formula was determined. In future work, the search for intrinsic reward programs and combiners will be co-adapted. Evaluation of 2,000 selected programs on lunar lander and acrobot shows good correlation with performance on the image-based grid world. These new environments have longer horizons and vector-based inputs. The evaluation of 16 best programs on grid world, lunar lander, and acrobot showed promising results. The meta-learned algorithms performed significantly better than constant rewards and were comparable to algorithms found by human researchers. The new environments, hopper and ant in MuJoCo, with longer exploration horizons and continuous action-spaces, were also evaluated. The study evaluated the performance of the top 16 programs on grid world and compared them to weak baselines and published algorithms. Results showed that the top programs performed statistically equivalent to published work and significantly better than weak baselines, indicating successful meta-learning of curiosity programs. The programs were meta-trained on GridWorld but generalized well to other environments. The study evaluated the top 16 programs on GridWorld, showing they generalized well to different environments. Meta-training on a single task gave great results, highlighting broad generalization. The approach is similar to neural architecture search but aims to generalize to many environments. Our work involves searching over programs, including non-neural operations and data structures, to determine loss functions for training. Inspired by AutoML, our algorithms specify their own optimization objectives and work in sync with deep RL algorithms. Previous work includes meta-learning with genetic programming and searching over mathematical operations within neural networks. Our work involves using neural networks as basic operations within larger algorithms, inspired by previous work on searching over programs and optimizing neural network weights. We draw from the idea of using neural network training as an implicit memory and incorporate buffers and nearest-neighbour regressors in our approach. The curr_chunk discusses the scalability of curiosity algorithms to millions of time-steps, buffers, and nearest-neighbour regressors. It mentions the representation of various curiosity algorithms and the generation of algorithms similar to novelty search and EX 2. However, it also highlights the exploration algorithm classes not covered, such as those focusing on generating goals, learning progress, diverse skills, stochastic neural networks, count-based exploration, and object-based curiosity measures. The motivation for this work is influenced by previous research showing challenges with bonus-based curiosity algorithms generalizing. The curr_chunk discusses research efforts on meta-learning exploration policies, including LSTM-based exploration and gradient-based meta-learning with structured noise for exploration. Zheng et al. (2018) parametrize an intrinsic reward function. In contrast to previous methods, the authors search over algorithms to generalize broadly and consider exploration over a larger number of time-steps. Chiang et al. (2019) modify reward functions over the agent's lifetime, while evolved policy gradients meta-learn a neural network to compute a loss function based on agent-environment interactions. In this work, the authors optimize neural network weights through evolution strategies to create new policies that can adapt to different environments. They demonstrate the ability to generalize across diverse environments by meta-training a robot to navigate east and then quickly learn to navigate west. Unlike other methods, their approach leverages polymorphic data types to adapt neural networks to varying environments. In this work, programs are shown to be a powerful representation for generating curious exploration algorithms efficiently. The resulting algorithms have broad generalization, making them reliable for reinforcement learning settings. The open-sourced algorithm search code allows for further research on exploration algorithms. Meta-learning programs instead of network weights may have applications beyond curiosity algorithms, such as optimization algorithms or meta-learning meta-learning algorithms. The types in the environment include R for real numbers, R+ for positive numbers, state space S for environment state, action space A for actions, feature-space F for neural network embeddings, and List[X] for each type. These types are adapted to each environment. The text discusses network embeddings and the use of lists for different types. It also mentions the RunningNorm algorithm for normalizing input variance. Additionally, it covers two published algorithms in meta-RL for learning transferable feature representations and improving task performance. The text discusses broadening the spectrum of generalization in tasks, including transfer between Atari games and benchmarking generalization using different levels of the game Sonic. It also mentions a benchmark of many tasks and the effectiveness of transferring policies between different terrains for a bipedal walker. The text discusses generalization between different environments and optimizing search algorithms to find the best programs faster. It shows that an optimized search can find 88% of the best programs after evaluating only 50% of them. The mean performance across 26,000 evaluated programs forms a Gaussian distribution. The text discusses the optimization of search algorithms to find the best programs faster. It shows that 88% of the best programs can be found after evaluating only 50% of them. The mean performance forms a Gaussian distribution with a small long tail of programs with statistically significant performance. The F \u2192 F network was used to map from the query to the target, sharing weights between both predictions."
