    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Abandoned and Derelict Vessel Removal Act of 1995\" and includes definitions for key terms. The \"Abandoned and Derelict Vessel Removal Act of 1995\" defines key terms such as abandon, navigable waters of the United States, removal, Secretary, vessel, and vessel removal contractor. A contractor is a person who enters into a contract with the United States to remove an abandoned vessel under the Act. SEC. 3 prohibits the abandonment of vessels on U.S. navigable waters, except in approved mooring areas or with permission on private property. SEC. 4 imposes a penalty of up to $500 per day for violations, and SEC. 5 addresses the removal of abandoned vessels. The Secretary, with the Coast Guard's cooperation, can remove abandoned vessels if a local official requests it and the owner is notified of removal at their expense. Notification must be via certified mail if the owner is known. The United States can remove abandoned vessels if the owner cannot be identified, and the owner or operator is not liable for damages. The owner or operator is responsible for all expenses incurred in removing the abandoned vessel. The Secretary may solicit bids for the removal of abandoned vessels. The Secretary may solicit bids for the removal of an abandoned vessel through public advertisement. After solicitation, a contract may be awarded to a removal contractor, who must submit a removal plan and take ownership of the vessel. Removal can begin 30 days after the Secretary completes the necessary procedures. Liability of vessel removal contractors is limited under this Act, excluding personal injury or wrongful death cases and instances of gross negligence or willful misconduct. Appropriations are authorized for the Act's implementation for fiscal years after September 30, 1996."
