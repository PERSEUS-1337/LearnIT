The outcome of the election could lead to a shift in U.S. policy towards Burma, potentially resulting in the removal of some sanctions. Other nations and the European Union are also considering lifting sanctions based on their assessments of the by-elections. The Union Parliament in Myanmar consists of two chambers: the People's Assembly with 440 seats and the National Assembly with 224 seats. A quarter of the seats in each chamber are appointed by the military commander-in-chief. By-elections were held to fill 48 vacant seats, with some postponed due to security concerns. The seats were vacated due to members accepting government positions, removal from office, or death. The by-elections in Myanmar filled 48 vacant seats previously held by the pro-military USDP party. The participation of the NLD, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, is significant for the country's democracy movement. Despite efforts to ensure fairness, incidents during the campaign period raised concerns about government interference. The by-elections in Myanmar were marred by government efforts to undermine the NLD's campaign and coerce support for the USDP. Despite irregularities, election day on April 1 went smoothly with no repeat of past issues. The NLD won all 37 seats in the People's Assembly and 4 seats in the National Assembly. The NLD won all 37 seats in the People's Assembly, 4 seats in the National Assembly, and both seats in the regional assemblies. The USDP won 1 seat in the National Assembly in Sagaing Region, while the SNDP won the seat in the National Assembly in Shan State. Pro-military parties and the military now control a significant majority of seats in the parliament, enough to pass laws or amend the constitution without opposition support. Initial international responses to the by-elections were generally positive, with the White House and the Secretary-General congratulating the people of Burma for the elections. The Spokesperson for Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon congratulated Myanmar for peaceful by-elections. ASEAN leaders called for sanctions removal on Myanmar. EU may consider lifting some sanctions in late April. 17 political parties registered candidates, including NLD and USDP. Two parties were disqualified for not meeting candidate requirements. NLD and USDP filed candidates for all 48 seats initially available. The NLD and USDP filed candidates for all 48 seats in the by-elections. The National Democratic Front (NDF) and National Unity Party also contested seats. Several political parties did not participate for various reasons, including two parties whose applications were not acted upon by the UEC. The Chin National Party and Rakhine National Development Party are not participating as none of the contested seats are in their home states. Four other parties are also not participating. Several political parties, including Mon National Democratic Front, Shan Nationalities League for Democracy, and Zomi National Congress, announced plans to register with the UEC but not run candidates in the by-elections. Members of the 88-Generation students group also decided not to run candidates but to support the NLD. Other parties like the Karen National Union, Karenni National Progressive Party, and Pa-O National Liberation Organization opted out due to members in detention or attacks by Burmese militia. President Thein Sein promised free and fair by-elections, with each party given airtime on radio and TV in March. The election campaign in Myanmar during March was marked by government interference, intimidation of voters, and alleged dirty tricks by the USDP to secure victory. Despite efforts by the Union Election Commission to address obstacles faced by the NLD, reports of unfair campaign practices persist. The Ministry of Sports refused to allow NLD rallies, adding to the challenges faced by the party. The NLD campaign faced challenges as the Ministry of Sports refused permission for rallies in football stadia, despite drawing large crowds. The UEC later instructed the sports ministry to lift restrictions, but the Mon State Election Commission also denied rally permissions. Allegations of intimidation and voter coercion by local government officials and the USDP to support their party in the by-elections. Tactics included threats of job loss, denial of electricity, and use of bribery, vote-buying, and fraud. NLD reported irregularities in voter registration lists, including deceased individuals and missing eligible voters. The NLD reported irregularities in voter registration lists, including deceased individuals and missing eligible voters. Advance ballots were collected ahead of official dates, allegedly used to steal seats in parliamentary elections. The UEC's decision to postpone voting for three People's Assembly seats in Kachin State was criticized as politically motivated. Opposition party candidates disputed security concerns in the districts. Multiple parties had candidates in the postponed constituencies. ALTSEAN released an overview of the by-elections on March 27, 2012, stating that the elections did not meet international standards. The assessment highlighted various shortcomings, including limited political participation, lack of independence and impartiality in the UEC, campaign restrictions, ineffective complaint process, interference by government officials and UEC representatives, voter disenfranchisement, and censorship of campaign materials. Despite these irregularities, rallies with Aung San Suu Kyi were popular, with turnout exceeding 10,000 people. The Union Government faced international pressure to allow election observers for the April by-election. President Thein Sein indicated willingness to allow observers from ASEAN. ASEAN announced sending 5 observers and 18 parliamentarians from member nations. EU, UN, and US were also involved. On April 1, 2012, international observers from ASEAN, the EU, the United Nations, and the United States were invited to monitor the election. Despite the deportation of an election monitor from the Asian Network for Free Elections, voting proceeded smoothly with minimal irregularities compared to the previous election in 2010. Voting centers operated efficiently, although there were some concerns about voter registration accuracy. The April by-election was observed by the diplomatic community, international election witnesses, and the press. Ballot counting was done in the presence of witnesses and results were recorded. The process differed from the November election with no unexplained boxes of \"advanced votes\" and counting done before witnesses. The official results were announced by the UEC on April 2 and 3. The UEC announced the official results of the April 2012 by-election, with the NLD winning a landslide victory, including all 37 seats in the People's Assembly. Aung San Suu Kyi was among the NLD winners. The USDP and SNDP also secured seats, but the balance of power in the Union Parliament remained largely unchanged. The pro-military parties, USDP and NUP, along with appointed military seats, have a majority in both chambers of the Union Parliament, allowing them to pass laws and amend the constitution without opposition support. The NLD has become the largest opposition party in both chambers. The Obama Administration urged the Burmese government to ensure free and fair parliamentary by-elections. Special Representative Derek Mitchell emphasized the importance of a transparent electoral process during his visit to Burma. The Obama Administration urged the Burmese government to ensure a free, fair, and transparent electoral process for the parliamentary by-elections. International observers were recommended to monitor the election campaign, balloting process, and vote-counting. The White House congratulated the people of Burma for their participation and Aung San Suu Kyi for the strong showing in the polls, hoping it signifies a continued path towards openness, transparency, and reform in the country. The Obama Administration may modify sanctions on Burma based on the elections' fairness. Aung San Suu Kyi's assessment could influence the decision. Possible changes in sanctions are being considered, but details have not been disclosed. The U.S. response may occur in steps, with modifications made after winners are sworn in. The Obama Administration may consider modifying sanctions on Burma after winners of the by-elections are sworn in and assessed. Other countries like the EU, Australia, and Japan are also reviewing their sanctions based on election results. The Obama Administration is reviewing sanctions on Burma following the by-elections, considering important issues such as political prisoners, attacks on ethnic militias, and human rights violations. President Thein Sein has granted amnesties but hundreds of political prisoners remain detained. Hundreds of political prisoners, including members of the NLD, opposition parties, ethnic groups, monks, students, and journalists, are still detained in harsh conditions in Burma. As of March 17, 2012, 458 political prisoners were confirmed to be in detention, with an additional 403 allegedly detained but unverified. The Organization of Former Political Prisoners lists 619 individuals still detained. The State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor maintains a list of political prisoners in Burma based on NGO and government sources. The Burmese government has provided conflicting estimates of the number of political prisoners, with President Thein Sein denying their existence. However, a political advisor estimated around 600 political prisoners before a prisoner amnesty in October 2011. After a release in January, it was stated that 302 of the 651 released were \"prisoners of conscience.\" Ko Ko reported that 302 out of 651 released individuals were \"prisoners of conscience,\" with 128 dissidents still detained. The Union Government has shifted from the SPDC initiative to negotiate ceasefire agreements with ethnic militias. Despite initial agreements with nine minority groups, conflicts persist, especially with the Kachin Independence Organization. President Thein Sein ordered a halt to offensives against militias, but reports indicate ongoing assaults and mistreatment of civilians by the Tatmadaw, leading to internal displacement. The human rights situation in conflict areas of Burma remains dire, with mistreatment of civilians leading to displacement. Negotiating teams are working towards ceasefire agreements with ethnic organizations, facing challenges in ensuring autonomy in exchange for peace. The negotiations for a permanent ceasefire or peace agreement in Burma face obstacles due to militias' lack of trust in the government and military. Some ethnic militias have signed preliminary ceasefire agreements, but talks with the KIO have not been successful. The Union Government has refused to hold ceasefire talks with the Arakan Liberation Party. Progress on human rights in Burma remains slow, with ongoing fighting in ethnic conflict areas and reports of political repression in urban areas. \"Despite some positive steps by the government, Burma's human rights situation in 2012 remains dire. Media restrictions have eased, but pre-publication censorship is still required. Legislation allowing trade unions and peaceful protests has been passed but not enforced. Reports of human rights abuses by the Burmese military in conflict areas persist.\" Since the Union Government took power, there have been reports of summary executions, rape, forced labor, impressments of child soldiers, and property destruction. The ongoing fighting in Burma has led to tens of thousands of internally displaced people and new refugees fleeing to China and Thailand. The situation is severe for IDPs in Kachin state, where international relief organizations have been denied access. Hundreds of Burmese refugees have crossed into China, and Thailand has seen an influx of refugees due to recent fighting in eastern Burma. The recent fighting in eastern Burma has led to an inflow of refugees. The April parliamentary by-elections provide an opportunity for Burma's Union Government, Parliament, and Tatmadaw to demonstrate commitment to political reform. Congress may need to reassess U.S. policy based on the election outcome and consider altering existing laws on sanctions. The elections did not meet U.N. standards of being free, fair, transparent, and inclusive. The recent elections in Burma did not meet U.N. standards of being free, fair, transparent, and inclusive. Key issues include the establishment of criteria for the U.S. response, such as rewarding positive developments, encouraging further reforms, and bolstering pro-reform officials. The Obama Administration may request Congress to amend existing laws imposing sanctions on Burma, as the President has the authority to waive some sanctions but not all. Consultations with Congress have begun on U.S. policy towards Burma, with Congress potentially conducting hearings and investigations in preparation for a response."
