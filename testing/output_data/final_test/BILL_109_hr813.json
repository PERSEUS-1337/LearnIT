    "content": "The \"Flu Protection Act of 2005\" includes a section on a Flu Vaccine Awareness Campaign, which amends the Public Health Service Act to include an awareness campaign, education, and outreach efforts related to flu vaccines. The Secretary will conduct a public awareness campaign each year before the influenza season, focusing on the importance of receiving the influenza vaccine, recommended populations for vaccination, professional medical education, and vaccine safety. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will outreach to Medicare providers to encourage early ordering of influenza vaccines to meet the needs of Medicare recipients. They will also publish rates of immunization among individuals receiving Medicare assistance. The Director of the Medicare program will support State adult immunization programs focusing on improving influenza vaccine delivery to high-risk populations and the general population. They will also conduct a study to assess the efficacy of the influenza vaccine and may use existing communication structures for public awareness campaigns. $10,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2005 through 2009 for these activities. SEC. 201 of TITLE II encourages vaccine production capacity by providing incentives for the construction of vaccine manufacturing facilities through a new investment tax credit. The vaccine manufacturing facilities investment credit under section 46 allows for a 20 percent credit on qualified investments in vaccine manufacturing facilities property placed in service during the taxable year. This incentive aims to boost vaccine production capacity by encouraging the construction of such facilities. The vaccine manufacturing facilities investment credit under section 46 provides a 20 percent credit for qualified investments in property used for vaccine manufacture, distribution, or research and development. The property must comply with FDA, OSHA, and EPA standards. Rules similar to subsections (c)(4) and (d) of section 46 apply, and the credit does not apply to certain properties. The subsection does not apply to property placed in service after December 31, 2009. Technical amendments are made to sections 49(a)(1)(C) and 50(a)(2) of the Code. The text discusses a vaccine manufacturing facilities credit and the effective date for property placed in service. It also addresses ensuring a sufficient flu vaccine supply by amending the Public Health Service Act to include a section on influenza vaccine supply. The Secretary must contract with manufacturers by March 15 each year for additional influenza vaccine doses deemed necessary. The contract includes compensation for unsold doses at the end of the season requested by the Secretary. The Secretary may purchase contracted vaccine doses when they are unlikely to be absorbed by the private market. States are encouraged to develop contingency plans for influenza vaccine delays or shortages. Authorization of appropriations is provided for this purpose. TITLE IV--PREPARING FOR A PANDEMIC OR EPIDEMIC\n\nSEC. 401. PREPARATION FOR INFLUENZA PANDEMIC OR EPIDEMIC. Subtitle 3 of title XXI of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include preparation for influenza pandemic or epidemic. The Secretary, through the Director of the National Vaccine Program, will establish a protocol to prevent, prepare for, and respond to influenza pandemics or epidemics. The protocol will improve influenza vaccines, production, dissemination methods, and coordinate vaccine distribution to key populations. The protocol established by the Secretary aims to enhance influenza vaccine manufacturing capacity, explore alternative production methods, prevent spread and complications of influenza, improve vaccine dissemination for pandemic threats like avian influenza, and implement tracking methods for vaccines. The Director of the Program will establish a tracking method for influenza vaccine doses to determine supply during a pandemic or epidemic. Coordination with stakeholders, surveillance capacity building, and epidemiological studies will also be conducted. The Program will establish tracking for influenza vaccine doses, build surveillance capacity, conduct epidemiological studies on novel viruses, and assist States with pandemic preparedness activities. Authorization of $150,000,000 for fiscal years 2005 through 2009 is provided."
