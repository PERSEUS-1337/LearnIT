    "content": "The 108th Congress is addressing immigration issues related to national security post-9/11. The establishment of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 transferred immigration functions from the Immigration and Naturalization Service to DHS. Lingering questions remain about the division of responsibilities. The 108th Congress is debating legislation to implement recommendations from the 9/11 Commission on immigration-related issues, including military naturalization and posthumous citizenship benefits for U.S. citizen servicemembers. The 9/11 Commission's immigration recommendations focus on targeting terrorist travel through reliable identification systems and information-sharing. Congress is considering legislative responses that may include significant changes to immigration law enforcement. Other measures before the 108th Congress address perennial immigration questions such as U.S. labor needs, unauthorized immigration, and noncitizen benefits. The report discusses immigration-related issues, including consular identification cards, unauthorized immigration, and security concerns. Legislative action and significant congressional interest are highlighted, with a focus on the Attorney General's historical authority over immigration law enforcement. Enacted legislation and selected bills are also listed. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) was responsible for immigration functions until March 1, 2003, when the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) took over border security and immigration management. The Homeland Security Act transferred authority to the Secretary of Homeland Security, as stated in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) was responsible for immigration functions until March 1, 2003, when the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) took over. The revised language reflects the transfer of general authority, but may leave certain issues unresolved regarding the Attorney General's retained powers in immigration matters. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) transferred authority to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in 2003. Questions remain about coordinating authority between DHS and the Attorney General in immigration matters. A bill, H.R. 1416, aims to clarify this by replacing references to the Attorney General with the Secretary of Homeland Security in the Immigration and Nationality Act. The bill H.R. 1416 aims to clarify authority in immigration matters by replacing references to the Attorney General with the Secretary of Homeland Security. Questions remain about how far this provision would resolve outstanding issues of authority, particularly regarding citizenship benefits for noncitizen soldiers. The INA grants posthumous citizenship to those who die in active-duty service during hostilities and allows expedited naturalization for noncitizens serving in the military. Noncitizens can petition for naturalization after three years of military service during peacetime, and immediately during periods of hostilities. President George W. Bush designated the period after September 11, 2001, as a \"period of hostilities,\" allowing immediate naturalization for active-duty U.S. military servicemembers. The Department of Defense and former INS collaborated to expedite military naturalization applications. As of February 2003, there were 37,000 noncitizens in active duty, 12,000 in selected reserves, and 8,000 in inactive national guard. H.R. 1588, the \"National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004,\" reduced the service period for naturalization based on peacetime service from three years to one year. The \"National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004\" reduced the service period for naturalization based on peacetime service from three years to one year. It also waives fees for naturalization based on military service during peacetime or wartime, allows discretionary revocation of naturalization granted through military service under certain conditions, permits naturalization processing overseas, provides priority consideration for military leave and transport for naturalization, and extends naturalization based on wartime service to members of the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve. Additionally, posthumous citizenship can be requested with permission from the next-of-kin. P.L. 108-136 expands immigration benefits for military personnel. P.L. 108-136 expands immigration benefits for immediate relatives of citizens who die from combat-related injuries or illnesses. They can self-petition for immigrant status, with certain requirements waived. Children, parents, and spouses of citizens who die during active-duty service can naturalize without prior residence requirements. This includes survivors of posthumous citizens who died on or after September 11, 2001. The INA is amended to change references to the Attorney General to the Secretary of Homeland Security. The effective date of the provisions in P.L. 108-136 would be retroactive to September 11, 2001, except for fee waivers and naturalization proceedings abroad. The 9/11 Commission found that key officials responsible for alien admissions were not fully involved in counterterrorism efforts before 9/11, leading to missed opportunities to intercept terrorists. The Commission recommended targeting terrorist travel through intelligence and law enforcement efforts. The recommendations from the 9/11 Commission focus on targeting terrorist travel through intelligence and security strategies. Congress is considering legislative responses that may include significant changes to immigration law and enforcement in the United States. Major bills like H.R. 10 and S. 2845 propose revisions to immigration law and policy. The National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004, 9/11 Commission Report Implementation Act of 2004, and 9/11 Commission Recommendations Implementation Act of 2004 propose extensive revisions to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Major areas of focus include asylum, biometric tracking, border security, document security, immigration enforcement, and visa issuances for nonimmigrants in the United States. The H visa category includes various visas for temporary workers in the United States, such as the H-1B visa for professional specialty workers, the H-2A visa for agricultural workers, and the H-2B visa for nonagricultural workers. Other nonimmigrant categories for work-related purposes include the B-1 visa for business visitors, the E visa for treaty traders and investors, and the L-1 visa for intracompany transfers. The increase in employment-based immigration in the 1990s was driven by concerns about labor scarcity affecting economic growth. The 108th Congress is currently considering the supply of foreign temporary professional workers. The 108th Congress is considering whether to renew increased H-1B visa ceilings or keep the limit at 65,000. The FY2004 and FY2005 caps were reached early in the fiscal year. Previous legislation raised the number of H-1B visas and increased fees for education and training of U.S. residents. The 108th Congress is debating whether to renew increased H-1B visa ceilings or maintain the limit at 65,000. Provisions allow H-1B workers to stay beyond the six-year limit if their employers petition for them to become legal residents. Labor market protections for firms with more than 15% H-1B workers expired in FY2003. Opponents argue against extending H-1B visa ceilings, stating there is no evidence of a labor shortage that cannot be met by U.S. students and workers. Proponents advocate for maintaining current H-1B levels, prioritizing education and training for U.S. students and workers. Some proponents argue that H-1B workers are essential for the US to remain globally competitive. Pending bills would make changes to H-1B visa laws, such as broadening lay-off protection provisions and giving the Department of Labor authority to investigate H-1B employers. H.R. 4166 would make certain provisions permanent, including the attestation requirement for nondisplacement of US workers and the filing fee for H-1B petitioners. H.R. 3534 proposes to amend the H visa category by eliminating current subcategories like the H-1B visa and replacing them with a single category for skilled or unskilled workers coming temporarily to the US. Concerns have been raised about potential misuse of the L visa category for executives and managers of multinational corporations working temporarily in the US. The number of L visas issued has tripled in the past 20 years, but there has been a slight decrease from a high in FY2001. Some are concerned that firms are using the L visa to transfer professional employees, potentially circumventing immigration laws. Legislation to amend the L-1 visa is before the 108th Congress. Legislation before the 108th Congress aims to restrict outsourcing of U.S. jobs to L-1 visa holders. Bills such as S. 1635 and H.R. 4166 propose amendments to the INA to limit entry of aliens with specialized knowledge and revise L visa requirements. Several pending bills in the 108th Congress aim to restrict outsourcing of U.S. jobs to L-1 visa holders by amending the INA. H.R. 4415 would limit the number of L-1 visas to 35,000 annually and eliminate specialized knowledge as a basis for obtaining an L visa. Some bills include labor attestation requirements to protect U.S. workers. The U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement and the U.S.-Singapore FTA create separate categories for nonimmigrant admissions for citizens of each country for business and investment activities. Legislation implementing the Chile and Singapore Free Trade Agreements introduced new visa categories for visitors, treaty traders, investors, intracompany transfers, and professional workers. The laws amended the INA to create the H-1B-1 visa for professional workers entering through the FTAs, with requirements similar to the H-1B visa. The FTA professional worker visa has specific requirements for specialized knowledge and numerical limits for entries from Chile and Singapore. The visa is initially issued for one year but can be renewed indefinitely, unlike the H-1B visa which has a six-year limit. FTA professional workers are counted against the H-1B cap in the first and fifth years but can legally remain in the US indefinitely. The FTA provisions on temporary entry of business personnel and professional workers are causing concerns in the immigration field as they were negotiated without Congress's authority. This raises questions about the USTR's compliance with the \"fast track authority\" obligations, limiting Congress's ability to amend FTA enabling legislation and potentially constraining future immigration law revisions. The USTR argues that the temporary entry of professionals under FTAs aligns with Trade Promotion Authority objectives, benefiting U.S. companies in expanding into new markets. They emphasize that these provisions do not impact immigration policy, as they only pertain to temporary entry. The USTR notified Congress in 2001 about negotiating measures to facilitate the temporary entry of business persons. The United States has programs for importing low-skilled workers through the H-2A and H-2B programs. Proposed bills aim to overhaul the H-2A program by streamlining the process and making changes to benefits, wages, and working conditions. The House Agriculture Committee reviewed the impact of agricultural guest worker proposals in 2004. Bills like S. 2010 and S. 2381/H.R. 4262 seek to reform the H-2B program by allowing short-term worker imports. Proposed bills aim to overhaul the H-2B program by allowing short-term worker imports and increasing the number of H-2B workers. H.R. 3534 proposes to amend the H visa category more generally by replacing current subcategories with a single category for skilled or unskilled work. Other bills before the 108th Congress aim to establish new nonimmigrant visas for temporary workers. Several bills in the 108th Congress propose to establish new nonimmigrant visas for temporary workers, including visas for seasonal workers, nonseasonal workers, unauthorized alien workers, and temporary workers in occupation classifications not covered by existing visa categories. Several bills before the 108th Congress aim to enable unauthorized aliens to adjust to legal permanent resident (LPR) status, including through guest worker programs. The unauthorized resident alien population in 2002 was estimated to be 9.3 million, with a majority being Mexican nationals. Adjusting to LPR status involves the process of granting legal permanent residence to individuals present in the United States. Several bills before the 108th Congress aim to establish special mechanisms for alien workers in the United States to become legal permanent residents (LPRs). These bills propose different two-stage legalization programs for agricultural workers and certain alien workers to apply for LPR status. One bill, known as the \"DREAM Act,\" would enable unauthorized alien students to become LPRs through a two-stage process. The bill proposes conditional LPR status for aliens under 16 at entry, residing in the US for 5 years, with a high school diploma or admission to higher education. Other bills in the House also aim to enable unauthorized alien students to become LPRs. The 1996 welfare reform law made newly entering LPRs ineligible for federal public benefits for five years, with states allowed to continue barring LPRs from benefits like Medicaid and SCHIP. However, all noncitizens eligible for Medicaid can receive emergency Medicaid. President Bush signed a law in 2003 to reimburse healthcare providers for treating unauthorized aliens and Mexican citizens with border crossing cards. P.L.108-173 instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to reimburse local governments and hospitals for providing emergency health services to unauthorized aliens, aliens paroled into the United States, and Mexican citizens with border crossing cards. Funding is allocated to states based on a formula, with $250 million appropriated for fiscal years 2005 through 2008. $83 million is allocated to 6 states with the highest unauthorized alien apprehensions. P.L. 108-173 requires a process for health care providers to apply for reimbursement. Legislation aims to repeal IIRIRA \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd505 to enable certain unauthorized alien students to become LPRs and access federal postsecondary education benefits. The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 (EBSVER; P.L. 107-173) mandated biometric identifiers on visas by October 26, 2004. It also required biometric measures for visa waiver program (VWP) countries. The government of each VWP country must certify they have a program for machine-readable passports with biometric identifiers by October 26, 2005. Applicants to the US under the VWP need a tamper-resistant, machine-readable passport with a biometric identifier, with facial recognition as the standard. P.L. 108-299 extended the deadline for VWP countries to comply with biometric passport requirements. The VWP countries must have tamper-resistant, machine-readable passports with biometric identifiers by October 26, 2005. S.Amdt. 3933 introduced during the debate of the \"National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004\" requires VWP countries to issue tamper-resistant, machine-readable visa documents with biometric identifiers compatible with US-VISIT program. The debate on consular identification cards in the US focuses on the matr\u00edcula consular issued by Mexican consulates to their citizens. Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, Mexican consulates in the United States have been working to gain acceptance of the matr\u00edcula consular as a form of identification. This has raised questions in both domestic and foreign policy, including debates on immigration, public safety, law enforcement, and homeland security. Legislation related to consular identification cards is currently before the 108th Congress, with provisions in the House-passed Foreign Relations Authorization Act for FY2004-FY2005 aiming to restrict the issuance of such cards by foreign missions. Legislation related to consular identification cards is currently before the 108th Congress, with provisions aiming to restrict the issuance of such cards by foreign missions. Other pending measures concern acceptance of consular identification cards by U.S. federal entities and for banking purposes. Additionally, there are proposals to establish consequences under immigration law for the possession or use of consular identification cards. The pilot programs were established to confirm the legal eligibility of new hires to work. The Attorney General was directed to create an employment eligibility confirmation system for participating employers. The programs were initially authorized for four years but were extended to six years by P.L. 107-128. The \"basic pilot program\" was the first to be implemented in November 1997 and currently operates in six states. Participation in the programs is mostly voluntary, although some employers are required to participate. S. 1685 aims to extend each program for an additional five years. S. 1685 aims to extend the pilot programs for an additional five years, authorizing the basic pilot program until 2008 and requiring operation in all states by December 1, 2004. The bill was amended to include provisions related to the immigrant investor regional center pilot program and was signed into law as P.L. 108-156. H.R. 2359, like S. 1685, aimed to extend pilot programs for five more years and expand the basic pilot program to all states. It would allow the pilot program confirmation system to be used for government inquiries about immigration status. The bill failed to pass after being considered on the House floor on October 28, 2003. The motion to pass the bill, as amended, failed on October 28, 2003, with a vote of 231 to 170 falling short of the required two-thirds majority. The refugee ceiling for FY2004 was set at 70,000, with 52,868 actual admissions. FY2005 proposed refugee admissions also set the ceiling at 70,000 with 20,000 unallocated slots. Unused refugee numbers in a fiscal year do not carry over. The \"Lautenberg amendment\" eases refugee status proof for certain nationals. The Lautenberg amendment, extended through FY2004, requires less evidence for refugee status for certain nationals, including Iranian religious minorities. Private organizations are now involved in refugee identification and referral. The McCain amendment allows adult children of Vietnamese refugees to apply for refugee status. The McCain amendment, enacted in 1996, allowed adult children of Vietnamese refugees to apply for U.S. refugee resettlement. P.L. 107-185 revised the amendment for FY2002 and FY2003, enabling previously denied cases to be reconsidered. H.R. 2792 in the 108th Congress aimed to extend the amendment through FY2005. Funding for refugee resettlement included $478.0 million for FY2003 and $450.3 million for FY2004. The Bush Administration requested $473 million for FY2005. The House and Senate bills for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations included funding for the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 aimed to address the eligibility of North Korean nationals for refugee or asylum status. H.R.4011 aims to facilitate applications for refugee status from North Koreans and requires annual reports on those who received asylum. P.L. 108-99 extends a provision for religious workers entering the U.S. under a special immigrant category. The Immigration Act of 1990 created a special immigrant category for ministers of religion and religious workers, with a nonimmigrant visa for religious workers. The provision for religious workers was initially set to expire in 1994 but was extended multiple times, most recently through September 30, 2008. The Immigration Act of 1990 created a special immigrant category for ministers of religion and religious workers, with a nonimmigrant visa for religious workers. The provision for religious workers was extended through September 30, 2008. In contrast, P.L. 106-386 established the T visa or T status for victims of severe trafficking in persons, requiring compliance with law enforcement and demonstrating extreme hardship to qualify for T status. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-193) expands eligibility for T status by raising the age for compliance with requests for assistance, allowing siblings of trafficking victims under 21 to qualify for derivative T status, preventing children from aging out of T status applications, and removing public charge as a ground for inadmissibility. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-193) expands T status eligibility by raising the age for compliance with requests for assistance, allowing siblings under 21 to qualify for derivative T status, preventing children from aging out of T status applications, and removing public charge as a ground for inadmissibility. Additionally, $15 million is authorized for HHS to provide services to trafficking victims. Social Security provides cash benefits to retired, disabled workers, dependents, and survivors with 10 years of covered employment required for retirement benefits. Aliens working in Social Security-covered employment must pay payroll taxes, except for certain visa categories like H-2A agricultural workers. The Social Security Protection Act of 2004 requires aliens applying for benefits based on SSNs issued after January 1, 2004 to have work authorization. Earnings before 2004 count towards eligibility regardless of work authorization. The diversity visa lottery allows immigration for nationals of low-immigration countries. Applications for the FY2005 lottery were due by December 30, 2003. The FY2005 diversity visa lottery allows immigration for nationals of low-immigration countries. The lottery is limited to 55,000 aliens annually. In FY2001, over 8 million aliens applied for the FY2003 lottery. European immigrants comprised 39.4% of diversity visa recipients in FY2002, while African immigrants received 38.1%. The Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act of 1997 temporarily reduces the annual ceiling by up to 5,000 visas. The diversity visa lottery, with an annual limit of 55,000 visas, was established in FY1999 to offset immigrant visa numbers for certain asylum seekers. There are debates on whether to continue the lottery, with some suggesting using the visas for backlog reduction in other categories. Supporters argue that the diversity visa brings new immigrants from countries not well-represented in the immigration system. The House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security and Claims has reported H.R. 775 to eliminate the diversity visa lottery. S. 710, as reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee, would make aliens who commit acts of torture, extrajudicial killings, or severe violations of religious freedom abroad inadmissible to, and removable from, the United States. It would also expand the authority of the Office of Special Investigations to denaturalize aliens involved in such acts. S. 1129, reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee, establishes procedures for DHS officers encountering unaccompanied alien children, including age determination and detention conditions. It also requires representation for children in immigration proceedings and a pilot program for guardians ad litem. S. 205, passed by the Senate, allows nonimmigrant admission for certain scientists under the INA. The INA would be amended to allow nonimmigrant admission for scientists with information on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. S. 205 sets a limit of 500 for this category and grants the Attorney General discretion to adjust their status to LPR. H.R. 2655 extends a visa program for young adults from Northern Ireland or certain counties in Ireland to work in the US. S. 1642 extends the immigrant investor regional center pilot program and gives priority to immigrant investor visa petitions under the program. The pilot program S. 1642 was added as an amendment to extend and expand employment eligibility verification pilot programs. S. 1685, as amended, was passed into law as P.L. 108-156. State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) provides reimbursement for incarcerating undocumented criminal aliens, with appropriations authorized by P.L. 108-199. S. 460 authorizes appropriations for SCAAP for FY2003-FY2010. The House companion bill H.R. 933, along with other pending bills, authorizes funding for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) for different fiscal years. The Commerce, Justice, State Department Appropriations bill included $325 million for SCAAP, while the Senate version provided $220 million. Waivers are available for nonimmigrant physicians in the U.S. on J-1 visas, allowing them to change status to H-1B under the \"Conrad 30\" or \"State 30\" program. Pending bills, like H.R. 4453, aim to amend the \"Conrad 30\" program for foreign physicians in J-1 status before June 1, 2004. H.R. 4453 proposes removing the cut-off date and making provisions applicable to physicians admitted before a year after the bill's enactment. It also exempts state-sponsored waiver recipients from the H-1B cap and extends the program until June 2006, allowing five physicians in each state to practice in non-\"under-served\" areas. The Department of Health and Human Services requires physicians to provide care to under-served populations. S. 1609 would make nonpayment of child support a ground of inadmissibility under immigration law. P.L. 108-7 includes provisions related to immigration authorities and refugee issues. P.L. 108-77 pertains to the United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act. P.L. 108-77 (H.R. 2738) and P.L. 108-78 (H.R. 2739) were passed in relation to the United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act and the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, respectively.
