    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Clean Cookstoves and Fuels Support Act\" and includes findings related to clean cookstoves and fuels. Congress finds that nearly half the world's population cooks over open fires or inefficient cookstoves, leading to health issues like respiratory illnesses and increased mortality rates from exposure to smoke. Household air pollution from cookstoves is a significant health risk factor, causing millions of deaths and illnesses annually. The use of biomass cooking fuel contributes to environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity in regions like Asia and Africa. Recent studies show that black carbon from biomass cookstoves contributes to regional air pollution and climate change, with emissions accounting for 21 percent of the global inventory. Women and children spend significant time collecting biomass fuel, facing risks like gender-based violence and rape. The Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves aims to enable the adoption of clean and efficient stoves in 100 million homes by 2020 through a public-private partnership. The United States Government has committed up to $125 million to the sector for research, field implementation activities, and financing. The Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves aims to enable the adoption of clean and efficient stoves in 100 million homes by 2020 through a public-private partnership. The United States Government has committed up to $50,000,000 in financing through various departments for this initiative. The Environmental Protection Agency, National Science Foundation, and Overseas Private Investment Corporation have committed funding through fiscal years 2015 and 2016 to support projects that provide clean and affordable energy access through the manufacture and sale of cookstoves. This commitment includes research on cookstoves performance, marketing, health benefits, and field expansion. The Alliance for Clean Cookstoves has received additional Federal support from various agencies including the Department of Agriculture, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Peace Corps. The Millennium Challenge Corporation made a significant investment of $45,300,000 in Mongolia in 2010 to promote economic growth through energy efficiency and improved air quality. The Alliance for Clean Cookstoves receives Federal support from various agencies to promote economic growth through energy efficiency and improved air quality. The Secretary of State, in collaboration with several federal agencies and international organizations, will support the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves by conducting research, promoting technology adoption, and establishing industry standards for efficient and clean cookstoves. The Secretary of State, federal agencies, and international organizations will support the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves by ensuring efficiency and cleanliness standards are met, engaging diplomatically to promote a commercial market for clean cookstoves and fuels, developing projects to build commercial businesses for clean cookstoves, and providing financing or insurance for projects that offer access to clean, affordable energy. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATIONS OF APPROPRIATIONS.
