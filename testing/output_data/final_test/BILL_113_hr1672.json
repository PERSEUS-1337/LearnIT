The public lands in Montana are withdrawn from appropriation under public land laws, reserved for use by the Secretary of the Army for training and facility construction. The public lands in Broadwater County, Montana, totaling approximately 18,644 acres, are reserved for training purposes by the Montana Department of Military Affairs, state and local law enforcement agencies, civil defense organizations, and public education institutions. Other defense-related purposes consistent with the training activities are also allowed on the withdrawn lands. The Secretary of the Interior will publish a legal description and map of the public land withdrawal in Broadwater County, Montana for training purposes. The Secretary of the Army will reimburse any costs incurred in implementing this. The Secretary of the Interior will publish a legal description and map of the public land withdrawal in Broadwater County, Montana for training purposes. The Secretary of the Army will consult with Indian tribes in the vicinity of the military land withdrawal before taking action affecting tribal rights or cultural resources protected by treaty or Federal law. During the specified withdrawal period, the Secretary of the Army will manage the public lands for designated purposes, subject to restrictions. Special rules govern minerals management on the withdrawn lands. Indian Creek Mine, located on withdrawn lands, is regulated for locatable mineral activities under specific regulations. The approved plan allows for the amendment or relocation of mining claims to preserve mining operations. The Secretary of the Army is restricted from making certain determinations regarding mineral exploration on the approved plan. The approved plan for Indian Creek Mine allows for mineral exploration, but it must be coordinated with defense-related land uses. The Secretary of the Army is responsible for removing unexploded ordnance on mining lands, subject to available funds and in compliance with laws. The Secretary of the Army is required to submit an annual report on unexploded ordnance removal activities at Indian Creek Mine. The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of the Army will enter into an agreement to coordinate mining activities. The agreement will cover coordination of defense-related uses, mining, and unexploded ordnance removal at Indian Creek Mine. Graymont Western US, Inc. or its successors will be party to the agreement. Provisions will address joint-use of the Limestone Hills Training Area, scheduling of military and authorized land uses, and training with explosive materials. Provisions for scheduling training activities, liability for damages, periodic review of the agreement, access through mining operations, and removal of unexploded ordnance within the withdrawn area. The compatible joint use of the lands withdrawn and reserved by section 2 will be governed by the terms of the 2005 Memorandum of Agreement until a new agreement is in place. SEC. 5. GRAZING. The Secretary of the Interior manages grazing permits and leases on public lands withdrawn by section 2, following all relevant laws and regulations. Safety procedures for new permits must meet Department of the Army standards. The Secretary of the Interior can assign permit authority with the Secretary of the Army's agreement. The Secretary of the Interior can assign grazing permits and leases on lands withdrawn by section 2 to the Secretary of the Army, with the exception of discontinuing grazing activities. The military land withdrawal specified in section 2 will end on March 31, 2039. The withdrawn lands will still be eligible for entitlement under 31 U.S.C. 6901. Hunting, fishing, and trapping on these lands must comply with 10 U.S.C. 2671. Water rights will also be addressed. SEC. 9. WATER RIGHTS. This section clarifies that the Act does not establish a reservation of water rights for the United States on withdrawn lands, and water appropriation must comply with State law. It also does not affect any water rights previously acquired by the United States. SEC. 10. BRUSH AND RANGE FIRE PREVENTION AND SUPPRESSION. SEC. 10. The Secretary of the Army must prevent and suppress brush and range fires resulting from military activities on withdrawn lands. The Secretary of the Interior can assist in fire suppression and be reimbursed for costs. During the withdrawal and reservation, the Secretary of the Army will conduct decontamination of defense-related contamination on the lands, following Federal and State laws. The Secretary of Defense must report on these activities annually. Application for renewal of withdrawal and reservation is also addressed. The Secretary of the Army must notify the Secretary of the Interior about the need for defense-related lands five years before the withdrawal termination. If there is a continuing need, an application for extension must be filed. Notification copies are sent to relevant Senate and House committees. The Secretary of the Army must file an application for extension of the withdrawal and reservation of needed lands in accordance with Department of the Interior regulations. SEC. 13 states that when a withdrawal and reservation of lands is terminated, those lands cannot be appropriated under public land laws until the Secretary of the Interior specifies a date for their restoration. SEC. 14 discusses relinquishment. The Secretary of the Army must file a notice of intention to relinquish lands with the Secretary of the Interior during a withdrawal period. This notice must include a determination of contamination on the lands to be relinquished, which will be published in the Federal Register. Additionally, if lands are to be relinquished, they must be decontaminated. If land identified for relinquishment is contaminated, the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of the Army, may decide to decontaminate it if deemed practical and economically feasible. This would allow the land to be opened for public land laws, including mining and leasing laws, with funding allocated for decontamination. If land proposed for relinquishment is deemed contaminated and decontamination is not feasible or funded, the Secretary of the Interior is not obligated to accept the land. If contaminated lands are not accepted, they may remain withdrawn and reserved. The Secretary of the Army must warn the public about contaminated lands, only decontaminate them after withdrawal, and report actions taken to the Secretary of the Interior and Congress. The Secretary of the Interior has the authority to revoke withdrawal and reservation of lands, accepting them officially and opening them to public land laws, including mining laws. The Secretary is not obligated to accept the lands proposed for relinquishment. The Secretary of the Interior can accept lands for relinquishment if deemed unsuitable for public domain return, notifying Congress of the decision."
