It is illegal for those under 21 to purchase alcohol in all states. Young people start drinking around age 13, with a high percentage using alcohol by high school. College students also exhibit binge drinking behavior. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, in 1998, 10.4 million underage drinkers were reported, with 5.1 million being binge drinkers. The perceived harmfulness of LSD among 10th graders is 68.8%, while only 45.7% of 12th graders see a great risk in trying MDMA. Additionally, 31% of 10th graders find crack and cocaine easy to access. Underage drinking significantly impacts institutions. Underage drinking has a significant impact on higher education institutions. A study at Harvard University found that students who binge drank in high school were 3 times more likely to do so in college. Another study reported that over 2 million out of 8 million college students in the US drove under the influence of alcohol, with many experiencing unintentional injuries or assaults by intoxicated peers. According to a Boston University study, in 1998, over 1,400 college students aged 18-24 died from alcohol-related unintentional injuries. Additionally, more than 600,000 students in this age group are assaulted by intoxicated peers, 500,000 are unintentionally injured under the influence of alcohol, and over 70,000 are victims of alcohol-related sexual assault or date rape. (A) Cultural influences perpetuate student drinking patterns, with a high percentage of frequent binge drinkers citing drinking to get drunk as a key reason. (B) Drinking rates vary among college students based on living arrangements, with fraternities and sororities having the highest rates. (C) Institutions in areas with strict alcohol laws see restrictions on drinking volume through measures like keg registration and bans on happy hours and open containers in public. (E) A 2000 report by the Department of Health and Human Services notes that the social acceptance of alcohol use contributes to high rates of underage drinking, while societal expectations of binge drinking among young people can lead to dangerous alcohol consumption. (F) Collaborative efforts between colleges and communities can create a positive impact on the broader environment. According to a working paper, alcohol and marijuana use among college students are economic complements. The annual prevalence of illicit drug use at higher education institutions is 36 percent, with marijuana use at 34 percent. As alcohol usage decreases, marijuana usage is expected to decrease as well. The annual use of cocaine, LSD, and heroin is 4.8%, 4.5%, and 34% respectively. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include terms like \"binge drinking,\" \"institution of higher education,\" \"outlying area,\" \"Secretary,\" \"State,\" and \"statewide coalition.\" A statewide coalition is defined as a group that includes the entity designated by a State to apply for and administer grants under this Act, institutions of higher education, and substance abuse prevention groups. The coalition works towards reducing drug and alcohol abuse rates at a minimum of 50% of higher education institutions in the State and surrounding communities. The term \"surrounding community\" refers to the community surrounding an institution of higher education participating in a statewide coalition, where students from the institution are involved in the community and live in off-campus housing. The Act aims to establish statewide coalitions to reduce drug and alcohol use among college students on campus and in the surrounding community. Grants will be provided to support these efforts. Authorization of Appropriations: $50,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2004 and additional funds for the following 4 years.
