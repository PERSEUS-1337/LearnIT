    "content": "The Fair Pay Act of 2009, also known as the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, includes findings related to fair pay. Congress finds wage rate differentials based on sex, race, and national origin depress wages, hinder labor utilization, cause disputes, burden commerce, and constitute unfair competition. Discrimination in hiring and promotion is also noted. Discrimination in hiring and promotion has maintained a segregated workforce, with women and people of color often working in occupations dominated by individuals of their same sex, race, and national origin. Data from the United States Census Bureau in 2007 showed that women working full-time earned roughly 78 cents for every dollar earned by men. Despite accounting for key factors influencing earnings, a 20 percent pay gap remains unexplained, partially attributed to women earning less. Discrimination in compensation based on sex, race, and national origin persists despite laws prohibiting such practices. Eliminating these barriers would help address wage differentials and benefit the economy. The curr_chunk discusses the benefits of reducing wage differentials created by discrimination, such as decreasing the number of low-wage earners among women and people of color and promoting stable families by enabling fair pay for working family members.

The employer must show that these factors are job-related or serve a legitimate business purpose. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission shall issue guidelines outlining exceptions to wage discrimination based on sex, race, or national origin, including factors like seniority, merit, production-based earnings, education, or experience. The employer must demonstrate that these factors are job-related or serve a legitimate business purpose.
