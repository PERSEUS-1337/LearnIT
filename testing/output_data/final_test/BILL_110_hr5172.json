This amendment adds a new section to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, specifically addressing the distribution of recovery rebates to eligible individuals. The \"Immediate Financial Assistance for America's Seniors Act of 2008\" provides recovery rebates for eligible social security recipients in the first taxable year beginning in 2008. The credit amount is $300 ($600 for joint returns) and is subject to a reduction based on adjusted gross income exceeding $75,000 ($150,000 for joint returns). The \"Immediate Financial Assistance for America's Seniors Act of 2008\" provides recovery rebates for eligible social security recipients who received a social security benefit during the taxable year and have earned income less than $3,000. An eligible individual excludes nonresident aliens, individuals with a deduction under section 151 by another taxpayer, and estates or trusts. Earned income is defined as in section 32(c)(2) with modifications. The \"Immediate Financial Assistance for America's Seniors Act of 2008\" provides recovery rebates for eligible social security recipients with earned income less than $3,000. The credit allowable under this section is reduced by refunds and credits received under subsection (f). The \"Immediate Financial Assistance for America's Seniors Act of 2008\" provides recovery rebates for eligible social security recipients with earned income less than $3,000. Refunds or credits allowed under subsection (f) are split equally for joint returns. Individuals eligible in 2007 are treated as having made a payment against their tax for that year equal to the advance refund amount. The Secretary will refund or credit any overpayment promptly, with no interest allowed. The Treasury will compensate possessions with mirror code tax systems for losses due to the amendments made. The Secretary of the Treasury will make payments to possessions of the United States without mirror code tax systems, based on estimated benefits that would have been provided if a mirror code tax system was in place. Possessions must have an approved plan to receive these payments. The Treasury will distribute payments to possessions of the United States, including Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands. A \"mirror code tax system\" refers to the income tax system of a possession that mirrors the US tax laws for residents' income tax liability. The United States will treat payments under this subsection as a refund due from the credit allowed under section 6431 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Amendments are made to section 1324(b) of title 31, United States Code, and the table of contents for subchapter B of chapter 65 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. \"Sec. 6431. 2008 recovery rebates for certain individuals receiving social security benefits.\""
