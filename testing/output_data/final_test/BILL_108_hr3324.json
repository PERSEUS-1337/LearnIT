    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Voluntary Grazing Permit Buyout Act.\" It includes findings related to grazing permits. Congress finds that commercial livestock grazing on Federal lands is increasingly difficult due to conflicts with other land uses, such as environmental protection and recreational activities. Recreational use often leads to conflicts with grazing operations, making them uneconomical. Factors like sustained drought and industry changes also impact the grazing industry. The competition, changing markets, and individual ranch situations have made grazing permits and leases stranded investments for many. Many permittees and lessees want to retire but lack family successors. Resolving grazing conflicts with other uses increases costs significantly. Some Federal grazing allotments may become unsuitable for livestock production. The cost of the Federal grazing program exceeds expectations. The Federal grazing program costs more than it earns, leading many permittees to consider ending livestock grazing on Federal lands in exchange for compensation. This could revitalize rural America by providing economic opportunities for permittees to restructure their operations, start new businesses, or retire securely. A voluntary buyout program for grazing permits and leases can help alleviate the need for permittees to sell or subdivide their private lands, resolve conflicts between livestock grazing and other land uses, and provide economic opportunities for permittees to restructure their operations or retire securely. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"animal unit month\" is defined as the forage needed to sustain one animal unit for one month. \"Grazing permit or lease\" authorizes the use of Federal lands for grazing livestock. \"Grazing allotment\" is the designated portion of Federal land for livestock grazing. \"Permittee or lessee\" refers to a livestock operator with a valid grazing permit or lease. \"Range developments\" are structures and fixtures on Federal lands. The term \"range developments\" refers to fences and fixtures on Federal lands for grazing livestock, excluding rolling stock, livestock, and water diversions. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the appropriate government official overseeing the grazing permit or lease. SEC. 4. VOLUNTARY GRAZING PERMIT BUYOUT PROGRAM. The Secretary may cancel grazing permits and leases waived by permittees or lessees, retiring associated allotments from livestock grazing on Federal lands. Priority for waiver of permits and leases is given to lands within specific federal systems. The Secretary may cancel grazing permits and leases waived by permittees or lessees, retiring associated allotments from livestock grazing on Federal lands. Priority for waiver of permits and leases is given to lands within specific federal systems, including National Park System units, National Wildlife Refuge System units, National Trails System allotments, National Landscape Conservation System units, designated critical habitat for endangered species, wilderness study areas, Roadless Area Conservation areas, Bureau of Land Management Areas of Critical Environmental Concern, Research Natural Areas, and water quality limited streams. The Act allows for the cancellation of grazing permits and leases on Federal lands, prioritizing lands within specific federal systems. It also specifies criteria for identifying stream segments and allotments with scientific, ecological, scenic, watershed, or recreation values. The Act clarifies that eminent domain cannot be used to acquire Federal grazing permits or leases. SEC. 5. COMPENSATION FOR WAIVED GRAZING PERMIT OR LEASE. Compensation for waived grazing permit or lease is set at $175 per animal unit month based on the average grazing use over the preceding 10 years. Any arrears in Federal grazing fees will be deducted from the compensation. Permittees or lessees seeking to waive a grazing permit for a vacant allotment are eligible for compensation. The Act allows for compensation based on average grazing use over the last ten years, including nonuse years. Permittees or lessees can waive compensation and donate existing permits or leases, which will be canceled and retired from grazing use. The Act does not affect the Secretary's authority to modify or terminate permits without compensation, and compensation does not create a property right for permittees or lessees. SEC. 6. EFFECT OF WAIVER OR DONATION OF GRAZING PERMIT OR LEASE.\n\n(a) A permittee or lessee who waives a grazing permit or lease to the Secretary under section 4 and receives compensation, or donates a permit or lease, forfeits any claim to range developments on the allotments.\n\n(b) The Secretary must secure retired allotments from unauthorized livestock grazing.\n\n(c) Existing water rights and other valid rights are not affected by this Act. SEC. 7. The Secretary will not issue grazing permits for allotments without a valid permit or lease and will permanently retire them from livestock grazing use. SEC. 8. Permittees can choose not to graze or graze below minimum levels and still keep their permit. SEC. 9. Authorization of appropriation. SEC. 9. Authorization of appropriation for compensation to permittees and lessees under section 5, totaling $100,000,000, to remain available until expended. No funds shall be used for administrative costs related to this Act."
