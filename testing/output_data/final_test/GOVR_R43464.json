    "content": "A streetcar is a type of light rail public transportation that operates mostly in mixed traffic on rail lines embedded in streets and highways. Streetcar service is typically provided by single cars with electric power delivered by overhead wires known as catenaries. Streetcars can also draw power from underground cables or batteries. Streetcar lines are shorter with more frequent stops, making them slower compared to non-streetcar light rail systems. Streetcar systems can be categorized into legacy, heritage, and replica systems. In early 2014, there were 12 operating streetcar systems, 7 new systems under construction, and approximately 21 new systems in the planning stages. Some streetcar lines are associated with museums or cater primarily to tourists. Streetcar systems with the largest ridership include those in Philadelphia, New Orleans, San Francisco, Portland, OR, Tacoma, Memphis, and others. Streetcars in various cities like Philadelphia, New Orleans, and San Francisco provide high-quality transit service for short distances in urban areas. They can link to other transportation modes for the \"last mile\" of a trip. Streetcars aim to increase transit ridership by offering better service than buses, including frequency, predictability, capacity, and comfort. However, they can be delayed by issues like fallen catenaries or double-parked vehicles. Modern streetcars have greater capacity but may have drawbacks. Overall, streetcars can attract and focus development by providing a more permanent transportation option than buses, promoting a walkable environment, and reducing costs for private developers. For example, the Little Rock streetcar system led to an $800 million capital investment in new businesses, residences, and activities between 2000 and 2012. During construction, streetcars are less disruptive than other rail systems. Development along streetcar lines may be shifted from other parts of the urban area. Empirical research on this specific issue is lacking. Some streetcar lines have not stimulated property development. Supportive land use laws are necessary for streetcars to spur development. Government support, incentives, and zoning changes can aid in this process. Government support, incentives, and zoning changes play a crucial role in determining development around public transportation investments. Light rail transit and bus rapid transit (BRT) both lead to development, with BRT attracting more private investment per dollar. Streetcar systems are cost-effective in small to medium-sized cities where larger rail systems are not suitable. Capital costs per mile vary depending on project circumstances, with streetcars falling in the middle range. The cost of building streetcar projects in Portland, OR, and Seattle ranged from $30 million to $60 million per mile. Regular bus service improvements are likely the least costly way to increase transit capacity. Operating costs vary among modes, with no consistent advantage for BRT or light rail identified in a Government Accountability Office analysis. Streetcar operating costs were higher in only two out of seven cities compared to bus service. Streetcar operating costs were significantly higher than bus operating costs per passenger mile. Three main sources of funding for streetcar construction include the TIGER grant program, New Starts and Small Starts program, and federal-aid highway program funds. TIGER program has been the predominant federal support for streetcar construction due to discretionary funding and favoritism by the Obama Administration. The TIGER program has been a significant source of funding for streetcar projects, with $279 million awarded to nine projects. Funding amounts varied from $1.5 billion in FY2009 to $600 million in FY2014. Applications for FY2014 funding needed to be submitted by April 28, 2014. The New Starts and Small Starts program provides federal funds for transit systems' construction and expansion. It accounts for 18% of FTA's budget and is funded from the U.S. Treasury's general fund. MAP-21 authorized $1.9 billion for FY2013 and FY2014, with actual appropriations totaling $1.855 billion and $1.943 billion respectively. Additionally, unobligated funds from the former discretionary bus program were allocated for bus rapid transit projects in FY2014. The Small Starts program provides federal funds for transit projects requesting $75 million or less in assistance. Few streetcar projects have received funding under this program, with only one approved between October 2004 and June 2012. Changes in project evaluation by FTA may make it easier for streetcar projects to receive funding in the future. In December 2013, streetcar projects in Tempe, AZ, and Ft. Lauderdale, FL, were in the project development phase of the Small Starts process. The cost of time savings measure has been replaced by cost per rider as required by MAP-21. GAO's study excluded projects receiving less than $25 million in funding. Streetcar projects in Fort Worth, St. Louis, Charlotte, and Cincinnati were awarded $24.99 million each, while Dallas received $4.9 million in FY2010. The Obama Administration allocated $130 million in unallocated New Starts and Small Starts program funds for \"urban circulator\" projects like streetcars and bus rapid transit. The Urban Circulator grant program evaluated projects based on livability criteria, including transportation options, sustainability, and economic development. MAP-21 allows federal-aid highway funds to be used for public transportation projects, with funds coming from programs like the Surface Transportation Program and the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program. Many streetcar projects have utilized or plan to use these flexed funds. The streetcar projects, including the one in Tempe, AZ, are utilizing flexed funding such as $32.1 million from CMAQ, $56 million from New Starts and Small Starts program, and $41.24 million in local funding. Federal law limits the use of federal transit funds for operating expenses in urbanized areas with 200,000 or more residents, focusing on capital expenditures instead. However, some items like preventive maintenance are considered transit capital expenses. CMAQ funds can be used for operating expenses of streetcars, including fare subsidies and launching new services. Recent federal program changes, like the TIGER program and reforms favoring streetcars, are expected to increase support for streetcar projects in the future. Increased funding for New Starts and Small Starts programs could lead to more federal support for streetcar construction. One way to boost this support is by directing existing funding towards streetcar projects, such as reinstating set-asides for Small Starts projects. This would limit competition for funds and potentially benefit streetcar systems. Congress could support streetcar systems by allowing federal transit funds to cover operating costs, potentially by reinstating set-asides for Small Starts projects. This would limit competition for funds and benefit streetcar systems. Alternatively, Congress may reduce or eliminate federal funds for streetcar construction and operation by cutting funding for programs like TIGER, New Starts, and Small Starts, or by reinstating unfavorable evaluation criteria for streetcar projects. Reinstating evaluation criteria unfavorable to streetcar projects, such as using time savings or passenger miles instead of passenger trips, could make it easier to assess their mobility benefits."
