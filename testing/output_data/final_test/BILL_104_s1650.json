    "content": "The \"Fair Pay Act of 1995\" is cited in Section 1 as the short title of the Act. Any amendments or repeals in the Act refer to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Section 2 contains the findings of the Act. Congress finds wage differentials between equivalent jobs segregated by sex, race, and national origin in Government employment and industries engaged in commerce. These wage gaps depress wages, hinder labor utilization, cause disputes, burden commerce, and constitute unfair competition. Discrimination in hiring and promotion is also noted. Discrimination in hiring and promotion has maintained a segregated work force, with many women and people of color working in occupations dominated by individuals of their same sex, race, and national origin. Studies have shown wage differentials between white and non-white workers, with a significant portion unexplained and potentially due to discrimination. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination in compensation based on race, color, religion, national origin, and sex. The Supreme Court's decision in County of Washington v. Gunther extended this prohibition to jobs that may not be considered \"equal work\" under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Clarification of existing legislation is needed to fully implement the Court's ruling. Artificial barriers to eliminating discrimination in compensation based on sex, race, and national origin persist despite legislation passed in 1938 and 1964. Removing these barriers would have positive effects on the economy, reduce reliance on public assistance, and promote stable families. SEC. 3. EQUAL PAY FOR EQUIVALENT JOBS. Amendment to Section 6 (29 U.S.C. 206) prohibits wage discrimination based on sex, race, or national origin within an establishment. Different wages are allowed based on seniority or merit systems. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issues guidelines for determining if a job is dominated by a specific sex, race, or national origin. Employers cannot reduce wages to comply with wage discrimination laws. Labor organizations cannot cause employers to discriminate against employees. The curr_chunk discusses the administration and enforcement of withholding amounts owed to employees in violation of minimum wage and overtime laws. It defines terms like \"labor organization\" and \"equivalent jobs.\" The curr_chunk discusses amendments to labor laws regarding skills, effort, responsibility, and working conditions. Section 13(a) is amended to include new provisions. The curr_chunk discusses prohibited acts, while the prev_chunk focuses on amendments to labor laws regarding skills, effort, responsibility, and working conditions. The curr_chunk introduces new paragraphs amending Section 15(a) (29 U.S.C. 215(a)) to prohibit discrimination against individuals who oppose unlawful acts, make charges, testify, or participate in investigations. It also prohibits discrimination against employees who inquire about wages or discuss them. The curr_chunk prohibits employees from exercising or encouraging others to exercise rights granted by section 6(g). SEC. 5. REMEDIES. Amends Section 16 to allow expert fees in actions for violation of section 6(g) and permits class actions. Amends subsection (b) to include additional sections and clarifies exceptions for class actions. Technical Amendment to Section 11(c) requires employers subject to section 6(g) to preserve records documenting wage calculations. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will set regulations for record-keeping and reporting. Every employer subject to section 6(g) with 25 or more employees in the first or second year after the effective date, or 15 or more employees in subsequent years, must file a report with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission detailing wage rates by classification, position, or job title, including employee demographics. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission requires employers with 25 or more employees to file reports detailing wage rates by classification, position, or job title to protect employee confidentiality. The Commission may publish information obtained from these reports. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission can use information from reports filed by employers for statistical and research purposes. They may compile and publish studies, analyses, reports, and surveys based on the data. Regulations allow for inspection and examination of the reports by any person, with copies available for a fee. The Commission is also authorized to issue rules for implementing the Act. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission can issue rules and regulations for reports required from employers to prevent evasion of reporting requirements. The Commission may also simplify reports for employers where detailed reporting is burdensome due to their size. SEC. 7. RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM; REPORT TO CONGRESS. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will provide information and assistance to address wage discrimination based on sex, race, or national origin in equivalent jobs. This includes research, education, and technical support to eliminate such discrimination. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will take steps to correct conditions leading to section 6(g) violations by publishing findings, sponsoring educational programs, and providing technical assistance to promote compliance. The annual report to Congress will include an evaluation of these efforts. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will provide an evaluation and appraisal of the implementation of section 6(g) in the annual report to Congress. SEC. 8. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS. Amends sections of the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995. SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE. The amendments will take effect 1 year after enactment."
