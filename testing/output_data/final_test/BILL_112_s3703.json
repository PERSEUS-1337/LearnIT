    "content": "The \"Data Cap Integrity Act of 2012\" requires clear information for consumers purchasing Internet services, including cost, upload/download speeds, service limits, contract terms, and legal/privacy policies. Congress urges the FCC to ensure transparency in service descriptions. The \"Data Cap Integrity Act of 2012\" defines terms like Commission, covered Internet service provider, and data cap. It prohibits Internet service providers from imposing data caps without certification. The \"Data Cap Integrity Act of 2012\" prohibits Internet service providers from imposing data caps on consumers unless certified by the Commission to adhere to accurate measurement standards for household data usage. The Commission must evaluate data caps proposed by Internet service providers, ensuring accurate measurement standards for household data usage. Public comment on proposed standards must be considered before finalizing them. The Commission evaluates data caps proposed by Internet service providers to limit network congestion without discouraging Internet use. Certification is provided if accurate measurement standards are met. The covered Internet service provider must not discriminate content based on data source or type. Consumers must be provided with tools to monitor and control data usage from the first day of service. The Internet service provider must control uploads and downloads on all devices with Internet access. If necessary tools are not available commercially, the provider must offer them to the consumer on the first day of service. The Commission will establish a procedure for individuals to file complaints regarding data measurement accuracy in relation to data caps by Internet service providers. The Commission has the authority to impose civil penalties on Internet service providers for inaccurately measuring data use in relation to data caps. A \"Data Cap Integrity Fund\" is established in the Treasury of the United States for this purpose. The Commission collects civil penalties from Internet service providers for inaccurate data measurement, which are deposited into a fund. The fund is used to compensate individuals who file complaints due to data measurement errors by providers. Any excess funds over $5,000,000 are transferred annually after September 30, 2013. Excess balances over $5,000,000 will be transferred to the Treasury's General Fund for deficit reduction. The Commission must create regulations within a year of the Act's enactment to implement this section."
