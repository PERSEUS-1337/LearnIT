    "content": "Since the mid-1980s, budget experts have debated whether to measure the subsidy cost of federal credit (direct loans or loan guarantees) based on the cost to the government or the fair value cost. The cost to the government reflects the actual budget cost, while the fair value cost estimate includes market risk and the opportunity cost of shifting capital from the private sector to the public. The U.S. government uses federal credit to allocate financial capital to various sectors, including home ownership, student loans, small business, agriculture, and energy. Federal credit involves direct loans and loan guarantees, with outstanding direct loans totaling $838 billion and outstanding guaranteed loans totaling $2,017 billion by the end of FY2011. The debate continues on whether to use the social cost or budgetary cost to allocate resources between the public and private sectors. At the end of FY2011, federal credit totaled $2.855 trillion, with direct loans at $838 billion and guaranteed loans at $2,017 billion. Low Treasury interest rates from FY2009 to FY2011 led to negative costs of federal credit, reducing federal deficits. The debate on fair value budgeting has been fueled by these negative costs over the past three fiscal years. Six bills in the 112th Congress propose using fair value accounting for subsidy cost calculations. The debate on fair value budgeting for federal credit programs has been fueled by negative costs over the past three fiscal years. Several bills in the 112th Congress propose using fair value accounting for subsidy cost calculations, including S. 1651 / H.R. 3414 (Honest Budget Act), H.R. 3581 (Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2011), H.R. 3844 (Honest Budget Act of 2012), House Fiscal Year 2012 Budget Resolution (H.Con.Res. 34), and House Fiscal Year 2013 Budget Resolution (H.Con.Res. 112). Before FY1992, federal credit programs were measured on an annual cash flow basis. The budgetary cost of a loan program in a fiscal year is the net cash flow, including new loans and administrative expenses, less loan fees, repayments, and interest payments. Federal acceptance of a contingent liability for loan guarantees does not impact the budget unless cash flow occurs. Administrative costs for guarantee programs are considered outlays in the fiscal year they occur. Fees charged to recipients are offsetting collections. Federal outlays to compensate lenders for default losses covered by guarantees are not budgeted until paid. The budgetary cost of federal credit was difficult to monitor accurately using the old cash-flow method. Policymakers struggled to make informed decisions as agencies could understate costs through budgetary techniques. To address this, Congress and the executive branch debated converting to accrual accounting. One key decision was whether to measure the cost of federal credit by the \"cost to the government\" or the \"fair value\" cost. The cost to the government approach measures the actual budget cost by discounting expected cash flows at the interest rate on risk-free Treasury securities. It includes credit flows for loan programs and loan guarantee programs, adjusting for defaults, prepayments, fees, penalties, and recoveries. This concept would measure the subsidy cost in an equivalent budgetary method for a grant or tax expenditure. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, signed by President George H. W. Bush, introduced the fair value cost approach to measure the cost of government assistance programs. This method considers the cost that credit recipients would have paid on the private credit market, including market risk and opportunity cost. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 introduced the fair value cost approach to measure the cost of government assistance programs, changing the methodology for federal direct loans and loan guarantees. The debate continues on whether the cost to the government or fair value cost is more appropriate, with the issue remaining unresolved since the 1980s. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 introduced the fair value cost approach to measure subsidy costs by comparing private financing terms with federal credit terms. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act of 1985 required all new direct loans and loan guarantees to be on-budget, sparking interest in budgetary reforms for federal credit recording. This led to proposed legislation and research in legislative, executive branch agencies, and the academic community. The Reagan Administration proposed credit reform in 1987 with the Federal Credit Reform Act. Senators Chiles and Domenici revised the proposal, measuring subsidy costs differently. The Administration aimed to sell loans on private markets, while the Chiles-Domenici proposal focused on the cost to the federal government. The Administration's proposal aimed to sell loans on private credit markets, measuring subsidy costs as the difference between face value and selling price. Credit subsidies would be objectively measured by market forces, with reinsurance for most loan guarantees. The Chiles-Domenici proposal, in contrast, focused on estimating subsidy costs by the Treasury Secretary, prohibiting loan sales and guarantee reinsurance. The Chiles-Domenici proposal aimed to establish a federal credit management agency in the Treasury Department to estimate subsidy costs as cost to the government. The General Accounting Office issued a report on credit reform proposals, recommending a \"cost-to-the-government\" model for measuring loan subsidy costs. The Chiles-Domenici proposal suggested creating a federal credit management agency in the Treasury Department to estimate subsidy costs as cost to the government. The General Accounting Office recommended a \"cost-to-the-government\" model for measuring loan subsidy costs, while CBO and OMB prefer a market-valuation approach. OMB believes the economic subsidy offered to borrowers is crucial and proposes including this measure in the federal budget. The GAO prefers the cost-to-the-government measure of credit subsidy costs over market-valuation subsidy costs, as it reflects future cash outlays and avoids overestimating the actual cost to the government. In December 1989, the CBO published a report on federal credit reform proposals, discussing methods of calculating subsidy costs and the importance of selecting the appropriate discount rate. The report discusses the use of Treasury borrowing rates for discounting future cash flows on credit contracts, highlighting that Treasury debt is considered risk-free and using a risk-free rate to discount uncertain future cash flows is unique to the government. Others, like banks, typically use a higher rate to discount risky income. Advocates argue that the risk-free rate reflects the government's actual cost of providing credit assistance. The report discusses the use of Treasury borrowing rates for valuing federal loans, advocating for a risk-free rate to discount cash flows. Others suggest using market rates to capture opportunity costs and distinguish costs of assets with different risks. Data deficiencies were noted in subsidy cost calculations. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) changed the budget methodology for federal loans and guarantees from cash flow to accrual accounting. It aimed to measure costs more accurately, align credit program costs with other federal spending, deliver benefits appropriately, and improve resource allocation. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) aimed to measure costs more accurately, align credit program costs with other federal spending, deliver benefits appropriately, and improve resource allocation. Some experts advocated for using fair value cost instead of taxpayer cost in measuring credit subsidies. CBO examined risk-adjusted discount rates and options-pricing methods to include market price for risk in federal credit subsidies. The risk-adjusted discount rate (ADR) method adds a spread to Treasury rates to discount expected cash flows, resulting in a higher cost measurement. The ADR method adds a spread to Treasury rates to discount expected cash flows associated with a loan. An options-pricing method is more accurate but requires necessary data and models. Options-pricing models are rarely used for valuing credit for individuals, while ADR method is usually appropriate. Option-pricing methods are better for valuing credit for commercial enterprises. The options-pricing method is more accurate than ADR methods for valuing credit for commercial enterprises. CBO used this method to calculate the risk-adjusted cost of federal loan guarantees for Chrysler and America West Airlines. The market-value loss for the Chrysler loan guarantee was $239.0 million, and for AWA, it was $26.3 million. President Obama established the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform in 2010 to address fiscal challenges. The President's fiscal commission recommended a review of budget scoring practices to accurately reflect government liabilities. Representative Paul Ryan introduced the Fiscal Year 2012 Budget Resolution in response to the nation's fiscal challenges. The Fiscal Year 2012 Budget Resolution, H.Con.Res. 34, 112th Congress, supported fair value accounting by requiring estimates of market values for assets and liabilities. It passed the House but was rejected in the Senate. Representative Scott Garrett introduced the Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2011. H.R. 3581, the Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2011, was passed by the House on February 7, 2012. The act includes a provision to calculate federal credit subsidy costs on a \"fair value\" basis. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities issued a report opposing the bill, stating that it would artificially inflate federal credit program costs and force policy makers to offset phantom costs with phantom offsets. The authors argue that individuals are risk averse due to the need for their financial assets at specific times, while the government can borrow inexpensively in bad times. They also state that adding a risk-aversion adjustment to the budget would be a phantom cost not incurred by the government. Additionally, they highlight the need for budget transparency in allocating public funds. The Transparency Act of 2011 creates phantom costs and offsets in budget accounting, leading to overstated deficits and diverging debt amounts over time. The authors argue against including risk-aversion costs in budget accounting but suggest considering them in cost-benefit analysis for policymakers. The Transparency Act of 2011 introduces phantom costs in budget accounting, leading to overstated deficits. Robert D. Reischauer opposes fair value accounting in H.R. 3581, stating it adds additional costs on top of cash flows. This reflects a cost to society due to the possibility of credit programs costing more than estimated. Professor Phaup commented on H.R. 3581, highlighting that it would remove \"phantom\" budgetary gains from direct lending and loan guarantee programs. He argued that these illusory gains mislead policymakers and encourage budget gimmickry. For example, the government could balance its budget on paper by issuing Treasury debt to invest in risky loans, resulting in no change to its net financial position. According to Professor Phaup, the government's current practice of valuing risky loans using Treasury securities prices could lead to misleading budget gains. He argues that the cost of market risk should be considered a budget cost, as it affects government stakeholders. Phaup suggests including this cost in cost-benefit analyses but not in the budget itself. He believes budgeting without an evaluation function is merely projecting Treasury's borrowing requirements. Additionally, he argues that the cost of market risk should not be excluded from the budget. In the President's Budget for FY2013, the Office of Management and Budget analyzed \"Fair Value Budgeting for Credit Programs.\" They compared the current cost estimation method with fair value budgeting, which considers social costs. The fair value method discounts cash flows with a market rate reflecting the loan's characteristics, instead of Treasury rates. This approach takes different risks and costs into account for a more accurate cost estimation. The fair value method discounts cash flows with a market rate reflecting the loan's characteristics, instead of Treasury rates. This approach considers different risks and costs for a more accurate cost estimation. However, there are conceptual and practical issues to address in implementing fair value proposals for credit programs. Key issues include developing accurate estimation methods, comparability of cost estimates across programs, and agencies' ability to implement fair value with limited resources. The fair value method for credit programs considers various factors such as time preference, expected loss from default, uncertainty premium, liquidity premium, administering costs, tax rates, and contract terms. OMB and CBO have addressed the challenges and benefits of implementing fair value accounting for federal credit programs. CBO supports fair value accounting for federal credit programs, stating that it would better reflect the true cost to the government. However, fair value accounting may be challenging due to the lack of exact analogues in the private sector, leading to approximations and increased volatility in estimates over time. Fair-value accounting for federal credit programs may be more volatile over time due to market risk fluctuations. CBO suggests addressing concerns by seeking expert advice and establishing federal guidelines for estimation procedures. Currently, fair-value accounting is applied in limited cases, such as the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The CBO has conducted studies for Congress on federal credit program costs using fair value accounting. Data shows a significant impact on the deficit, with subsidy costs being negative in recent years. Representative Paul Ryan introduced a budget resolution with a fair value provision, which passed the House. The Budget Office can provide a supplemental estimate of the fair value of assets and liabilities affected by a measure upon request. This estimate can be used to determine compliance with budgetary controls. Debate on fair value budgeting continues."
