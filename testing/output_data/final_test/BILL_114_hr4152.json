    "content": "The \"Cardiac Arrest Survival Act of 2015\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress finds that establishing a nationally uniform baseline of protection from civil liability for persons using automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in medical emergencies will encourage more AED deployment and ultimately save lives lost to cardiac arrest. The current state \"Good Samaritan\" laws are incomplete, inconsistent, and inadequate in providing protection for entities acquiring or deploying AEDs. Concerns about liability are inhibiting the widespread deployment of AEDs, especially for entities with operations in multiple states. A nationally uniform baseline of protection is needed for persons using AEDs in medical emergencies to encourage their deployment and save lives lost to cardiac arrest. SEC. 3. Liability regarding emergency use of automated external defibrillators is addressed in an amendment to the Public Health Service Act. Liability protection for individuals using automated external defibrillator devices in emergencies, as well as for premises owners where the device is used, is granted under the Public Health Service Act. Liability protection is granted under the Public Health Service Act for individuals using automated external defibrillator devices in emergencies. Owners of the device are immune from civil liability unless harm is caused by failure to maintain the device properly. The term 'owner-acquirer' refers to a person who owns or possesses an AED used in a medical emergency. Immunity is granted regardless of signage, registration, or compliance with warnings when using the AED. The use of an AED in a medical emergency grants immunity to the person using it if they have received training or were assisted by another person. However, immunity does not apply in cases of willful misconduct, gross negligence, or conscious indifference to the victim's safety. The immunity granted to individuals using an automated external defibrillator (AED) in a medical emergency applies if they are licensed health professionals, employees of healthcare entities, or owners who leased the device to a healthcare entity. This immunity does not cover cases of willful misconduct, gross negligence, or conscious indifference to the victim's safety. The section provides immunity from civil liability for individuals using an automated external defibrillator (AED) in a medical emergency if they are licensed health professionals, employees of healthcare entities, or owners who leased the device to a healthcare entity. It does not establish a cause of action or preempt state laws regarding AED placement. This section preempts State laws allowing civil liability when immunity is provided. It does not waive liability protection for Federal officers or employees. The text discusses the alternative benefits provided by the United States under Federal law, including civil actions for liability that arise under Federal law in geographic areas under Federal jurisdiction. In civil actions arising under State law, the courts of the State have jurisdiction to apply the provisions of this section. The application of this section in a civil action does not establish Federal court jurisdiction over the action. For the purposes of this section of title 28, United States Code, a perceived medical emergency is defined as circumstances where an individual's behavior indicates a life-threatening medical condition requiring immediate medical attention for heart or cardiopulmonary issues. Additionally, an automated external defibrillator device (AED) is defined as a defibrillator device meeting specific criteria outlined in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The term 'cautionary signage' refers to markings on an AED indicating its ability to recognize ventricular fibrillation, determine the need for defibrillation, and deliver an electrical shock in automated mode. The term 'harm' includes physical, nonphysical, economic, and noneconomic losses, with economic loss defined as any pecuniary loss resulting from harm and noneconomic losses referring to losses beyond pecuniary measures. The term 'noneconomic losses' encompasses various nonpecuniary losses such as pain, suffering, impairment, mental anguish, disfigurement, and loss of enjoyment of life."
