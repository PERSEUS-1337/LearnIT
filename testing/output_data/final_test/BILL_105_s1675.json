    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Congressional Office of Regulatory Analysis Act\". Congress finds that Federal regulations can have a positive impact on protecting the environment and the health and safety of Americans, but uncontrolled increases in regulatory costs on the economy are unsustainable. The legislative branch must ensure proper implementation of laws by the executive branch, and effective implementation of congressional review of agency rulemaking is crucial in controlling the regulatory burden on the economy. Accurate and reliable information is necessary for the legislative branch to fulfill its responsibilities under title 5 of the United States Code.
