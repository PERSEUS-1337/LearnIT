The Secretary of Transportation will issue a final rule within a year of enactment. Additionally, the Act mandates a GAO study. The Comptroller General must submit a report to specific committees within a year of this Act's enactment, reviewing the computer network architecture and critical functions of air carriers operating under part 121 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations. The report will also analyze the impact of consolidated systems and software. The report will analyze the impact of consolidated systems and software handling multiple critical functions in airline computer networks, identify common causes of disruptions, and recommend industry best practices to prevent and mitigate network disruptions. SEC. 4. COMPUTER NETWORK RESILIENCY. The Secretary of Transportation may consider schedule changes due to computer network disruptions as events within an air carrier's control. A working group will collaborate to enhance airline computer networks. Within a year of this Act, the Secretary must publish a final rule mandating air carriers to submit plans for maintaining critical computer network systems. The airline industry must submit a contingency plan for maintaining critical computer network systems to the FAA within a year of the establishment of the working group. The plan should include details on system functionality, restoration in case of disruptions, backup systems, and passenger services during delays or cancellations. The airline industry must submit a contingency plan for critical computer network systems to the FAA, but the plan cannot disclose specifics to the public. Instead, a general outline of the plan should be made available to the public. The Airline Industry Computer Network Resiliency Working Group is established. The Secretary of Transportation establishes the airline industry computer network resiliency working group to improve network resilience for air carriers. Objectives include promoting communication and coordination on network architecture and engaging industry and government stakeholders on guidelines and best practices. The airline industry computer network resiliency working group aims to enhance network resilience by promoting communication, reviewing past disruptions, and serving as a liaison between industry and government representatives. Membership includes Government officials from the Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Homeland Security, as well as voluntary participation from the airline industry and their contractors. Meetings are held at least twice a year, with additional meetings as needed. The airline industry computer network resiliency working group meets at least twice a year for a period of not less than 2 years. They submit a report to the Secretary of Transportation with voluntary guidelines for network resiliency, best practices, and conditions for future meetings. SEC. 6. IMPROVED ACCOMMODATION OF DISPLACED PASSENGERS. The Secretary of Transportation must update regulations within a year to require airlines to have contingency plans for delays and cancellations at various airports, ensuring passengers are accommodated in case of involuntary denied boarding. The Administration of the Federal Aviation Administration must ensure essential needs are met for passengers, including food, water, restroom facilities, and medical assistance. In case of a delay exceeding 4 hours, the airline must provide a meal voucher or cash equivalent. An air carrier is required to provide meal vouchers or cash equivalent to passengers for delays exceeding 2 hours between 10 p.m. and 3 a.m. if the delay is within the carrier's control. Passengers must accept compensation when offered to be eligible for reimbursement of meal expenses. An air carrier must provide lodging, transportation, and meal expenses to passengers if there is a delay of more than 2 hours with no guarantee of reaccommodation on another flight within the following 2 hours. Alternatively, the carrier can compensate the passenger with cash or a voucher for future travel if lodging is unavailable. If lodging is unavailable, an air carrier must compensate a passenger with cash or a voucher for lodging, meals, and transportation. This does not apply if the passenger lives within 60 miles of the airport. The carrier cannot force the passenger to accept the initial compensation. An air carrier is not liable to reimburse a passenger for meal expenses if the passenger refused compensation when offered. SEC. 7. AIRCRAFT FLIGHTS WITHOUT FUNCTIONING LAVATORIES. The Secretary of Transportation must issue regulations within 90 days to ensure passengers on certain aircraft flights do not pay a fee to select an alternative flight if the lavatory is not functioning."
