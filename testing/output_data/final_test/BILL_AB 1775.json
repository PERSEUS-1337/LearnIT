    "title": "AB 1775",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 18601 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to require taxpayers subject to the tax imposed by Part 11 to file a return with the Franchise Tax Board by the 15th day of the fourth month following the close of the taxable year. The return must disclose all necessary facts for the taxable year as specified by the Board. Returns for cooperative associations are due by the 15th day of the ninth month after the close of the taxable year. For taxpayers with short periods, the due date is aligned with the federal tax return deadline. S corporations must file returns by the 15th day of the third month after the close of the taxable year. For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1997, S corporations must provide shareholders with a copy of the information shown on the return. Shareholders must treat Subchapter S items consistently with the corporate return, unless the shareholder's treatment may be inconsistent. The corporation must provide shareholders with a copy of the information shown on the return. Shareholders must file a statement with the Franchise Tax Board if there is an inconsistency. Shareholders can comply by demonstrating consistency with the corporate return and electing to apply the provision. In cases where a shareholder fails to comply with the requirements for consistent treatment of items on the corporate return, any necessary adjustments will be treated as a mathematical error and handled under Section 19051. \"Subchapter S item\" refers to items of an S corporation determined at the corporation level rather than the shareholder level. The penalties under Article 7 apply to shareholder negligence in connection with this section. The amendments apply to returns for taxable years starting on or after January 1, 2016. Section 18633 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is being amended. Section 18633 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to require partnerships to file a return stating gross income, deductions, and distributive shares of partners by the 15th day of the third month after the taxable year ends. The return must be verified under penalty of perjury. Limited partnerships subject to the tax imposed by Section 17935 must file a return by the 15th day of the third month after the taxable year ends, containing specific information. The Franchise Tax Board will determine how out-of-state limited partnerships should include this information in their returns. Each partnership must provide partners with a copy of the information shown on their tax return by the filing deadline. Nominees holding an interest in a partnership must disclose the partner's information to the Franchise Tax Board and provide the partner with the information received from the partnership. Section 6031(d) and (f) of the Internal Revenue Code apply, along with amendments for taxable years starting on or after January 1, 2016. Section 18633.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended. Every limited liability company classified as a partnership for California tax purposes must file its return by the 15th day of the third month after the close of its taxable year. The return should detail gross income, deductions, and the distributive share of each person entitled to the net income. The return must be verified under penalty of perjury by a member of the limited liability company. For returns filed on or after January 1, 1998, the Franchise Tax Board will specify how information must be included with the return for businesses subject to the tax imposed by Section 17941. Each limited liability company must provide information to individuals holding an interest in the company, as required by the Franchise Tax Board. Nominees holding an interest for another person must also furnish necessary information to the company as prescribed by the Franchise Tax Board. The limited liability company must provide information to individuals holding an interest, and nominees must furnish necessary information to the company as prescribed by the Franchise Tax Board. Section 6031(d) of the Internal Revenue Code applies to the separate statement of items of unrelated business taxable income. A limited liability company must file agreements from nonresident members with their tax return, agreeing to pay taxes to California and be subject to jurisdiction for tax collection. Failure to file agreements results in the company paying taxes on behalf of nonresident members. A limited liability company must timely file and pay taxes on behalf of nonresident members based on their distributive share of income to the state. The company can recover the payment from the member for whom it was made. If a limited liability company fails to attach the agreement or pay the required payment, it will be considered the tax of the company for penalty and interest purposes. Payment of the penalty and interest will extinguish the liability of a nonresident member. No penalty or interest will be imposed if the nonresident member timely files and pays all taxes imposed by the state. Any agreement of a nonresident member must be filed when the limited liability company files its annual return. Any payment made by the company to the state on behalf of a nonresident member will be considered a payment towards the member's income tax liability. Every limited liability company classified as a corporation for California tax purposes must file a tax return and pay applicable taxes. LLCs doing business in the state, organized or registered with the Secretary of State, must file a return with necessary information, owner's details, consent to California tax jurisdiction, and other required information for tax administration. The limited liability company must pay on behalf of its owner if consent is not included, similar to the amount paid for a nonresident member. The tax return must be filed by the 15th day of the fourth month after the owner's taxable year. Section 23281 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to specify the filing deadline for tax returns of certain entities like S corporations, partnerships, and limited liability companies. The amendments made in 2005 apply to taxable years starting from January 1, 2005, while those made in 2016 apply to taxable years starting from January 1, 2016. Section 23281 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to address the tax implications for taxpayers who cease to do business within the state. If a taxpayer stops doing business in a taxable year but does not dissolve or withdraw from the state, and does not resume business the following year, their tax upon resuming business prior to January 1, 2000, will be based on either the net income when they ceased business or the minimum tax prescribed in Section 23153. When a taxpayer ceases business in California but does not dissolve or withdraw, and then resumes business in a later taxable year, the tax due will be based on their net income when they stopped doing business or the minimum tax in Section 23153. The tax is payable when the corporation resumes business or by the due date of their return, whichever is later. This does not apply to corporations subject to Chapter 3 after ceasing business in the state. The amendments to this section apply to taxable years starting on or after January 1, 2016."
