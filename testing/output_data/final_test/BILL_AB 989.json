    "title": "AB 989",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 786 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to dismiss petitions for minors who complete certain programs or probation successfully. Records related to the dismissed petition will be sealed, with limited access for specific purposes. The probation department can access sealed records for minors with new felony petitions to determine eligibility for programs. The court can access sealed files to verify jurisdictional status for a ward petitioning for court jurisdiction. The probation department, law enforcement agencies, and other local agencies can access sealed records for specific purposes without releasing personally identifying information. Access authorizations do not unseal the record or require notice to other entities. The court can enforce civil judgments for unfulfilled restitution orders even if a minor's records are sealed. Victims and collection programs can also enforce restitution orders and fines after records are sealed, with the juvenile court having access to sealed records for enforcement purposes. Section 786 of the Welfare and Institutions Code allows the Department of Social Services to monitor and evaluate federal programs under Title IV-B and Title IV-E without prohibition. If a minor successfully completes a program of supervision or probation, the court will dismiss the petition and seal all related records held by various agencies. The court will specify a date for the destruction of the sealed records and notify the minor and their counsel of the order. The court will notify the minor and their counsel of the dismissal of the petition and sealing of records, including the minor's right to nondisclosure. Upon court's dismissal of the petition, all arrest and proceedings are deemed not to have occurred, allowing the individual to respond accordingly to inquiries about the case. Upon satisfactory completion of an informal program of supervision or probation, with no new findings of wardship or convictions for certain offenses, the petition may be dismissed, and records sealed. Unfulfilled restitution orders do not affect completion of supervision or probation. The court may seal a record and dismiss a petition, including any prior petitions, if certain criteria are met. Offenses committed at age 14 or older listed in Section 707 cannot be sealed unless dismissed or reduced to a lesser offense. An individual with an eligible record can request the court to seal a record held by a public agency for successful reentry. The sealed record can only be accessed by specific entities for limited purposes. The court can access information for verifying jurisdictional status of a ward petitioning to resume jurisdiction. The probation department can access information for identifying previous court-ordered programs or placements of a minor facing a new felony offense, solely for determining eligibility for remedial programs. Upon subsequent adjudication of a minor with a sealed record, access to the record is allowed for determining appropriate juvenile court disposition for felony offenses. This access does not reverse or modify the court's order to seal the record. Access to sealed records can be granted upon request by the person whose record is sealed or by the probation department for specific compliance purposes. This access does not affect the court's order to seal the record. Access to sealed records authorized by paragraph (1) does not unseal the record and does not require notice to other agencies. Courts can enforce civil judgments for unfulfilled restitution orders, even if the minor's records are sealed. Victims and collection programs can still enforce restitution orders and fines after records are sealed, and the juvenile court can access sealed records for enforcing civil judgments or restitution orders. The Department of Social Services can monitor and evaluate federal programs without restrictions. The Judicial Council will establish rules for juvenile courts to implement this section. Section 1.5 of the bill includes amendments to Section 786 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, contingent on the enactment of both this bill and Assembly Bill 666 before January 1, 2016. If this bill is enacted after Assembly Bill 666, Section 1 of this bill will not take effect."
