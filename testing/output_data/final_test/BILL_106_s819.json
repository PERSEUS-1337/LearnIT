    "content": "The \"National Park Preservation Act\" is cited as the short title. A portion of Outer Continental Shelf revenues is dedicated to the National Park Service. The \"National Park Preservation Act\" allocates a portion of Outer Continental Shelf revenues to the National Park Service. The Act defines terms like \"leased tract\" and \"outer Continental Shelf.\" The term \"outer Continental Shelf revenues\" includes royalties, net profit share payments, and late-payment interest from natural gas and oil leases. The term \"outer Continental Shelf revenues\" excludes certain lease types and areas with leasing moratoriums. $500,000,000 of these revenues each fiscal year go into a separate Treasury account for the Secretary of the Interior to use without further appropriation. The Secretary of the Interior can use outer Continental Shelf revenues for National Park System units with threatened ecosystems or resources. The funds can address identified threats through various means like land acquisition or partnerships with other agencies. The Secretary of the Interior can allocate funds from outer Continental Shelf revenues to National Park System units. 30% is for units with threatened ecosystems inside the unit, and 70% is for units with threats outside the unit. The Federal government allocated funds for the Everglades and South Florida ecosystem restoration project from 2000 to 2015. A conforming amendment was made to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act."
