    "content": "The report focuses on the demographics of unaccompanied alien children from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras in removal proceedings. After being apprehended by CBP, children are transferred to ORR for placement in appropriate care. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) is responsible for placing unaccompanied alien children in appropriate care, ensuring their interests are considered. ORR oversees residential facilities and arranges housing or reunification with family members. Data on placement trends from FY2011 to FY2014 are analyzed, using selected variables due to the confidential nature of ORR data. The FY2014 data, although partial, show that El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras have consistently had the most unaccompanied children in ORR custody. Honduras saw a significant increase in unaccompanied children, while even the smallest increase from El Salvador was notable. The increase in unaccompanied children in ORR custody from El Salvador was significant, with a 463% rise from FY2011 to the first seven months of FY2014. Not all apprehended children are transferred to ORR, as some are voluntarily returned to their home countries. Age is a key factor in qualifying as an unaccompanied alien child under the law. The median age of unaccompanied children in ORR custody has decreased from 17 to 16 years old in recent years. Younger age groups (0-9, 10-12, 13-15) have seen more growth compared to older age groups (16-17, 18, 19+). Older children may have entered shortly before turning 18 or have special needs keeping them in custody. In recent years, there has been a decrease in the median age of unaccompanied children in ORR custody from 17 to 16 years old. There has been a notable increase in younger children, particularly in the 10-12 age group, in ORR custody. From FY2011 to FY2014, there was a rise in the number of children in the 0-9, 10-12, and 13-15 age brackets for Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Honduras had the youngest children making up over half of all Honduran unaccompanied children. Guatemala had an increase in the younger age brackets but also had the most unaccompanied children in the oldest age brackets. The number of unaccompanied children in ORR custody has seen an increase in females, with a rise from 1,075 in FY2011 to 5,385 in FY2013. The percentage of females among unaccompanied children has also grown, reaching about 33% in the first seven months of FY2014. The majority of unaccompanied children in ORR custody are from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. In ORR custody, the sex distribution among children from top countries like Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador was examined. A higher proportion of females originated from El Salvador compared to Honduras, while a lower proportion came from Guatemala. Honduras had the most females in custody and the highest number of minors overall. The number of males in custody aged 16-17 was highest, but younger males aged 0-15 steadily increased over the years. Similar patterns were observed for females, with an increase in the 16-17 age group in FY2014. In FY2014, the number of females in the 16-17 age bracket increased while the number of males decreased. The median age of unaccompanied children decreased for females across all top countries, dropping to 15 years for Honduran children in the first seven months of FY2014."
