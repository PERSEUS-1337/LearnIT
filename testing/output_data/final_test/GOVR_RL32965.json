    "content": "Recruiting is vital for the military to maintain manpower for current and future leadership needs. The Active and Reserve Components set annual goals for new recruits, with separate goals for officers and enlisted personnel. Enlisted force goals include both quantity and quality benchmarks. Data shows that the Active Components met their enlisted accession quantity goals in FY2013 and FY2014. Performance with respect to Department of Defense enlisted accession quality benchmarks is also monitored. The Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force have achieved the highest recruit quality levels since 1973, exceeding quality goals in FY2013 and FY2014. The Army also has historically high recruit quality in terms of high school diploma graduates, but its performance on the Armed Forces Qualification Test metric is just above the DOD benchmark. In FY2003-FY2004, U.S. military forces saw a significant increase in quantity and quality of recruits, reaching levels not seen since the post-Cold War drawdown. However, in FY2005-FY2007, some services had to lower recruit quality to meet quantity goals, with the Army being notably affected. In FY2004, the Army slightly exceeded its quantity goal of 77,000 recruits. In FY2004, the Army exceeded its quantity goal of 77,000 recruits, with 92% having high school diplomas and 72% scoring above average on the AFQT. Despite challenges like wartime recruitment and competition from civilian employers, the Army struggled to meet recruiting goals from FY2005 to FY2007. In FY2005-FY2007, the Army faced challenges in meeting recruiting goals, with a decline in recruit quality despite increased resources and efforts. Only 79% of recruits had high school diplomas and 61% scored above average on the AFQT by the end of FY2007. The proportion of Category IV recruits also increased during this period. The Army improved recruit quality by increasing enlistment bonus maximums, granting more waivers, and being more selective in recruiting. By FY2008, 83% of recruits were high school diploma graduates and 62% scored above average on the AFQT. The Army also reduced the number of Category IV recruits and individuals enlisted with conduct waivers. Quality improvements accelerated in FY2009 and FY2010 due to a more favorable recruiting environment and the completion of a major force expansion. During FY2004-FY2008, the Army exceeded its quantity goal in FY2009 by 8% with a significant increase in recruit quality. In FY2010, all recruits were high school diploma graduates, 64% scored above average on the AFQT, and less than 1% were Category IV. The quality remained consistent from FY2011-FY2013 but dropped slightly in FY2014. The Marine Corps faced similar recruiting challenges during FY2005-FY2007 due to heavy involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. During FY2005-FY2007, the Marine Corps faced recruiting challenges due to heavy involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. Despite a slight drop in recruit quality from FY2004 to FY2007, the Marine Corps still maintained high standards compared to DOD benchmarks. In FY2009, there were significant improvements in recruit quality, with 99% of recruits being high school diploma graduates. In FY2009, Marine Corps recruits saw significant improvements in quality, with 99% being high school diploma graduates and 71% scoring above average on the AFQT. In FY2010, all recruits were high school diploma graduates, 72% scored above average on the AFQT, and less than 1% were Category IV. The Navy and Air Force were less affected by recruiting stresses during FY2005-FY2007, with fewer casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan. Both services met quantity goals without compromising quality metrics. During FY2008-FY2014, the Navy and Air Force both met their quantity goals with minimal changes in quality metrics. The Navy's HSDG rate improved from 93% to 99%, and its AFQT rate increased from 73% to nearly 89%. The Air Force maintained a high HSDG rate of 98%-100% and saw its AFQT rate rise from 79% to 99%. Neither service accepted Category IV personnel during this period. The Reserve Components' enlisted accession quantity rose from 79% in FY2007 to 99% in FY2011 and 98% in FY2012-FY2013, declining to about 95% in FY2014. Despite the decrease, this is still considered high historically. In FY2013 and FY2014, all Reserve Components met their quality goals, with most meeting their quantity goals as well, except for the Army National Guard and Army Reserve. The Army National Guard's shortfalls were minor, given its ability to maintain personnel strength close to authorized levels. The Army Reserve experienced some challenges in meeting its goals. The Army Reserve fell short of its quantity goal by about 800 in FY2012, 3,700 in FY2013, and 2,500 in FY2014, coinciding with a decline in strength. Steps have been taken to reverse this trend, with early data from 2015 showing improvement. Recruiting shortfalls may indicate broader issues, similar to past trends in the Reserve Components. The Reserve Components of the Army, including the Army Reserve and Army National Guard, faced significant recruiting challenges from FY2003 to FY2005. Despite this, recruiting improved in FY2006. The Marine Corps Reserves met their goals but saw a slight decline in quality metrics. The Air Force Reserves and Air National Guard also had brief recruiting difficulties. Overall, recruiting for Reserve Components was strong from FY2009 to FY2014, with the Army Reserve struggling to meet quantity goals in recent years. Recruiting challenges for the Army National Guard and Army Reserve from FY2003 to FY2005 led to missed quantity goals and declines in recruit quality. Both components were below their authorized end-strength by the end of FY2005. However, recruiting for the Army National Guard began to improve in FY2006. Recruiting for the Army National Guard improved significantly from FY2006 to FY2013, exceeding authorized end-strength goals in FY2007-FY2009. Retention was strong in FY2010-FY2011, leading to lower recruiting goals in FY2012. Recruit quality also improved, with HSDG metric rising from 83% in FY2005 to 92%-96% in FY2010-FY2013. The Army Reserve recruiting improved from FY2006 to FY2011, stabilizing at around 190,000 personnel in FY2006 and FY2007. It met its authorized end-strength in FY2009 and maintained it in FY2010-FY2011, but experienced declines in FY2012-FY2014. The quality of recruits declined from FY2006 to FY2008. The Army Reserve's recruit quality improved significantly from FY2009 to FY2014, with a high school diploma percentage reaching 96%-100% and AFQT scores above average increasing to 71% in FY2010 before declining slightly in subsequent years. Concerns arose in FY2013-FY2014 as AFQT scores hovered just above the DOD benchmark of 60%, potentially indicating recruiting challenges that may affect other branches. The Reserve Components experienced recruiting challenges in FY2003-FY2005, with the Marine Corps Reserve and Air Force Reserve meeting quantity goals consistently. The Air National Guard fell short by about 7% from FY2004 to FY2007 but maintained stable strength levels. The Navy Reserve missed goals in FY2005 and FY2006, attributed to restructuring initiatives. Overall, recruit quality in the Reserve Components has shown improvement, although the trend may be fading. In recent years, there has been a positive trend in recruiting for Reserve Components, with some fluctuations. From FY2009 to FY2014, all Reserve Components met their quality goals, showing strong recruiting years. Concerns about recruiting health in FY2005-FY2007 have been alleviated by more favorable results in subsequent years. The AFQT metric for the Army's Reserve Components slightly exceeded the goal of 60% in FY2013 and FY2014. Overall, recruit quality has improved, with likely factors contributing to this success. Likely factors contributing to the recent recruiting success include the state of the economy, with high unemployment rates benefiting military recruiting efforts. Additionally, substantial increases in military compensation over the past decade have also played a role in the strong recruiting numbers. The military compensation package was improved between FY1998 and FY2008, including raising housing allowance rates and increasing hostile fire pay. The improved security situation in Iraq also contributed to a decline in casualties from 2004 to 2007. The number of casualties in Iraq decreased significantly from 2008 to 2011 as security improved, with combat deaths in Afghanistan also declining after 2010. The Army and Marine Corps successfully increased their personnel strength through growth initiatives between FY2005-FY2008, leading to lower accession goals. The Army and Marine Corps reduced their accession goals after successful growth initiatives between FY2005-FY2008. However, factors that boosted recruiting in FY2009 are diminishing, such as the improved civilian unemployment rate. This could negatively impact military recruiting efforts due to competition with civilian employers. The military has faced challenges in recruiting due to competition from civilian employers and efforts to control compensation increases. Changes to military compensation, including restructuring the retirement system, are being considered. Reductions in force structure and defense spending could also impact recruitment and retention rates. The retention rate in the military is crucial for maintaining experienced leaders and job satisfaction. Imbalances in retention can lead to shortages or excess of personnel, affecting promotion opportunities and organizational structure. This has been a concern due to combat stress and force structure reductions. The Army and Marine Corps have shown strong retention rates over the past decade despite combat stress. The Army exceeded its retention goals in FY2013 and FY2014, while the Marine Corps fell short in FY2014 due to reduced manning needs from the drawdown of forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Air Force met or nearly met reenlistment goals in FY2009 and FY2010, with some difficulties in FY2008. In FY2011, it exceeded goals for Zone A and Zone B personnel but fell slightly short for Zone C personnel. In FY2012, it exceeded all goals, and in FY2013, it fell slightly short for Zone A and Zone B personnel. In FY2013, the Air Force fell slightly short of its Zone A and Zone B retention goals, but exceeded all of its retention goals in FY2014. The Navy exceeded its retention goals in FY2009 by comfortable margins and by even larger margins in FY2010 and FY2011. It changed its methodology for setting retention goals and measuring achievement about midway through FY2012 in order to focus solely on those who were completing their term of obligated service in that fiscal year. The Navy showed strong reenlistment behavior in Zone A and Zone C for FY2012, with reenlistments in Zone B about 5% below goal. In FY2013 and FY2014, the Navy showed weaker retention in its Zone A and Zone B goals, in part due to a substantial increase in planned force structure that required higher retention goals. Navy personnel analysts noted that while these results for FY2013 were significantly below goal, the service had moved closer to achieving its goals in FY2014. The Navy was able to maintain actual strength above authorized end-strength in FY2014 by mitigating shortfalls with short-term extensions of personnel. Attrition rates for Reserve Components were below their ceilings in FY2012, indicating successful retention efforts. Retention efforts for Reserve Components have been successful, with attrition rates staying below their ceilings in FY2012. However, in FY2013, the Army National Guard, Army Reserve, and Navy Reserve exceeded their attrition ceilings, partly due to a lower ceiling. Attrition slightly increased in FY2014 for all Reserve Components except the Army National Guard. Factors such as a weak civilian job market and attractive military compensation have contributed to improved retention and recruiting efforts. The Army and Marine Corps have seen success in achieving retention goals due to planned reductions in force structure. The Marine Corps may need to raise retention goals soon. Factors like improvements in the job market could pose challenges to retention in the future. Recent force structure reductions in the Army and Marine Corps, along with improvements in the job market, may lead servicemembers to seek civilian employment over military careers. The completion of U.S. combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan could also contribute to dissatisfaction with military life and impact retention. The potential impacts of force structure cuts on recruiting and retention have been demonstrated in past reduction efforts after the Cold War. During the post-Cold War era, the Army, Navy, and Air Force initially had successful recruiting and retention results due to force reduction efforts. However, by the late 1990s, they faced challenges meeting enlistment goals and retaining personnel. Factors contributing to these difficulties included competition with the civilian economy, perceived pay disparities, competition with higher education institutions, and demographic shifts among younger Americans. The current drawdown in the military is attributed to limited recruiting resources, dissatisfaction with military life, and a lack of critical supplies. Compared to the Cold War drawdown, this reduction is smaller for the Army and about the same for the Marine Corps. Challenges in recruiting and retention may arise as the drawdown nears completion. The military drawdown is facing challenges in stabilizing force levels due to competition from a robust economy, limited resources for recruiting, and negative attitudes towards military careers. The impact on recruiting and retention may not be seen until later in the decade. Managing force structure to prepare for future contingencies is crucial, as rebuilding quality soldiers and leaders takes time. Congress plays a significant role in setting personnel strength levels for the military. Congress plays a significant role in setting personnel strength levels for the military, which can impact recruiting and retention goals. This includes influencing military compensation levels, eligibility criteria for enlistment and retention, and authorizing funding for recruiting and retention programs. Congress closely monitors the executive branch's management of the military workforce, using policy levers like varying recruiter numbers and funding for advertising and bonuses. Additional resources are applied during shortfalls, while resources may be shifted during strong recruitment periods. Military compensation, force structure cuts, and labor market conditions also impact recruiting and retention. The military has seen favorable recruiting and retention conditions in recent years due to robust compensation and force structure cuts. However, these influences are starting to diminish, and caution is raised about potential challenges in the future if job satisfaction decreases or civilian employment becomes more attractive."
