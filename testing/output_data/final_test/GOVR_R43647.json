    "content": "The House and Senate Armed Services Committees annually review the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) with provisions affecting military personnel. Differences between the versions are resolved by a conference committee. This report focuses on personnel-related issues in the FY2015 NDAA. The House and Senate introduced versions of the FY2015 NDAA, with the House passing H.R. 4435 and the Senate introducing S. 2410 but not considering it. Instead, a proposed final version, H.R. 3979, was drafted by the Armed Services Committees and approved by the House on December 4, 2014. Contact information for CRS analysts is provided for detailed background information and analysis of the issues addressed. The authorized active duty end-strengths for FY2001 were as follows: Army (480,000), Navy (372,642), Marine Corps (172,600), and Air Force (357,000). Congress increased Army and Marine Corps personnel strength in response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but began reversing these increases after FY2006. In response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Congress increased Army and Marine Corps personnel strength after FY2006. However, in light of the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq and a drawdown in Afghanistan, the Army plans to reduce its active personnel strength to 420,000-450,000 by FY2017, while the Marine Corps plans to reduce its strength to 175,000-182,600. The Air Force and Navy have also seen gradual decreases in end-strength since 2001. The administration requested reductions in Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps end strengths compared to FY2014 levels. The Navy's end strength remained stable. H.R. 3979 aligns with the administration's request, except for a slightly higher Air Force end strength. The total active duty end strength in the proposed final bill is 50,720 lower than FY2014. The committee expressed concerns about potential further reductions in end strength due to budget constraints. The potential reductions in military force, along with discretionary caps, could impact the All-Volunteer Force's capacity and the ability to meet the National Defense Strategy. The Selected Reserves' authorized end strength has decreased by about 4% over the past twelve years, with significant reductions in Navy Reserve strength. Between FY2001 and FY2014, shifts in strength occurred in the Selected Reserve components. The Army and Navy Reserve saw the largest decreases, while the Army National Guard, Air Force Reserve, and Coast Guard Reserve experienced smaller changes. The Air National Guard, Army Reserve, and Marine Corps Reserve remained relatively stable during this period. The Selected Reserve end strength for FY2014 was reduced for various reserve components: Army National Guard (-4,000), Army Reserve (-3,000), Navy Reserve (-1,800), Marine Corps Reserve (-400), Air National Guard (-400), Air Force Reserve (-3,300), and Coast Guard Reserve (-2,000). The proposed final bill aligns with the administration's request. Military personnel costs and pay raises are key concerns for Congress. The military pay raise is a key concern for Congress, with a statutory formula providing for an annual increase in basic pay indexed to the Employment Cost Index. The FY2015 President's Budget requested a 1.0% raise, lower than the statutory formula of 1.8%, in line with Department of Defense plans to limit pay raises through FY2017. The FY 2015 President's Budget proposed a 1.0% pay raise for military members, lower than the statutory formula of 1.8%. The House bill did not specify a rate of increase in basic pay but supported a 1.8% raise for fiscal year 2015. The committee supports a 1.8 percent military pay raise for fiscal year 2015 to keep pace with private sector pay increases. President Obama set the pay raise at 1.0% for 2015, with a provision freezing the basic pay of generals and admirals at 2014 levels. The armed services provide funds to assist military members with housing costs through Basic Allowance for Quarters (BAQ) and Variable Housing Allowance (VHA). Congress combined BAQ and VHA in 1998 to create Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH). Service members are expected to pay approximately 20% of housing costs out-of-pocket. In 1998, Congress combined BAQ and VHA to create BAH, eliminating out-of-pocket costs for service members by 2005. The President's 2015 budget proposed slowing BAH growth to have service members pay 5% out-of-pocket by 2019. The final version allows the Secretary of Defense to reduce BAH payments by up to 1% of the national average monthly housing cost. The agreement preserves the option for Congress to achieve the full savings requested by DOD by adopting changes to BAH starting in the first year of the proposal. Further changes to BAH in fiscal years 2016, 2017, and beyond will be considered after the report of the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission in February 2015. The two committees commit to consider proposed changes to BAH included in the fiscal year 2016 budget request as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. The issue of sexual assault in the military has received significant attention from Congress and the media. Despite enacted changes, problems persist. Congress maintains oversight responsibilities and desires positive changes in this area. Military hair and grooming standards, along with religious accommodations, aim for uniformity but can conflict with changing styles and accommodations. Regulations have been revised as the military becomes more diverse. The Army revised its regulations in response to criticism of racial bias in March 2014. The updated regulation (A.R. 670-1) was revised on September 15, 2014, to address hairstyles for females. Pressure from Congress and the public has pushed for more accommodating policies regarding attire and grooming standards, particularly for minorities and people of religious faith. The Army revised regulations in September 2014 to address hairstyles for females, aiming to be more accommodating. The Bill of Rights protects individual religious exercise and prohibits government endorsement of a national religion. Actions must balance these clauses to avoid violations. The House-passed bill would amend sections under the Army, Navy, and Air Force regarding chaplains' duties. DOD Instruction 1300.17 accommodates religious practices in the military, emphasizing the rights of military personnel to practice their religions. Some soldiers have raised concerns about religious remarks made by chaplains at military ceremonies, fearing it could lead to religious proselytizing and harm unit cohesion. A specific incident involved an atheist soldier threatening a lawsuit over a chaplain's prayer at a secular event. The issue of chaplains closing prayers outside of religious services has sparked debate, with some arguing it could create tension among soldiers. The Secretary of Defense submitted a report to Congress in response to Section 535 of P.L. 111-383, which required a review of laws, policies, and regulations restricting female service members in the Armed Forces. In 2013, Secretary Panetta rescinded the rule prohibiting women from serving in combat units. Since Secretary Panetta's decision to rescind the rule, the Army and Marine Corps have taken steps to integrate women further. Congress is concerned about DOD's review of policies affecting female service members and the difference between \"equitable\" and \"equal.\" Service leadership is assessing occupational requirements, with a study of gender integration mandated by Section 584 of H.R. 4355. No study mandate is present in Sec. 523 of S. 2410, focusing on gender-neutral occupational standards. Military members who are single parents face challenges with deployment requirements, including the need for contingency plans for their dependents. Concerns have been raised about custody arrangements and changes while deployed, potentially affecting the welfare of military children and service members' ability to serve effectively. The final version aims to protect custodial arrangements of military parents by limiting temporary custody orders during deployment, preventing courts from using deployment as the sole factor in custody decisions, and deferring to state law when beneficial to service members. References include CRS Report R42651 and CRS Report R43091. In recent years, the military services have broadened the evaluation of commanders to include assessing the \"command climate\" of their unit, looking at complaints, turnover, morale, leadership, and discipline. The proposed final bill would require performance appraisals to indicate how well commanders manage sexual assault allegations and protect those making the allegations from retaliation. The FY2014 National Defense Authorization Act addresses the issue of sexual assault in the military, with an increase in reported cases attributed to victims being more willing to come forward. There are provisions in the Act that focus on preventing and reporting sexual assault, providing assistance to victims, and modifying judicial proceedings. The Purple Heart is awarded to members of the Armed Forces who are wounded or killed in action against an enemy while serving with friendly forces or by friendly fire under certain circumstances. Contact [author name scrubbed] for more information. In June 2009, a civilian opened fire on U.S. Army soldiers in Little Rock, AK, and in November 2009, an Army major opened fire at Ft. Hood, TX. Both attackers were charged with murder. Some believe these acts should be viewed as acts of war due to the perpetrators being Muslim and angry over U.S. actions in Iraq and Afghanistan. There are concerns that awarding the Purple Heart in these cases could have anti-Muslim implications. The decision to award the Purple Heart in cases involving Muslim attackers is rare legislative initiative as it traditionally rests with the executive branch. The Combat Action Badge (CAB) is awarded to soldiers engaged in combat with the enemy, established in 2005. The Combat Action Badge (CAB) is awarded to soldiers engaged in combat with the enemy, regardless of military occupational specialty. Section 572 of a House bill may allow retroactive CAB awards to eligible Army veterans, aligning eligibility dates with the Combat Infantry Badge (CIB) and Combat Medical Badge (CMB). However, obtaining records to justify the award may be challenging, and the CAB cannot be acquired by survivors of deceased service members. The Joint Explanatory Statement with the proposed final bill directed a review of military decorations to include retroactive award of the Army Combat Action Badge. Critics have highlighted issues with the Medal of Honor review process, citing lengthiness and bureaucracy. Sgt. Rafael Peralta's nomination for smothering a grenade in Fallujah, Iraq, saving comrades, faced controversy due to conflicting eyewitness and forensic evidence. The Pentagon's alleged creation of false narratives for high-profile cases like Pat Tillman and Jessica Lynch tarnished the medals process. Peralta's case is compared to Marine Cpl. William \"Kyle\" Carpenter, who also sacrificed himself to save others. Marine Cpl. William \"Kyle\" Carpenter received the Medal of Honor for jumping on an enemy grenade in Afghanistan to save a fellow Marine. Advocates for Sgt. Rafael Peralta's nomination may draw parallels between the two cases, potentially impacting the review process. TRICARE, a health care program for service members, retirees, and their dependents, may undergo changes in its FY2015 budget request. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about proposed changes to TRICARE and increased fees for beneficiaries, especially in light of proposed reductions in compensation. The Administration's cost-sharing proposals have not been rejected, but further action is deferred pending a report from the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission. The DOD legislative proposal includes changes to TRICARE pharmaceutical co-pays for fiscal years 2015-2024, with adjustments starting in 2015. The agreement allows for potential savings without rejecting the DOD proposal endorsed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Further changes to co-pays are postponed until after the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission report in February 2015. Committees will review proposed co-pay changes in the FY 2016 budget request as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. If sequestration-level budgets remain in effect for Fiscal Year 2016 and beyond, DOD will need to make painful cuts and achieve substantial savings across its entire budget to maintain readiness of the Armed Forces. The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission website provides detailed information on the military health care program and costs. TRICARE beneficiaries have access to a pharmacy program that allows prescriptions to be filled through military pharmacies, TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery, and retail network pharmacies. Active duty service members have no pharmacy copayments when using military pharmacies or TRICARE pharmacies. Military pharmacies provide a 90-day supply of formulary medications for free. The TRICARE pharmacy program provides a supply of formulary medications for prescriptions written by civilian and military providers. Copayments apply for brand name and non-formulary medications, with higher costs for non-formulary drugs. The policy encourages the use of generic medications over brand-name ones. Proposed annual increases in copayments were included in the Administration's FY2015 budget request. Section 702 of H.R. 3979 would expand the requirement for TRICARE beneficiaries to fill maintenance medications through military treatment facilities or TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery, increasing copayment requirements by $3. This change is estimated to save roughly $375 million per year by removing retail pharmacies as an option for refilling prescriptions. Background: Person-to-person mental health assessments are mandated for deployed armed forces members under current law (10 U.S.C. 1074m) at specific intervals post-deployment. The purpose of mental health assessments for deployed personnel is to identify post-traumatic stress disorder, suicidal tendencies, and other behavioral health conditions. Requiring DOD to administer these assessments every six months would cost $35 million over the 2015-2019 periods according to Congressional Budget Office estimate for H.R. 4435. The annual person-to-person mental health assessment required by section 701 would require DoD to assess all members on active duty and in the selected reserve. The Air Force and Air National Guard currently require mental health assessments at intervals of three and five years, respectively. Implementing section 701 would require an additional 240,000 assessments each year at a cost of about $35 each. The estimated increase in spending over the 2015-2019 periods would be $43 million. The Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (MHPAEA, P.L. 110-343) ensures equal treatment for mental health and substance use disorder benefits in group health plans and insurance coverage. It was expanded by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to include individual health insurance. The Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 extends mental health coverage under TRICARE, removing limitations on inpatient stays for both adults and children. This change would eliminate the 30-day limit for adults and 45-day limit for children, as well as the 150-day limit for stays at Residential Treatment Centers. The DoD can issue waivers to exceed annual limits for stays at Residential Treatment Centers, but removing restrictions would lead to longer stays and increased costs. CBO estimates that eliminating restrictions would result in about 650 TRICARE beneficiaries extending their stays by 26 days on average, costing DoD an additional $12 million per year. The DoD implemented a reorganization of the military health system in 2013, creating a new Defense Health Agency and Enhanced Multi-Service Markets. DOD plans to consolidate or eliminate underutilized services at military treatment facilities. Section 714 of a House bill would delay these changes, requiring DOD to submit a report on military medical facility modernization. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that delays in planned changes would increase costs to DOD by about $135 million over the 2015-2019 period. TRICARE payments are prohibited for services not medically necessary. The TRICARE Policy Manual prohibits coverage for unproven drugs, devices, treatments, or procedures that have not been proven safe and effective. This includes any medical intervention lacking FDA approval or clearance for marketing. Cost-sharing may be allowed for services or supplies when there is no logical or causal relationship between the unproven drug, device, treatment, or procedure and the treatment at issue. This is authorized when treatment that is not related to the unproven drug, device, treatment, or procedure is medically necessary. TRICARE uses reliable evidence to determine if a medical practice has moved from unproven to accepted status, including well-controlled studies published in medical literature. TRICARE policy is not solely based on other government medical programs like Medicare. Section 704 allows TRICARE to address situations such as Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs), considered \"medical devices\" by the FDA. TRICARE coverage is limited to FDA approved LDTs, but recent changes in medical coding have helped identify when non-approved LDTs were reimbursed. The Defense Health Agency is exploring coverage options for FDA non-approved LDTs that may assist providers and patients with treatment decisions. The Defense Health Agency is designing a new demonstration project to expand coverage for certain Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs) that inform clinical decision making in cancer diagnosis and treatment under TRICARE. Potential spending increases could be offset by reductions in spending under DOD's Supplemental Care program. TRICARE may cover breastfeeding support, supplies, and counseling during pregnancy and postpartum period, excluding electric breast pumps for personal convenience. This contrasts with regulations under the Affordable Care Act mandating coverage for lactation support without cost-sharing. CBO did not score this provision."
