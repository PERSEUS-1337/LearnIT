    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Physician Assistants Continuity of Care Act of 2007\". It includes findings related to physician assistants. Congress finds that physician assistants play a crucial role in providing quality and cost-effective medical care to diverse populations, with over 286 million prescriptions written and 230 million patient visits in 2006. Physician assistants are essential in addressing health disparities, especially in rural and minority communities, and are regulated in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam. In 1997, the Balanced Budget Act amended the Medicare program to extend coverage for medical services provided by physician assistants, allowing them to practice medicine under physician oversight and write prescriptions. Physician assistants work in collaboration with physicians, and in underserved areas, they may be the only onsite healthcare provider available. Physician assistants play a critical role in providing immediate medical care to vulnerable populations, especially in rural areas where they may be the only available healthcare providers. However, Medicare reimbursement issues have led to delays in hospice care and difficulties with discharge planning at some critical access hospitals. The continuity of care for terminally ill Medicare beneficiaries may be disrupted because physician assistants may not be reimbursed for certain services, such as hospice care. This can lead to additional costs for the Medicare program. Physician assistants, when delegated by a physician, can now order or provide post-hospital extended care services, home health services, and hospice care under the Medicare program. This change aims to address the disruption in care for terminally ill Medicare beneficiaries and reduce additional costs for the program. Physician assistants, when delegated by a physician, can now order or provide post-hospital extended care services and home health services under the Medicare program. Physician assistants, when delegated by a physician, can now order or provide post-hospital extended care services, home health services, and hospice care under the Medicare program. Amendments have been made to allow physician assistants to certify terminal illness for hospice care. Physician assistants can now provide professional services under Medicare, including services that would be provided by physicians if furnished by a physician. The amendments apply to services from January 1, 2007."
