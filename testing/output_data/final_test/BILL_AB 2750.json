    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1635.1 of the Health and Safety Code requires tissue banks in California to have a valid license, with some exceptions for blood banks and non-transplant tissue use. The exemption for tissue collection and implantation by a physician does not apply to processing or storage, except for semen processing and storage. Additionally, the collection, processing, storage, or distribution of fetal tissue or tissue derived from a human embryo or fetus is prohibited. The curr_chunk discusses exemptions for certain activities related to tissue storage and distribution, including OPO activities, bone storage by hospitals, and bone and dermis storage by licensed dentists. The curr_chunk discusses the storage of human cells, tissues, or HCT/P that are medical devices or biologic products approved by the FDA or licensed physician for direct implantation into their own patient, obtained from a California-licensed tissue bank, and stored according to manufacturer instructions. To be eligible for the exemption, the entity must notify the department in writing that the practitioner is licensed and meets the requirements. The notice must include a list of practitioners using the medical device, their agreement to follow storage directions, and not resell the product. Additionally, it covers the collection of organs in a general acute care hospital with a Medicare-approved transplant program and the storage of allograft tissue meeting specific criteria. The storage of allograft tissue in a hospital or outpatient setting regulated by the Medical Board of California is allowed if specific criteria are met, including maintaining a log of tissue details and obtaining it from a licensed tissue bank. The allograft tissue, obtained from a licensed tissue bank, is individually boxed and labeled with a unique ID and expiration date. It is intended for implantation or application on a patient, not for further distribution. Registered with the FDA, it is to be stored at room temperature without refrigeration."
