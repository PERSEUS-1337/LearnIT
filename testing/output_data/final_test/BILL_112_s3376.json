    "content": "The Act titled \"Preventing Abuse of Cough Treatments Act of 2012\" or \"PACT Act\" regulates the sales of over-the-counter drugs containing dextromethorphan. The Preventing Abuse of Cough Treatments Act of 2012 (PACT Act) amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to prohibit the sale of dextromethorphan-containing drugs to individuals under 18 years of age without proper identification. Failure to request ID and selling to minors is considered a violation, unless the seller examined the purchaser's ID and reasonably believed they were of legal age. The sale of dextromethorphan-containing drugs to individuals under 18 is prohibited without proper identification. Exceptions include sales made with a valid prescription or if the individual under 18 is married, a parent, or actively enrolled in the military. Identification must include a photo and date of birth, issued by a State or Federal Government. The Preventing Abuse of Cough Treatments Act of 2012 sets limits on civil penalties for violations of section 301(aaa) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Penalties range from $1,000 to $5,000 depending on the number of violations by a person. The Preventing Abuse of Cough Treatments Act of 2012 imposes civil penalties on retailers for violations related to the sale of products containing dextromethorphan. Retailers can mitigate penalties by implementing employee training programs and other compliance measures. Each physical location operated by a retailer is considered a separate entity for penalty assessment purposes. The term 'retailer' in the Preventing Abuse of Cough Treatments Act of 2012 refers to stores selling products with dextromethorphan for personal use, subject to penalties for violations. SEC. 3 amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to include restrictions on the distribution of bulk dextromethorphan. The text prohibits possession or distribution of unfinished dextromethorphan without proper registration or approval. Common carriers are exempt from these restrictions. The text defines common carriers as providers of transportation services and unfinished dextromethorphan as the substance not in finished dosage form. It also prohibits unauthorized possession or distribution of unfinished dextromethorphan. A person who violates section 506D may face a civil penalty of up to $100,000."
