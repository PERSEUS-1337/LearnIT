    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 1793.2 of the Civil Code in California is amended to require manufacturers of consumer goods with express warranties to maintain service and repair facilities in the state or designate authorized facilities for warranty fulfillment. Manufacturers in California can comply with warranty requirements by entering into contracts with independent service facilities. These contracts must adhere to specified rates and can include discounts related to reduced costs. Contracts cannot exceed one year and must be renewed separately. The contract between the manufacturer and independent service facility in California must not exceed one year and can only be renewed with a new agreement. In California, the contract between the manufacturer and independent service facility must not exceed one year and can only be renewed with a new agreement. Failure to comply may result in being subject to Section 1793.5 and providing service literature and replacement parts during the warranty period. Service and repair facilities in California must be maintained within the state. If goods do not conform to warranties, service or repair must start promptly. Goods should be fixed to meet warranties within 30 days, unless agreed otherwise in writing. Delays beyond the manufacturer's control extend the 30-day requirement. Conforming goods should be provided promptly after any delays. The buyer must deliver nonconforming goods to the manufacturer's service and repair facility in California. If delivery is not possible due to certain reasons, the buyer must notify the manufacturer. The manufacturer will then service or repair the goods at the buyer's residence, pick up the goods for repair, or arrange for transportation to its facility. All transportation costs in such cases will be covered by the manufacturer. The manufacturer is responsible for transporting nonconforming goods to and from the service and repair facility at their expense. If the manufacturer or its representative in this state fails to service or repair the goods to conform to the warranties after multiple attempts, they must either replace the goods or reimburse the buyer for the purchase price, minus any amount attributable to prior use. If a manufacturer in the state cannot repair a new motor vehicle to meet warranties after several attempts, they must replace the vehicle or provide restitution to the buyer. The buyer can choose restitution over a replacement, and cannot be forced to accept a replacement vehicle. In cases of replacement, the manufacturer must provide a new vehicle identical to the one being replaced, along with all warranties. The manufacturer is also responsible for paying any fees related to the replacement, as well as incidental damages such as repair, towing, and rental car costs incurred by the buyer. The manufacturer is responsible for restitution in an amount equal to the actual price paid by the buyer, including transportation and manufacturer-installed options. This also includes collateral charges and incidental damages, such as reasonable repair, towing, and rental car costs incurred by the buyer. When the manufacturer replaces the new motor vehicle, the buyer is only liable to pay for the use of the replaced vehicle before delivering it for correction. Restitution may be reduced by the amount attributable to the buyer's use before the vehicle was delivered for correction. The amount is determined by multiplying the actual price paid by the buyer for the new motor vehicle. The buyer's liability for the use of a replaced vehicle is determined by multiplying the actual price paid for the new motor vehicle by a fraction based on the number of miles traveled before delivery for correction. This does not limit the buyer's rights under other laws. If a new motor vehicle cannot be repaired to conform to warranties, the manufacturer must replace it or reimburse the buyer. This does not apply to deficiencies in the construction of a new residential dwelling for non-manufactured products. The Tanner Consumer Protection Act presumes a reasonable number of repair attempts for a new motor vehicle under warranty. If not fixed within 18 months or 18,000 miles, the manufacturer must replace or reimburse the buyer. The Tanner Consumer Protection Act sets criteria for a vehicle to be deemed a lemon: (1) if a nonconformity poses a risk of death or serious injury after two repair attempts, or (2) if the same issue persists after four repair attempts. The Tanner Consumer Protection Act outlines criteria for a vehicle to be considered a lemon, including if it is out of service for more than 30 days due to repairs by the manufacturer. The buyer must notify the manufacturer directly if specified in the warranty or owner's manual. This is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof. The buyer can assert a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof in any civil action or small claims court based on the information in the owner's manual. If a qualified third-party dispute resolution process is available, the buyer must be notified in writing with a description of its operation. The buyer must resort to this process before asserting a presumption in a civil action or small claims court. If the buyer is dissatisfied with the decision or if the manufacturer fails to fulfill the terms, the buyer can then assert the presumption. The buyer can assert a presumption in an action to enforce their rights under Section 1793.2 after accepting a decision from a qualified third-party dispute resolution process. The findings and decision of the process are admissible in evidence. The period of limitation for actions is extended based on the time between filing a complaint with the process and the decision date. A qualified third-party dispute resolution process must comply with FTC regulations, provide binding decisions, ensure timely fulfillment of decisions, and instruct arbitrators on relevant regulations. The manufacturer must replace a nonconforming motor vehicle or provide restitution to the buyer as per the terms of the chapter. An independent automobile expert may inspect the vehicle at no cost to the buyer if requested by the arbitrator or arbitration panel. The decision-making process considers legal factors, including warranties, regulations, and equitable considerations. It does not mandate awards of punitive damages, multiple damages, attorneys' fees, or consequential damages beyond what is specified in the regulations. The buyer may be entitled to reimbursement for repair, towing, and rental car costs under Section 1794. The buyer may be entitled to reimbursement for repair, towing, and rental car costs under Section 1794. Arbitrators deciding disputes must not be parties to the dispute, and no other person can participate in the merits of the dispute unless the buyer is allowed to participate. Certification by the Department of Consumer Affairs is required. \"Nonconformity\" is defined as a defect that substantially impairs the use, value, or safety of the new motor vehicle. A \"new motor vehicle\" is defined as a vehicle purchased primarily for personal, family, or household use, or for business use with a gross vehicle weight under 10,000 pounds. It includes chassis, chassis cab, and propulsion portion of a motor home, but excludes portions for human habitation, dealer-owned vehicles, demonstrators, motorcycles, or off-highway vehicles. A demonstrator vehicle is assigned by a dealer for demonstrating qualities common to vehicles of the same model and type, to be used exclusively off highways. A motor home is a vehicular unit designed for human habitation on a self-propelled motor vehicle chassis. It cannot be sold, leased, or transferred without disclosing any nonconformity to the buyer and correcting it, with a one-year warranty provided by the manufacturer. The transfer of a motor vehicle to an educational institution for use in automotive repair courses does not require disclosure of nonconformities to the transferee."
