Recipients must be members of a consortium to receive the funds. The chancellor and Superintendent will allocate funds to each consortium based on the statewide need for adult education. The funds will be apportioned to a fund administrator or consortium members within 30 days of approval. If the total amount certified for education programs exceeds $375 million, the chancellor and Superintendent will allocate funds to each school district based on their certified amount. The chancellor and Superintendent will allocate funds to each consortium based on the statewide need for adult education.
