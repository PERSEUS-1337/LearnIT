    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that Admiral Dennis C. Blair confirmed the policy of including US citizens on assassination lists maintained by the CIA and JSOC, with special permission required for lethal force. The Obama administration authorized the targeting of Anwar Al-Awlaki, a US citizen accused of terrorist involvement, making him the first American on the CIA's capture or kill list. The CIA added US citizens to its list of targets for capture or killing. Anwar Al-Awlaqi and Samir Khan were killed by a US drone strike in Yemen without due process. Abdul-Rahman Al-Awlaqi, a 16-year-old US citizen, was also killed in a similar strike. Attorney General Eric Holder acknowledged the successful prosecution of terrorism defendants in Federal courts. The decision to use lethal force against US citizens abroad lacks oversight, judicial process, or disclosed standards. Executive Orders by Presidents Reagan and Ford prohibited assassination by US government personnel. President Gerald Ford issued an Executive Order in 1976 prohibiting US government employees from engaging in political assassination. SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The sense of Congress emphasizes the importance of due process, condemns extrajudicial killings of US citizens, and highlights the need to uphold the rule of law. The 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force has been misused by the executive branch to bypass Congress, detain prisoners without due process, conduct domestic spying on citizens, and use lethal force against suspected terrorists without judicial review. The idea of sacrificing one citizen's rights to protect others should be rejected. The use of lethal force against a US citizen outside of Afghanistan is a violation of the law of armed conflict. It is important for the US to uphold international and domestic law. Prohibition on extrajudicial killing of US citizens. Prohibition on instructing or conspiring to engage in extrajudicial killing of US citizens. President required to report on US citizens on targeted assassination lists. President must provide assurances to Congress. The congressional intelligence committees must receive assurance that no US citizens are targeted as \"high-value individuals\" or \"high-value targets\" by the Joint Special Operations Command or the CIA. Definitions for congressional intelligence committees and extrajudicial killing are provided. The use of lethal force against a United States citizen can be justified after a trial and finding of guilt by a tribunal, in active armed conflict, or for law enforcement purposes such as self-defense or hostage release."
