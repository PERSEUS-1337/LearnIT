    "content": "The annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill funds agencies and programs in three federal departments, including the controversial Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) in the Department of the Interior. The FY2011 budget request for FWS is $1.64 billion, slightly lower than the FY2010 level. The largest portion of the FWS annual appropriation is the Resource Management account, which includes programs like Endangered Species and Climate Change Adaptive Science Capacity. Adaptive Science Capacity is a key aspect of the FWS appropriations cycle, with potential issues arising in the management of California water projects. Legal challenges have been faced by the Bureau of Reclamation in California, particularly regarding the impact of Reclamation operations on endangered species. BiOps issued by FWS and NMFS provided alternatives to avoid harm to listed species under the ESA. The BiOps authorized incidental take of listed species despite following recommendations, leading to potential water supply restrictions in California. Water interests support modifying BiOps for agriculture, while others emphasize the need to maintain water for listed species, fisheries, and water quality. Congressional response and FWS appropriations may address California's water issues. The Administration's FY2011 request for the endangered species program is $181.3 million, an increase from FY2010. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees have made recommendations for improving the consultation program and addressing backlog of candidate species. The Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund supports conservation efforts for listed species. The President proposes to maintain the endangered species program at the FY2010 level, with a 1% increase in funding for two endangered species programs. The Administration requested a 1% decrease in funding for refuge operations and maintenance for FY2011. Refuge funding is not keeping pace with new demands, leading to cuts in programs for endangered species, invasive species control, habitat restoration, and water supply protection. The FY2009 stimulus law provided additional funding to address problems such as infestation by invasive species, protecting water supplies, habitat restoration, and staffing at less popular refuges. Despite some increases in recent years, ongoing concerns remain about the system's problems after the stimulus funding is exhausted. The Administration requests $63.3 million for nationwide law enforcement, a 4% decrease from the FY2010 level, covering border inspections, investigations of violations of endangered species or waterfowl hunting laws, and other activities. The FY2009 stimulus law provided additional funding for Resource Management and Construction, with obligations ending on October 1, 2010. The funds will be used to hire local laborers and contractors for maintenance, repairs, and construction. Refuges are major beneficiaries of the stimulus funding, with improvements in energy conservation and habitat restoration. The Administration requests $28.8 million for Climate Change Planning and Adaptive Science Capacity in FY2011, a 44% increase from FY2010. The Administration requests $106.3 million for land acquisition to address climate impacts on wildlife at local and regional scales through a network of Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs). The funding will also support cooperative scientific research on climate change and habitat, with a goal of increasing the network of LCCs from 9 to 12, eventually reaching 21 LCCs. The FY2010 budget request allocates a higher percentage of funding (80% and 77%) for land acquisition for federal refuges, funded by the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The Migratory Bird Conservation Account (MBCA) provides mandatory spending for land acquisition, with estimated funds of $58.0 million for FY2011 from duck stamp sales and import duties. The National Wildlife Refuge Fund compensates counties for federal lands, with funding from various activities on the NWRS. The Administration requests $14.1 million for FY2011, a 3% decrease from FY2010. The fund, along with refuge receipts, would cover 38% of the authorized payment level in FY2010. The President's request for the Multinational Species Conservation Fund in FY2011 is $10.0 million, a 13% decrease from FY2010. The Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Fund is requested at $4.0 million, down 20% from FY2010. State and Tribal Wildlife Grants support conservation efforts for species of concern to states, territories, and tribes. The State and Tribal Wildlife Grants program funds conservation projects and state conservation plans. Funding includes competitive grants to tribal governments and grants to states based on a formula. The FY2011 budget request is $90.0 million, with changes in required state match percentages to encourage state participation. The FY2011 budget proposal aims to increase funding for conservation projects and state plans, with a minimum of 50% return to states for implementation. Grants would be distributed to more projects to encourage state participation."
