    "content": "The Agricultural Act of 1949 is amended to establish the Conservation Flex Program Option under section 116. The Secretary will establish a voluntary conservation flex program to help agricultural producers adopt site-specific farm management plans by reducing barriers to resource stewardship practices. Definitions include the program itself, site-specific farm management plans, alternative crops for soil and water conservation, and breeding cattle excluding calves grown for slaughter or dairy purposes. The term 'legume' includes alfalfa, clover, lentils, lupine, medic, peas, soybeans, and vetch grown for forage, green manure, or biomass feedstock. A 'resource-conserving crop' encompasses legumes, grasses, brassica cover crops, alternative crops, and designated crops by the Secretary. Crop rotation involves using at least one resource-conserving crop to reduce erosion, maintain soil fertility, and interrupt pest cycles. Rotational grazing involves dividing pastures into paddocks and using grazing rotations to improve forage quality and reduce runoff. Small grains include barley, oats, and rye, but not wheat for nonhuman consumption. Special conservation practices include field borders and wildlife habitat. The program includes practices like strips, grass windbreaks, wildlife habitat plantings, and beneficial organism habitat. Eligible producers must submit a farm management plan for approval. Upon approval, the Secretary will enter into an agreement specifying crop acreage bases. The producer enters into an agreement with the Secretary specifying crop acreage bases for a period of 1-7 years. The producer must comply with the approved plan and allocate at least 15% of crop acreage to a resource-conserving crop. The producer must submit a plan to the Secretary specifying crop acreage bases and conservation practices to be implemented. The plan must include a schedule for implementing and maintaining resource-conserving practices on the acreage. The program for improvement and maintenance of resource-conserving practices is administered by the Secretary, who provides technical assistance to producers in developing and implementing a plan. The Secretary administers a program to help producers develop and implement plans for farming operations, evaluate effectiveness, and assess costs and benefits. Technical assistance is provided to comply with regulations protecting natural resources. Flexibility is given for producers to adjust plans in response to market conditions, weather, or technology changes. The Secretary administers a program to help producers develop and implement plans for farming operations, evaluate effectiveness, and assess costs and benefits. Producers can adjust plans with approval, and compliance is certified by the Secretary. Termination of agreements can occur if producers violate terms. Program rules protect crop acreage bases and payment yields when planting resource-conserving crops. The Secretary ensures that program participants are not penalized for planting resource-conserving crops through various provisions, including protecting payment acres and providing deficiency payments at a specified rate. The program allows producers to designate acreage for resource-conserving crops, with adjustments made by the Secretary to accommodate factors like crop rotation and conservation practices. The Secretary may waive acreage limitation requirements for a farm if the reduction in program crop production will exceed the reduction that would occur without participation. Additionally, if a resource-conserving crop includes a feed grain crop planted on base acres of another farm, the Secretary will consider the yield of both grains for adjustments or waivers. Total base acreage flexibility is allowed by the Secretary for participants. The Secretary allows participants in the program to plant farm program crops and oilseeds in any proportion on a producer's total acreage without affecting farm program payments. Acreage devoted to resource-conserving crops is eligible for crop insurance. The Secretary will not make farm program payments to a producer for acreage enrolled in the program if haying and grazing restrictions are violated. During a five-month period, haying and grazing on conserving use acres may be prohibited under the Act. There is a transition option for producers who agree to retire all base acreage at the end of the agreement period. The Secretary can release acreage for emergency haying and grazing in case of a natural disaster. The Act allows for reduced acreage, conservation use, land diversion, and enrollment in the conservation reserve program. Section 1451 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 is repealed."
