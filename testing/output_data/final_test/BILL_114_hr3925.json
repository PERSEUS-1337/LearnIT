The Secretary will cancel repayment obligations for qualified loans disbursed after July 1, 2010, for borrowers who graduated from a high-quality program, worked as a full-time principal for at least one school year in a qualifying location, and are not in default on their loans. Loan forgiveness is authorized under the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Secretary will cancel 15 percent of the loan obligation and all accrued interest for qualified loans disbursed after July 1, 2010, for principals completing service for up to four years. After completing four years of service as a principal, the Secretary will cancel 20 percent of the loan obligation and all accrued interest for loans disbursed after July 1, 2010, for the fifth to seventh years of service. After the first complete school year of service, a principal may serve in a different school or location for one year, and may stop serving as a principal for up to one complete school year. Loan amounts for Federal Direct Consolidation Loans disbursed after July 1, 2010, may be considered qualified loan amounts. Loan amounts for Federal Direct Consolidation Loans disbursed after July 1, 2010, may be considered qualified if used to repay specific federal loans for graduate or professional programs, subject to regulations. If the list of schools for high need principals is unavailable before May 1, the previous year's list may be used. Continuing eligibility is maintained for principals who perform service. Continuing eligibility for principals who serve in qualifying schools allows them to remain eligible for loan cancellation. The canceled loan amount and interest are not considered taxable income. There is no authorization for refunding any canceled loan, and borrowers cannot receive benefits from both this section and another program for the same service. The Secretary can issue regulations for this section. Definitions for \"principal\" and \"year\" are provided."
