    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that it is in the interest of the United States to maximize economic return from cruise ship sailings to and from Alaska by encouraging the use of US facilities and promoting new enterprises. Additionally, there is a need to protect existing employment and economic activity associated with the Alaska Marine Highway System and similar US enterprises. Since 1989, Alaska cruise ship tourism has grown by 86%, making it the third most popular cruise destination globally. Currently, all cruise ships to Alaska are foreign-flag vessels due to the absence of US-flag ships in the trade. Vancouver benefits economically from servicing these ships. In 1995, Alaska cruise sailings increased to 283 voyages with 595,577 passengers. Vancouver gains from this industry include employment for 2,500 people and payments of $120 million per year. The transfer of cruise ship activity from Vancouver to US ports could generate additional revenues of $100 million federally and $30 million for state and local governments. SEC. 2. FOREIGN FLAG CRUISE VESSELS. Foreign-flag cruise vessels are allowed to transport passengers between ports in Alaska and the west coast of the contiguous states, with exceptions. Owners of US cruise vessels can offer coastwise trade services in Alaska with proper certification. Foreign-flag cruise vessels transporting passengers under this section must be notified by the Secretary to terminate service within one year of notification. Coastwise privileges granted to these vessels expire 365 days after receiving the notification. Notifications are issued in reverse order of entry into coastwise service and in a minimum number to ensure passenger-carrying capacity is removed from coastwise service. The United States cruise vessel must terminate service within 365 days if it has not entered the coastwise passenger trade in Alaska or between ports in Alaska and other ports on the west coast of the contiguous states. The termination of service will be delayed by 90 days following the entry into trade by the United States vessel. The term \"cruise vessel\" refers to a luxury vessel providing various services for passengers. Foreign-flag cruise vessels do not include those carrying passengers and cargo or serving as transportation between US ports. The Act does not affect the transportation authority of Canadian vessels in Alaska and the US."
