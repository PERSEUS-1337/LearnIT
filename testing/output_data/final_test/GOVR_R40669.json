    "content": "Energy and Water Development funding for FY2009 was included in the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 (P.L. 111-8) totaling $40.549 billion, with $7.5 billion for Advanced Technical Vehicles Manufacturing Loans. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (P.L. 111-5) provided $44.325 billion for programs in the Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, and Department of Energy. President Obama's FY2010 budget for these programs was released in May 2009. The House and Senate subcommittees marked up bills for FY2010, with the House passing the bill on July 17. The Energy and Water Development bill, including several amendments, was passed by the Senate on July 29 and signed by the President on October 28 (P.L. 111-85). It includes funding for various projects such as civil works projects of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Central Utah Project, Department of Energy, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Appalachian Regional Commission. The Energy and Water Development bill, signed into law as P.L. 111-85, includes budget totals for energy and water development appropriations enacted for FY2002 to FY2009. Tables provide budget details for various titles, with the Army Corps of Engineers receiving $5.445 billion in appropriations for FY2009-FY2010, exceeding the Obama Administration's request of $5.125 billion. The Senate bill appropriated $5.405 billion for the Corps' civil works activities, while the agency has received additional funds through various supplemental appropriations and acts since Hurricane Katrina. Unlike other infrastructure programs, federal funds for the Corps are not distributed based on a formula or competitive program. About 85% of the appropriations for the Corps' activities are allocated for its projects. The Corps' civil works activities receive about 85% of appropriations for specific projects, which are often debated during congressional deliberations. Funding is typically allocated to authorized projects, with a backlog ranging from $11 billion to over $80 billion. This backlog raises questions about the disconnect between authorization and appropriations processes and how to prioritize among authorized projects. The Obama Administration's request for the Corps includes new starts, with five new construction projects. The House bill supports new starts and adds 20 projects not requested by the Administration. The Senate Appropriations Committee deemed new starts imprudent in the current budget environment. The Inland Waterway Trust Fund faces a deficit. The Inland Waterway Trust Fund (IWTF) is facing a deficit as expenses exceed incoming collections. The fund receives money from a fuel tax on vessels and investment interest. The Obama Administration proposed a lock usage fee to replace the fuel tax, but this is not included in the House or Senate bill. The House is focused on addressing the IWTF's insolvency. The House and Senate bills did not include legislative language to address the insolvency of the Inland Waterway Trust Fund (IWTF). The Senate Committee report discussed alternatives to the Administration's proposal but did not propose legislative changes. The conference report directed the Administration to report on the status of the fund and identify priority projects. The conference bill would prohibit funds from being used for new contracts committing additional IWTF funds until the insolvency issue is resolved. The Corps plays a significant role in coordinating the restoration of Central and Southern Florida. The Corps plays a significant coordination role in the restoration of the Central and Southern Florida ecosystem, with funding coming from Energy and Water Development appropriations. The FY2010 Obama Administration request for Everglades restoration was $214.5 million, with the conference bill providing $180 million. Congressional bills varied in funding amounts for Everglades restoration. The Senate bill would have provided $163.4 million for hurricane protection in coastal Louisiana, with funding for the Modified Water Deliveries Project to come from the Department of Interior. The Corps has been responsible for repairing and fortifying the hurricane protection system, funded through emergency appropriations rather than annual appropriations. This includes construction of levees, floodwalls, storm surge barriers, and pump improvements to reduce flooding risk in the New Orleans area. The Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2009 provided $0.439 billion for barrier island and ecosystem restoration in Mississippi Gulf Coast. The FY2010 request for the Bureau of Reclamation was $1,020.7 million, $55.1 million less than FY2009, with a net discretionary authority of $985.7 million. The FY2010 budget request for the Bureau of Reclamation is $1.1 billion, with $1.06 billion allocated for Title II funding. The House-passed bill includes $1.08 billion, the Senate bill proposes $1.17 billion, and the conference report includes $1.13 billion. The Water and Related Resources account is the largest, covering various programs and projects. The Obama Administration requested $893.1 million for this account. The Obama Administration requested $893.1 million for the Water and Related Resources Account for FY2010, with the House bill including $910.3 million and the Senate bill proposing $993.1 million. The conference agreement settled on $951.2 million for the account, which is $31.0 million more than enacted in FY2009. Reclamation manages dams and water diversion structures primarily for irrigation in the West. Reclamation manages dams and diversion projects in 17 western states, providing water to 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people. They are the largest wholesale water supplier in the region and the second-largest hydroelectric power producer in the nation. Reclamation also offers flood control, recreation, and wildlife benefits, but faces controversy over its impact on fish and wildlife species and conflicts among water users. The agency's budget is mainly project-based, and it has been criticized for becoming a \"caretaker agency.\" Reclamation has not shown leadership in water supply management despite past achievements. The House Appropriations Committee emphasizes the need for active leadership in managing western water resources due to increasing demand and changing hydrology. The Central Valley Project (CVP) in California, one of Reclamation's largest projects, has faced water delivery limitations due to drought and environmental restrictions. Amendments have been proposed to prevent new Biological Opinions on project operations' impact on fish species. Representative Calvert offered an amendment to prohibit such restrictions by Reclamation or state agencies. Calvert offered an amendment to prevent restrictions on the Central Valley Project (CVP) and State Water Project (SWP) due to recent BiOps finding that project operations could harm Delta Smelt and salmon. OCAP allowed increased pumping from the Delta, contributing to fish declines, along with other factors like invasive species and pollution. Low Delta Smelt numbers led to court-imposed limits. The Delta Smelt population decline led to court-imposed pumping limits, impacting the economy and species. A proposed Calvert amendment to prevent restrictions on water projects was defeated. Unemployment in water districts with junior water rights worsened due to low water deliveries. Amendments related to Delta pumping restrictions were passed in the House. The bill includes an additional $9 million for the California Bay-Delta Restoration Program and language to facilitate water transfers. The Administration requested $31.0 million for the Bay-Delta for FY2010, targeting funds at water use efficiency, water quality, water storage, conveyance, and ecosystem restoration. The Administration requested funding for various activities in the California Bay-Delta Restoration Program, including water use efficiency, water quality, water storage, conveyance, and ecosystem restoration. Funding for the program includes allocations for science, planning, and management activities, with a significant increase in funding for water use efficiency and ecosystem restoration. The conference agreement provides $40 million for CALFED, $9 million more than requested but $1 million less than recommended. $35.4 million is allocated for the CVPRF, with an extension of the CALFED authorization to 2014. Funding for both CVPRF and CALFED is lower than FY2009, serving areas in California facing water supply reductions and pumping restrictions due to drought. Reclamation proposed a $15.9 million allocation for the San Joaquin River Restoration Fund for FY2010, authorized by the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act. The Fund will be used for fisheries restoration and water management, funded through various sources including Central Valley Project Restoration Fund receipts and Friant water users' capital repayment obligations. Reclamation plans to release interim flows from Friant Dam in FY2010 and complete a permit application for reintroducing spring-run Chinook salmon into the San Joaquin River. The construction of Friant Dam in the 1940s blocked salmon migration and dewatered parts of the river, leading to the elimination of spring-run Chinook. The goal of the settlement is to restore the salmon run and minimize water supply impacts to Friant Division long-term contractors. The Senate bill includes $7.0 million in CVP funding for the San Joaquin River Restoration, with the conference agreement providing $5.0 million. Reclamation proposed a new program for FY2010 called the Water Conservation Initiative (WCI), requesting $46 million, including $37 million for two specific purposes. The Senate bill includes $7.0 million in CVP funding for the San Joaquin River Restoration, with the conference agreement providing $5.0 million. Reclamation proposed a new program for FY2010 called the Water Conservation Initiative (WCI), requesting $46 million, including $37 million for two specific purposes. The House Committee on Appropriations report did not discuss the WCI; however, the report notes that $100,000 will be provided for each Title XVI project pending the announcement of ARRA funding. Reclamation has announced $134.3 million in ARRA funding for 27 projects\u201426 of which are in California. The Senate Committee on Appropriations encourages Reclamation to work with a lab at Utah State University to expand. The Energy and Water Development bill has funded all DOE's programs since FY2005, including research on renewable energy, nuclear power, environmental cleanup, and nuclear weapons programs. The FY2009 appropriations funded DOE programs at $34.2 billion, with additional funding from the ARRA (P.L. 111-5) of $38.7 billion for selected DOE programs. In FY2009, DOE programs were funded at $34.2 billion, with an additional $38.7 billion from the ARRA (P.L. 111-5) for selected programs, including Conservation and Renewable Energy, Electricity Delivery, Fossil Energy R&D, Science, and Environmental Clean-up. President Obama emphasized energy efficiency and renewable energy policy in his address to Congress, highlighting the importance of finding new energy sources for survival. The ARRA aimed to create jobs in renewable energy industries like wind power. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) aimed to boost jobs in renewable energy industries like wind and solar energy. The Department of Energy's FY2010 request seeks $2.3186 billion for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) programs, with a $390.1 million increase from FY2009. In addition to regular appropriations, ARRA provided $17.05 billion for EERE programs and $4.5 billion for Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability. ARRA emphasizes job creation, economic recovery, and assistance for those impacted by the recession, allocating $16.8 billion for EERE programs, including $2.5 billion for R&D programs. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) allocated funds for various R&D programs in FY2010, including $2.5 billion for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) programs. This included specific amounts for programs such as the Biomass Program, Geothermal Program, Wind Energy, Industrial Technologies, Fuel Cell Technologies, Facilities and Infrastructure, and Program Direction. Additionally, the law provided $11.3 billion for grant programs, including Weatherization Grants, State Energy Program, and Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program. Transportation related grants were also included, such as Advanced Battery Manufacturing, Transportation Electrification, and Alternative Fueled Vehicles. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated funds for various R&D programs in FY2010, including $2.5 billion for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy programs. The law also provided $300 million for Alternative Fueled Vehicles and $4.5 billion for grid modernization and related technologies. Proposed increases in funding include Solar Technologies, Building Technologies, Vehicle Technologies, and State Energy grants. The House bill proposes major cuts in various programs, including Congressionally-Directed Activities and Fuel Cells. It includes $2.250 billion for EERE, with increases for Congressionally Directed Activities and Vehicle Technologies. The bill also decreases funding for RE-ENERGYSE, Program Management, Solar Technologies, and Building Technologies. In floor action, the House approved a $15.0 million increase, including more funding for Water Power Technologies. The Senate bill proposes $2.233 billion for EERE, with increases for Hydrogen/Fuel Cell Technologies, Water Power Technologies, and Wind Technologies. It eliminates the RE-ENERGYSE program and reduces funding for Program Management, Vehicle Technologies, state energy grants, and weatherization grants compared to the House bill. An amendment designates $15.0 million for a specific purpose. The Senate bill proposes $2.233 billion for EERE, with increases for various programs including Concentrating Solar Power (CSP). An amendment designates $15.0 million for Industrial Programs for technical assistance grants, nearly tripling spending for CSP. New solar subprogram focus areas include Systems Integration, Market Transformation, and the Solar Electricity Energy Innovation Hub. Two new subprogram activities would receive most of the proposed $54.1 million increase for CSP funding, with $17 million for high-temperature baseload power and $22 million for a \"Pilot Solar Zone.\" The Pilot Solar Zone initiative involves developing a land parcel to support utility-scale solar projects in collaboration with the DOE, BLM, and solar developers. The Systems Integration subprogram will receive a $17.5 million boost for activities such as system modeling, grid integration, and resource mapping to enhance solar energy production and grid access. The Solar Energy Program includes activities to improve solar resource mapping, reduce solar power costs, and promote commercial use of solar technologies. It addresses market barriers, promotes large-scale solar deployment, assists U.S. cities in using solar power, and provides technical assistance for large-scale projects. The Solar Policy and Analysis Network (SPAN) is a new market transformation activity proposed for launch in FY2010. SPAN aims to provide analysis on policies promoting solar market transformation by leveraging university expertise and attracting new students to the solar industry. Energy Innovation Hubs focus on addressing science, technology, economics, and policy issues to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote energy security. The Solar Electricity Energy Innovation Hub aims to push energy science and technology towards fundamental limits and support high-risk research projects. The House bill would provide $258.7 million for Solar programs, but no funding for the Hub. The Appropriations Committee expressed concern with DOE's proposal to establish eight Energy Innovation Hubs. The Committee expressed concern with DOE's proposal to establish eight Energy Innovation Hubs, citing overlap with existing centers and lack of detailed plans. However, they support the concept and recommend $35 million for one Hub under the Office of Science. The Senate bill would allocate $255.0 million for Solar Technologies, with $30.0 million directed towards Concentrating Solar. Additionally, the Committee encourages R&D on innovative textiles like solar cell roofing shingles and directs DOE to develop the PV Manufacturing Initiative. The Senate adopted the Committee's funding recommendations for the Solar Technologies Program, allocating $225.0 million. Funding would be provided for Concentrating Solar, but not for the Solar Electricity Energy Innovation Hub. Within the Building Technologies program, the Emerging Technologies subprogram would receive a $97.7 million increase, with $48.9 million going towards it. An Energy Innovation Hub focused on energy efficient building systems design would receive $35.0 million to integrate smart materials and systems for energy conservation. The Residential Buildings Integration subprogram would receive an $18.1 million increase to develop cost-effective, energy-efficient systems in different climate zones. The Zero Energy Home (ZEH) initiative aims to create homes that produce as much energy as they use annually by combining energy-efficient construction with renewable energy systems like solar power. The goal is to achieve net zero financial cost for homeowners. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended no funds for the proposed Equipment Standards and Analysis Hub, with the Senate approving the recommendation. The conference report recommends $200.0 million, with $27.0 million allocated for solid state R&D. No funding would be provided for the Energy Efficient Building Systems Design Innovation Hub. The largest share of the $60.1 million requested increase would go to Hybrid Electric Systems, focusing on advanced vehicle technologies. The focus is on R&D for advanced vehicle technologies to improve fuel economy without compromising safety, performance, or affordability. The Vehicle and Systems Simulation and Testing activity will receive a $32.2 million increase to develop technologies for reducing energy losses in commercial vehicles. This funding will also support testing of both commercial and passenger vehicles, as well as the evaluation of advanced prototypes. The increase in funding will expand the evaluation of advanced electric drive vehicles with dual energy storage systems, power electronics, and motors. A new solicitation will fund industry R&D for power electronics and electric motors to support vehicle electrification efforts. DOE emphasizes the importance of electrification in reducing oil imports and highlights the critical role of advanced power electronics and electric motors in deploying advanced vehicles. The awards for power electronics and electric motors will enable cost reductions and technology transfer to domestic manufacturers. Emphasis is on R&D for advanced packaging, reliability, and manufacturability. Activities include research on inverters, motors, converters, magnet materials, capacitors, thermal systems, and motor control systems to meet performance requirements for PHEVs. Advanced materials research will be enhanced to enable further advancements. The House bill would appropriate $40 million above the request to support technologies for hydrogen transportation and advanced materials research. A floor amendment added $5.0 million for the development of natural gas vehicles. The Senate bill would zero out the Fuel Cells account but provide $190.0 million for the Hydrogen Technologies account. The conference report would provide $7.5 million for coordination with the Biomass Program. The House Appropriations Committee report includes funding for ethanol and gasoline fuel blends, natural gas vehicle R&D, and an analysis of light-duty vehicle transportation. It does not include funding for hydrogen or a study on recharging options. The report also emphasizes studying the \"green job economy\" and recruiting staff from Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions. The Senate Appropriations Committee report includes directives for EERE, with a focus on funding for hydrogen technologies. The Committee directs funding for algae biofuels, increasing wind energy deployment nationwide, supporting Fuels from Sunlight and Energy Efficient Building Systems hubs, and improving home insulation and sealing in older homes. The conference report includes funding for various projects such as ethanol use, water power technologies, geothermal technologies, and renewable energy demonstrations. It also allocates funds for algae biofuels research and development, a five-year R&D plan for water power technologies, and congressionally directed activities totaling $292.1 million. The report does not include a House-proposed reporting requirement for tracking the progress of EERE investments. The FY2010 request would provide $208.0 million to the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE), a $71.0 million increase above the FY2009 appropriation. This increase is for new major programs including Clean Energy Transmission, Smart Grid R&D, Energy Storage, and Cyber Security. The House bill provision is identical to the request, but the Senate bill would appropriate $179.6 million. The Committee recommended no funding for the Grid Materials, Devices, and Systems Hub and $6.5 million for congressionally directed activities. The conference report would provide $172.0 million for OE, with no funds for the Grid Materials, Devices, and Systems Hub. The Obama Administration's FY2010 funding request for nuclear energy research and development totals $761.3 million, including advanced reactors, fuel cycle technology, infrastructure support, and security. The House provided $812.0 million, $50.4 million above the request and $20.0 million above the FY2009 level. The Senate approved the same funding level as the Administration request. DOE's nuclear energy R&D program focuses on generation, safety, waste storage and management, and security technologies to meet energy and climate goals. Critics argue that the program provides wasteful subsidies to an industry they believe should be phased out. Total funding in the FY2010 nuclear energy request is similar to previous years. The Obama Administration's FY2010 nuclear energy funding request remains similar to previous years, but with significant changes. The Nuclear Power 2010 Program would be largely eliminated, hydrogen production research with nuclear reactors would cease, and the AFCI would be renamed and shifted towards longer-term research. The House Appropriations Committee called for a strategic plan on balancing long-term R&D with near-term reactor deployment. Funding for the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility would continue to help dispose of surplus weapons. Funding for the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility, aimed at disposing of surplus weapons plutonium, would be transferred from DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy to the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Program. The Nuclear Power 2010 Program, which supported new commercial reactor construction, faced significant funding cuts under the Obama Administration's proposal. The Standby Support Program, designed to address regulatory delays for new reactors, would continue under the Office of Nuclear. The Standby Support Program under the Office of Nuclear Energy program direction account received funding of $71.0 million from the House and $120 million from the Senate. The final installment of $105.0 million was provided for the Nuclear Power 2010 program. The Department of Energy stated that federal funding for new nuclear power plants is no longer needed due to industry interest. $20 million was requested for FY2010 to assist NuStart in licensing a new reactor at the Vogtle plant in Georgia. No further funding was allocated for other industry consortiums or reactor designs. The DOE requested $191.0 million for FY2010 for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems, focusing on advanced commercial reactor technologies. The budget cut $24 million from previous activities to shift emphasis to long-term technology advances. $35 million was included to establish the Energy Innovation Hub for Modeling and Simulation. The Energy Innovation Hub for Modeling and Simulation was established with $35 million to focus on computer assistance for nuclear power and radioactive waste. The House did not provide funding for the Hub but increased total Generation IV funding to $272.4 million. The Senate approved $143 million, including funding for the Hub. The conference agreement allocated $220.1 million, with $22.0 million for the Hub. The budget shifted focus from the Next Generation Nuclear Plant to long-term technology advances. The Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) features helium as a coolant and coated-particle fuel that can withstand high temperatures. Phase I research was to continue until 2011, with a decision on moving to Phase II. The House Appropriations Committee provided additional funding to accelerate work on NGNP. DOE's proposed FY2010 nuclear research program did not mention NGNP but included activities related to VHTR technology. Other advanced reactor concepts like sodium-cooled fast reactors and molten salt reactors were also to continue. The House Appropriations Committee specified at least $245.0 million for NGNP in FY2010. The Senate Appropriations Committee FY2010 report did not specifically mention NGNP but called for DOE to select two advanced reactor technologies for future research. The conference agreement provides $169.0 million for NGNP and $17.8 million for other Generation IV reactor concepts. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorized $1.25 billion through FY2015 for NGNP development and construction. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorized the development of the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) to produce electricity and hydrogen by 2021. The FY2010 budget allocated $192.0 million for the Fuel Cycle Research and Development program, with a focus on long-term research. The House reduced funding to $129.2 million, excluding the Extreme Materials Hub. The FY2010 budget allocated $192.0 million for Fuel Cycle R&D, with the House reducing funding to $129.2 million due to lack of research direction specificity. The Senate provided $145.0 million, while the conference agreement settled on $136.0 million, excluding funding for the Extreme Materials Hub. DOE plans to continue research on technologies to reduce spent nuclear fuel hazards, including separation of plutonium and uranium for reuse or transmutation. Research will also focus on waste storage, security systems, and disposal options like salt formations and deep boreholes. The DOE nuclear waste strategy panel identified needs for advanced materials research to improve nuclear waste packages, reactor designs, and reactor safety. The Energy Innovation Hub for Extreme Materials was intended to support this research, following the elimination of funding for the GNEP program in FY2009. (For more information about nuclear reprocessing, see CRS Report RL34579, Advanced Nuclear Power) The Obama Administration proposed to discontinue funding for the Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative in FY2010, shifting resources to higher priority activities related to waste management, materials, and simulation. Both the House and Senate agreed to eliminate the program, with the Obama Administration requesting $617.6 million for Fossil Energy Research and Development in FY2010. The Obama Administration requested $617.6 million for Fossil Energy Research and Development in FY2010, a 29.5% decrease from FY2009. The request is supplemented by $3.4 billion from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. No new funding for Clean Coal Technology or Clean Coal Power Initiative in FY2010 due to previous appropriations. FutureGen project funding pending review for clean coal-based power generation with CO2 capture and sequestration. In early 2008, the Bush Administration restructured the FutureGen program to focus on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies for clean coal-based power generation. The DOE proposed a cost-shared collaboration with industry, with awards ranging from $100 million to $600 million. The FY2010 request had no funding for the Carbon Capture Initiative, resulting in a $288.5 million reduction in the President's request for Fuels and Power. The President's request for Fuels and Power has been reduced by $288.5 million (42%) from the prior year appropriation. No funding has been requested for Oil Technology due to the Obama administration's policy. There is an increase in funding for Carbon Sequestration and Natural Gas, while Program Direction sees a 4% increase. The House bill would appropriate $617.6 million for the Fossil Energy R&D program, with some reductions in carbon sequestration research. The Senate bill allocates $699.2 million for Fossil Energy R&D, including funding for research on high purity hydrogen production from coal. The bill also includes $428.2 million for fuels and power systems, with reductions in Carbon Sequestration funding. Additionally, the Conference Report for H.R. 3183 provides $672.4 million for Fossil Energy R&D, with $36.9 million for Congressionally Directed Fossil Energy Projects. In FY2009, $876.3 million was appropriated for fossil energy research and development, with $288.2 million available for the Clean Coal Power Initiative Round III solicitation. Additionally, $43.9 million was allocated for Congressionally Directed Fossil Energy Projects. The Coal Power Initiative Round III Funding Opportunity Announcement includes $1.52 billion for industrial carbon capture and energy efficiency projects, $50.0 million for site characterization activities, $20.0 million for sequestration training and research, and $10.0 million for program direction. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) consists of caverns in Louisiana and Texas with a current capacity of 727 million barrels, authorized at 1 billion barrels, to provide an emergency crude oil source. The Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) was established during the Clinton Administration to house 2 million barrels of home heating oil. Fill of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) has been mainly done with deliveries of royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil since the mid-1990s. Loans of crude oil from the SPR after hurricanes were returned with a greater volume of oil. H.R. 6022 (P.L. 110-232) suspended RIK fill unless crude oil prices fell below a specified threshold. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 required expansion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to one billion barrels. Congress approved $205 million for the SPR program in FY2009, including funds for expansion activities in Richton, MS. The FY2010 budget request included $43.5 million for a cavern at Bayou Choctaw to replace an environmentally risky cavern. The Senate Committee on Appropriations added $30 million for engineering activities at the Richton, MS expansion site. The Committee supported engineering activities for the expansion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in Richton, MS, but did not approve any other activities at this time. The Senate proposal included restrictions on funds for firms providing products or services to Iran, and allocated $25 million for work at the Richton site. Congress approved a total of $243.8 million for the project. The FY2010 request for the NHOR is $11.3 million to repurchase heating oil sold during FY2007. The DOE Office of Science conducts basic research in various program areas and is a significant federal funder of research. ARPA-E was established to support innovative energy technology research projects. The COMPETES Act (P.L. 110-69) supports energy technology research projects. For FY2010, DOE requested $4.942 billion for the Office of Science, an increase of 4% from FY2009. ARPA-E received $10 million, a 33% reduction from FY2009. Both offices also received additional funding in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The President's Plan for Science and Innovation aims to double R&D funding for the Office of Science and other agencies by FY2016. The Office of Science, along with two other agencies, saw a 4% increase in funding from FY2006 to FY2016 as part of the American Competitiveness Initiative. The requested funding for basic energy sciences in FY2010 is $1.686 billion, up 7% from the previous year. Proposed increases include $34 million each for two innovation hubs focused on energy storage materials and fuel production from solar energy. Funding for scientific user facilities is identified as a separate subprogram for the first time, with a proposed increase of $20 million. The House report accepted the proposal to establish scientific user facilities as a separate subprogram with a proposed increase of $20 million. The Senate rejected it, and the conference report was silent. The House provided $1.675 billion for basic energy sciences, including funding for one hub and $23 million more than the request for scientific user facilities. The Senate provided $1.654 billion, including both requested hubs. The conference report provided $1.636 billion, including neither hub. Proposed increases for high-energy physics include $31 million for the NO\u03bdA detector at Fermilab and $12 million for U.S. activities in support of upgrades at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The House, Senate, and conference report provided funding for upgrades at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), with slight variations in the amounts allocated. The request for biological and environmental research saw a small increase to $604 million. For nuclear physics, the request is $552 million, with increases for all four research subprograms. The conference report expressed concern about U.S. isotope production but allocated not less than the requested amount for isotope development and production. Funding for nuclear medicine applications research was shifted to the biological and environmental research program. The House, Senate, and conference report provided varying amounts for nuclear physics, with the final allocation at $535 million. The request for fusion energy sciences is $421 million, including an $11 million increase for the U.S. share of ITER. The U.S. share of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) construction cost is 9.1%, estimated to be between $1.45 billion and $2.2 billion. There are concerns about ballooning costs and delays, with a revised cost and schedule expected in late FY2010 or FY2011. The House provided $20 million for laser fusion research, the Senate provided $416 million, and the conference report allocated $426 million. The conference report allocated $426 million for the Office of Science research programs, with proposed increases for advanced scientific computing research and the Leadership Computing Facility. The request for laboratory infrastructure is $134 million, down 8% from the previous year. No new funds are requested for excess facilities disposition. The conference report provided $128 million for ARPA-E, a new program aimed at overcoming technological barriers in energy development. The House and Senate did not allocate additional funds for ARPA-E, citing remaining ARRA funds. DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management is responsible for disposing of highly radioactive waste. The Obama Administration decided to terminate the Yucca Mountain program for nuclear waste disposal, seeking alternative solutions. A \"blue ribbon\" panel of experts will evaluate these alternatives, while the Nuclear Regulatory Commission continues the licensing process for Yucca Mountain. The FY2010 budget requested $198.6 million for the licensing process and policy evaluation, which was $90 million below the needed amount. The FY2010 budget requested $90 million below the FY2009 funding level for alternative policies in nuclear waste disposal. Over 2,000 waste program contract employees were to be terminated, with federal staff taking over most remaining work. Yucca Mountain repository construction and operation preparations were halted, with funding solely for licensing activities and a blue-ribbon panel review approved by the House. The House-passed bill allocated $5 million for a blue-ribbon review, insisting that Yucca Mountain be considered despite the Administration's opposition. The House panel recommended $70 million for expertise maintenance by the Yucca Mountain Project management contractor. The Senate approved the Administration's request without restrictions on the review panel. Funding for the nuclear waste program comes from two appropriations accounts. The Administration's FY2010 request for the nuclear waste program is divided between the Nuclear Waste Fund and the Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal account. The Senate Appropriations Committee called for fee collections to be suspended due to the termination of the Yucca Mountain repository program. The conference agreement provides reduced funding and allocates $5 million for a Blue Ribbon Commission to consider nuclear waste disposal alternatives. The Conference Committee Joint Explanatory Statement supersedes House and Senate reports, including Yucca Mountain as a disposal option. The NRC budget request for Yucca Mountain was reduced to $29 million from $56 million. DOE failed to meet the NWPA deadline for waste disposal, leading to court decisions in favor of utilities. DOE estimates liability payments could reach $11 billion if waste removal from reactor sites starts by 2020. Congress established the DOE Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program to support energy projects with new technologies. The FY2009 omnibus funding measure provided DOE with $47 billion in loan guarantee authority. The FY2009 omnibus funding measure provided DOE with $47 billion in loan guarantee authority, including $18.5 billion for nuclear power, $18.5 billion for energy efficiency and renewables, $6 billion for coal, $2 billion for carbon capture and sequestration, and $2 billion for uranium enrichment. The FY2010 budget requested an increase in administrative funding to $43.0 million, offset by fees, with additional loan guarantees of up to $60 billion for renewable energy and electric transmission projects provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The DOE received $6 billion in funding to cover potential loan defaults, with $2 billion transferred to the \"cash for clunkers\" program. The Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program was established in 2007, with $7.5 billion appropriated in FY2009 for up to $25 billion in direct loans. In FY2010, $20 million was requested for administrative expenses. The program provides loans to automobile manufacturers and parts suppliers for investments in plant capacity to produce vehicles with improved fuel economy. The Stockpile Stewardship Program was established by Congress to maintain the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear stockpile. It is operated by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and consists of various programs within the Weapons Activities account. NNSA also manages programs outside of Weapons Activities, including Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation and Naval Reactors. The Nuclear Nonproliferation and Naval Reactors are part of the stewardship activities at the nuclear weapons complex, which includes three laboratories and four production sites managed by NNSA. The FY2010 request document includes data from NNSA's Future Years Nuclear Security Program (FYNSP) projecting the budget through FY2014. Despite the post-Cold War reduction, there have been calls for changes in the Complex. Despite calls for changes in the Complex, in January 2007 NNSA submitted a report to Congress on its plan for transforming the Complex, \"Complex 2030.\" The House Appropriations Committee expressed displeasure with the plan and demanded a comprehensive nuclear defense and nonproliferation strategy before considering further funding for Complex 2030 and the Reliable Replacement Warhead program. The Senate Appropriations Committee criticized the NNSA's plan for Complex 2030 and the Reliable Replacement Warhead program, stating a lack of strategy and rejecting premature deployment. Congress requested a comprehensive nuclear weapons strategy for the 21st century. NNSA later announced Complex Transformation, reducing the weapons program footprint. The NNSA's Complex Transformation plan aims to reduce the weapons program footprint by one-third, close or transfer 600 structures, decrease weapons workers by 20%-30%, accelerate dismantling of weapons, and construct new facilities like the Uranium Processing Facility, Weapons Surveillance Facility, and Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement Nuclear Facility. This plan was detailed in the Final Complex Transformation Supplemental Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement in October 2008. The Committee recommends a 21st Century nuclear deterrent strategy focused on current and future threats, determining the size and nature of the nuclear stockpile and weapons complex needed to support it. Funding for the Reliable Replacement Warhead and other programs was recommended for elimination in the FY2009 report. The FY2010 budget proposes canceling the Reliable Replacement Warhead program, which aimed to replace current nuclear weapons. The program involves monitoring, maintaining, and R&D on nuclear weapons in the stockpile, including Life Extension Programs for existing warheads. An LEP for the B61 mods 7 and 11 bombs was completed in FY2009; no funds are requested for it for FY2010. An LEP for the W76 warhead for the Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missile is ongoing. The House bill would increase the request for the W76-1 to $233.2 million, expressing concern that NNSA's request \"does not reflect the needs of military clients.\" The Senate bill would appropriate the amount requested, and the conference bill includes $223.2 million for Stockpile Systems program involving routine maintenance and replacement. The Stockpile Systems program involves routine maintenance, replacement of limited-life components, and ongoing assessment for all weapon types in the stockpile. The House bill would appropriate funds for B61 sustainment but not for a refurbishment study. The Senate bill includes the requested amount, and the conference bill allocates $357.8 million, with $92.0 million for B61 stockpile systems activities. The NNSA is authorized to reallocate $15,000,000 for the B61-12 non-nuclear upgrade study, with no funds to be used for nuclear components without approval. The President and Congress aim to reduce the stockpile while maintaining national security. Reducing U.S. nuclear weapons signals modernization without a return to the Cold War arms race. The Weapons Dismantlement and Disposition (WDD) program involves interim storage and dismantlement of warheads. Funding for WDD in FY2010 includes $96.1 million, with a focus on the Pit Disassembly and Conversion Facility (PDCF) for converting plutonium in warhead pits to plutonium oxide for commercial use. The MFFF was transferred to DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy in FY2008. The WDD program includes a Waste Solidification Building to convert liquid wastes into solids for disposal. Stockpile Services funding for FY2010 includes Production Support, R&D, and pit work. The FY2010 request for Stockpile Services is $831.1 million. In FY2009, H.R. 1105 reduced funding for Plutonium Capability to $155.3 million from $198.8 million in FY2008. In FY2010, NNSA renamed it to Plutonium Sustainment with a request of $149.2 million for pit manufacturing and W88 warheads. The House bill recommended $123.2 million for Plutonium Infrastructure Sustainment to maintain plutonium capability. The Senate bill included $844.1 million, with an increase for subcritical experiments at the Nevada Test Site. The conference bill includes $828.8 million for the Reliable Replacement Warhead program, which aimed to develop a warhead to replace W76 warheads. Congress eliminated funding for this program in FY2008 and FY2009, and the Administration proposed to cancel it in FY2010. These efforts provide specialized scientific knowledge and technical support for the nuclear weapons stockpile. The Science Campaign aims to improve warhead performance assessment without nuclear testing and readiness for nuclear tests if needed. The FY2010 budget includes funding for campaigns aimed at improving readiness for nuclear tests and maintaining scientific infrastructure at nuclear weapons laboratories. The Senate Appropriations Committee believes that the requested funding level is inadequate for modernization of the complex. The Senate bill includes $319.7 million for the Science Campaign, while the conference bill includes $295.6 million for the Engineering Campaign, aimed at improving safety and reliability of nuclear weapons components. The FY2010 budget also includes $150.0 million for Enhanced Surety to enhance safety and security measures for nuclear weapons. The House bill includes $174.1 million for FY2010, with $66.1 million allocated for Enhanced Surety. The Senate and conference bills include the requested amount for the Inertial Confinement Fusion Ignition and High Yield Campaign, focused on creating high temperatures and pressures for weapons research. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) was controversial but gained support as it progressed, with key experiments expected to be conducted. The facility was dedicated in May 2009 with key experiments expected to begin in 2010. Funding for the Advanced Simulation and Computing Campaign was provided by P.L. 111-8, with the FY2010 request also being $436.9 million. The campaign aims to develop computation-based models of nuclear weapons for comprehensive understanding of the weapons lifecycle. Funding for this campaign was also provided by P.L. 111-8, with the FY2010 request being $556.1 million. The budget for the NNSA's computing strategy lacks detail, raising concerns about fitting new platforms within the budget. The House bill for FY2010 would appropriate $561.1 million, with $5.0 million designated for technology assessments of nuclear weapons. The Senate bill and conference bill would allocate $566.1 million and $567.6 million respectively. The Readiness Campaign aims to develop technologies and techniques. The Readiness Campaign aims to develop technologies and techniques to improve manufacturing safety and efficiency, with funding of $567.6 million. The Operations of Facilities program, part of the NNSA budget, received $1,842.9 million in the conference bill for FY2010. The largest program in the NNSA budget is Operations of Facilities, receiving $1,348.3 million in the conference bill for FY2010. Other programs include Program Readiness, Material Recycle and Recovery, and Construction, with the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Building Replacement Project being the most costly and controversial. The Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Building Replacement Project (CMRR) is a controversial project with a high cost of $55.0 million. The House Appropriations Committee believes that proceeding with the project will strongly prejudice any nuclear complex transformation plan, while the Senate Appropriations Committee highlights the need for worker safety and containment precautions in the existing facility. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees have differing views on the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Building Replacement Project (CMRR). The House committee recommended no funds for the project, citing the need for critical decisions on the stockpile size. The Senate committee recommended $125.0 million for CMRR to address previous funding shortfalls. The House bill for FY2010 includes $55.0 million for CMRR, while the Senate bill includes $98.0 million. The House and Senate bills have differing funding amounts for the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Building Replacement Project (CMRR). The House bill includes $55.0 million for CMRR, the Senate bill includes $98.0 million, and the conference bill provides $97.0 million. The House Appropriations Committee stated that the budget does not allow for construction of both CMRR and the Uranium Processing Facility (UPF) at the same time. The House bill would appropriate $101.5 million for UPF, while the Senate bill would appropriate $94.0 million. The conference bill includes funding for UPF as well. Additionally, the Weapons Activities program includes the Secure Transportation Asset program, which provides for safe transport of nuclear weapons and materials. The FY2010 budget includes funding for Nuclear Weapons Counterterrorism Response, Facilities and Infrastructure Recapitalization Program, and Site Stewardship. The funding amounts for these programs are specified in P.L. 111-8 and the conference bill. The FY2010 budget includes funding for Site Stewardship, a new program consolidating earlier programs, with a request of $90.4 million. The House bill supports the program but reduces funding to $62.4 million due to budget limitations. The Senate bill denies funding for the stewardship planning initiative, citing poorly defined mission priorities. The conference bill provides $61.3 million for Site Stewardship. Defense Nuclear Security, which includes operations, maintenance, and construction funds for security measures, had a FY2010 request of $749.0 million. The House bill allocated $789.0 million for this purpose. The FY2010 budget allocated funds for Site Stewardship, with the House bill reducing funding to $62.4 million. The Senate bill denied funding for the initiative, while the conference bill provided $61.3 million. Cyber Security received $122.5 million in the FY2010 request, with $3.0 million allocated for congressionally directed projects. Nonproliferation and national security programs support U.S. efforts to prevent nuclear spread. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) supports U.S. efforts to prevent nuclear weapons spread worldwide. Funding for Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation in FY2010 was $2.137 billion, with the Senate bill appropriating $2.1367 billion. The Nonproliferation and Verification R&D program received $363.8 million in FY2009. The Nonproliferation and Verification R&D program received $363.8 million in FY2009. The FY2010 request was $297.3 million, with the House bill and Senate bill proposing $297.3 million and $337.3 million respectively. The conference amount is $317.3 million. International Materials Protection, Control and Accounting (MPC&A) was funded at $400.0 million in FY2009, with a FY2010 request of $552.3 million. The House bill would provide $592.1 million, and the Senate bill would provide $552.3 million. The conference bill appropriates $572.1 million for the elimination of Weapons-Grade Plutonium Production program. The goal is to persuade Russia to shut down nuclear reactors producing weapons-grade plutonium. Two reactors were shut down in 2008 and replaced with fossil-fueled facilities. The Fissile Materials Disposition program aims to convert surplus weapons plutonium into fuel for commercial power reactors. The program was funded at $141.3 million for FY2009 and $24.5 million for FY2010, with the House and Senate bills appropriating the requested amount. The U.S. and Russia had a program to convert plutonium to reactor fuel, but lack of progress led to controversy over funding. The House Appropriations Committee declared the bilateral agreement a failure and recommended transferring the MOX plant. The House Appropriations Committee recommended transferring the MOX plant and PDCF to different programs. The FY2008 omnibus funding act adopted this recommendation, reducing the net appropriation for the NNSA's Fissile Materials Disposition program. The Obama Administration proposed returning the MOX plant to the Nonproliferation program for FY2010, requesting $701.9 million for Fissile Materials Disposition. The Obama Administration proposed a credible program to dispose of Russian surplus weapon-grade plutonium in November 2007. The House Appropriations Committee disagreed and transferred the projects to Other Weapons Activities, reducing Fissile Materials Disposition funding to $36.4 million. The Senate approved the Administration's project transfer and allocated $701.9 million. The Office of Environmental Management was established in 1989 for cleanup of nuclear weapons sites, including disposal of radioactive waste and decontamination of buildings. The Office of Environmental Management oversees cleanup of federal facilities involved in nuclear weapons production and research. Cleanup is complete at over 80 facilities, but will continue for many years at others. Total costs for completing cleanup could range between $205 billion and $260 billion. Additional funds will be needed to operate, maintain, and monitor cleanup remedies. Funds are required for long-term operation, maintenance, and monitoring of cleanup remedies at various facilities. Some facilities under the Office of Environmental Management have been transferred to other offices or the Army Corps of Engineers. Congress directed the transfer of cleanup responsibility for smaller, less contaminated facilities to the Corps under the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP). After initial cleanup, the Corps is responsible for activities for the first two years. The Office of Environmental Management oversees cleanup activities at various facilities, with jurisdiction transferred to DOE's Office of Legacy Management after two years. Funding for the office comes from three accounts, with Defense Environmental Cleanup receiving the largest portion. The conference report on H.R. 3183 proposes $5.64 billion for Defense Environmental Cleanup in FY2010. The conference report proposed $5.66 billion for Defense Environmental Cleanup in FY2009, with $244.7 million for Non-Defense Cleanup in FY2010 and $573.9 million for the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund account in FY2010. The House, Senate, and President had varying proposals for these allocations. The Office of Environmental Management received $6.0 billion in supplemental appropriations for FY2009 in the ARRA. DOE is to obligate the funds by the end of FY2010. $5.13 billion was allocated to Defense Environmental Cleanup, $483 million to Non-Defense Cleanup, and $390 million to the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund account. The funds will be used for \"footprint reduction\" and finishing up projects nearing completion to reduce maintenance costs and make cleanup progress. DOE received $6.0 billion in supplemental appropriations for FY2009 in the ARRA, with funds allocated to Defense Environmental Cleanup, Non-Defense Cleanup, and the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund account. The funding will be used for cleanup progress, including significant cleanup progress and hiring blue-collar workers with limited training required. DOE's approach in allocating the funding aims to address economic stimulus goals, with milestones set for completion of cleanup actions. The committee highlighted the increase in funding for DOE in FY2009 from the ARRA, expecting it to help meet cleanup milestones. DOE was directed to update its progress report by April 1, 2010. Concerns were raised about the pace of cleanup at major sites like Hanford, Savannah River, and Idaho National Laboratory due to complex challenges from nuclear weapons production. Hanford would receive $2.09 billion in FY2010. The conference report on DOE funding for FY2010 includes $1.21 billion for the Savannah River site, $464.2 million for the Idaho National Laboratory. Cleanup at Hanford, Savannah River, and Idaho National Laboratory is expected to continue for decades, with completion estimated as late as 2062, 2040, and 2037 respectively. The Department of Energy (DOE) needs to treat and dispose of high-level radioactive wastes stored at Hanford, Savannah River, and Idaho National Laboratory. There are a total of 54 million gallons at Hanford, 33 million gallons at Savannah River, and nearly 1 million gallons at Idaho National Laboratory. The lack of a geologic repository and delays in waste treatment facilities construction raise concerns about environmental risks. Leakage from tanks at Hanford into groundwater is monitored by DOE. The Department of Energy (DOE) monitors groundwater contamination from tank wastes at Hanford, Savannah River, and Idaho National Laboratory. Concerns also exist about possible contamination of the Columbia River and Snake River. Funding for cleanup of uranium enrichment facilities is supported by the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund established by the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund, established by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, received assessments from nuclear utilities and federal payments. The authority to collect utility assessments and federal payments expired in 2007, but Congress has continued payments without reauthorizing legislation. The fund's remaining balance may not be enough to cover cleanup costs for federal enrichment facilities, with $4.5 billion available as of FY2008, far less than DOE's estimated range of $15 billion to $29 billion. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund, established by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, may not have enough funds to cover cleanup costs for federal enrichment facilities. The fund's remaining balance is $4.5 billion as of FY2008, far less than the estimated range of $15 billion to $29 billion needed for long-term cleanup. If the fund is insufficient, DOE is responsible for costs, subject to appropriations by Congress. The President proposed reinstating utility assessments to increase resources, with $200 million in estimated collections in the FY2010 budget request. Reauthorizing legislation is needed before assessments can be collected. Two bills have been introduced in the 111th Congress to reauthorize the utility assessments. The conference report on H.R. 3183 included $463 million for the Defense Environmental Cleanup account to continue federal payments to the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund in FY2010. The Department of Energy plans to expand cleanup work at the Portsmouth uranium enrichment plant, with funding to come from an \"off-budget barter strategy for federal uranium assets.\" Concerns were raised about the financial viability of this strategy. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) was directed to evaluate DOE's management of federal uranium assets and its success in meeting budgetary objectives through material sales. Funding levels for DOE's Office of Environmental Management in FY2010 were compared to FY2009 appropriations. Responsibility for long-term operation and maintenance of cleaned-up facilities is transferred to DOE's Office of Legacy Management, which also handles pensions and benefits for former contractor personnel. The conference report on H.R. 3183 would provide $189.8 million in FY2010 for the Office of Legacy Management, the same as the House and Senate had proposed prior to conference, and the same as the President had requested. Congress appropriated $186.0 million for the Office of Legacy Management in FY2009, funding all facilities under the \"Other Defense Activities\" account of DOE. The DOE's Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) were established to sell power generated by dams operated by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. Priority for PMA power is given to \"preference customers\" such as municipal utilities and cooperatives, selling power at low rates. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) sell power generated by dams at low rates to preference customers. The Obama Administration's FY2010 request for the PMAs was $288.9 million, with individual requests for SEPA, SWPA, and WAPA. The budget also proposes reclassifying receipts to offset annual expenses for better operations and maintenance planning. The Obama Administration's FY2010 budget request for the Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) included reclassifying receipts to improve operations and maintenance planning. Additionally, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) provided $10 million in non-reimbursable appropriations to the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) for activities authorized in section 402 of the act. ARRA also granted WAPA borrowing authority up to $3.25 billion from the United States Treasury for building new or upgraded electric power transmission lines to deliver renewable energy resources. The FY2010 budget proposal for the Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) includes reclassifying receipts for operations and maintenance planning. The budget requests Bonneville to accrue $3.029 billion for operating expenses, $105 million for Projects Funded in Advance, $846 million for capital investments, and $420 million for capital transfers in FY2010. Additionally, the budget is based on the Administration's Infrastructure Program and ARRA's increased borrowing authority for BPA. The budget proposal for FY2010 includes $3.029 billion for operating expenses, $105 million for Projects Funded in Advance, $846 million for capital investments, and $420 million for capital transfers. BPA's budget is focused on power and transmission activities. Independent agencies funded by the Energy and Water Development bill include the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), and the Denali Commission. The NRC requested $1.071 billion for FY2010, with an increase of $25.6 million from FY2009. The House and Senate both endorsed the full NRC request. The conference agreement provides $1.067 billion for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), including $10.9 million for the inspector general. NRC's activities include safety regulation, licensing of commercial nuclear reactors, and oversight of nuclear materials users. The budget request included $248.3 million for new reactor activities to handle new nuclear power plant license applications due to increased interest in reactor construction. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has allocated funds for licensing new reactors and the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository. The Obama Administration plans to halt the Yucca Mountain project but has allowed the licensing process to continue. Senator Reid opposes the Yucca Mountain repository and announced plans to find alternative waste management strategies. The Obama Administration announced the termination of the Yucca Mountain licensing effort in the FY2011 budget request. NRC's FY2010 budget included $263.2 million for reactor oversight and incident response activities, such as safety inspections and security exercises. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires 90% of NRC's budget to be offset by fees on licensees, excluding certain expenditures like waste repository licensing and homeland security spending. The FY2010 budget request included offsets for general homeland security and DOE defense waste oversight, resulting in a net appropriation of $183.9 million, an increase of $9 million from FY2009. The House approved the requested amount, while the Senate-passed net appropriation was $159.7 million. The final conference agreement set the net appropriation at $154.7 million, including funding for the inspector general."
