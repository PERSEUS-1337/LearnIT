The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, Section 510, is amended to prohibit discrimination in canceling or reducing benefits under a group health plan based on specific diseases or medical conditions. This includes ensuring that participants undergoing treatment related to a disease or medical condition have valid claims submitted prior to any benefit changes. The term 'insurer' under a plan refers to a person licensed by a State to provide benefits under a contract or policy of insurance. A 'valid claim' under a group health plan is a claim that would have entitled the participant or beneficiary to benefits at the time of submission. SEC. 3.

The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 mandates a 60-day notice for significant changes in group health plans. Self-insured plans must clarify they are not insurance policies and specify the responsible party for claim processing. The plan is not covered by State guarantee funds, and participants may still be responsible for unpaid benefits. SEC. 5. LEGAL RELIEF FROM DAMAGES FOR INTERFERENCE WITH RIGHTS UNDER PLAN. Section 502(c) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended to include liability for damages for violations of certain sections related to group health plans. Damages for violations shall not include punitive damages, but in cases of willful, fraudulent, or malicious conduct, exemplary damages may be awarded up to 200 percent of actual damages or $10,000. In addition to actual damages, exemplary damages may be awarded for violations of group health plans. Attorney's fees and costs, including expert witness fees, shall be awarded to the prevailing plaintiff in actions for damages under subsection (c)(4). The amendments made by this Act shall apply to changes in group health plan coverage adopted on or after February 4, 1993."
