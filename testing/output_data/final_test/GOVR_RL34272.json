    "content": "There is a consensus in the scientific community that human activities, such as fossil fuel combustion and land clearing, are the primary drivers of climate change due to the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Various efforts are being made at different levels to address climate change, including research initiatives and GHG emission reduction regimes. The establishment of a federal program to manage GHG emissions would impact states differently, but predicting these impacts is complex. The report focuses on GHG emissions intensity, measured by dividing GHG emissions from state sources by the state's economic output. The primary focus is on CO2 emissions intensity and its determining factors, which vary significantly across states. Analyzing these factors among states can provide valuable insights for climate change policy discussions. The report analyzes factors influencing GHG emission levels in states, including population, per capita income, and GHG emissions intensity. These factors interact to shape a state's emissions, with an increase in one variable leading to higher emissions. The variables vary among states and play different roles in determining GHG emissions. Table 1 shows the relationship between states and their GHG emissions, with the top 10 states accounting for nearly half of total U.S. emissions in 2003. Annual changes in emission drivers like population, income, and intensity impact emission levels. To reduce emissions, the combined rates of these variables must be negative. Table 2 illustrates positive growth rates in population and income in the U.S. from 1990 to 2000, despite a decrease in GHG intensity. GHG emission levels increased by 1.4% annually, with varying growth rates among U.S. states. Some states saw significant declines in GHG intensity, but these were offset by increases in population and per capita income. GHG intensity is the most relevant driver for climate change policy, as decreases in population and income can lower emissions. However, policies limiting these drivers may conflict with social goals of population and income growth. The Bush Administration set a voluntary target in 2002 to reduce the ratio of U.S. GHG emissions to GDP by 18% by 2012, aiming to decrease GHG emissions intensity. Critics argue that this target may conflict with social goals of population and income growth. Intensity targets have been criticized for being imprecisely quantified and potentially misleading in their impact on actual emission levels. Meeting the U.S. emissions intensity target would result in reduced greenhouse gas emissions, but within the context of overall increasing emissions. There is uncertainty surrounding whether these reductions will be significant. The Administration's projected reductions are based on GDP forecasts, with uncertainty on whether they will be achieved. Meeting an aggressive intensity target can lead to actual emission reductions if it outpaces population and income growth. GHG emissions intensity reduction is crucial for the U.S. to lower emissions while maintaining growth rates. In the United States, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions historically account for 85% of the nation's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with CO2 intensity significantly impacting overall GHG intensity levels among states. GHG intensity varies widely among states, with CO2 emissions dominating in nearly all states. If states were ranked based on CO2 emissions intensity, the results would be similar due to the dominance of CO2 emissions. The report focuses on CO2 emissions intensity and its drivers in the US. Approximately 98% of CO2 emissions in 2003 were from energy use. Factors affecting CO2 emissions intensity include energy intensity and carbon content of energy use. Energy intensity is measured in tons of oil equivalent per gross state product. Table 4 shows states with highest and lowest energy intensity levels in 2003. The report compares energy intensity levels among states in 2003, with a focus on potential drivers such as economic structure, transportation use, public policy, state climate, and gross state product. A state's economic structure, particularly the ratio of high-energy industries, plays a significant role in determining its energy intensity. The comparison of energy intensity levels among states in 2003 reveals a correlation between a state's economic structure and energy intensity. The top states with high energy intensity also have a high percentage of GSP from high-energy sectors, while low energy intensity states rely more on low-energy sectors. The transportation sector contributes significantly to total energy consumption in the United States. The transportation sector, particularly personal transportation, accounts for a large portion of energy consumption in the United States. Vehicle miles traveled per person varies significantly among states, impacting energy intensity levels. States with lower per capita VMT tend to have lower energy intensity levels. Some states show exceptions to the correlation between energy intensity and VMT/person. Factors like public policy actions can help reduce energy intensity, with some states having more stringent efficiency standards than federal requirements. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) ranks states based on energy efficiency policies, showing a correlation between energy intensity levels and ACEEE scores. States with low energy intensity levels tend to have high ACEEE rankings, while states with high energy intensities receive low rankings. Public policy plays a significant role in reducing energy intensity, with natural factors like climate also influencing energy usage in buildings. In the United States, the concept of energy intensity in buildings is evaluated using \"degree days,\" which include heating degree days (HDDs) and cooling degree days (CDDs). HDDs outnumber CDDs by a factor of five to one, with colder states having the most degree days. However, there is no overall correlation between energy intensity and degree days for all 50 states. Climate may play a supplementary role in energy usage, alongside other influential factors. Climate may play a supplemental role in energy usage, especially in states with lower Gross State Products (GSPs). States with lower GSPs tend to have higher energy intensity, while states with larger GSPs may experience less pronounced effects from drastic changes in energy consumption. For example, Alaska, Wyoming, North Dakota, and West Virginia have high energy intensities but rank low in terms of GSP. Conversely, California and New York have low energy intensities and rank high in GSP. In states with lower Gross State Products (GSPs), climate may play a supplemental role in energy usage. Factors such as climate, GSP, and other underlying factors show a relationship with energy intensity. However, there are exceptions that highlight the diversity among states, making it difficult to draw conclusions that apply universally. Wyoming is an extreme example of this complexity, ranking third highest in energy intensity despite various factors at play. Wyoming ranks high in energy intensity due to factors like energy-intensive industries, VMT/person, degree days, GSP, and public policy scorecard. The carbon content of energy sources also influences CO2 emissions intensity. States using high-carbon energy sources have higher emissions per unit of energy. The electricity sector is crucial for a state's carbon emissions, accounting for 40% of U.S. CO2 emissions. Different energy sources have varying CO2 emissions per unit of energy, with coal emitting more than natural gas. Some sources like hydropower, nuclear, wind, and solar do not release CO2. The transportation sector is the second-highest emitter in the U.S., but uses a more uniform fuel mix. The report focuses on the electricity sector's carbon emissions, which account for 40% of U.S. CO2 emissions. States with high carbon content in their fuel mix used a large percentage of coal for electricity generation in 2003, while states with low levels utilized zero-emission sources like hydropower, nuclear power, wind, solar, and geothermal. The report discusses the carbon emissions in the electricity sector, with states using coal for generation having high carbon content. States with low levels utilized zero-emission sources like hydropower, nuclear power, wind, solar, and geothermal. The carbon content of energy use is influenced by whether a state is a net importer or exporter of electricity, with CO2 emissions attributed to the generating state but energy use to the consuming state. The table lists states with high percentages of energy use from electricity exports and imports, especially relevant for states with high carbon content levels. In 2003, top carbon content states like West Virginia, Wyoming, North Dakota, and Montana exported significant electricity. Conversely, states like Idaho, with low carbon content, imported 41% of its energy use. This import/export dynamic impacts the carbon content of energy use in different states. The electricity export/import dynamic between states with varying carbon content levels impacts how energy use is measured. There is no system to track electricity back to its source, making it difficult to attribute CO2 emissions accurately. States may export electricity from low-carbon sources like hydropower or nuclear, complicating the measurement of energy sources. The electricity export/import dynamic between states with varying carbon content levels impacts how energy use is measured. It is challenging to accurately attribute CO2 emissions due to the lack of a system to track electricity back to its source. States may import high-carbon energy despite using low-carbon sources, leading to a wide range of impacts if a federal GHG emissions reduction program is enacted. If Congress implements a mandatory GHG emissions reduction program, it would assign a cost to carbon emissions. The design of the program would determine costs and their distribution, with provisions like a safety-valve to control costs. States with high carbon content in energy use would likely experience higher energy prices under such a regime. Under a mandatory GHG emissions reduction program, states with high carbon content in energy use would likely face increased energy prices. Consumers' responses to these price hikes would influence the impact, potentially leading to energy conservation or a shift to alternative sources. The carbon price imposed by the regime would incentivize a switch from high-carbon to low-carbon fuels, but limitations in technology and infrastructure, especially in the electricity generation sector, may restrict this transition. Coal-fired power plants, which currently generate half of all electricity, may struggle to switch to alternative fuel sources. Under a mandatory GHG emissions reduction program, states with high carbon content in energy use would likely face increased energy prices. Differences in state regulations may influence who ultimately pays for additional carbon costs in electricity prices. Depending on the design of the emissions reduction program, producers or consumers may bear a higher proportion of the costs. This could be alleviated by providing emission allowances for free to producers or auctioning them to consumers. The auctioning of emission allowances could help offset higher electricity costs for consumers, especially low-income households. States with a high import/export ratio of electricity may see varying impacts on their carbon content and energy mix. Depending on how emission allowances are distributed, net energy providers could benefit financially in the short term. This could result in regulated entities, like coal-fired power plants, gaining financially through mitigation cost pass-through and free emission allowances. If Congress enacts an emissions reduction program, states with high energy intensity levels may face higher costs than states with low energy intensity levels. The impacts could vary dramatically between states at the ends of the spectrum. Energy intensity levels are influenced by various factors, some of which can be altered through public policy. For example, states could implement policies to address these factors. States with high energy intensity levels may face higher costs if Congress enacts an emissions reduction program. Public policy can alter factors like driving behavior and energy intensity. A newly-imposed carbon price may have a greater impact in states where energy demand is less elastic due to climate influence. Low-income citizens in states with substantial heating and cooling needs may bear a disproportionate burden of price increases. States with high energy intensity may have a high percentage of carbon-intensive industries. States with high energy intensity levels may have a high percentage of carbon-intensive industries. These industries could potentially pass on the additional carbon costs to consumers, depending on market competitiveness and consumer willingness to pay higher prices. Consumers may seek out substitutes or lower cost suppliers, including foreign producers not subject to domestic carbon pricing. States with high energy intensity levels, potentially due to a high percentage of carbon-intensive industries, may have more options for emission reduction through energy efficiency policies. States using high-carbon fuels for energy may have more flexibility in a carbon-constrained regime compared to states using low-carbon energy sources. States using high-carbon fuels may have more options for emission reduction through energy efficiency policies, while states using low-carbon fuels may be limited in finding substitutes. The availability of low-carbon fuel substitutes varies across states, with some having better natural resource endowments for alternatives like wind energy. The choice of baseline year for emission reduction programs is crucial, as it can impact the reward for past reductions. Several members in the 110th Congress have introduced proposals for a nation-wide GHG reduction program. To stabilize national GHG emission growth, the entire United States would need to achieve annual reductions in GHG intensity of approximately 3%. Only four states exceeded this rate of decline between 1990 and 2003. To meet legislative proposals in the 110th Congress, the United States would need to reduce GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, requiring a 5% annual decline in GHG intensity starting in 2010. The top 10 emitting states would need to more than double their current annual GHG intensity declines to reach this goal."
