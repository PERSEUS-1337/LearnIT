    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Minuteman Missile National Historic Site Establishment Act of 1998\". Congress finds that the Minuteman II intercontinental ballistic missile launch control facility and launch facility known as \"Delta 1\" and \"Delta 9\" are significant examples of American history during the Cold War. These facilities symbolize the dedication of Air Force missileers stationed in remote locations, offering a unique opportunity to illustrate the Cold War, arms race, and ICBM development. The National Park System lacks a unit specifically commemorating the Cold War. The Act aims to preserve and interpret structures related to the Minuteman II missile defense system, highlighting its historical significance in the context of the Cold War and America's commitment to world peace. It also aims to enhance the interpretive programs offered by the South Dakota Air and Space Museum. The Act establishes the Minuteman Missile National Historic Site to preserve structures related to the Minuteman II missile defense system. The Minuteman Missile National Historic Site is established in South Dakota as part of the National Park System, consisting of Minuteman II ICBM launch control facilities. The map of the historic site is available for public inspection. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to make minor boundary adjustments to the Minuteman Missile National Historic Site. The site will be administered in accordance with applicable laws, including those governing the National Park System. The Secretary will coordinate with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State to ensure compliance with treaties. Cooperative agreements may be entered into with public and private entities to further the purposes of the Act. The Secretary is authorized to acquire lands within the historic site by donation, purchase, exchange, or transfer. Lands owned by the State of South Dakota can only be acquired by donation or exchange. The Secretary cannot acquire contaminated lands unless remedial action has been taken. A general management plan must be developed within three years. The Secretary is required to prepare a general management plan for the historic site within three years. The plan will evaluate suitable locations for visitor and administrative facilities, with boundaries of the historic site adjusted accordingly. Coordination with Badlands National Park for administrative functions is also considered. Authorization of appropriations is granted for the implementation of this Act, with funds to be transferred from the Air Force for the maintenance of historic facilities. The Legacy Resource Management Program's existing funds for resource preservation and treaty compliance are unaffected by this Act. Attest: GARY SISCO, Secretary."
