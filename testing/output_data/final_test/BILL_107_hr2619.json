Congress finds that the Gabrieleno/Tongva Nation has had continuous dealings with the United States Government from 1771 to 1961. The Nation traditionally occupied the Los Angeles Basin and surrounding islands. Several Federal officials have recognized the Nation in the past. In 1852, Superintendent of Indian Affairs E.F. Beale noted a numerous Indian population in Los Angeles County. In 1855, Superintendent of Indian Affairs Henley suggested moving Indians to a reservation. Some lived at the Sebastian Reserve at Tejon Pass. In the 1870s, former Mission Indian Agent J.Q. Stanley highlighted Indian grievances at Mission San Gabriel. Scholars like Helen Hunt Jackson and C. Hart Merriam noted the Gabrieleno/Tongva Nation's presence in the San Gabriel area. In the early 20th century, the Federal Government allowed Nation members with one-half Indian blood to register at the Sherman Indian School in Riverside, California. The United States purchased land for the Nation in 1913 at San Gabriel. By 1928, many Nation members were still living in San Gabriel, identifying themselves as tribal members. The California Indians' Jurisdictional Act authorized the creation of a roll for payment purposes, including at least 150 Gabrieleno/Tongvas with Indian blood. The Nation's membership historically included a verifiable half-blood community eligible for organization under the Indian Reorganization Act. The Bureau of Indian Affairs ignored this community, leading the Nation to believe it couldn't organize as such. The Nation has been politically active at the national level. The Nation, politically active at the national level, lobbied for Indian causes from the 1920s to the 1950s. In 1949, they were plaintiffs in an Indian Claims Commission case along with 46 bands, including the Tongva. After 12 years of negotiations, all bands voted on a settlement, with Nation members being relatives of present-day tribal members. The State of California recognized the Gabrieleno/Tongva in 1994. The Gabrieleno/Tongva Nation in San Gabriel has maintained its distinct community, culture, and governance, recognized by the State of California in 1994. The Act defines key terms such as \"member\" as individuals enrolled in the Gabrieleno/Tongva Nation and \"Nation\" as the Gabrieleno/Tongva Nation. The Secretary refers to the Secretary of the Interior. Federal recognition is addressed in the Act. Federal recognition of the Gabrieleno/Tongva Nation is affirmed, granting eligibility for federal services and benefits to its members. Inconsistent laws and regulations are not applicable, while those not conflicting with the Act remain in force. Federal services and benefits will be provided to the Gabrieleno/Tongva Nation and its members without considering the existence of a reservation or member's residence location. The service area includes Los Angeles County, parts of Ventura and Orange Counties, and services can extend beyond these areas if not prohibited by law. SEC. 5 of the Act reaffirms and restores all rights and privileges of the Nation and its members that may have been abrogated or diminished before the enactment of the Act. It also clarifies that existing rights of the Nation and its members are not diminished by the Act, and legal claims to enforce wrongfully denied rights are preserved. SEC. 6 of the Act requires the Nation to submit a membership roll to the Secretary within 18 months, based on the Nation's governing document. The Secretary will publish notice of the roll in the Federal Register, and the Nation must maintain and update it. SEC. 7 states that the Nation's tribal lands include all real property held by or in trust for the Nation, with the Secretary acquiring property for the Nation in trust for its benefit. SEC. 8. CONSTITUTION AND GOVERNING BODY. The Secretary shall conduct elections for adopting a new constitution within 24 months of the Act's enactment. Until then, the current governing documents will serve as interim. After adopting the constitution, elections for officials must be held within 6 months. The Nation will hold elections by secret ballot to elect officials as per the governing constitution. Interim governing bodies will remain until new officials are elected. The Nation has jurisdiction over lands taken into trust for its benefit by the Secretary, exercising jurisdiction over members within the service area as per the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978."
