This Act is cited as the \"Rural Housing Tax Credit Act of 2005\" and adds a new section to the Internal Revenue Code for this purpose. The \"Rural Housing Tax Credit Act of 2005\" offers a tax credit to first-time homebuyers in rural areas for purchasing a principal residence. The credit is either 10% of the residence's purchase price or $5,000, whichever is less, with limitations based on adjusted gross income. The tax credit for first-time homebuyers in rural areas is limited based on adjusted gross income, with a maximum credit of $30,000 ($60,000 for joint returns). Modified adjusted gross income includes any excluded amounts from gross income. The credit cannot exceed the regular tax liability plus the tax imposed by section 55.

The terms 'purchase' and 'purchase price' are defined as per section 1400C(e). Any excess credit in a taxable year can be carried forward to the next year. Reporting requirements may be necessary for verifying taxpayer eligibility for the credit. Recapture of the credit may occur in certain sales situations.

Year 1 has a 100% recapture rate, decreasing to 0% after Year 5. The tax credit recapture percentage decreases over 5 years if the qualified residence is sold, with a 100% recapture rate in Year 1 decreasing to 0% after Year 5.
