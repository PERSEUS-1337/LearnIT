    "content": "The Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act is amended to include Title V, addressing unfair and deceptive practices related to billing for miscellaneous products or services. Section 501 specifically focuses on the billing of charges for such products or services. The Commission will prescribe rules to protect consumers from unfair billing practices for miscellaneous product or service charges, including prohibiting unauthorized charges and requiring an account authorization code for billing. The Commission will prescribe rules to protect consumers from unfair billing practices for miscellaneous product or service charges, including requiring detailed billing information and contact details for service providers. The rules will require telephone bills to include detailed information on miscellaneous charges, provide a toll-free number for billing disputes, ensure immediate credit for disputed charges, and allow subscribers to dispute charges within 90 days. The rules allow subscribers to instruct their common carrier not to bill for certain products or services, either orally or in writing. Subscribers can also specify particular providers or billing aggregators to exclude from billing. The rules allow subscribers to instruct their common carrier to resume billing miscellaneous charges either orally or in writing. The common carrier must use internal control procedures to verify the subscriber's request. The Commission will adopt rules for resolving billing disputes between subscribers and providers after disputed charges have been credited to the subscriber's account, including measures to prevent fraudulent disputes. The regulations allow subscribers to dispute billing charges with their common carrier. The carrier has the right to discontinue billing for any charges believed to be in violation of regulations or statutes. The regulations empower common carriers to cease billing for any disputed miscellaneous products or services from individual providers or aggregators. This action is not exempt from other laws prohibiting anticompetitive or discriminatory practices. The FCC must establish rules within 270 days of the Act's enactment, following standard procedures. The regulations require common carriers to stop billing for disputed miscellaneous products or services. Violations of these rules will be treated as violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act regarding unfair or deceptive acts. Communications common carriers will be under the jurisdiction of the Commission. The regulations will apply to charges first billed after their effective date. \"SEC. 502. RELATION TO STATE LAWS.\" The title does not override state laws on telephone or credit billing practices unless there is inconsistency, with the Commission authorized to determine such inconsistencies. State laws giving greater consumer protection cannot be deemed inconsistent. The Commission can exempt certain acts and practices from the title's requirements within a state if it deems it appropriate. The Commission can exempt certain acts and practices from the title's requirements within a state if it determines that state laws provide similar or greater consumer protection and have adequate enforcement provisions. The Commission enforces the requirements of the title and can use the powers under the Federal Trade Commission Act to ensure compliance. States can also take actions to enforce the provisions of the title. Whenever an attorney general of a State believes residents are affected by a violation of a Commission rule, the State can bring a civil action in federal court to stop the violation, enforce compliance, seek damages, or obtain other relief. The State must notify the Commission before taking action, unless prior notice is not feasible. The State must provide immediate notice when taking civil action, allowing the Commission to intervene, be heard on all matters, and file petitions for appeal. Civil actions can be brought in a district court where the defendant is found, transacts business, or where the violation occurred. The attorney general retains investigatory powers for bringing civil actions under this section. The attorney general of a State is allowed to conduct investigations, administer oaths, compel witnesses, and produce evidence. State court proceedings can still proceed based on alleged violations of civil or criminal antifraud statutes. During a civil action by the Commission, no State can initiate a separate civil action against a defendant named in the Commission's complaint for the same violation. Other State officials can take actions as well. Other State officials, authorized by the State, can bring actions in State court for consumer protection against individuals identified by the Commission for violating its rules. SEC. 505.
