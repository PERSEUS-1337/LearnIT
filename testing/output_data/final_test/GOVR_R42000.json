This proposal aims to better reflect how consumers adjust their buying habits in response to price changes. Supporters of using the Chained CPI-U argue that it more accurately reflects changes in buying habits in response to price changes. Opponents, however, believe that adjusting Social Security benefits with the Chained CPI-U would result in reduced benefits for the elderly, as their cost of living, particularly in healthcare, is higher than what is reflected in the overall CPI. Some policy makers support using the experimental Consumer Price Index for the Elderly (CPI-E) to calculate Social Security COLA. A potential change in COLA computation has raised questions about indexing provisions in federal entitlement programs. A report aims to identify key indexing provisions in major federal entitlement programs and present the information in a summary table. The report aims to identify key indexing provisions in major federal entitlement programs, including programs like Railroad Retirement, closely coordinated with Social Security. Table 1 provides an overview of federal mandatory spending programs with indexing provisions. It also describes measures of consumer price change used for inflation adjustments and the proposed Chained CPI-U measure. The report does not evaluate the best measure of consumer price change for specific programs or address all indexing provisions within the laws and regulations governing these programs. The report focuses on key indexing provisions in federal entitlement programs, including Social Security and Railroad Retirement. It discusses measures of consumer price change and the Chained CPI-U measure. The report does not address specific program adjustments or broader technical issues. The national CPI-W and CPI-U reflect changes in consumer prices by averaging retail prices of items in a market basket purchased in urban areas across the nation. The indexes are calculated using weights based on spending importance. These indexes are used to calculate constant-dollar estimates and have only slightly differed over time. The national CPI-W and CPI-U are used for inflation indexing by the federal government. The CPI-W determines the annual COLA of Social Security benefits, while the CPI-U is used for features of the Earned Income Tax Credit. Specific groups of items in the CPI-U are used to adjust various federal programs, such as per-meal subsidies for schools tied to the \"food away from home\" index. The Bureau of Labor Statistics developed the Chained CPI-U to better measure changes in the cost of living by adjusting spending patterns towards items with slower price increases. Despite being introduced in 2002, the C-CPI-U has not replaced the CPI-U or CPI-W in federal programs. Some policymakers have suggested using the C-CPI-U for inflation-indexed federal programs and income tax provisions. The proposal to switch from the CPI-W to the C-CPI-U for inflation adjustments in federal programs and income tax provisions has raised concerns about Social Security beneficiaries' ability to maintain their standard of living. Some suggest using the experimental CPI-E for those aged 62 and older, as it may better reflect the elderly population's inflation experience, particularly in healthcare costs. Inflation adjustments impact various federal entitlement programs, primarily affecting benefit levels. Inflation adjustments impact federal entitlement programs by increasing benefit levels, adjusting non-cash benefits like SNAP, and affecting Medicare coverage amounts and eligibility requirements. This includes changes in Social Security payroll taxes and Medicare premiums based on income levels. Indexing impacts various aspects of federal entitlement programs, such as Part B and Part D premiums, Medicare payments to providers, cost-sharing amounts for Medicaid beneficiaries, per-meal subsidies for schools, and eligibility criteria for programs like Medicaid and the child tax credit. Switching to the C-CPI-U for COLAs and indexing is seen as a cost-saving measure to reduce federal budget deficits, with potential savings of $31.0 billion over five years and $127.2 billion over 10 years. However, this switch could also increase program costs in some areas. Switching to the C-CPI-U for indexing could increase program costs in some cases. For example, under Medicare, indexing cost-sharing amounts to the Chained CPI-U would result in higher federal Medicare spending. Similarly, indexing the refundability threshold to a lower inflation index would expand the availability of the refundable child tax credit. The Chained CPI may have disadvantages for indexing federal programs, as it could lead to estimation errors and understate cost of living growth for certain groups, such as the elderly. The impact of rising healthcare prices on older people's cost of living is difficult to measure accurately due to challenges in determining actual prices paid and changes in healthcare quality.
