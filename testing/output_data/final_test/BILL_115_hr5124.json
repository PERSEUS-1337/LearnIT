    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Community Action Opioid Response Act of 2018\" and establishes the Community Action Opioid Response Grant Program. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a grant program through the Office of Community Services to help Community Action Agencies address the needs of communities and individuals affected by the opioid addiction epidemic. The goals include supporting efforts to identify and respond to opioid misuse and addiction among low-income individuals and families. Eligibility for the grant program is open to any Community Action Agency. The grant program established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services through the Office of Community Services allows Community Action Agencies to use funds for activities such as public education, outreach, direct services for opioid addiction, and stabilizing education and employment. Services provided under the grant program include stabilizing education, employment, housing, transportation, and other needs for individuals and families affected by opioid addiction. Additionally, support is offered to children impacted by addiction, including those in foster care or at risk of placement. Partnerships are developed with various entities to expand resources for those struggling with addiction. The grant program provides training for agency personnel on opioid addiction issues and overdose prevention. Grants are limited to $50,000-$1,000,000 per year for up to three years. Recipients must submit annual reports to the Secretary. The grant program requires recipients to submit annual reports detailing goals, interventions, outcomes, and expenditures to the Secretary. These reports are made public on the Community Action Agency's website and the Department of Health and Human Services' website. The Secretary compiles all reports for each year and submits them to Congress with an annual summary. Additionally, the Secretary must establish an expedited grant application, review, and award process within 60 days of the enactment of this section. The Secretary will publish the application process and criteria for grants in the Federal Register. Criteria will include objectives, activities, innovative approaches, evidence of success, and a plan for measuring progress. Targeted populations like incarcerated or homeless individuals must be served. The applicant must identify relevant community organizations for coordination, conduct an assessment of community needs related to opioid misuse among low-income individuals, and ensure grant funds do not supplant other resources. The grant funds awarded must not replace other community programs with similar objectives, and evidence-based approaches should be utilized. The Secretary will establish a Community Action Opioid Response Grant Application Review Panel within 90 days, consisting of experts in the opioid epidemic and drug treatment. The Secretary will establish a Community Action Opioid Response Grant Application Review Panel to review and evaluate grant applications, giving priority to those demonstrating coordination with agencies experienced in addressing opioid-related issues. The Community Action Opioid Response Grant Application Review Panel will prioritize grant applications that show evidence of leveraging non-Federal funds, quality methodology for monitoring outcomes, capacity-building in community responses to the opioid crisis, and efforts to minimize trauma. The Community Action Opioid Response Grant prioritizes efforts to minimize trauma and negative impact of foster care on children of addicted individuals, demonstrates knowledge of opioid-related needs, and uses innovative approaches to address unmet needs. Funding for the grant may come from the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Community Action Opioid Response Grant Application Review Panel will award grants within 120 days of funds availability. $50,000,000 is authorized annually for grants from 2018 to 2022, with a 7% set aside for grants to Indian tribes or tribal organizations. The Secretary of Health and Human Services defines terms related to grants for Community Action Agencies under the Community Services Block Grant Act."
