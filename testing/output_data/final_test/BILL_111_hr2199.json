    "content": "The Act titled \"Protecting Workers From Imminent Dangers Act of 2009\" aims to implement streamlined procedures to address imminent dangers in the workplace. The \"Protecting Workers From Imminent Dangers Act of 2009\" amends Section 13 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to address imminent dangers in the workplace by requiring immediate correction of hazardous conditions or removal of employees from danger. The \"Protecting Workers From Imminent Dangers Act of 2009\" amends the Occupational Safety and Health Act to address imminent dangers in the workplace. It allows the Secretary to take immediate action to correct hazardous conditions or remove employees from danger. If the employer refuses to comply, the Secretary can issue an order to withdraw all persons from the area until the danger is resolved. The \"Protecting Workers From Imminent Dangers Act of 2009\" empowers the Secretary to address imminent dangers in the workplace by issuing orders to withdraw individuals from hazardous areas until the danger is eliminated. Any findings and orders must be promptly communicated to the employer in writing, detailing the conditions causing the imminent danger. This does not prevent the issuance of citations or penalties under other sections of the Act. The \"Protecting Workers From Imminent Dangers Act of 2009\" allows the Secretary to issue orders to remove individuals from hazardous areas. These orders can be modified or terminated after consultation with the employer and affected employees. No person can be discriminated against for refusing to perform a duty identified as an imminent danger. The Act allows the Secretary to issue orders for hazardous work removal. Employers or affected employees can request modification or termination of the order within 30 days. The Commission will hold a hearing and issue an order based on findings of fact. Temporary relief from the order issuance is not granted. The Secretary may take action to expedite proceedings for relief, including injunctions, in cases of employer non-compliance with orders under the Act. Penalties for failure to remove employees from hazardous exposure are also outlined. Penalties for failure to address hazards under section 13(a) include a civil penalty of $10,000 to $50,000 per day of exposure, unless determined otherwise by the Commission or district court."
