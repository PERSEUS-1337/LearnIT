The \"American Hostages in Iran Compensation Fund\" is established in the Treasury to make payments to Americans held hostage in Iran between 1979 and 1981 and their families. A surcharge of 30 percent is imposed on fines or penalties assessed on individuals. The Act allows for penalties to be imposed on individuals for violations of specified laws or regulations, even if the conduct occurred before the enactment of the Act. It also includes settlements entered into after the enactment of the Act. The amount in settlements does not include judgments from actions brought under a specific section. The Act allows penalties for violations of specified laws or regulations related to Iran, administered by Treasury, Justice, or Commerce. Penalties can be imposed even for conduct before the Act's enactment, including settlements post-enactment. The surcharge imposed under subparagraph (A) will end when all amounts in subsection (c)(2) are distributed to recipients. Surcharges collected will be deposited into the Fund, regardless of payment to the relevant federal agency. The Secretary of State administers the law and accepts contributions for payments under the Act. Amounts in the Fund are available for payments without further appropriation. Payments from the Fund are administered by the Secretary of State. Payments from the Fund, administered by the Secretary of State, are made to former hostages and their families. Living former hostages receive $150,000 plus $10,000 for each day of captivity, while the estate of deceased former hostages also receives the same amount. Spouses or children of former hostages in the proposed class may receive $5,000 for each day of captivity. The Fund, administered by the Secretary of State, provides payments to former hostages and their families.

Spouses or children of former hostages in the proposed class may receive $5,000 for each day of captivity. Recipients must waive all claims against Iran and the United States to receive payment. The Secretary of State notifies qualified individuals about their payment status under the Fund for former hostages. If a claim is denied or approved for less than the full amount, individuals can submit additional information for review. The Secretary may affirm, modify, or revise the initial decision. The Secretary's actions in identifying claimants and disbursing funds from the Fund are final and not subject to review. Any remaining funds will be deposited into the Treasury after all payments have been made to recipients or after 5 years. The Secretary of State must report annually on the status of the Fund, including amounts deposited, rules for administration, and payment distribution. Payments will continue until all specified amounts are fully satisfied, even if laws referenced in the Act are reduced in scope. The President must propose a program to Congress if funds in the Fund cannot fully satisfy specified amounts within 2 years. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" is defined as specific Senate and House committees. The term \"person\" in the context of the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives includes any individual or entity under the jurisdiction of the United States."
