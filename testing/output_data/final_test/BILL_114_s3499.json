    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Daniel Webster Congressional Clerkship Act of 2016\". Congress acknowledges the importance of judicial clerkship programs for young lawyers, highlighting their role in shaping future leaders of the legal profession. Despite various analogous programs in other branches of government, Congress lacks a similar initiative. The Daniel Webster Congressional Clerkship Program is created by Congress to engage young lawyers in the legislative process, modeled after judicial clerkship programs. This initiative aims to improve Congress's operations and enhance public understanding of its work. The Daniel Webster Congressional Clerkship Program is established by Congress. The Daniel Webster Congressional Clerkship Program is established for appointing law school graduates as Congressional Clerks in the Senate or House of Representatives. Selection Committees from the Senate and House will choose at least 6 clerks each year for a 1-year clerkship. The Committee on House Administration selects at least 6 Congressional Clerks each year for a 1-year clerkship based on specific criteria including being a law school graduate with excellent academic and extracurricular records, a commitment to public service, and strong communication skills. After being selected by the Committee on House Administration, Congressional Clerks can interview for clerkships in various Senate offices, including committees, individual member offices, leadership offices, and the Office of the Parliamentarian. Congressional Clerks selected by the Committee on House Administration can interview for clerkships in various Senate offices, including committees, individual member offices, leadership offices, and the Office of the Parliamentarian.

The House of Representatives Administrative Reform Technical Corrections Act outlines limits on the number of employees in offices. The Senate suggests financial assistance for Congressional Clerks should be comparable to other clerkships in the judiciary and executive branches. The House of Representatives Administrative Reform Technical Corrections Act sets limits on office employees. Financial assistance for Congressional Clerks must be approved by the hiring office and based on their duties. Eligible clerks can accept fellowships from higher education institutions. The House of Representatives Administrative Reform Technical Corrections Act requires Congressional Clerks to adhere to all laws and regulations applicable to similar positions in the Senate or House of Representatives. Compensation for clerks can be provided by the congressional office during their clerkship term. The Selection Committees will develop rules for the Congressional Clerkship program."
