Lead poses significant environmental health risks, especially for children under age 7, leading to neurotoxic effects and learning disabilities. House dust is a key indicator of lead levels in infants' blood. Improving methods for testing and abating lead-based paint is a cost-effective way to prevent childhood lead poisoning. Federal efforts to disseminate information on effective techniques to reduce human exposure to lead should be enhanced. SEC. 2. DETECTION TECHNOLOGIES.\n\nThe EPA will develop methods for evaluating lead detection products and techniques, with results made public. NIST will establish standards for reliable lead detection technologies within 2 years.\n\nSEC. 3. LEAD EXPOSURE IN CHILDREN. The EPA, in consultation with other agencies, will conduct a long-term study on lead exposure in children under seven years old. The research aims to identify sources of lead exposure, establish exposure profiles, and breakdown by region and demographics. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, in consultation with the EPA and other agencies, will research effective lead abatement techniques to reduce human exposure. The emphasis is on developing new technologies and assessing cost effectiveness. Results will be made public. Additionally, there will be a focus on lead removal and containment products. SEC. 5. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology will conduct research on lead removal and containment products in consultation with relevant agencies. Within 24 months, performance criteria and standards for these products will be established. SEC. 6. Public education efforts will be implemented. SEC. 6. The EPA Administrator will lead public education efforts to raise awareness about lead exposure, focusing on children's specific exposure routes. SEC. 7. USE OF CLEARINGHOUSE AND TELEPHONE HOTLINE. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will ensure public information is available through established channels. SEC. 8. STATE PROGRAMS. The Governor of a State can request a grant from the EPA to gather data on lead exposure, collaborate with other States to create a national database, and conduct public outreach programs. The Administrator will consider the State's experience in addressing lead exposure, the severity of the issue, and the State's standards for reducing human exposure when selecting States for grants. The EPA focuses on providing sufficient funding to selected States for comprehensive lead exposure data collection and public outreach programs. The Federal share of grants should not exceed 75 percent of the State's costs, with the condition that the non-Federal share is from non-Federal funds. Granted funds remain available for the fiscal year and the following year. The EPA provides grants to States for lead exposure data collection and outreach programs. Grants are limited to 75% of State costs, with non-Federal funds required for the remaining share. States must show satisfactory implementation of grant activities to receive funding in subsequent years. States must provide required information in grant applications. The Administrator coordinates with the National Institute of Standards and Technology. SEC. 9. REPORTS.\n\nWithin 24 months of this Act's enactment, the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must jointly submit an initial report to Congress detailing their activities, study results, and any recommendations for action. Updates to this report will be submitted as deemed necessary by the Director and Administrator."
