The United States is still in a global war on terror and engaged in armed conflict with terrorist organizations, capturing terrorists who need to be detained in a secure facility. Enemy combatants have been detained at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility since 2002, with almost 800 al-Qaeda and Taliban combatants held there. Over 600 detainees have been tried, transferred, or released to other countries, and the last enemy combatant was brought to the facility in June 2008. The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility, established in 2002, houses enemy combatants in a secure location away from population centers. It meets international standards, provides humane treatment, and exceeds oversight of maximum-security prisons. The Expeditionary Legal Complex (ELC) at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is a unique and secure location for trying detainees charged by the United States Government. It offers full access to sensitive information, defense lawyers, prosecution, and the press. Guantanamo Bay is the largest repository of human intelligence in the war on terror. The intelligence gathered from detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility has been crucial in preventing terrorist attacks and saving lives. It includes information on the organizational structure of terrorist groups, the presence of terrorists globally, pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, recruitment methods, and terrorists' skills. Key intelligence used to locate Osama bin Laden was obtained through enhanced interrogation of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, with the CIA Director confirming the use of these techniques. SEC. 3. Requirement for detention at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, of high-value detainees who will be detained long-term.

The detainee must be held at Guantanamo Bay if they are involved in planning terrorist actions against the US or its allies, or if they pose a continuing threat upon release."
