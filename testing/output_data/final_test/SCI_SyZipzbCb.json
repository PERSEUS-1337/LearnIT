It includes enhancements like N-step returns and prioritized experience replay. Experimental results demonstrate the algorithm's state-of-the-art performance in various control tasks, manipulation tasks, and obstacle-based locomotion tasks with high-dimensional input and action spaces. The use of reinforcement learning in developing artificial intelligence has seen significant advancements, particularly in solving tasks with continuous action spaces. While algorithms like DQN have shown success in discrete action problems, they struggle with continuous control tasks due to the need for costly optimization or discretization of action spaces, which may not be effective in high-dimensional settings. In high-dimensional settings or tasks requiring finer control, a more principled approach is needed than a poor approximation. The Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm is considered for enhancements, as it is an off-policy actor-critic method. Improvements to the critic learning procedure directly enhance the quality of actor updates. Utilizing a distributional version of the critic update provides a more stable learning signal by modeling randomness from intrinsic factors. The text discusses modeling randomness in a continuous environment to improve gradients and enhance learning algorithm performance. The use of a distributional update in DDPG allows for better gradients. Running multiple actors in parallel to gather experience and feed into a single replay table is also highlighted. The work is based on the Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm, which replaces stochastic policy with one that includes no randomness. The Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm replaces stochastic policy with a deterministic one, which is important as it was previously believed to not exist in a model-free setting. The gradient form does not require integration over the action space, potentially needing fewer samples to learn. BID9 extended this algorithm using a deep neural network for vision-based inputs. The off-policy actor-critic architecture allows for actor gradients to depend only on derivatives through the learned critic, improving estimation of the critic directly improves actor gradients. Recent attempts have been made to distribute updates for the DDPG algorithm. In recent work, there have been attempts to distribute updates for the DDPG algorithm, building on previous research for implementing distributed actors. Bellemare et al. demonstrated that estimating a distribution over returns alone can achieve state-of-the-art results on Atari 2600 benchmarks by improving updates for the critic in a standard reinforcement learning setting. The agent's behavior is controlled by a policy \u03c0 : X \u00d1 A which maps observations to actions. The state-action value function, defined as DISPLAYFORM0, evaluates policy quality. Instead of updating policy directly from Q \u03c0, a parameterized policy \u03c0 \u03b8 is considered to maximize expected value by optimizing Jp\u03b8q \" ErQ \u03c0 \u03b8 px, \u03c0 \u03b8 pxqqs. The deterministic policy gradient theorem is used to write the gradient of this. By utilizing the deterministic policy gradient theorem, the gradient of the objective can be written as DISPLAYFORM1 using the state-visitation distribution \u03c1. This allows for empirical evaluation of the gradient using off-policy data. The gradient can be approximated with a parameterized critic Q w px, aq instead of the true value function of the current policy. Introducing the Bellman operator pT \u03c0 Qqpx, aq \" rpx, aq`\u03b3E \" DISPLAYFORM2 helps minimize the temporal difference error by evaluating the TD error under separate target policy and value networks. The Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm involves training a neural network policy using deterministic policy gradient and minimizing the TD error with a deep neural network. Enhancements include distributional critic update, distributed parallel actors, N-step returns, and prioritization of experience replay. The algorithm also employs sample-based approximation of gradients using data from a replay table. The Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm includes enhancements like distributional critic update, distributed parallel actors, N-step returns, and prioritization of experience replay. The distributional update introduces a distributional Bellman operator that acts on functions mapping state-action pairs to distributions within the actor-critic architecture. The distributional policy gradient algorithm parameterizes the distribution and defines a loss for measuring the distance between distributions. Key components impacting performance include parameterization for Z w and the metric d for measuring distributional TD error. The algorithm incorporates the action-value distribution in the actor update and includes details on batch size, trajectory length, number of actors, replay size, and exploration constant. The algorithm initializes network weights and target weights, launches actors with replicated network weights, samples transitions from replay, computes actor and critic updates, updates network parameters, replicates network weights to actors, and returns policy parameters. The update can be empirically evaluated by replacing the outer expectation with a sample-based approximation. The DDPG algorithm can be modified to use N-step returns for estimating the TD error, replacing the Bellman operator with an N-step variant. This modification can also be applied to the distributional Bellman operator for updating the distributional critic. Additionally, the standard training procedure can be adjusted to distribute the process of gathering experience using K independent actors. The DDPG algorithm can be modified to use N-step returns for estimating the TD error and updating the distributional critic. Experience gathering can be distributed using K independent actors, with data stored in a replay table. The ApeX framework is used for implementing this procedure, with actor and critic parameters updated using stochastic gradient descent. Importance sampling is used with non-uniform priorities for sampling data. The DDPG algorithm can be modified to use N-step returns for estimating the TD error and updating the distributional critic. Experience gathering can be distributed using K independent actors, with data stored in a replay table. The ApeX framework is used for implementing this procedure, with actor and critic parameters updated using stochastic gradient descent. Importance sampling is used with non-uniform priorities for sampling data. Additionally, pseudocode for actor processes filling the replay table in parallel is shown, along with the architecture used for control and manipulation domains. The performance of the D4PG algorithm across various continuous control tasks is described, focusing on wall clock time and data efficiency, as well as ablations conducted for scientific purposes. In scientific experiments, ablations were performed on the D4PG algorithm to assess the impact of different components. Variants such as Distributed DDPG (D3PG) were considered, along with prioritized and non-prioritized versions. Transitions were sampled uniformly for non-prioritized variants, while prioritized variants used absolute TD-error for sampling from replay. In experiments with the D4PG algorithm, different components were tested. Variants like Distributed DDPG (D3PG) were explored, with prioritized sampling using absolute TD-error. Trajectory length and noise levels were adjusted, with learning rates initialized equally for actor and critic updates. The value for \u03b1 and \u03b2 was set to 1\u02c610\u00b44 for simple control problems and 5\u02c610\u00b45 for harder ones. For the control suite, \u03b1 was reduced to 5\u02c610\u00b45 and batch size M increased to 512. Performance was evaluated on physical control tasks with dense or sparse rewards. Inputs to the agent were low-dimensional observations ranging from 6 to 60 dimensions. The acrobot task, despite being low-dimensional, was challenging due to its controllability. The suite of control tasks includes high-dimensional tasks that are more difficult to learn. Actor and critic architectures are used with 32 actors in each experiment. Performance of D4PG and its variations are shown across the control tasks. Comparisons are made with the non-distributed DDPG algorithm as a baseline. The D4PG algorithm performs worse on tasks compared to other methods, especially on more difficult tasks. The best performance is seen with the full D4PG algorithm. Longer unroll lengths are generally better, while shorter lengths can lead to instability in some cases. The distributional critic update is beneficial, particularly on the hardest tasks like Humanoid (Run) and Acrobot. The D4PG algorithm struggles on difficult tasks, with prioritization not significantly improving its performance. In contrast, D3PG benefits from prioritization on many tasks. The D4PG agent shows promise in learning dexterous manipulation tasks with a simulated hand model in MuJoCo. The D4PG algorithm is tested on tasks involving a simulated hand model with 13 actuators controlling 22 degrees of freedom. Tasks include catching a falling cylinder, picking up and maneuvering objects, and rotating a cylinder to match a target orientation. The algorithm is compared against ablations of its components, with 64 actors used in the experiments. The D4PG algorithm outperforms ablations of its components, with N \" 5 consistently showing better results. Prioritization does not harm D4PG but adds limited value. In contrast, prioritization can sometimes harm the performance of the D3PG variant, especially in the N \" 1 case where it can lead to instability or failure to learn. In a parkour domain, the agent controls a robotic walker rewarded for forward movement. The agent controls a robotic walker in a parkour domain, rewarded for forward movement and impeded by obstacles. The walker can move horizontally and vertically, facing gaps, barriers, and platforms. It receives proprioceptive and terrain observations to navigate the environment. The network architecture in the robotic walker domain includes a depth map of terrain and uses feed-forward layers to process terrain information. The actions involve torque controls. The D4PG algorithm's performance is evaluated with ablations and a PPO baseline. Results show better performance with a higher unroll length. The performance of the D4PG algorithm is evaluated with ablations and a PPO baseline, showing better performance with a higher unroll length. The biggest gain comes from the distributional update, with marginal benefit to using prioritization for D3PG. Comparisons to the PPO baseline show favorable results for D3PG with N \" 1, but D4PG outperforms when N \" 5. Sample complexity is also considered in the evaluation. In comparing the performance of different algorithms, PPO outperforms the non-prioritized version of D3PG and shows significant gains with distributional updates. Prioritization does not offer much advantage over the non-prioritized D4PG. Initially, non-prioritized D4PG performs better, but performance levels out later on. In a humanoid walker experiment, obstacles include gaps, barriers, and walls with gaps. The network architecture is the same as in a previous experiment, with observations of size x proprio P R 79 and x terrain P R 461. Actions are torque controls in 21 dimensions, and the number of atoms for the categorical distribution is increased from 51 to 101 for higher resolution. This presents a much higher dimensional problem. The humanoid walker experiment involves a higher dimensional problem with more difficult control tasks. Results show clear performance differences between PPO, D3PG, and D4PG, with prioritization showing little benefit in the D4PG results. In this work, the D4PG algorithm was introduced, incorporating distributional updates and multiple distributed workers writing into the same replay table. Simple modifications, such as using N-step returns, significantly improved the algorithm's performance. Priority was found to be less crucial, especially on harder problems, as it could lead to unstable updates, particularly in manipulation tasks. The D4PG algorithm showed state-of-the-art performance on difficult continuous control tasks, especially in manipulation tasks. Two potential parameterized distributions were considered, including the categorical parameterization with hyperparameters for the number of atoms and support bounds. The distributional layer in the D4PG algorithm corresponds to a linear layer from the critic torso to the logits, followed by a softmax activation. However, this distribution is not closed under the Bellman operator due to the support defined by the (V min, V max) hyperparameters. Instead, a projected version of the distributional Bellman operator is used. The loss is written in terms of cross-entropy and a mixture of Gaussians is also considered. The loss in the D4PG algorithm is written in terms of cross-entropy and a mixture of Gaussians is considered for parameterizing the action-value distribution. The distribution layer maps from the critic torso to the mixture weight, mean, and variance for each component. A categorical projection operator is used to handle the finite support of the parameterized distribution. Results of running D4PG on control suite tasks using a mixture of Gaussians output distribution showed underperformance compared to the Categorical distribution. This highlights the importance of the distribution choice in the algorithm. The control suite tasks involved using a simulated model of the Johns Hopkins Modular Prosthetic Limb hand with 22 degrees of freedom for dexterous manipulation. The hand was positioned above a table to pick up objects, rotate, and manipulate them. The tasks involved manipulating a cylindrical object on a table using a hand with 22 degrees of freedom. The observations included joint positions, velocities, position targets, object position and velocity, and rotational angles. Tasks included 'catch', 'pick-up-and-orient', and 'rotate-in-hand'. In the 'catch' task, the agent learns to catch a falling object before it hits the table. The reward function is based on the height difference between the object and the palm. The episode ends if the object touches the table. In the 'pick-up-and-orient' task, the agent picks up a cylindrical object from the table and moves it to a target position. In the 'pick-up-and-orient' task, the agent must maneuver a cylindrical object from the table to a randomized target position and orientation. The reward function includes distance and orientation components, with fixed episode duration of 500 steps. In the 'rotate-in-hand' task, the agent rotates a cylinder in its palm to match a moving target. The task involves manipulating a cylindrical object to match a moving target angle by dynamically forming and breaking contacts. The reward function includes components for axial rotation matching and penalizing orientation deviation. The episode duration is 1000 steps, with early termination upon object-table contact."
