    "content": "The Act titled \"Affordable Housing Preservation and Revitalization Act of 2009\" establishes the Affordable Housing Preservation and Revitalization Program. The United States Housing Act of 1937 is amended to include the Affordable Housing Preservation and Revitalization Program, which aims to transfer funds from multifamily housing properties to preservation entities during qualified sales or exchanges. This facilitates the maintenance of affordability and preservation of housing projects with expiring assistance contracts. The Affordable Housing Preservation and Revitalization Program allows preservation entities to use funds from acquired multifamily housing properties for rehabilitation costs, depositing into replacement reserves, and providing services for tenants. The Affordable Housing Preservation and Revitalization Program allows funds from acquired properties to be used for property acquisition costs, not exceeding 50% of the residual receipts account, and for approved costs benefiting tenants. Definitions include affordability and use restrictions and extended use period. The extended use period for eligible multifamily housing properties lasts 30 years after sale to a preservation entity or until the remaining useful life of the property, taking into account any rehabilitation. This period ends if Section 8 assistance cannot be provided by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Development is unable to provide Section 8 assistance on terms as advantageous to the preservation entity as at the time of acquisition of eligible multifamily housing property receiving project-based housing assistance payments under part 883 of title 24, Code of Federal Regulations after February 29, 1980. The term 'housing agency' refers to the entity administering housing for such properties. The term 'preservation entity' refers to a nonprofit corporation or limited partnership managing eligible multifamily housing properties receiving housing assistance. The term 'preservation entity' refers to a nonprofit corporation under State law exempt from Federal income taxation and approved by a housing agency to acquire and preserve eligible multifamily housing properties. A 'qualified sale' involves selling an eligible multifamily housing property to a preservation entity that agrees to maintain affordability and use restrictions. The term 'residual receipts' refers to funds generated by a property in compliance with legally enforceable restrictions for a term of not less than the extended use period. These restrictions are binding on all successors and assigns of the preservation entity and recorded as a restrictive covenant on the property pursuant to State law. Residual receipts are funds generated by a property in excess of operating expenses and reserve requirements, designated by the Secretary. These funds are not considered federal funds for tax purposes."
