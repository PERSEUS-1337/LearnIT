    "content": "House and Senate rules of procedure are influenced by the number of members in each chamber. The House has a structured legislative process due to its 435 Representatives, while the Senate has a more flexible approach with its smaller membership. This report compares selected House and Senate rules for legislative processes, such as referral to committees and floor consideration. The presiding officer plays a key role in both chambers. In both the House and Senate, the presiding officer refers legislation to standing committees based on subject matter jurisdiction. The House changed its referral rule to reduce multiple referrals, eliminating joint referrals. The Speaker designates a primary committee for multiple referrals based on committee jurisdictions. Two types of multiple referrals can occur: sequential referral and split referral. In exceptional circumstances, the Speaker may not designate a primary committee. House committees often create memorandums of understanding to divide jurisdiction. The Speaker receives memorandums from committees regarding jurisdiction over policy issues, which are sometimes printed in the Congressional Record. The Senate's referral rule states that legislation is referred to the committee with predominant jurisdiction. Senate rules specify committee responsibilities and the process for referring measures. Under Senate rules, bills and joint resolutions are read twice and referred to committee upon introduction. Multiple referrals, including joint, sequential, and split, are allowed in the Senate. Measures can be referred to multiple committees by unanimous consent. The Senate Majority and Minority Leaders can make a joint motion to refer legislation to multiple committees, although this rule has never been used since 1977. Multiple referrals are more common in the House than in the Senate. Measures reported from House committees are referred to either the Union or House. The House maintains different calendars for various types of measures, including the Union Calendar for tax, authorization, and appropriations bills, the House Calendar for other public bills and resolutions, the Private Calendar for private measures, and the Calendar of Motions to Discharge Committees. In contrast, the Senate has the Calendar of Business and the Executive Calendar for nominations and treaties. The House maintains different calendars for various types of measures, including the Union Calendar for tax, authorization, and appropriations bills, the House Calendar for other public bills and resolutions, the Private Calendar for private measures, and the Calendar of Motions to Discharge Committees. Nominations and treaties are referred to the Executive Calendar. Legislation reported from committee are placed on the Calendar of Business. Rule XIV provides a procedure for placing measures on the Calendar of Business without reference to committee. The Speaker has the fundamental prerogative of scheduling legislation for House floor action. Individual Representatives cannot easily influence leadership decisions on which measures should come to the floor. The House has different calendars for various types of measures. The most significant and controversial measures are considered under a \"special rule\" passed by a majority vote. Less controversial measures are raised under the \"suspension of the rules\" procedure. The Speaker can recognize a Member to move to suspend the rules and pass a measure, which requires approval by two-thirds of those present and voting. The House may also agree to take up a measure by unanimous consent. House rules designate specific days for bills from the Private Calendar to be brought up for floor consideration. Legislation involving the District of Columbia can be raised on the second and fourth Mondays of each month, known as \"District Days.\" Calendar Wednesday reserves Wednesdays for committee bills that have not been granted special rules. Privileged measures from certain committees can be called up at any time under House Rule XIII, clause 5(a). The Senate Majority Leader has the authority to raise measures for Senate floor consideration, either by unanimous consent or a debatable motion. Consultation with the Minority Leader, committee chairmen, and individual Senators is necessary before scheduling measures for floor action. \"Holds\" can be placed on measures by Senators, an informal custom in the Senate. In the Senate, \"holds\" are an informal custom where Senators can place a hold on measures. Special rules govern House floor consideration, with the House Rules Committee reporting a special rule in the form of a simple resolution. These rules determine debate time, amendment procedures, and privilege for floor consideration. Special rules under Rule XIII, clause 6 allow bills to be called up, debated, and voted upon at any time in the House. The Rules Committee can report a special rule to discharge a bill from committee. In the Senate, unanimous consent agreements govern floor consideration of major measures. In the Senate, unanimous consent agreements govern floor consideration of major measures, limiting debate time, structuring the amendment process, and waiving points of order. These agreements are negotiated by the Majority Leader in consultation with the Minority Leader, committee chairmen, and interested Senators, and must be accepted by all Senators on the floor to take effect. Complex agreements are printed in the Senate's daily \"Calendar of Business\" and the Congressional Record. In the House, members can use discharge petitions to bring measures to the floor that have not been reported by a committee. If 218 members sign a discharge petition, the motion is placed on the Discharge Calendar and can be called up on specific Mondays. However, most discharge motions do not get enough signatures to proceed. In the House, discharge petitions can bring unreported measures to the floor if 218 members sign. This can prompt committee action or use suspension motions for noncontroversial measures. Senators have more flexibility to bypass committees with non-germane amendments or Rule XIV. In the Senate, the Senator can reintroduce a bill, demand two readings, and object to the second reading to bypass committees and place the measure directly on the Calendar of Business. The Speaker of the House, as the leader of the majority party and presiding officer, has discretionary power to govern House floor proceedings and recognize Members to speak. The Speaker of the House has discretionary power to govern House floor proceedings and recognize Members to speak. The Speaker presides over House floor proceedings and appoints a majority party Representative to preside over the Committee of the Whole. The Vice President of the United States is the Senate's official presiding officer, with the President pro tempore presiding in the Vice President's absence. The Vice President typically presides to break tie votes, while the President pro tempore is elected by a majority vote of the Senate. The President pro tempore appoints a Senator as \"Acting President pro tempore\" to preside over the Senate in the absence of the Vice President. Junior Senators from the majority party take turns presiding for about an hour each. The presiding officer's powers are limited compared to the Speaker of the House, as they can only speak with permission and vote to break ties. The Senate's presiding officer gives preferential recognition to Majority and Minority Leaders, and floor managers. A non-partisan Senate Parliamentarian advises on rulings. House rulings by the presiding officer are rarely appealed, with majority vote deciding if appealed. House votes on chair's ruling typically follow party lines. In contrast to the Senate, the House's presiding officer usually rules on points of order, with few exceptions. The Senate often appeals the presiding officer's rulings, with the full Senate voting on whether to sustain or overrule. The Senate can also vote on questions of order, especially those involving constitutional issues or amendments to appropriations bills. Senate votes on rulings and points of order can be influenced by political considerations rather than established practices, resulting in a smaller body of precedents compared to the House. The House operates under time restrictions for debates, such as the \"one-hour\" rule and the \"five-minute\" rule during the amendment process. Special rules and statutes also limit debate time, making it challenging for individual Representatives to speak for more than two to five minutes. In the Senate, Senators have the right to unlimited debate and can use parliamentary maneuvers like filibusters to delay floor action and extract concessions from the leadership. This contrasts with the House, where time restrictions limit debate time for individual Representatives. The Senate often agrees to debate restrictions through unanimous consent agreements to ensure timely action on legislation. In the House, debate on certain measures can be limited by rule-making provisions, with the option to end debate through motions like the previous question. In the Committee of the Whole, Representatives can propose motions to close or limit debate on pending questions. The motion to limit debate on a pending question can be adopted by a majority vote, closing or restricting debate without preventing additional motions or amendments. Time limitations set by special rules or unanimous consent can also end debate. In the Senate, debate typically ends when a Senator yields the floor or when a time limit expires. Adoption of a motion to table by majority vote can also end debate. The Senate can end debate on a pending question by adopting a motion to table with a majority vote, effectively rejecting the question. The motion can only be resumed with unanimous consent. A cloture motion signed by 16 Senators can also be filed to end extended debate, limiting debate to 30 more hours after adoption. The House typically meets in the Committee of the Whole to consider legislation that will be amended. Legislation is amended in an orderly fashion, with members offering amendments to the part of the bill that has been read or designated for amendments. Amendments must always be germane, unless a special rule permits non-germane amendments. Voting on amendments follows specific principles. The Committee of the Whole in the House approves amendments to legislation, which are then reported back to the full House for approval. The Senate amends legislation in a less structured manner, allowing for amendments to be proposed in any order. Floor consideration in the Senate is less predictable, with Senators deciding on debate and amendments. In the Senate, a unanimous consent agreement sets limits on amendments and debate. Four amendment trees outline the order for offering and voting on amendments. Amendments do not need to be germane, except in specific cases. A quorum is required for both the House and Senate to conduct business. A quorum is necessary for the House (218) and the Senate (51) to conduct business. House quorum calls last 15-17 minutes, while Senate quorum calls can be made almost anytime. Senators can suggest the absence of a quorum for constructive delay without requiring a recess or adjournment. The Senate can pause floor action for informal negotiations without recessing by using a quorum call. Quorum calls have no time limit and can be dispensed with by unanimous consent. Both the House and Senate have voice, division, and record votes, with record votes including individual member names. Most questions are first put to a voice vote, where members respond \"Aye\" or \"No.\" In the House, members respond \"Aye\" or \"No\" for votes, with the chair announcing the result. Division votes involve standing up to be counted. Senators may raise hands for division votes. House members can demand a \"yea and nay vote\" or a \"recorded vote\" after a voice or division vote. In the House, members can demand a \"yea and nay vote\" or a \"recorded vote\" if supported by one-fifth of those present. Votes are normally done electronically, displayed on a board in the chamber. A 15-minute voting period is required for record votes. The House requires a 15-minute voting period for record votes, which can be demanded by one-fifth of members present. In the Senate, a rollcall vote is conducted without an electronic system, with Senators voting at the well and the Clerk announcing the results. A minimum of 11 Senators is needed to demand a rollcall vote. In the Senate, a rollcall vote must be supported by a minimum of 11 senators, which is one-fifth of the quorum for doing business. Senators can request a rollcall vote at any time, even before debate on an amendment begins. The yeas and nays are ordered after a sufficient second supports the request, but most rollcall votes do not immediately take place. In the Senate, rollcall votes do not happen immediately upon being ordered. The House adjourns at the end of the day's proceedings, with calendar days and legislative days usually aligning. A motion to adjourn in the Senate ends the day's proceedings and starts a new legislative day, while a motion to recess keeps the Senate in the same legislative day. This allows the Senate to continue a legislative day for many calendar days, providing procedural advantages for the Majority Leader. The Majority Leader in the Senate may create a new legislative day by adjourning, which can provide procedural advantages. This allows for non-debatable motions at the beginning of a new legislative day, such as the motion to proceed to consider a measure, creating an opportunity for a filibuster."
