It highlights the responsibility of landowners to protect topsoil from destruction or burial to ensure its accessibility for future use. Minimum standards are necessary to manage the nation's land resources effectively. The National Topsoil Preservation Act of 1993 emphasizes the need for minimum standards to protect land resources, including environmental, social, and economic factors. Failure to establish these standards can lead to destructive practices and impact interstate commerce. Projects on federal land must adhere to these standards to prevent the loss of topsoil. The National Land Resources Protection Commission, established under the National Topsoil Preservation Act of 1993, is composed of the Secretary of the Interior and four other members appointed by the President. The Commission is responsible for overseeing projects on federal land that involve moving or covering topsoil. The National Land Resources Protection Commission, established under the National Topsoil Preservation Act of 1993, is composed of the Secretary of the Interior and four other members appointed by the President. Vacancies on the Commission are filled in the same manner as original appointments, with members receiving compensation at $67,500 per annum. The Commission is authorized to select, appoint, employ, and fix the compensation of necessary officers and employees. It shall hold meetings, conduct hearings, and establish rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of the Act. The National Land Resources Protection Commission may delegate responsibilities within a State to ensure Federal minimum standards are met. The Commission has oversight authority and can cancel delegations at any time. It can administer oaths, take evidence, and subpoena witnesses. The Commission establishes minimum standards. The Commission sets minimum standards for projects, requiring a minimum of twelve inches of topsoil to be stockpiled and used on exposed areas. Excess topsoil not used must be stored in a place to improve plant production. The Commission requires stockpiling of nontoxic subsoil for plantlife on completed projects to maintain vegetation and protect productive capacity. The Commission establishes rules to protect topsoil fertility and prevent pollution in construction projects. Minimum standards are set to avoid environmental damage like pollution, landslides, and flooding. The Commission requires approval before moving soil on projects exceeding 100,000 square feet. Approval can be granted by the Commission or delegated authority. Prior approval may also be required for earth-moving activities on projects to ensure compliance with the Act's purposes. Prior to moving earth, a plan by a professional engineer or surveyor must be submitted, showing boundaries, elevations, drainage plans, topography, water flow, and soil removal and replacement in separate layers. The Commission requires detailed plans for projects to ensure compliance with standards. They may also request bonds or deposits to guarantee adherence to these standards. Additionally, the Commission must report its activities to Congress annually and provide requested reports. Authorization for appropriations is limited. Sec. 10 authorizes up to $6,000,000 annually for administering the Act starting from September 30, 1993. Sec. 11 of the budget act requires compliance with appropriations Acts for entering into contracts or making payments. Any provision authorizing new budget authority is effective only for fiscal years after September 30, 1993."
