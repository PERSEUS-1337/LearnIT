    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature amended Section 84601 of the Government Code to enhance public access to campaign and lobbying disclosure information. The amendment emphasizes the importance of a new, user-friendly online filing system that provides easily understandable campaign finance and lobbying information. This system aims to allow the public, including voters, journalists, and researchers, to access information in a robust and flexible manner, including through searches and visual displays like graphs and maps. Section 84602 of the Government Code is amended to develop online and electronic filing processes for campaign and lobbying disclosure requirements. The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Commission, will implement these processes to enable users to comply with all disclosure requirements. A means or method for filers to submit required filings free of charge, without additional functions, must be available by December 31, 2002. The Secretary of State will develop a nonproprietary standardized record format for data transmission, with public input through hearings. The format will be made public by July 1, 1999, to ensure compliance with the law. The Secretary of State will accept test files from software vendors to ensure compliance with standardized record formats. A list of approved providers will be published. A system will be developed for secure online data transfer. Develop a procedure for filers to sign under penalty of perjury, make all data available online in an easily understood format for public access, maintain filed data online for 10 years, and provide assistance to those seeking information access. (7) Provide assistance for public access to information and (8) implement technology to prevent unauthorized data manipulation. (9) Provide necessary information to assist with compliance and administration of this title. The report to the Legislature will cover the implementation and development of online filing requirements, system security, compliance costs, and recommendations for changes. Reports are due before the system is operational, by June 1, 2002, and by January 31, 2003. The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Commission, will develop an online filing and disclosure system to promote electronic submissions by June 1, 2005. The system will enable users to comply with all disclosure requirements of the law. The online filing and disclosure system developed by the Secretary of State allows filers to submit required filings free of charge, comply with disclosure requirements, retain and access previously submitted data, ensure data security, and potentially accept statements from specified filers in the future. The Secretary of State will define a standardized record format for data transmission required by specified persons and entities, conforming to disclosure requirements. The Secretary of State accepts test files from software vendors to ensure compliance with standardized record format. Accepted files are made available online for public access in a user-friendly format. The Secretary of State accepts test files from software vendors to ensure compliance with standardized record format and makes them available online for public access. Contributions must be reported free of charge and promptly, within 24 hours for late reports, without disclosing personal details or bank account numbers. The Secretary of State assigns a unique identifier to track contributions over $10,000 in a calendar year. Filers can electronically sign documents without needing an original signature. The Secretary of State must maintain filed data online for 20 years, provide public access assistance, prevent unauthorized data manipulation, and collaborate with the Commission. Consultation with relevant committees and stakeholders is required for developing the online filing system. The Secretary of State must hold a public hearing by July 31, 2017, to gather input on the online filing system. A report must be submitted by December 31, 2017, outlining the system's plan, public data access, and integration of statements. The Secretary of State will launch the online filing system by February 1, 2019, with a possible extension until December 31, 2019, after consulting with relevant committees. Acceptance of funds or grants for system development requires notification to specific committees. The Secretary of State will develop an online filing and disclosure system without following certain procurement requirements to ensure timely implementation. Collaboration with the Department of Technology will focus on project success, cost efficiency, and system security. Before public use, the Secretary of State will test and certify the online filing system developed in consultation with the Commission. Once certified, the previous system will no longer accept reports unless directed otherwise, but will still allow access to past disclosures unless data is migrated. The Secretary of State must provide quarterly progress reports on the Cal-Access Project to legislative committees, certifying any changes to scope, schedule, or budget, and identifying risks to project completion. This reporting requirement ends upon project completion or termination. This bill aligns with the Political Reform Act of 1974."
