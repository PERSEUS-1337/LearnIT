    "content": "Workers who experience short-term illnesses or injuries can use paid sick leave, accruing at a rate of 4 hours for each two-week pay period for federal employees. Unused sick leave continues to accrue without limit. If sick leave is exhausted, employees can use annual leave or take leave without pay. The Federal Employees Leave Sharing Act of 1988 allows for a voluntary leave bank program. The Federal Employees Leave Sharing Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-566) allows federal employees to donate unused annual leave to those who have exhausted sick leave. Unused sick leave is added to an employee's length of service upon retirement. CSRS employees are eligible for disability retirement after five years of service if they have a disabling condition certified by a physician. To be eligible for CSRS disability retirement, the agency must be unable to accommodate the disability in the worker's current job or in a vacant position at the same grade and pay in the same commuting area. An application must be filed before separation or within one year of separation. Unlike SSDI and SSI programs, CSRS disability retirement does not require the employee to be disabled for any job in the national economy. The employee must be unable to perform their assigned job or a job at the same pay in the same commuting area to qualify for a CSRS disability retirement annuity. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) certifies permanent disability for retired employees, who must undergo periodic medical reevaluations until age 60. Disability annuity payments continue temporarily if the individual seeks reemployment, but terminate if the individual is reemployed by the government, recovers from the disability, or demonstrates restored earning capacity. Earning capacity is restored if income equals at least 80% of previous pay. A disabled worker under CSRS is eligible for a retirement annuity based on the greater of the regular retirement formula or a minimum benefit tied to high-three pay. The method ensures the annuity does not exceed what would be received through normal retirement. A federal employee covered by CSRS can receive a retirement annuity based on the regular CSRS formula after 22 years of service, regardless of age. Most CSRS employees now have 30 or more years of service, with a retirement annuity replacing 56.25% of their high-three average pay. Retirement can be taken at 55 with 30 years of service, 60 with 20 years, or 62 with 5 years. Annuities are indexed to CPI growth annually for both disability and normal retirement. A federal employee enrolled in FERS must have completed at least 18 months of service to be eligible for disability retirement. Disability annuity under FERS is offset by a portion of Social Security Disability Insurance until age 62. Federal employees covered by FERS must also apply for Social Security disability benefits. Eligibility for Social Security disability benefits requires a determination of inability to work in any job in the national economy. An individual covered by FERS may be eligible for a disability annuity but ineligible for SSDI if disabled for federal government job only. If disabled under both FERS and Social Security, they can receive both benefits. FERS disability annuity is 60% of high-three average pay in first year, then 40% in subsequent years, minus any Social Security benefit received. The FERS disability annuity is adjusted annually by the FERS cost-of-living adjustment until age 62. At age 62, the annuity is adjusted to the amount the individual would have received if they had continued working. This ensures that the annuitant does not receive a higher annuity after 62 than they would have received with a normal retirement. The adjusted annuity at 62 is equal to 1.0% of the individual's high-three average pay multiplied by years of service before disability retirement plus years since that date. The FERS disability annuity is calculated based on the individual's high-three average pay multiplied by years of service before disability retirement plus years since that date. If the total number of years is 20 or more, the annuity is 1.1% of high-three average pay multiplied by this number of years. If an employee covered by FERS becomes disabled at the age of 62 or later, their FERS annuity is computed under the regular FERS retirement rules. At age 62, the offset to the FERS annuity for any Social Security benefits ceases, and the individual may apply for Social Security retired worker benefits if eligible. The FERS disability annuity is adjusted for inflation starting in the second year of payment. The FERS cost-of-living adjustment depends on the percentage change in the CPI, with different scenarios outlined based on CPI increases. FERS retirement benefits include the FERS annuity, Social Security, and the Thrift Savings Plan. P.L. 108-92 changed the computation of the FERS annuity for federal employees injured on the job, affecting their ability to contribute to Social Security and the Thrift Savings Plan while receiving workers' compensation. The Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) provides benefits to federal employees who suffer work-related injuries, including disability and death benefits for dependents. Workers' compensation payments do not count as earnings for Social Security or TSP contributions, potentially reducing future retirement income. P.L. 108-92 increased the FERS basic annuity to 2.0% of high-three average pay for individuals receiving workers' compensation to offset potential income loss. FECA provides benefits to federal workers for work-related injuries, including cash compensation, medical expenses, vocational rehabilitation, and attendant care services. Benefits are calculated based on pre-injury earnings, indexed annually, and not subject to income taxes. Cash compensation is two-thirds of lost earning capacity without dependents, or three-fourths with dependents, capped at 75% of GS-15 pay rate. FECA cash benefits for federal workers cover total disability with a minimum pay grade, continuing until disability ends. Compensation can be received instead of a disability retirement annuity, but not both simultaneously. FERS-covered employees receiving FECA compensation will have it reduced by Social Security benefits. Minimum cash benefits are provided for certain listed injuries, and full pay continues for specific incident injuries up to 45 days. An election between FECA and a disability retirement annuity can be changed at any time. FECA provides cash compensation for federal workers with work-related injuries, covering total disability for up to 45 days before regular payments begin. Surviving dependents receive benefits, with a spouse getting 50% of the worker's last pay and children receiving up to 15% each. Benefits end if the spouse remarries before age 60, with a lump sum payment offered in that case. The Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) provides cash compensation for federal workers with work-related injuries, covering total disability for up to 45 days before regular payments begin. Surviving dependents receive benefits, with a spouse getting 50% of the worker's last pay and children receiving up to 15% each. A dependent child's benefit ends at the age of 19, unless disabled. Other surviving dependent relatives may be eligible for compensation based on financial dependence. Additionally, a gratuity payment of up to $10,000 may be paid to the executor of the estate of a federal employee who dies as a result of injury sustained in the performance of official duties after August 1, 1990."
