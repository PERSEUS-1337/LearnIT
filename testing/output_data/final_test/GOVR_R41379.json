This decision clarifies that foreign government officials cannot use the FSIA as a defense unless the foreign state is the real party in interest. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Samantar v. Yousef that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act does not apply to suits against foreign officials. The decision clarifies that foreign government officials cannot use the FSIA as a defense unless the foreign state is the real party in interest. The ruling leaves open the possibility for foreign officials to seek immunity through other sources or defenses. The Supreme Court's ruling clarifies that foreign officials cannot use the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act as a defense unless the foreign state is the real party in interest. Customary international law historically granted sovereign states complete immunity from lawsuits in other states' courts, rooted in the equality and independence of sovereigns and the need for friendly relations. States usually refrain from exercising jurisdiction over other sovereign states out of comity considerations. During the last century, sovereign immunity gradually shifted to a more limited application due to states engaging in commercial activities. The \"restrictive principle\" of state immunity emerged to balance sovereign immunity with allowing domestic courts to handle most cases. The restrictive principle of sovereign immunity allows domestic courts to exercise jurisdiction over suits against foreign states for claims arising from commercial activities. In 1978, Congress codified this principle in the FSIA, which states that foreign states are generally immune from US court jurisdiction, with exceptions such as waiver and commercial activity. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) codified the principle of sovereign immunity, stating that foreign states are generally immune from US court jurisdiction, with exceptions like waiver, commercial activity, and torts committed by foreign officials in the US. The question arose whether the FSIA also immunizes foreign officials, defined as entities that are organs of a foreign state. The FSIA defines a foreign state as a legal entity owned by a foreign state, excluding US citizens or entities created under the laws of a third country. The interpretation of \"foreign state\" led to a split among US appellate courts, with the majority view including foreign officials as part of a foreign state when acting in their official capacity. This interpretation was based on the idea that the state acts through individuals, lawsuits were essentially against the foreign government itself, and the FSIA codified existing common law. The FSIA codified existing common law on foreign sovereign immunity, which includes immunity for foreign officials for their official acts. Courts have held that suits against foreign officials enforcing actions against the state itself are prohibited under the FSIA. This interpretation was applied in cases involving bank officials and human rights violations. The D.C. Circuit ruled that the FSIA prevented a lawsuit against a former Israeli Army Intelligence head for authorizing an attack in Lebanon. The court considered him an \"agency and instrumentality\" of Israel, even though he was no longer a government official. The court also determined that the TVPA did not override the FSIA, and rejected the argument that violating international human rights law voids immunity under the FSIA. In a case involving the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Second Circuit ruled that Saudi princes and organizations accused of funding Al Qaeda were protected by immunity under the FSIA. Despite allegations of support to terrorist groups, no exceptions to immunity applied, allowing the suit to go forward. The Second Circuit ruled that Saudi princes and organizations accused of funding Al Qaeda were protected by immunity under the FSIA. The defendants' alleged support to Muslim charities promoting terrorism did not fall under the commercial activity exception. The FSIA tort exception for death and personal injury did not apply as the terrorist act occurred overseas. Saudi Arabia was not covered under the terrorism exception as it was not designated a state sponsor of terrorism. The court also clarified that a former foreign official may not necessarily be covered by the FSIA. The court ruled that a former foreign official, in this case, Matar, was entitled to immunity under common law despite the FSIA not explicitly addressing immunity for former officials. The State Department recommended declining jurisdiction for claims against Matar related to civilian injuries during an Israeli military operation. Some circuits disagreed, allowing lawsuits against foreign officials under the FSIA. The court ruled that a former foreign official, Mohamed Ali Samantar, could be sued because the FSIA does not explicitly include heads of state or individual officials. Samantar, a former defense minister and prime minister of Somalia, was accused by Somalis living in the United States of systematic persecution during the 1980s. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the challenge after the Fourth Circuit joined the minority in Samantar v. Yousef. In the 1980s, expatriates accused Mohamed Ali Samantar of commanding Somali military forces who committed human rights abuses. Samantar claimed immunity under the FSIA, arguing that the suit was based on his official actions. He fled Somalia in 1991 and now resides in Virginia. The United States has not recognized a government in Somalia since the fall of the military regime. The court debated whether Samantar, a former Somali official accused of human rights abuses, could claim immunity under the FSIA for actions taken on behalf of Somalia. The Fourth Circuit disagreed, stating that individual officials do not fall under the FSIA's immunity. The case was sent back to determine if another form of immunity applied. Samantar appealed to the Supreme Court. The Fourth Circuit's decision was appealed to the Supreme Court by Samantar, arguing for immunity under the FSIA based on non-exhaustive examples and common law principles. The Somali plaintiffs countered that the statute does not cover officials, international law excludes former officials from immunity, and the TVPA serves as an exception. The Supreme Court's unanimous decision in Samantar resolved the issue. The Supreme Court's unanimous decision in Samantar resolved a circuit split in favor of the minority position. Justice Stevens found that the definition of \"agency or instrumentality\" in the FSIA refers to an entity, not an individual. The Court explained that the term typically refers to organizations, not natural persons. The Supreme Court in Samantar clarified that the term \"agency or instrumentality\" in the FSIA refers to entities, not individuals. The Court emphasized that the statute does not include individual officials within its scope, pointing out that the definition should be interpreted based on the context in which it is used. The Supreme Court clarified that the FSIA does not include individual foreign officials within the definition of \"agency or instrumentality.\" The Court emphasized that Congress did not intend to encompass foreign officials within the FSIA, which was meant to codify the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity. The Supreme Court clarified in 1978 that the FSIA does not cover individual foreign officials under the definition of \"agency or instrumentality.\" Justice Stevens explained that while statutes are generally interpreted consistently with common law, the FSIA was intended to replace common law regarding foreign state immunity, not official immunity. The Court found the relationship between common law state immunity and official immunity to be more complex and left the determination of Samantar's immunity to be decided on remand. The Supreme Court clarified that the FSIA does not cover individual foreign officials under the definition of \"agency or instrumentality.\" Samantar is entitled to immunity, but the question is left to be determined on remand. The Court noted a caveat to immunity for foreign officials, highlighting the importance of the State Department's role in recommending official immunity. Justice Stevens also mentioned the possibility of Samantar being entitled to head of state immunity under common law. On remand, the district court resolved the immunity issue for Samantar in line with the State Department's opposition based on foreign relations interests. Samantar appealed, arguing for a more thorough review rather than blindly following the State Department's recommendation. The State Department asserted its determination as binding, regardless of supporting or opposing immunity. The appellate court sided with the plaintiffs, emphasizing the need to consider State Department views. The court followed the plaintiffs' interpretation, giving deference to the State Department's views on Samantar's immunity. The State Department cited two reasons for denying immunity: Samantar's lack of a recognized government to request immunity and his status as a U.S. legal resident. The court considered whether Samantar should be entitled to head-of-state immunity, which is status-based and depends on recognition by the executive branch. Samantar, a former official, was not entitled to immunity based on his former status, even during his tenure in office. The State Department's views on Samantar's immunity were based on his lack of a recognized government to request immunity and his status as a U.S. legal resident. The court addressed conduct-based immunity for lower-level public officials and former high-level officials, considering the State Department's views but not binding its decision. Unlike status-based immunities, conduct-based immunity does not rely on the Executive Branch's control, focusing instead on the scope of the defendant's official duties and principles of customary international law and foreign policy. The court considered conduct-based immunity for public officials, not bound by State Department views, focusing on customary international law. Samantar's violation of jus cogens led to denial of immunity. A petition to the Supreme Court challenges this decision, citing a circuit split. The case is being remanded to the lower court to consider immunity in light of recent events affecting the State Department's determination. The Supreme Court's decision in Samantar limits foreign officials' recourse to the FSIA for liability protection in U.S. courts, emphasizing that other means for obtaining immunity are still available. The Supreme Court's decision in Samantar limits foreign officials' recourse to the FSIA for liability protection in U.S. courts. Other means for obtaining immunity are still available, such as the common law of official immunity with State Department support. The Court outlined three areas where a suit against a foreign official may be dismissed, including the absence of personal jurisdiction and the need to join a foreign state as a necessary party. The Supreme Court's decision in Samantar limits foreign officials' recourse to the FSIA for liability protection in U.S. courts. The Court outlined three areas where a suit against a foreign official may be dismissed, including the need to consider the foreign state as the real party in interest. The Supreme Court's decision in Samantar clarified that suits against foreign officials under the FSIA are only valid if they are in the official capacity of the entity, not personally. The Court rejected the interpretation that would cover officials for all actions taken in an official capacity, emphasizing the distinction between official capacity suits and personal capacity suits. The Supreme Court's decision in Samantar clarified that suits against foreign officials under the FSIA are only valid if they are in the official capacity of the entity, not personally. If a lawsuit is filed against an official in his or her official capacity, the suit will be considered as one against the state itself, in which case the FSIA applies. If a suit is brought against an official in his or her personal capacity, the common law of foreign sovereign immunity applies, where the relevance of the official nature of the conduct may be considered for determining immunity. The Court provided limited guidance on the application of common law immunity, suggesting that lower courts may analyze it based on traditional agency relationship principles. Immunity may depend on whether the state takes responsibility for the actions of its agent, similar to cases interpreting the FSIA through common law principles. The FSIA and common law principles may not always align in cases involving state and individual responsibility. While the state may be immune under the FSIA, individual officials could still be held liable for actions taken without authority. Exceptions to the FSIA may also result in officials being immune even if the state is not. The FSIA codifies common law foreign sovereign immunity, but there are instances where individual officials may still be immune or not personally liable. The FSIA codifies common law foreign sovereign immunity, but exceptions may lead to varying outcomes in cases involving foreign officials. The common law principles applied to determine official status under the FSIA could result in similar outcomes, but deviations from common law in FSIA exceptions may affect liability. The FSIA codifies common law foreign sovereign immunity, but exceptions may lead to varying outcomes in cases involving foreign officials. Immunity determinations for foreign officials may be influenced by principles articulated by the Executive Branch, especially in cases involving state sponsors of terrorism designated by the State Department. Executive branch intervention in lawsuits against officials of U.S. allies could help address concerns about unfounded and politically motivated lawsuits. The Supreme Court's decision in Samantar may complicate immunity analysis in cases involving individual defendants without head-of-state or diplomatic immunity. Courts may rely less on the FSIA and more on common law or State Department determinations, prompting potential congressional intervention to establish a statutory framework. The Supreme Court's decision in Samantar may complicate immunity analysis for individual defendants without head-of-state or diplomatic immunity. Common law immunity for foreign officials can take two forms: absolute immunity based on status and function-based immunity for official acts. State Department suggestions of immunity will likely remain controlling, even in cases of alleged jus cogens violations. Appellate courts have rejected the State Department's control over functional immunity cases. Congressional intervention may be needed to establish a statutory framework. The Supreme Court's decision in Samantar questions function-based immunity for foreign officials. Some argue officials have immunity for official acts within their duties, while others believe immunity depends on the nature of specific conduct. The common theme is \"official capacity\" in both common law and FSIA assessments. The Supreme Court's decision in Samantar raises questions about immunity for foreign officials, stating that officials are entitled to immunity only if a lawsuit against the individual would impose an obligation on the foreign government. The decision does little to clarify the circumstances under which immunity extends to an individual for acts taken in an official capacity. Arguments for immunity in authorized official conduct cite historical judicial precedent, including the case of Underhill v. Hernandez. The majority of courts consider immunity for acts done within a state's sovereignty as dispositive. Whether based on international law or federal common law, immunity is not affected by the defendant's status as long as the act was official. Some see this as customary international law and believe it will influence federal common law and State Department recommendations. Proponents argue that official immunity does not solely depend on the nature of the official's actions, citing early cases where immunity was not based on this factor. They point out that international case law does not always guarantee immunity for foreign officials, especially when foreign laws define \"state\" broadly to include individuals. Immunity can also be influenced by comity and convenience. The Samantar Court agreed that immunity for foreign sovereigns is not solely based on the nature of their actions, but also influenced by comity and convenience. The enactment of the FSIA aimed to reduce the State Department's role in court cases involving foreign sovereigns due to inconsistent treatment and burdensome practices. The State Department supported the FSIA despite losing its role in recommending immunity. The State Department supported the FSIA and did not object to losing its role in assessing sovereign immunity claims against foreign states. However, it continued to recommend immunity for foreign officials, with its recommendations often being respected by the Department of Justice and the courts. In recent cases, the State Department has asserted that its immunity recommendations are binding. The State Department's role in recommending immunity for foreign officials is crucial, especially in light of potential international legal actions. While historically deference was given to the State Department's recommendations, the emergence of human rights lawsuits may present new legal and political challenges. Despite the pre-FSIA framework not guaranteeing absolute deference to the executive, the courts often respected the State Department's recommendations. Some argue that increased reliance on the State Department for immunity determinations in cases involving foreign officials may lead to court delays and inconsistent outcomes. There are concerns about competing demands from foreign governments and human rights advocates, as well as increased lobbying from various interests involved in such lawsuits. One former U.S. official argues that the administration must consider the reciprocal impact on current and former U.S. officials if lawsuits against foreign officials are allowed in the United States. The Department of Defense may be particularly concerned due to its controversial counterterrorism operations worldwide. Congress could amend the FSIA to regulate foreign officials' immunity or enact a new statute for this purpose. This could involve altering the definition of \"agency or instrumentality\" to include individual officials and broadening the definition of \"state\" to cover all foreign officials. Congress could consider amending statutes like the TVPA to address immunity for foreign officials. Sovereign immunity of individual officials has been prevalent in lawsuits related to state-sponsored terrorist acts. Legislation to amend the FSIA has been introduced in response to the need to abrogate immunity and create a cause of action in terrorism cases. Legislation has been introduced to amend the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) to revoke immunity for foreign officials from lawsuits under the Anti-Terrorism Act. The bills aim to reduce burdens for victims of state-sponsored terrorism in the US in bringing lawsuits against foreign governments or officials by amending the non-commercial tort exception in the FSIA. The bills aim to amend the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) to remove immunity for foreign officials from lawsuits under the Anti-Terrorism Act. This change is in response to a court decision regarding the tort exception in the FSIA, clarifying that the location of the injury is what matters, not where the tortious act occurred. Additionally, the bills would allow contribution and indemnity actions against foreign states in cases of state-sponsored terrorism. The bills aim to amend the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) to remove immunity for foreign officials from lawsuits under the Anti-Terrorism Act. This change clarifies that foreign governments sponsoring terrorism in the US are liable under the tort exception to the FSIA. The revised tort exception would be more limited, changing \"personal injury\" to \"physical injury\" and excluding claims for emotional distress or injuries occurring outside the US. The proposed bill aims to limit immunity for foreign officials from lawsuits under the Anti-Terrorism Act, extending liability to foreign governments sponsoring terrorism in the US. The revised tort exception would change \"personal injury\" to \"physical injury,\" excluding claims for emotional distress or injuries outside the US. The bill would restrict claims to victims present during a terrorist attack, estates of those killed, and owners of damaged property. It would also eliminate the exemption for foreign officials and governments from the ATA's civil remedy provision. The proposed bill aims to limit immunity for foreign officials from lawsuits under the Anti-Terrorism Act, extending liability to foreign governments sponsoring terrorism in the US. The bill's amendment to the ATA cause of action allows for the refiling of previously dismissed claims, potentially conflicting with the Supreme Court decision in Plaut v. Sprendthrift Farms. Previous terrorism cases against foreign states have been revived on Congress's enactment of new laws. The Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings on a proposed bill, S. 2930, which aimed to amend the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) to limit immunity for foreign governments sponsoring terrorism in the US. Concerns were raised about potential implications on international law, U.S. allies like Israel, and the reciprocity of immunity provisions. The proposed bill aimed to limit immunity for foreign governments sponsoring terrorism in the US, addressing concerns about international law and reciprocity of immunity provisions. The Samantar decision clarified that the FSIA does not govern lawsuits against foreign officials, emphasizing that specific cases involving them will follow ordinary rules in determining immunity. The FSIA governs lawsuits against foreign states, not individual officials. Lawsuits against officials may not be worthwhile as judgments may not be paid by the state. Defendants may be entitled to immunity or other defenses not available to a state. The Samantar Court was unconcerned with lower courts' predictions about the FSIA. The Samantar decision raises concerns about the potential impact on U.S. foreign policy if the FSIA is interpreted to cover foreign states but not their officials. Congress and the executive branch may need to collaborate on a new statutory framework for official immunity to address any negative consequences."
