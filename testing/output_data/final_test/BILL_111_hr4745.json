    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Achievements of the GI Bill Gold Medal Act\". Congress finds that Harry W. Colmery served with distinction in World War I and continued to advocate for veterans' issues through the American Legion. He played a key role in ensuring government programs for the millions of servicemen and women returning from World War II. Harry Colmery spearheaded efforts to ensure government programs for returning US Armed Forces members, leading to the creation of the GI Bill of Rights in 1944. This legislation aimed to help GIs buy homes, start businesses, and attend college after World War II. President Roosevelt signed the bill into law on June 22, 1944. The GI Bill of Rights, passed in 1944, enabled over 2 million men and women to attend college and provided home loans for nearly 2.4 million World War II veterans. It is considered a significant piece of legislation that had a profound impact on the United States socially, economically, and politically. SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL. The Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate will arrange for the presentation of a gold medal in honor of recipients of the GI Bill of Rights. The Secretary of the Treasury will design and strike the medal with suitable emblems and inscriptions. The gold medal in honor of recipients of the GI Bill of Rights will bear the image of Harry W. Colmery on the obverse and a design emblematic of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 on the reverse. After the award, the medal will be given to the Smithsonian Institution for display and research purposes, with Congress suggesting it be displayed elsewhere as well. The gold medal honoring GI Bill recipients will be displayed at various locations chosen by the Secretaries of Veterans Affairs, Defense, or Education. The Secretary has the authority to strike and sell duplicate bronze medals of the gold medal at a price covering all costs. The medals are considered national medals and numismatic items. Proceeds from the sale can be used as authorized. SEC. 6. AUTHORITY TO USE FUND AMOUNTS; PROCEEDS OF SALE. The United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund can be used to pay for the costs of medals struck under this Act. Proceeds from the sale of duplicate bronze medals will be deposited into the Fund."
