The \"Small Business Start-up Savings Accounts Act of 2016\" establishes Small Business Start-up Savings Accounts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. A Small Business Start-up Savings Account is treated like an individual retirement plan, with no deduction allowed for contributions and a contribution limit set for each taxable year. The Small Business Start-up Savings Accounts Act of 2016 sets a $10,000 limit for individual accounts and a $150,000 aggregate limit for contributions across all accounts. Starting from 2017, the $10,000 limit will be adjusted for cost of living increases. The Small Business Start-up Savings Accounts Act of 2016 allows contributions to be made to accounts even after the account holder turns 70 and a half. Adjustments for cost of living increases are made annually, with amounts rounded to the nearest multiple of $500. The Small Business Start-up Savings Accounts Act of 2016 allows contributions after age 70 and a half. Taxpayers cannot rollover funds from retirement plans, except for rollovers from another Small Business Start-up Savings Account. Income limits apply based on modified adjusted gross income. The Small Business Start-up Savings Accounts Act of 2016 allows contributions after age 70 and a half, with income limits based on modified adjusted gross income. The reduction amount is determined by the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for the taxable year. Under sections 911, 931, or 933, distributions from a Small Business Start-up Savings Account are treated differently. Qualified distributions are excluded from gross income, while non-qualified distributions are included in gross income and treated as net capital gain for tax purposes. A qualified distribution refers to any payment or distribution from the account in a taxable year. The Small Business Start-up Savings Account allows for payments or distributions that do not exceed amounts spent on business expenses and capital contributions for the taxable year. The Small Business Start-up Savings Account allows payments or distributions within 5 years of the first payment, for the same trade or business. If the account beneficiary dies, the account ceases to be a Small Business Start-up Savings Account. When the beneficiary of a Small Business Start-up Savings Account dies, the account ceases to be a Small Business Start-up Savings Account. The fair market value of the assets in the account on the date of death is includible in the beneficiary's or estate's gross income for the respective taxable year. Special rules apply for the reduction of inclusion for predeath. The amount included in gross income for predeath expenses is reduced by amounts incurred by the decedent before death and paid within 1 year. An estate tax deduction is allowed for amounts included in gross income. Mandatory distribution rules do not apply. Excess contributions to Small Business Start-Up Savings Accounts are defined as the amount contributed exceeding the allowable contribution limit for the taxable year. Excess contributions to Small Business Start-Up Savings Accounts are calculated by subtracting the distributions and the excess contribution amount from the previous year, and then subtracting the aggregate contributions from all years from the allowable contribution limit. The amendment involves excess contributions to Small Business Start-Up Savings Accounts under section 408B(c)(2)(B) for taxable years, compared to previous years. A conforming amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart A of part I of subchapter D of chapter 1 of the Code. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2016."
