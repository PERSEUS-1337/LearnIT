These sanctions were issued between 1990 and 2012 in response to actions by Burma's ruling military junta. The sanctions create a complex web of restrictions, waiver provisions, and reporting requirements specified in six federal laws, presidential executive orders, and determinations. The United States imposes sanctions on Burma through six federal laws and executive orders targeting issues like human rights and democracy standards. These laws include Section 138 of the Customs and Trade Act of 1990, Section 307 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, Section 570 of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, and The Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003. The Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 (2003 BFDA) and The Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act of 2008 impose bans on imports from Burma, freeze assets of Burmese officials, block U.S. support for loans, and restrict visas for certain officials. Additionally, P.L. 112-192 allows the President to waive opposition to assistance from international financial institutions to Burma. Five executive orders also impose sanctions on Burma. Five presidential executive orders (E.O.) currently impose sanctions on Burma. E.O. 13047 bans new investments in Burma, E.O. 13310 freezes assets of Burmese officials, E.O. 13448 and E.O. 13464 add to the list of officials and entities with frozen assets, and E.O. 13619 expands sanctions on Burmese nationals. President Clinton and President Bush issued executive orders imposing sanctions on Burma, including visa bans and asset freezes. The sanctions aim to hinder Burma's transition to democracy. President Bush provided a limited waiver of some sanctions in the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act, citing national interest. The sanctions are based on laws like the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, granting the President authority to impose trade and financial sanctions in response to threats. The National Emergencies Act authorizes the President to declare a national emergency to impose international trade or financial sanctions in response to threats. The President can delegate this authority to other government officials, typically the Secretary of State or Treasury Secretary. President Obama continued the international emergency with respect to Burma in 2012. The international emergency with respect to Burma was extended for another year, renewing various provisions and sanctions. Current U.S. policy towards Burma involves a balance of bilateral engagement and economic sanctions, aiming to influence the country's government. The U.S. policy aims to pressure Burma's government to release political prisoners and transition to a democratic civilian government. Recent discussions focus on amending existing sanctions. The current principles underlying US Burma policy include supporting the reform process and targeting corrupt elements with sanctions. The Obama Administration has taken steps to encourage further reforms and support individuals in favor of political and economic reforms. These actions were announced after prisoner releases and parliamentary elections. The Obama Administration has utilized presidential authority to waive or ease political and economic sanctions on Burma, coinciding with visits by President Thein Sein and Aung San Suu Kyi to the United States in September 2012. While the waivers effectively lift sanctions, they can be reimposed at any time. Secretary Clinton was the first Secretary of State to visit Burma since John Foster. The Administration plans to partially or totally waive the general import ban in the future and support assistance to Burma through international financial institutions. During her visit to Burma in November 2011, Secretary Clinton announced new U.S. development programs, including aid for victims of internal conflict and an English language program funded by Brunei. The initiatives also included expanding an anti-malaria program and introducing academic exchange programs. During her visit to Burma in November 2011, Secretary Clinton announced new U.S. development programs, including aid for victims of internal conflict and an English language program funded by Brunei. The initiatives also included expanding an anti-malaria program into Burma, which was permissible under current U.S. sanctions. President Obama waived a section of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act to allow for this expansion. The Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 still requires opposition to loans or assistance to Burma, but the Obama Administration maintains support for the presidential waiver. The Obama Administration waived a provision of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act to allow for IMF and MDBs to provide technical support to Burma. In April 2012, Burma held a by-election with Aung San Suu Kyi and NLD members running as candidates. The by-election did not meet UN standards for being free, fair, transparent, and inclusive. The Obama Administration supported Burma's by-election in April 2012, where Aung San Suu Kyi and NLD candidates won. Secretary Clinton announced five steps to foster reforms in Burma following the election. The Obama Administration announced five steps to foster reforms in Burma following the by-elections in April 2012, including seeking an agreement with Burma on ambassador exchange, establishing an in-country USAID mission, relaxing restrictions on U.S. organizations, facilitating travel for pro-reform Burmese officials, and beginning a targeted easing of restrictions. The Obama Administration announced five steps to foster reforms in Burma, including seeking an agreement on ambassador exchange, establishing an in-country USAID mission, relaxing restrictions on U.S. organizations, facilitating travel for pro-reform Burmese officials, and beginning a targeted easing of the ban on the export of U.S. financial services and investment. These steps are to be taken using existing executive authority granted by the constitution and relevant federal laws. The State Department worked with OFAC to create an expanded general license for financial services in Burma. OFAC approved the license on April 17, 2012, allowing exportation and reexportation for not-for-profit projects. The easing of trade and investment restrictions aims to have an immediate impact on the country's people and reduce impediments to reform. Agriculture, banking, tourism, and telecommunications are potential sectors for easing restrictions, while caution is advised for regressive sectors like gems. The plan to implement five steps in Burma involves using existing waiver authorities and rescinding executive orders, without seeking legislative changes from Congress. Some steps may require invoking presidential authority through executive orders. Key sectors like gems, timber, and activities in ethnic minority areas need careful monitoring due to past government approval of projects opposed by locals. On May 16, 2012, Burma's Foreign Minister visited Washington, DC, where the Obama Administration announced three key developments: renewing sanctions for one year, nominating Derek Mitchell as U.S. ambassador to Burma, and implementing a presidential executive order. President Obama nominated Derek Mitchell as the U.S. ambassador to Burma and announced an easing of U.S. bans on financial services and new investment in Burma. Secretary Clinton detailed the steps to allow American investment and export of financial services, emphasizing responsible business practices. Administration officials provided further information on the planned easing of investment and financial restrictions. Officials provided more details about the planned easing of the investment and financial services ban in Burma. U.S. investors will be allowed to invest in all sectors and export financial services to any Burmese entity, as long as the partner is not on the SDN list. The SDN list will be regularly updated to prevent \"bad actors\" from benefiting. Criteria for listing on the SDN will likely include evaluations of business practices and attitudes towards Burma's reforms. The State Department is working with various stakeholders to develop voluntary corporate governance standards for U.S. companies operating in Burma. On July 11, 2012, the Obama Administration eased sanctions on U.S. investments in Burma, broadening the scope to target individuals threatening peace, security, or involved in human rights abuses. The implications of these changes will be discussed in the \"Summary of Burma-Specific Sanctions\" section. The Obama Administration eased sanctions on U.S. investments in Burma by lifting a ban on new investments and the export of financial services. President Obama delegated authority to Secretary Clinton to waive the investment ban, which was then exercised by Deputy Secretary of State Thomas R. Nides. This waiver led to the creation of General License No. 17, allowing new investments in Burma. General License No. 17 permits new investments in Burma by U.S. persons with restrictions, such as avoiding investments with certain entities and complying with State Department reporting requirements. Investments do not need pre-approval but must be reported, especially those involving Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise or exceeding $500,000 in value. Investments over $500,000 in Burma must be reported to the State Department annually by April 1. General License No. 16 allows the export of financial services to Burma with restrictions, excluding certain entities and individuals. This license supersedes General License No. 14-C and 15. The provision of financial services to sanctioned Burmese entities is subject to penalties under IEEPA. President Obama imposed sanctions on certain Burmese nationals via E.O. 13619, prohibiting visas, asset freezes, and financial services for those involved in threatening peace, human rights abuses, arms trading with North Korea, or supporting such activities. The Obama Administration eased sanctions on Burma in September 2012, removing President Thein Sein and Lower House Speaker Shwe Mann from the list of Specially Designated Nationals. H.R. 6431 was introduced to grant the President authority to waive U.S. opposition to IFI assistance to Burma. H.R. 6431 was passed by both the House and Senate, signed into law as P.L. 112-192 by the President on October 5, 2012. Secretary Clinton announced steps to ease restrictions on Burmese goods in response to progress towards reform. The timeline and scope of the import ban easing were unknown and would involve consultation with Congress. U.S. sanctions on Burma reflect a decline in relations with the country. Sanctions on Burma are the result of a decline in U.S. relations with Burma and its military since World War II. The U.S. government criticizes the Burmese military for human rights violations. Burma was a base for the U.S. against Japanese forces during WWII, leading to cordial relations. Burma became independent in 1948 and joined the UN. Relations between the United States and Burma soured after World War II due to issues with displaced Kuomintang soldiers and Burma's unstable civilian government, leading to a temporary halt in U.S. economic assistance in 1953. The military government in Burma, known as the Burmese Socialist Programme Party (BSPP), strengthened ties with the PRC, which the United States opposed. The government also violated human rights by suppressing opposition groups advocating for civilian rule. Despite strained relations, the U.S. maintained normal policies towards Burma, providing economic benefits and military assistance until 1988 when sanctions were imposed. The military government in Burma, known as the Burmese Socialist Programme Party (BSPP), strengthened ties with the PRC, which the United States opposed. Sanctions on Burma were implemented after the Tatmadaw brutally suppressed the 8888 Uprising in 1988. The military crackdown led to the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) assuming power. The U.S. Senate and House of Representatives passed resolutions condemning the violence and calling for a return to democracy in Burma. The House of Representatives passed H.Res. 529 condemning the killing of unarmed protesters in Burma and calling for a review of assistance programs. The Reagan Administration suspended all U.S. aid to Burma in response, starting the gradual imposition of sanctions. President George H. W. Bush later suspended preferential treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences program. The SLORC announced plans for parliamentary elections in 1990 and issued new laws governing political parties. The SLORC announced plans for parliamentary elections in 1990 and issued new laws governing the registration of political parties. Despite 235 parties registering, only 4 won more than 10 seats. The National League for Democracy (NLD) led by Aung San Suu Kyi won 59.9% of the votes and 382 seats, while SLORC's party only got 10 seats. SLORC refused to allow the Union Assembly to meet, arrested opposition leaders, and declared martial law. Congress responded with sanctions in the Customs and Trade Act of 1990. The Customs and Trade Act of 1990 granted the President authority to impose economic sanctions on Burma, including those under the Narcotics Control Trade Act of 1986. Prior to this, the Bush Administration had suspended Burma's eligibility for the Generalized System of Preferences program and designated Burma as a drug-producing country. The Bush Administration invoked the Customs and Trade Act of 1990 on August 5, 1991, refusing to renew the Bilateral Textile Agreement with Burma. Congress considered various sanctions on Burma during the 1990s, with some measures passing, such as the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1994 and the Free Burma Act of 1995. In July 1995, the Free Burma Act of 1995 (S. 1092) was introduced, imposing sanctions on Burma including a ban on U.S. investment, suspension of trade privileges, prohibition of imports, travel restrictions, and opposition to multilateral assistance. The severity of these sanctions led to the release of Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest. Congress later approved additional sanctions in 1997, including a cessation of non-humanitarian assistance, visa bans for Burmese officials, and instructions to oppose funding for Burma from international financial institutions. President Clinton issued various proclamations and executive orders to impose sanctions on Burma, including suspending visas for individuals impeding democracy, prohibiting new investments by U.S. persons, and banning all new investments in Burma. Congress introduced bills seeking to apply more sanctions, such as banning textile and apparel imports from Burma. The Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-61) and the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act were passed by Congress in response to crackdowns on opposition parties in Burma. The George W. Bush Administration took action after attacks on the Burmese opposition in 2003. President George W. Bush issued E.O. 13310, E.O. 13448, and E.O. 13464 in response to attacks on the Burmese opposition in 2003. President Barack Obama renewed sanctions under various executive orders and waived some related to the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000. U.S. relations with Burma have seen patterns of sanctions imposition post-World War II. The imposition of sanctions on Burma post-World War II has been linked to events like the 8888 Uprising in 1988 and human rights violations by the military. Congress has been more proactive than the White House in pushing for sanctions. The impact of sanctions on the SPDC is uncertain, as is the potential outcome without sanctions. U.S. sanctions target Burmese government officials, particularly the leadership of the State Peace and Development Council. Sanctions imposed on Burma target government officials, their families, and business associates, with restrictions on financial services and asset freezing. Import of Burmese goods is prohibited, along with new U.S. investments in Burma. Bilateral and multilateral assistance to Burma is also restricted. The sanctions imposed on Burma target government officials, their families, and business associates, with restrictions on financial services and asset freezing. Import of Burmese goods is prohibited, along with new U.S. investments in Burma. Bilateral and multilateral assistance to Burma is also restricted. Various laws and Executive Orders have overlapping provisions for sanctions, with differing waiver provisions, renewal conditions, and reporting requirements. Three laws restrict visas for certain Burmese nationals, along with Presidential Proclamation 6925. The visa restrictions imposed on Burma under various laws and Executive Orders differ in nature and scope. While the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act and Presidential Proclamation 6925 are mentioned, there is no indication that the Act supersedes prior visa restrictions. The Obama Administration expressed willingness to facilitate travel to the United States for selected government officials and parliamentarians, with a focus on reform-minded authorities. The 2003 BFDA provisions authorize a visa ban but do not require implementation, and no President has invoked this authority so far. Existing sanctions laws allow the President to waive visa restrictions on Burmese officials, with a certification to Congress required for each case. President Obama issued E.O. 13619 blocking entry into the US for individuals threatening Burma's peace, security, or stability. Restrictions on financial services to Burma from the United States are outlined in various executive orders and the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act. Secretary Clinton announced easing of the ban on export of U.S. financial services and investment to support economic and political reform in Burma. The United States eased sanctions on Burma, allowing Burmese citizens access to international credit markets and dollar-based transactions. Implementation occurred on July 11, 2012, through General License No. 16 issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Certain restrictions on financial transactions with designated Burmese nationals remain in place. The United States eased sanctions on Burma, allowing Burmese citizens access to international credit markets and dollar-based transactions. Section 2 of E.O. 13310 established a general prohibition on the export or reexport of financial services to Burma, with exceptions for pre-existing U.S. investments or agreements. The President has the authority to waive, amend, or terminate this prohibition under IEEPA, but must report to Congress when doing so. The freezing of assets of sanctioned Burmese officials is included in several executive orders and acts, expanding the list of sanctioned individuals and entities over time. The Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act is directly linked to the list of sanctioned persons. The Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act is connected to the visa ban list and includes import restrictions on Burmese products. Laws like the Customs and Trade Act of 1990 and the 2003 BFDA, along with executive order E.O. 13310, regulate the import of Burmese goods. H.R. 5986 extended the import ban to July 25, 2013. Additionally, the 2003 BFDA and the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act have specific import restrictions, including bans on products and services from certain companies. President Obama renewed the national emergency with respect to Burma, considering easing the ban on new investments in select sectors like agriculture, tourism, and telecommunications for the benefit of the average Burmese. The United States is considering easing the ban on new investments in select sectors in Burma, such as agriculture, tourism, and telecommunications, to benefit the average Burmese. Secretary Clinton announced that American businesses will be able to invest across the Burmese economy, with mechanisms in place to promote responsible investment and deter abuses. The Obama Administration issued documents to waive the ban on new U.S. investments in Burma, subject to certain conditions. The U.S. Department of the Treasury prohibits U.S. investments with certain entities in Burma, including the Ministry of Defense, armed groups, and individuals blocked under specific regulations. Restrictions on bilateral assistance to Burma are also in place under various acts. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 restricts U.S. funding for international organizations in Burma, with exceptions. The 2003 BFDA requires the U.S. to vote against loans or assistance to Burma in IFIs. P.L. 112-192 allows the President to waive opposition to IFIs' assistance if in the national interest, after consulting with Congress. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 restricts U.S. funding for international organizations in Burma, with exceptions. The 2003 BFDA requires the U.S. to vote against loans or assistance to Burma in IFIs. P.L. 112-192 allows the President to waive opposition to IFIs' assistance if in the national interest, after consulting with Congress. The Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury consult with congressional committees on assistance to Burma by international financial institutions. Assistance includes loans, financial or technical aid, or any other use of funds. Current sanction laws may prevent the U.S. from contributing funds to a UNDP program in Burma. Section 307 of the Foreign Assistance Act prohibits the use of U.S. funds for programs in Burma, North Korea, Syria, Iran, Cuba, or the Palestine Liberation Organization. The State Department has historically notified the UNDP that the U.S. may withhold contributions if new programs are funded. The UNDP may have funding withheld if new programs are initiated in Burma. The FAA prohibits U.S. funds for programs in certain countries, including Burma. The President cannot waive funding restrictions in Section 307, requiring Congress to pass legislation for financial support to UNDP in Burma. Past laws have also restricted U.S. contributions to UNDP until compliance with specific conditions in Burma programs. The UNDP's compliance with specific conditions on its programs in Burma has been tied to U.S. contributions in past laws. While previous legislation restricted funding until compliance, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2012 does not mention UNDP in Burma but instructs against financial support to Burma. Burma is currently under targeted sanctions. Burma is currently subject to targeted sanctions and specific sanctions based on functional issues such as child soldiers and human trafficking. These sanctions restrict certain types of foreign assistance and relations with Burma. Burma is prohibited from receiving certain foreign assistance due to its Tier 3 designation in the 2011 Trafficking in Persons Report. President Obama granted Burma a partial waiver for aid sanctions to control infectious diseases. The memorandum waives the requirement for U.S. Executive Directors to vote against non-trade, non-humanitarian loans to Burma through multilateral development banks and the IMF. Despite the waiver, the Executive Directors still need to oppose loans to Burma due to the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act. Burma's Mayflower Bank and Asia Wealth Bank are designated as primary money laundering concerns under the USA PATRIOT Act. The USA PATRIOT Act designated Burma's Mayflower Bank and Asia Wealth Bank as primary money laundering concerns due to weak oversight and private bank connections to organized crime. The Treasury Department imposed a \"special measure\" prohibiting certain U.S. financial institutions from maintaining accounts for Burmese banks. The International Religious Freedom Act requires an annual review of religious freedom in other nations. The International Religious Freedom Act requires an annual review of religious freedom in other nations and authorizes sanctions for violations. Burma has been designated a \"country of particular concern for religious freedom\" since 1999. The Trade Reform Act grants the President authority to withdraw trade preferences if a country does not uphold worker rights. President George H. W. Bush suspended Burma's preferential treatment in 1989. President George H. W. Bush suspended Burma's preferential treatment under the GSP program, invoking his authority under the Trade Reform Act of 1974. The U.S. arms embargo on Burma remains in effect, with restrictions on arms exports and defense articles and services. Burma has also faced sanctions for violations of religious freedom and illicit drug production. Since 1989, some Members of Congress have proposed additional sanctions on Burma, beyond the current policy provisions due to its designation as a major illicit drug producing and/or drug-transit country. Despite this designation, a national interest waiver was granted to Burma in 2012, along with Bolivia and Venezuela, allowing them to bypass certain prohibitions. Proposed sanctions on Burma have included a ban on importing products of Burmese origin, with legislation introduced in Congress since 1989 targeting specific products like teak and fish. Proposed sanctions on Burma have included a ban on importing products of Burmese origin, with legislation introduced in Congress since 1989 targeting specific products like teak and fish. The 106th Congress introduced H.R. 5603 and S. 3246 proposing a ban on all textile and apparel products from Burma. Later bills in the 110th Congress aimed to ban goods containing materials from Burma, such as gemstones and timber, regardless of the country of origin. Various bills and resolutions have also called for a broader arms embargo on Burma. In support of a global arms embargo on Burma, congressional legislation has targeted China and other nations to end military assistance to Burma. Bills have called for the US to vote against loans or assistance to China until arms sales to Burma cease. The European Union and ASEAN members have also been urged to tighten sanctions on Burma. Several bills in Congress have aimed to tighten sanctions against Burma, including calls for ASEAN to suspend Burma's membership and denying trade benefits to countries supporting Burma unless they cease trade and investment. Congressional consideration has also included broader financial sanctions, such as prohibiting US persons from economic-financial transactions under the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act. The final bill replaced provisions prohibiting economic transactions with Burmese government entities, including taxes to the Yadana gas project, with a suggestion for Chevron to consider disinvestment. Congressional bills have also targeted investments in Burma by U.S. nationals, aiming to ban existing and new investments and payments to the SPDC. After the dissolution of the SPDC in 2011, political reforms in Burma led to prisoner amnesties and the release of political prisoners. The Union Parliament enacted laws allowing opposition parties to participate in elections and the formation of labor unions. The Union Government has improved communications with the United States. In April 2012, Burma saw the formation of labor unions and ceasefire talks with ethnic-based militias. Despite some progress, human rights violations persist, with political prisoners still detained and ethnic-based political parties facing registration issues. The Tatmadaw continues attacks on militias and commits abuses against civilians. The 112th Congress maintained existing sanctions in response to these ongoing challenges. The 112th Congress retained existing sanctions on Burma, passing laws to extend import restrictions and reaffirm other sanctions on military assistance and financial support. Congress allowed the Obama Administration to decide on selectively easing or waiving sanctions. The 112th Congress retained sanctions on Burma, allowing the Obama Administration to decide on easing them. Congressional committees held oversight hearings on U.S. policy in Burma, and delegations visited to assess political reforms. The Administration consults with Congress on policy options and updates them on the situation in Burma. Members of Congress have also released statements on Burma. Several Members of Congress have released statements on Burma, with varying opinions on sanctions. The repeal of Burma-specific sanction laws may not eliminate all restrictions due to overlapping provisions and functional issues. Removing certain types of assistance may be more challenging than eliminating bans on imports from Burma. Congress may consider imposing sanctions on goods with materials from Burma, matching the importance of the sanction to the intended message. The balance of sanctions would depend on events in Burma in the coming months."
