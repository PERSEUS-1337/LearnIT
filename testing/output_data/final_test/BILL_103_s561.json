    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Child and Family Services and Law Enforcement Partnership Act\". Congress finds that homicide is the leading cause of death for young black males and females, with rates for children and youth doubling since 1950. Teenagers are more likely to be victims of violent crime, and physical fighting among high school students mirrors patterns of homicide. There is a need for additional preventive programs to supplement existing mental health services. Preventive programs are essential to reach those at risk for behavioral or social problems. Mental health manpower can be expanded through consultative techniques and training of nontraditional resources. Community-based police can serve as role models and resources to promote well-being and identify those at risk for behavioral issues. The purpose of the preventive programs is to reach those at risk for behavioral or social problems. The Act aims to identify high-risk children and families exposed to community violence and provide mental health services, facilitate collaboration between various organizations for violence prevention, and enhance law enforcement services through training and support from child and family service organizations. The Act aims to provide mental health services and collaboration for high-risk children and families exposed to community violence, as well as promote conflict resolution training for children and youth in local educational agencies.
