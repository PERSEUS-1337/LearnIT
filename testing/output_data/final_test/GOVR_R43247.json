    "content": "Federal executive branch agencies own approximately 361,000 buildings acquired over decades to support their missions. As missions change, some assets become less useful. For example, the Department of Veterans Affairs has shifted to outpatient care, and the Department of Defense reduced its force after the Cold War. Agencies must dispose of unneeded real property, but many still hold onto it. In FY2010, the government held 77,700 underutilized buildings, spending $1.67 billion on maintenance. Disposal efforts are hindered by legal and budgetary issues. Several real property reform bills were introduced in the 113th Congress to address inefficiencies in the disposal process. The Property Realignment Act of 2013 aims to reform the real property disposal process, including the use of Public-Private Partnerships to generate revenue from underutilized properties. The government faces challenges in disposing of unneeded properties due to statutory requirements and maintenance costs. The disposal of unneeded properties is hindered by statutory requirements, preparation costs, conflicts with stakeholders, and lack of accurate data. Agencies must continuously survey and report excess property to the General Services Administration for disposal following regulations. Agencies first offer excess properties to other federal agencies before considering other disposal methods. The disposal of unneeded properties is hindered by statutory requirements, preparation costs, conflicts with stakeholders, and lack of accurate data. Federal agencies must offer excess properties to other federal agencies first before considering other disposal methods. Surplus properties not acquired by federal agencies must be offered to state and local governments, and qualified nonprofits for public benefit at less than fair market value or for sale at fair market value. Agencies argue that these statutory requirements slow down the disposition process, leading to operating costs for months or years. The disposal of unneeded properties is hindered by statutory requirements, preparation costs, conflicts with stakeholders, and lack of accurate data. Real property officials at the VA have mentioned that the McKinney-Vento Act can add up to two years to the disposal process. Agencies are required to screen surplus properties for homeless use, even if they cannot be conveyed, leading to additional operating costs. Statutes related to environmental remediation or historic preservation also contribute to delays in the disposal process. The disposal of unneeded properties is hindered by statutory requirements, preparation costs, conflicts with stakeholders, and lack of accurate data. Agencies must assess potential environmental consequences and develop abatement plans, as required by law. The National Historic Preservation Act mandates agencies to minimize harm to historic properties, leading to costly repairs and renovations before properties can meet standards and comply with preservation requirements. VA may need to spend $3 billion to repair buildings in poor condition, with many vacant or underutilized. The poor condition of federal properties, including vacant or underutilized buildings, may deter potential buyers or lessees due to required improvements. Agencies face high deconstruction and cleanup costs, which may exceed maintenance costs, leading to retention of properties. Compliance with environmental regulations poses a significant disincentive to disposal, as agencies must assess and pay for cleanup of hazards like lead paint and asbestos before disposing of a property. Disposing of federal properties can be costly due to hazards like lead paint and asbestos. Agencies face challenges from stakeholders with competing agendas, leading to delays or cancellations of disposal efforts. The Department of State has difficulty disposing of surplus real property overseas due to disputes with host governments. The challenges agencies face in disposing of federal properties include conflicts that can lead to delays or cancellations of disposal efforts. Data on agency real property portfolios are often inaccurate, with government-wide data accessible only to the GSA. Agencies tend to enter into leases rather than seek funding for new construction, even if leased space is more expensive over time. The Federal Real Property Profile managed by the GSA is the primary source of information on real property under executive branch agencies' control. The Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) contains data on federal real property activities, including excess properties, maintenance costs, and disposition actions. The FRPP data is determined by the Federal Real Property Council (FRPC) and is not directly accessible to Congress due to proprietary reasons. GSA responds to congressional requests for real property data by querying the database and providing the results. Some FRPP data is made public through an annual summary report. The annual summary reports of FRPP data posted on GSA's website are limited for congressional oversight as they are highly aggregated and lack agency-specific information. This hinders Congress from monitoring individual agency performance, comparing agencies, and studying policies effectively. The quality of FRPP data has also been questioned, with GAO audits revealing inconsistencies. The quality of FRPP data has been questioned by GAO audits, citing incomplete and inconsistent real property data across agencies. Key data elements like building utilization, condition, and value are not consistently captured, leading to unreliable data for decision-making on excess and underutilized property. Annual summary reports based on FRPP data may also misclassify disposal methods. The FRPC summary reports show that the \"other\" category is the largest or second largest category of property disposal, accounting for a significant percentage of real property assets disposed by agencies in recent years. This category includes cases that do not fit into the major data categories of transfer, conveyance, sale, or demolition, raising questions about the accuracy and classification of disposal data. The annual summary reports on property disposals may be of limited use due to potential miscategorization of properties. The reports omit data that could enhance congressional oversight, such as the number of excess and surplus properties held by agencies and their annual operating costs. This results in a focus on the positive aspects of asset disposition while neglecting ongoing costs associated with excess properties. Additionally, agencies estimate repair needs for buildings and structures in their reports, but this information is not fully disclosed in the summary reports. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has raised concerns about the government's reliance on costly leased space, which contributes to federal real property being designated as a \"high risk\" issue. Leasing space is more expensive than owning space over the same time period, as evidenced by a long-term operating lease that cost $40.3 million more than purchasing the same building. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has highlighted concerns about the government's preference for leasing over purchasing buildings due to budget scoring rules, even if leasing is not the most cost-effective option. Agencies often choose to lease space for operational reasons or due to budget constraints under the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, which requires up-front funding for total legal commitments when acquiring space. Some agencies have independent leasing authority, like USPS and VA, with in-house real property expertise. The SEC made a costly leasing decision, acquiring three times the needed space, leading to criticism from the SEC's inspector general. S. 1398 was introduced on July 30, 2013, and focuses on real property management, including new performance measures, agency consolidation opportunities, and a real property database for federal agencies. It aims to expand the role of the FRPC in collecting and analyzing real property data. S. 1398 defines different categories of federal properties, including \"underutilized,\" \"excess,\" and \"surplus\" properties. Certain properties are exempt from being classified as \"surplus,\" such as DOD properties under BRAC legislation and properties related to national security. S. 1398 requires federal agencies to manage their real property holdings by maintaining inventory controls, identifying excess properties for colocation or consolidation, reporting to GSA promptly, setting goals to reduce underutilized property, and adopting workplace practices to decrease space needs. The bill requires federal agencies to provide an annual assessment of their real property inventory to the FRPC and GSA Administrator, including details on property age, size, utilization, operating costs, sustainability metrics, and capital expenditures. The bill requires federal agencies to report on their real property inventory annually to the FRPC and GSA Administrator, including details on property age, size, utilization, operating costs, sustainability metrics, and capital expenditures. It also aims to establish clear standards for real property management practices and identify opportunities for more efficient space use. Additionally, it sets in statute an interagency real property working group, the FRPC, to facilitate cost-effective real property disposals. The bill establishes an interagency working group, chaired by the OMB's Deputy Director for Management, to oversee the management of federal real property. The group will develop a management plan template with performance measures, savings strategies, and goals for reducing surplus property. It will also set standard use rates and reduce agencies' reliance on leased space. The Federal Real Property Council (FRPC) aims to reduce federal agencies' reliance on leased space, provide guidance on leasing process efficiencies, and identify field offices suitable for colocation. An annual report to the OMB Director will list excess, surplus, and underutilized property, along with progress updates on real property goals. Consultation with various stakeholders is required for fulfilling FRPC duties. S. 1398 defines \"postal property\" as buildings owned by USPS, exempting properties operated by USPS from being surplus but not underutilized. USPS is considered a federal agency under the bill, required to identify available space for federal agencies annually. The FRPC will share this list for colocation recommendations within 90 days. The Postal Reorganization Act (PRA) of 1970 gave USPS independent authority over its real estate. S. 1398 allows federal agencies 90 days to recommend colocation with USPS properties, enabling USPS to lease space to these agencies. This shift in control was necessary as Congress had relinquished control over USPS operations due to past issues. The PRA mandated USPS to be financially self-supporting and maintain an efficient mail system nationwide. The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 granted USPS independent authority over its real estate, allowing it to determine the need for post offices, facilities, and equipment. This authority helps USPS adjust its operational footprint based on population shifts and technological advancements. S. 1398's colocation provisions aim to facilitate, not compel, USPS to enter leasing agreements with federal agencies. S. 1398 aims to facilitate USPS entering colocation leasing agreements with federal agencies, defining USPS as a \"federal agency\" for legislative purposes. The bill outlines duties including property surveys, inventory controls, and reporting on excess properties. Agencies with leasing authority must submit lease details to the FRPC. GSA Administrator would have additional responsibilities under S. 1398. S. 1398 requires the GSA Administrator to establish a comprehensive database of federal agency real property, including disposal information. The database will be accessible to specific Senate committees upon request. Section 627 of S. 1398 establishes a five-year pilot program to streamline the disposal process of up to 200 surplus properties annually. The OMB Director can authorize expedited disposal through transfer, sale, conveyance, or demolition, prioritizing properties with high fair market value. GSA can use funds to prepare properties for disposal, with repayment from proceeds of surplus property sales. Properties in the pilot program can only be disposed of if proceeds exceed disposal costs. Properties selected for disposal under the pilot program can be sold, transferred, or demolished without being offered for public benefit conveyance. Proceeds from the sale of real property would be distributed with 80% going towards debt reduction, up to 18% retained by landholding agencies, a maximum of 2% for homeless assistance grants, and any remaining funds for deficit reduction. The pilot program allows agencies to dispose of surplus properties within two years, with proceeds going towards debt reduction. If a property is not sold within two years, it may be transferred to state/local governments or nonprofits. Failure to sell a property within 18 months restricts agencies from increasing their real property inventory without offsetting the increase. S. 1398 allows HUD to use funds from property disposal for grants to nonprofits to acquire or rehabilitate housing for the homeless. Recipients must use the property for homeless services for at least 15 years. H.R. 328, introduced in 2013, aims to expedite real property disposal and includes provisions for high-value properties. The bill aims to expedite the disposal of high-value federal properties, reduce the scope of the McKinney-Vento Act, and establish a real property database for oversight. It would identify and sell 15 excess properties through public auction, with proceeds used to acquire or rehabilitate housing for the homeless. The bill aims to expedite the disposal of high-value federal properties, excluding certain types of properties from the program. Properties under the program must be sold at fair market value and generate revenue exceeding disposal costs. Selected properties would be exempt from various statutory provisions, including screening for homeless use and public benefit conveyance. H.R. 328 aims to expedite the disposal of federal properties by depositing proceeds into the Treasury's General Fund, with 2% allocated for homeless assistance grants. HUD can use the proceeds for grants to nonprofit organizations aiding the homeless. GSA would issue guidance on real property plans, including identifying excess properties and prioritizing disposal decisions based on agency missions. Executive agencies must maintain inventory controls and identify underutilized properties. H.R. 328 aims to expedite the disposal of federal properties by depositing proceeds into the Treasury's General Fund. It requires agencies to develop real property plans, identify underutilized properties, and establish goals for reducing excess property. Agencies are encouraged to reassign or transfer underutilized properties within the agency or to other federal agencies before acquiring nonfederal property. GSA must issue a report within three years detailing agency efforts to reduce excess property. H.R. 328 requires agencies to develop real property plans, identify underutilized properties, and establish goals for reducing excess property. Agencies must detail disposal efforts within three years, including date, method, cost, and proceeds obtained. Net proceeds from property sales are deposited into agency accounts for real property activities, with any unspent funds used for deficit reduction. GSA is tasked with creating a federal real property database. H.R. 328 mandates the creation of a database by GSA containing details of federal real properties, accessible to Congress and the public. It must include property location, size, utilization level, operating costs, and replacement value in a machine-readable format. The legislation also requires agencies to divert 50% of construction and demolition materials by 2015. H.R. 328 mandates the creation of a database by GSA containing details of federal real properties, accessible to Congress and the public. It requires agencies to divert materials by 2015, excluding certain properties from homeless screening and changing the publication requirements for surplus properties. The House and Senate versions of CPRA propose reforms to the real property disposal process, drawing on the BRAC model. Both versions establish an independent commission to assess agency portfolios and recommend actions to reduce the government's inventory of unneeded buildings. Differences between the bills are discussed. H.R. 695 and S. 1715 have broad scopes, applying to space owned and leased by executive branch agencies and government corporations. The legislation includes various real property asset management functions like consolidation, sale, and transfer of unneeded properties. The Senate version of CPRA, S. 1715, includes properties owned by the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations. H.R. 695 proposes federal landholding agencies to develop recommendations for realigning property portfolios and reducing costs, submitting data on property details to GSA and OMB annually. The CPRA bill proposes recommendations for realigning federal property portfolios to reduce costs, including categorizing properties for sale, transfer, consolidation, or redevelopment. The GSA Administrator and OMB Director would develop criteria for determining realignment options based on nine specified principles. The OMB Director would analyze federal buildings for potential sale or redevelopment to maximize value, reduce operating costs, align with agency missions, and decrease energy consumption. The OMB Director would conduct an independent analysis of agency recommendations and submit them to a Civilian Property Realignment Commission composed of nine members with expertise in various fields. The commission would review the recommendations and make decisions on property realignment. The Civilian Property Realignment Commission, composed of nine members with expertise in various fields, would review the OMB Director's recommendations on property realignment. The commission could reject, accept, or modify the recommendations and develop an accounting system to evaluate costs and returns. Hearings on recommendations must be open to the public, and the commission must include at least five federal properties worth $500 million in its recommendations. H.R. 695 and S. 1715 propose commissions to review property realignment recommendations. The commissions may recommend selling high-value assets, with different membership compositions. GAO would publish a report on the recommendations, and the President would receive the final recommendations. The proposed bills, H.R. 695 and S. 1715, suggest the creation of commissions to review property realignment recommendations. The President would have the authority to appoint the chairperson and members, with input from Senate and House leaders. The commissions would have 10-year terms and the President would review and report on their recommendations within 30 days. If approved, the recommendations would be submitted to Congress. The President would need to submit a report to Congress and the commission if he disapproves of their recommendations. The commission would then have 30 days to submit a revised list of recommendations. If the President approves the revised recommendations, he must submit them to Congress. If no report is submitted within 30 days, the process ends for the year. The President can only approve or reject the recommendations, not amend them. H.R. 695 and S. 1715 propose similar requirements for congressional consideration of the commission's recommendations. H.R. 695 and S. 1715 propose requirements for congressional consideration of the commission's recommendations. Congress would have 45 days to review and vote on a joint resolution of approval. If no resolution is passed, agencies would not be required to implement the recommendations. If approved, agencies must begin implementation within two years and complete it within six years. The GSA Administrator would be authorized to take necessary actions to implement Commission recommendations, including property sale or conveyance. Other agencies must use existing authorities or work with GSA. The Administrator could convey property for less than fair market value. H.R. 695 would require HUD to evaluate properties for homeless use as per the McKinney-Vento Act. The provision in H.R. 695 would require HUD to evaluate properties for homeless use under the McKinney-Vento Act. It would also expand reporting requirements for real property actions exceeding the prospectus threshold, including details on life-cycle cost analysis. S. 1715 would require agencies to develop implementation plans within 90 days of enactment, provide updates to the commission and GSA within one year, and complete implementation within three years. GSA would take over if an agency fails to implement recommendations. The bill exempts properties from certain statutory requirements and establishes new guidelines for public benefit conveyances. H.R. 695 would create accounts for administrative costs and asset proceeds. The bill would establish a salaries and expenses account and an asset proceeds and space management fund (APSMF) to fund administrative costs and implementation of recommended actions. It authorizes a one-time appropriation of $20 million for salaries and expenses and $62 million for APSMF. The APSMF would receive proceeds from property sales for implementing recommendations. The Senate version allows APSMF to receive proceeds from any disposal recommended by the commission, not just property sales as in the House version. S. 1715, similar to H.R. 695, outlines the distribution of disposal proceeds with the first $50 million deposited in the Treasury's general fund. Any excess proceeds would be split with 80% going to the Treasury and 20% at the discretion of the GSA Administrator. The APSMF could also receive unused funds from property maintenance appropriations under S. 1715. H.R. 695 and S. 1715 would restrict executive agencies to acquire leased space through GSA, except for VA properties or those excluded for national security reasons. This may enhance oversight by centralizing leasing decisions, but it is unclear if it would limit GSA's ability to delegate leasing authority. Both bills also require considering a building's life-cycle cost when constructing or leasing. The bills would require considering a building's life-cycle cost when constructing or leasing, applying to buildings meeting specific criteria such as cost thresholds and square footage. \"Life-cycle cost\" includes various expenses over a 50-year period or the building's projected lifespan. GSA Administrator must include a statement on how the life-cycle cost analysis was used in prospectus submissions. The prospectus includes a statement on how life-cycle cost analysis was used. Table 1 compares key provisions from four proposals. Agencies argue that public benefits conveyance requirements create delays and drive up costs. H.R. 695 and S. 1715 limit agencies' disposal authorities. The GSA would have authority to implement commission recommendations, allowing properties to bypass certain statutory requirements. H.R. 328 and S. 1398 exempt properties from public benefit conveyance requirements, with different criteria for exemptions. H.R. 695 and S. 1715 propose a new commission for final recommendations, requiring Senate confirmation for the chair. S. 1398 would utilize the Federal Real Property Council to develop asset management plans for agencies, including recommendations for disposal of underutilized properties. Membership on the FRPC would not require congressional approval. Property officials from each agency play a central role in improving real property management by developing government-wide asset management principles and policies, as well as by vetting and finalizing recommendations to the OMB Director regarding property disposal. H.R. 328 would establish a program for expedited disposal of properties recommended by agency heads, with final selections made by the OMB Director and GSA Administrator. H.R. 695 and S. 1715 propose a 45-day timeframe for congressional review of property disposal recommendations, potentially reducing oversight of major real property actions. Congress regularly holds hearings on major consolidation proposals, such as the effort to consolidate the Department of Homeland Security at St. Elizabeth's in DC, estimated to cost $3.26 billion. Similar issues have been raised regarding the consolidation of the Food and Drug Administration headquarters, which has received hundreds of millions of dollars since FY2000. Some argue that Congress may not have enough time to approve or disapprove of recommendations under proposed time constraints. S. 1398 and H.R. 328 propose programs managed by executive agencies, eliminating the need for Congress to approve recommendations. This could reduce conflict among stakeholders involved in property disposal efforts. For example, the USPS faced challenges in closing facilities due to involvement from various groups with competing agendas. USPS faced challenges in closing facilities due to political pressure from stakeholders. H.R. 695 and S. 1715 propose establishing an independent commission to manage property disposal, reducing stakeholder influence. The bills also require the commission to maintain a public database with relevant information on recommendations. The commission would have authority to access detailed data on property age, condition, operating costs, size, and number of employees. S. 1398 requires the FRPC to submit a report to the OMB Director with descriptive data similar to H.R. 695 and S. 1715. GSA must establish a free descriptive database for public access, including data useful to Congress. The database proposed in H.R. 328 would provide public access to detailed information on federal real properties, allowing users to search, sort, and download data. However, the quality of the data in the new database may impact its utility for decision-making and analysis. This approach aims to offer the widest public access to federal real property data. The bills analyzed in this report aim to establish procedures for selling federal properties and using the proceeds to reduce the federal deficit. However, the lack of basic data on excess properties held by agencies may limit the revenue generated. The Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) data shows that sales of federal properties have not generated significant net proceeds in recent years due to high costs of bringing properties to market and undesirable locations. Proposed bills may increase revenue by selling properties in more desirable locations. For example, H.R. 695 aims to require the Civilian Property Realignment. H.R. 695 and S. 1398 propose mechanisms to sell valuable properties not declared as excess or surplus, potentially generating greater net proceeds. H.R. 328 focuses on selling excess or surplus properties to increase sales revenue and net proceeds. By auctioning the 15 most marketable properties, agencies can increase sales revenue and net proceeds significantly. The reduction in operating and maintenance costs has resulted in greater annual savings for the government compared to sales proceeds. Operating costs were reduced by $274 million in FY2010, four times more than the net sales proceeds that year. The government faces challenges with underutilized and vacant properties due to lack of funding for repairs, leading to repair backlogs exceeding $1 billion. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) could be a solution, where non-federal entities provide capital for renovations in exchange for a share of revenue generated. Some agencies, like the Department of Veterans Affairs, have the authority to enter into specific types of PPPs. Expanding PPP authorities could pose risks to the government as many agencies lack expertise to negotiate contracts effectively, potentially leading to agreements not in the government's best interest."
