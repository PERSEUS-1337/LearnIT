    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The California Achieving a Better Life Experience Act aims to support individuals with disabilities in saving for the future to achieve greater independence. It incorporates Section 529A of the Internal Revenue Code for qualified ABLE programs, with modifications to certain provisions. Section 4877 creates the California ABLE Program Trust as an instrumentality of the State of California with the board having the power and authority to sue and be sued. The California ABLE Program Trust has the power to sue and be sued, enter contracts, accept grants, and establish ABLE accounts for eligible individuals. They can also invest funds, adopt a corporate seal, and cover administrative costs. The California ABLE Program Trust has the power to carry out duties and obligations under the ABLE program trust, including advising beneficiaries on qualified disability expenses and participating in governmental programs. The California ABLE Program Trust has the authority to impose fees, set investment levels, administer funds, and procure insurance for protection. The Treasurer appoints an executive director for the board, who can enter contracts and manage operations. The board segregates funds into program and administrative funds, with the program fund continuously appropriated for ABLE Act Board purposes. The administrative fund for the ABLE Act Board is available for administration, with costs capped at 3% of incoming funds for the first five years and 1% thereafter. Startup and administrative costs are covered by a loan from the General Fund, to be repaid within five years with interest. The investment manager must provide a monthly report on investment performance, including details such as types of investments, maturity dates, amounts invested, weighted average maturity, market value, and compliance with the investment policy. The board annually prepares and adopts a written statement of investment policy for the program fund. Moneys in the fund may be invested by the Treasurer or under contract with an investment manager. Transfers can be made to the administrative fund for operating costs associated with administering the ABLE program trust. (f) Moneys from designated beneficiaries for ABLE accounts are deposited into the program fund, invested separately, and can be used for qualified disability expenses. The board maintains separate accounting for each beneficiary. (g) Beneficiaries can direct investments in their accounts twice a year. The trust assets must be used solely for trust purposes and held for designated beneficiaries. Moneys in ABLE accounts, up to $100,000, are exempt from means-tested program eligibility. The board will adopt regulations to implement the program in accordance with federal tax-exempt benefits criteria. Emergency regulations may be adopted for immediate public welfare. The program will be marketed to California residents if funds are available. SEC. 9. This act is contingent on the enactment of Senate Bill 324 by January 1, 2016."
