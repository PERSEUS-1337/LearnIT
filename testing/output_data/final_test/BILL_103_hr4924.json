The Congress finds that the world's rhinoceros population has declined by 90% since 1970, all tiger subspecies are threatened with extinction, and both rhinoceros and tiger species are listed as endangered under various conservation acts and agreements. The government aims to destroy stockpiles of rhinoceros horn and pressure countries allowing trade in rhinoceros products.
