    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Legislature acknowledges the importance of park access and outdoor recreational experiences for the health and well-being of California citizens. Many communities lack equitable access to parks, leading to higher incidences of health issues in low-income areas. Improving access to parks and outdoor activities, especially for youth in disadvantaged communities, can result in healthier lifestyles and better educational outcomes. The Legislature established the Outdoor Environmental Education Program in 2003 to study the benefits for at-risk youth and underserved groups. The program improved science test scores by 27%, enhanced conflict resolution skills, self-esteem, and motivation to learn. Another resolution in 2006 was enacted. The Legislature enacted Resolution Chapter 101 of the Statutes of 2006 to recognize the importance of local recreational and park agencies in promoting health among Californians. The intent is to expand access to parks and outdoor educational opportunities in underserved areas through strategic partnerships. Chapter 14 was added to Division 5 of the Public Resources Code to establish the Outdoor Environmental Education and Recreation Grants Program. The department director will establish an Outdoor Environmental Education and Recreation Grants Program by March 30, 2016, to increase access for underserved populations. Priority will be given to urban and rural areas with limited participation in outdoor programs. An advisory task force may be developed. The director may establish an advisory task force comprised of various entities to assist in developing the grant program. Priority for funding will be given to outdoor environmental education programs serving students in need, with attributes like partnerships, promoting healthy lifestyles, and maximizing outdoor experiences. The grant program prioritizes outdoor environmental education programs that serve students in need and maximize the number of participants served. It also requires a curriculum aligned with state science standards, fosters stewardship of the environment, integrates STEM instruction, and includes service learning and community outreach components. The California Clean Water, Clean Air, Safe Neighborhood Parks, and Coastal Protection Act of 2002 allows for the appropriation of funds for specific programs meeting certain criteria. The director of the program can also accept private donations to supplement the costs from various sources like foundations, corporate funding, and crowdfunding. All funds received for the program will be deposited into the California Youth Outdoor Education Account within the State Park and Recreation Fund. These funds are continuously appropriated to the department for the program's purposes. The department shall gather information from applicants each award year to evaluate outdoor environmental education programs. An annual report will be submitted to the Legislature with details on children served, grant recipients, partnerships, and recommendations for program improvement. The report will also include the total number of applications received and the potential impact if all applicants were awarded grants. The director will develop a grant program with the State Department of Education to provide outdoor educational opportunities to children in collaboration with various organizations and agencies. Applicant entities must provide a 25% matching contribution in community resources, which can include money, gifts, volunteer services, and more. The department may waive the matching requirement in cases of hardship. Additional consideration will be given to entities collaborating with school districts, faith-based groups, and others to reach urbanized youth in need of recreational activities. The department prioritizes providing increased access for elementary school-age children to park properties, with a focus on science curriculum, serving low-income families, and reaching underserved children for environmental education. Applicants for grants must collaborate to develop environmental education partnerships and work with local educational agencies to reach children lacking outdoor education opportunities. Grants range from $20,000 to $200,000 and can be used for staffing, training, transportation, and medical insurance for participants if required. Operational costs, including rental equipment, food, and supplies, must be covered by the grant. Administrative costs should not exceed 7.5% of the grant amount. The department may collect information on program effectiveness and report to legislative committees on children served, educational goals achieved, and demand levels. Applicant agencies can contract with other public entities to provide interpretive skills and curriculum-based programs in conservancy properties or park systems. This allows for the provision of programming services and educational activities to enhance cultural traditions."
