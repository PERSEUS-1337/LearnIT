    "content": "The Act titled \"Preserving Access to Life-Saving Medications Act of 2011\" amends Section 506C of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act regarding the discontinuance or interruption of the manufacture of a prescription drug. In this section, definitions are provided for terms such as 'average historic demand', 'discontinuance', and 'interruption' related to the manufacture of prescription drugs. Manufacturers of drugs subject to section 503(b)(1) must notify the Secretary of any discontinuance or interruption in drug production, including planned discontinuances, at least 6 months in advance. This notification requirement applies to factors like changes in manufacturing processes, business decisions affecting drug production, or any other changes that could impact drug availability. Manufacturers must notify the Secretary of any discontinuance or interruption in drug production at least 6 months in advance, or as soon as practicable if advance notice is not possible. This requirement applies to changes that could affect drug availability. Manufacturers can provide additional information in the notification about alternative drug sources or availability of drugs with the same active ingredient. The notification period can be reduced if the manufacturer certifies good cause, such as a public health problem or biomaterial shortage. Manufacturers may face liability issues, economic hardship, or bankruptcy if they continue manufacturing for a 6-month period. The notification period required by the Secretary can be reduced based on the type of discontinuance or interruption. Manufacturers must submit a notification to the Secretary regarding any discontinuance or interruption, with penalties for failure to comply. Information provided is confidential, and penalties for violations can reach up to $10,000 per day and $1,800,000 for all violations in a single proceeding. The Secretary must establish civil monetary penalties for violations related to drug shortages within 180 days of the enactment of the Preserving Access to Life-Saving Medications Act of 2011. Penalties will be enforced in a similar manner as other civil penalties under section 303(f). The term 'drug shortage' refers to a period when the available supply of a drug does not meet the demand as determined by the Secretary. The Secretary is required to publish information on drug discontinuances, interruptions, and actual shortages on the FDA website. The Secretary must distribute information on drug shortages to healthcare providers and patient organizations, including the expected duration of any discontinuance or interruption. If a drug is deemed vulnerable to a shortage, the manufacturer must be notified by the Secretary. The Secretary must collaborate to improve continuity of supply plans for drugs vulnerable to shortage based on evidence-based criteria including the number of manufacturers, sources of raw materials, supply chain characteristics, and availability of alternatives. The Secretary collaborates with stakeholders to establish and enhance continuity of supply plans for drugs vulnerable to shortage, without the authority to compel manufacturers to produce or delay discontinuances. The Secretary collaborates with stakeholders to establish and enhance continuity of supply plans for drugs vulnerable to shortage. Manufacturers are allowed to allocate distribution of products to manage drug shortages without penalty. Section 506C of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act applies to discontinuances, interruptions, and shortages occurring one year after the enactment of the Act. The provisions of section 506C of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act will continue to apply until a specified day. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to submit reports to Congress regarding actions taken to address drug shortages in the prescription drug supply chain. Additionally, a GAO study is mandated. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study to examine how the FDA identifies and responds to drug shortages, analyze possible causes, assess communication between industry stakeholders, and evaluate the impact of the Act on FDA's ability to address shortages. The Comptroller General will conduct a study to examine FDA's response to drug shortages, analyze causes, assess communication, and evaluate the Act's impact. A report will be submitted to Congress within 1 year of the Act's enactment."
