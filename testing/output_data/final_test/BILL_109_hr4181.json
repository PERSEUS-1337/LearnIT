The Act is titled the \"Rocky Flats Minerals Acquisition Act\" and aims to acquire mineral rights associated with the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site in Colorado to enhance its management as a national wildlife refuge and reduce the Department of Energy's long-term responsibilities. The Act aims to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to acquire mineral and other rights related to the Rocky Flats site to enhance its management as a national wildlife refuge. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"mineral rights\" as the rights of parties other than the United States to minerals within the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge, \"fair market value\" as determined by an independent mineral appraiser, and \"natural resource damage liability claim\" as a claim under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act arising from hazardous substances releases at Rocky Flats. The curr_chunk discusses the definitions of terms related to Rocky Flats, such as the Secretary of Energy, Trustees, Rocky Flats facility in Colorado, and Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge. These terms are important in the context of hazardous substances releases at Rocky Flats. The term \"Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge\" is defined in the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge Act. The Secretary may purchase mineral rights if the owner is willing and at fair market value. Consultation with the Secretary of the Interior is required to prioritize purchases. Mineral rights bought under this Act are retained by the United States. Funding and release from liability are addressed in Section 4. The Secretary may use appropriated funds to purchase mineral rights under this Act. Any natural resource damage liability claim can be satisfied by the purchase of mineral rights or payment to Trustees. The Secretary can make a payment to the Trustees for the difference between $10,000,000 and the amount paid under subparagraph (A). The funds received by the Trustees must be used for purchasing additional mineral rights and developing habitat restoration projects at Rocky Flats, with expenditures made jointly by the Trustees. The Trustees may use additional funds received in conjunction with other private and public funds for purchasing mineral rights and developing habitat restoration projects at Rocky Flats. SEC. 5 states that administrative jurisdiction over lands in Rocky Flats with active mineral development will remain with the Secretary until mining ends and lands are reclaimed. SEC. 6 grants additional authority to acquire mineral interests. The Secretary of the Interior may acquire mineral interests in Rocky Flats through purchase, exchange, or issuance of credits. The Secretary of the Interior can acquire mineral interests in Rocky Flats by purchasing, exchanging, or issuing credits, which are legal instruments or documentation that can be used instead of monetary payments for lease sales or royalties on oil and gas production on the Outer Continental Shelf. The Secretary of the Interior can acquire mineral interests in Rocky Flats through the issuance of transferable credits that expire after 10 years and can be freely transferred to other parties. The requirement for lands or interests exchanged to be in the same state does not apply to Rocky Flats. The United States can acquire land or interests in Rocky Flats through an exchange, with limitations on disposal of public land not identified as suitable for disposal. Lands outside the exterior boundaries of Rocky Flats cannot be acquired by the Federal Government. The Federal Government can acquire land or interests in Rocky Flats, managed by the Secretary of the Interior under specific standards. No minerals acquired can be developed or disposed of by the United States or any other party. These authorities are additional to existing ones for acquiring non-Federal interests within Rocky Flats. No acquisition of mineral rights under this Act will be considered a major Federal action affecting the environment under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969."
