The Act \"Maternal Motor Vehicle Crash Safety Act of 2006\" defines key terms such as Administrator, appropriate congressional committees, biofidelic, and data linkage system. The Act \"Maternal Motor Vehicle Crash Safety Act of 2006\" defines an information system capable of tracking adverse health effects and birth outcomes for pregnant women involved in a crash and their unborn children through data analysis. The term \"unborn child\" refers to a member of the species homo sapiens at any stage of development in the womb. SEC. 3. FINDINGS. Congress finds that injuries are the leading cause of pregnancy-associated deaths in the United States, with motor vehicle crashes being the primary cause of injury deaths in women of reproductive age and injury hospitalizations among pregnant women. Studies show that up to 80 percent of injury-related deaths among unborn children are due to motor vehicle accidents, surpassing other fatal childhood injuries such as bicycle-related deaths and firearm-related deaths. Studies have shown that pregnant women involved in motor vehicle crashes face risks such as premature childbirth, low birth weight, placental injury, uterine rupture, and amniotic rupture. Despite advancements in vehicle safety, pregnant women have not received adequate attention to understand and prevent these risks. More research and application are needed in this area. During pregnancy, understanding the risks of traumatic injury to both the woman and her unborn child is crucial. Research using anthropometric test devices and computerized modeling systems representing pregnant women at all stages of pregnancy is needed to improve maternal and child health outcomes, especially in motor vehicle crashes. Despite the importance of maternal and fetal health in motor vehicle crashes, data systems often fail to track pregnancy status and outcomes for unborn children involved in these incidents. The effects of vehicle crashes on long-term neuro-developmental and functional outcomes for unborn children are often not tracked. Congress emphasizes the importance of including data on motor vehicle crashes involving pregnant women in the National Automotive Sampling System Crashworthiness Data System. They also urge the Administrator to find ways to improve understanding of these crashes through data collection and analysis systems. Additionally, grants are available for programs related to data linkage systems. The Administrator will provide grants and incentives to eligible entities for developing data linkage systems. Eligible entities include academic, public health, transportation safety organizations, and state or local government agencies. Applications for grants must be submitted to the Administrator as per the specified guidelines. The Administrator will establish criteria and a competitive process for awarding grants under this Act. Data linkage systems eligible for assistance must use state and local vital statistics databases. The Administrator will integrate the grant program with existing State Crash Outcome Data Evaluation Systems to improve tracking of adverse health effects and birth outcomes for pregnant women involved in motor vehicle crashes. The Administrator will ensure data security and privacy for occupants of motor vehicles involved in crashes and their unborn children by handling personal identifiers and information in compliance with laws. $2,500,000 is authorized annually for fiscal years 2007-2010 for this section. Funds appropriated for data security and privacy in motor vehicle crashes will remain available until expended. SEC. 6. SAFETY RESEARCH PROGRAM AND NATIONAL CONFERENCE. The Administrator conducts a research program to promote the health and safety of pregnant women involved in motor vehicle crashes and their unborn children. High priority research areas include investigating methods to enhance the performance of safety belts for pregnant women and analyzing technologies to improve safety across different pregnancy stages. The Administrator conducts research to enhance safety for pregnant women in motor vehicle crashes and their unborn children. This includes developing test devices and computer models representative of pregnant women at all stages of pregnancy to understand crash forces. A national conference will be convened within 18 months to discuss these research efforts. The Administrator will convene a national research conference to identify critical scientific issues for research on the safety of pregnant women in motor vehicle crashes and their unborn children. The purpose is to establish and prioritize research questions for future studies, with the authority to partner with relevant organizations. The Administrator will submit a report to congressional committees within 2 years, detailing the research program, findings, priorities established at a national conference, and plans for future regulations or programs. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2007-2009 to support this section. Funds appropriated for this section shall remain available until expended. SEC. 7. PUBLIC OUTREACH AND EDUCATION. The Administrator is required to conduct a public outreach and education program to raise awareness of safety risks for pregnant women in motor vehicle crashes and ways to reduce these risks, including promoting proper safety belt and airbag use. The program will utilize media and organizational partners to educate pregnant women effectively and efficiently utilize resources. The program must be initiated within 12 months of the enactment of the Act. The Administrator must conduct a public outreach program to raise awareness of safety risks for pregnant women in motor vehicle crashes. The program must be initiated within 12 months of the Act's enactment and maintained for at least 24 months, contingent on funding availability. SEC. 8. INCLUSION OF SAFETY DATA IN ANNUAL ASSESSMENT. The Administrator must include data on the safety of pregnant women and their unborn children in the Annual Assessment of Motor Vehicle Crashes. If this is not feasible, a report must be submitted to Congress explaining the reasons why. The Administrator must provide data on the safety of pregnant women and their unborn children in the Annual Assessment of Motor Vehicle Crashes. If not possible, a report must be submitted to Congress explaining the reasons and steps needed to make the information available in the future."
