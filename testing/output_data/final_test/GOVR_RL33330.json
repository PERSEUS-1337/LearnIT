    "content": "The CDBG program, administered by HUD, provides financial assistance for neighborhood revitalization, housing rehabilitation, and economic development. Grants are allocated to over 1,100 communities, states, and territories for local officials to address housing, public services, and infrastructure needs. Local and state officials have discretion in choosing eligible activities to undertake. The CDBG program allows local officials to choose from 25 categories of eligible activities for community development plans. Activities include historic preservation, economic development, housing assistance, and public service activities. Projects must address one of three national objectives: benefit low and moderate income persons, eliminate or prevent slums or blight, or meet urgent community development needs. The CDBG program allows for a variety of eligible activities for community development plans, including historic preservation, economic development, housing assistance, and public service activities. Projects must address one of three national objectives: benefit low and moderate income persons, eliminate or prevent slums or blight, or meet urgent community development needs. CDBG funds can be used to assist in disaster response activities, with 70% of funds allocated to benefit low- and moderate-income persons. HUD has waived this provision in the past to address urgent threats to resident safety, and the program has been frequently used for disaster recovery efforts. HUD provides assistance to communities and states affected by presidentially declared disasters through the reprogramming of CDBG funds for disaster-related needs. This includes short-term relief, mitigation, and long-term recovery activities. Grant awards may be expedited for affected communities, allowing them to adjust their CDBG program start dates. CDBG funds have been used to fill gaps in FEMA and SBA emergency relief activities, supporting activities not reimbursable by these agencies. CDBG funds are used for disaster-related needs such as debris removal, security patrols, and utility restoration. Mitigation activities aim to reduce disaster impact through measures like levee construction and public awareness programs. Additionally, CDBG funds have been used for permanent utility restoration and infrastructure improvements. CDBG funds are utilized for disaster-related needs and mitigation activities, including buyouts of real property in flood-prone areas and levee construction to reduce vulnerability to future disasters. Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress allocated $2 billion for disaster relief and recovery assistance to New York under P.L. 107-117. This included $500 million for economic losses to individuals, businesses, and nonprofit organizations to mitigate the attack's economic impact. HUD was required to implement the program within 45 days, limiting economic loss grants to small businesses to $500,000. Additionally, $10 million was earmarked for the tourism and travel industry. CDBG assistance also covered long-term recovery efforts, such as helping businesses and residents affected by disasters and attracting new businesses to the area. Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress allocated $3.5 billion in CDBG funds for the redevelopment of Lower Manhattan. This included $1.49 billion for recovery assistance, such as business recovery grants and residential grant assistance to encourage renters and owners to stay in the area. Following the 9/11 attacks, Congress allocated $3.5 billion in CDBG funds for Lower Manhattan redevelopment. Residential grants covered up to 30% of housing costs, with additional funds for utility restoration. Congress included provisions for relief efforts, waivers, and accountability in past disaster relief appropriations. The Secretary of HUD has authority to waive program requirements, except for nondiscrimination, environmental review, labor standards, and fair housing. The CDBG program's authorizing legislation allows the Secretary to suspend certain requirements for disaster relief funding, with exceptions for public notice, nondiscrimination, fair housing, labor, and environmental standards. Congress has previously waived income targeting provisions during disasters like the Midwest floods of 1998 and the Gulf Coast hurricanes of 2005. During disasters like the 1992 Los Angeles riots, Congress increased the ceiling on CDBG funds for public service activities. Grantees in disaster areas can request waivers for certain provisions, such as extending deadlines for reports and changing income-targeting requirements. They may also seek waivers for restrictions on using funds for new housing construction or building repairs. The HUD has been required to publish waivers or suspensions of CDBG fund regulations in advance. Congress has allowed the transfer of CDBG funds to other programs in past disaster relief acts, such as transferring funds to the HOME Investment Partnership program after the Northridge earthquake. Additionally, Congress has transferred administrative authority over CDBG funds for land buyouts from HUD to FEMA in certain disaster mitigation strategies. Congress has included language in disaster relief appropriations requiring communities to provide a financial match for CDBG-funded disaster relief assistance. States have been required to provide matching funds ranging from 10% to 25% for different disasters. Additionally, statutory provisions allow states and local governments to use their annual CDBG allocations to meet matching fund requirements of other federal programs. Recently, Congress included language in appropriations prohibiting states and local governments from using CDBG disaster-relief funds to meet matching fund requirements of other federal programs. Past appropriations acts have also required quarterly reports on fund expenditure for oversight and accountability. Legislation for disaster relief assistance included provisions for HUD and FEMA to submit quarterly reports on CDBG fund use. President Obama signed the Supplemental Appropriations Act for FY2010, P.L. 111-212 on July 29, 2010, which allocated $100 million in CDBG supplemental funds for disaster recovery activities in areas affected by severe storms and flooding from March 2010 to May 2010. The legislation limits the assistance to states where the entire state or at least 20 counties have been declared presidential disaster areas. This act aims to distribute CDBG disaster recovery funds effectively. The Supplemental Appropriations Act for FY2010, P.L. 111-212 allocated $100 million in CDBG disaster recovery funds to states affected by severe storms and flooding. The act limits assistance to Rhode Island, Kentucky, Nebraska, and Tennessee. Grantees can use up to 5% of funds for administrative costs, meet matching fund requirements, and receive waivers for certain CDBG program regulations. The Senate passed H.J.Res. 66 for an additional $100 million in CDBG disaster assistance. The House-passed version of H.J.Res. 66 did not include provisions appropriating supplemental CDBG disaster funds. It would have directed HUD to allocate funds to states and local governments, allowed funds to be used for matching fund requirements, administrative costs, and granted waivers for program requirements. Congress allocated $400 million in supplemental CDBG assistance in response to disasters in 2011. HUD distributed the funds to 17 grantees in eight states for housing, infrastructure, and economic recovery. Administrative expenses are capped at 5%, and grantees must submit detailed disaster recovery plans to HUD before using the funds. The CDBG program allows for waivers of program requirements for disaster recovery efforts, with a focus on fair housing, nondiscrimination, labor standards, and environmental review. It provides flexibility for communities and states to undertake short-term relief, mitigation, and long-term recovery activities. The funds have supported disaster recovery efforts across multiple states and urban areas. Congress is considering legislative proposals for financing long-term disaster recovery efforts through the CDBG program. Key policy questions include determining the appropriate level of CDBG assistance, control of funds by communities or states, matching fund requirements, and compliance measures for recipients."
