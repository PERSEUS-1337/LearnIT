The \"Job Creation through Energy Efficient Manufacturing Act\" aims to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies in manufacturing and industrial facilities in the US through a Financing Energy Efficient Manufacturing Program. This program will provide financial support to reduce upfront expenses for businesses to invest in energy efficiency measures, clean energy systems, smart grid systems, and alternative vehicle fleets. The \"Job Creation through Energy Efficient Manufacturing Act\" aims to help building owners invest in energy-saving measures, reducing costs and creating short-term savings. This can also allow industrial businesses to defer capital expenditures, hire new workers, and improve property value, comfort, and sustainability. The \"Job Creation through Energy Efficient Manufacturing Act\" defines key terms such as \"covered program\" and \"Secretary\" and includes provisions for financing energy efficient manufacturing programs. The Secretary will establish the \"Financing Energy Efficient Manufacturing Program\" to provide grants to States for covered programs. States can apply for grants to expand these programs, which will be evaluated based on their potential to increase investment and energy savings in retrofit projects. The Secretary will consult with States and stakeholders to identify financing opportunities for manufacturing and industrial businesses across multiple states. States receiving grants must prioritize programs that leverage private funding and aim to expand energy efficiency. The Davis-Bacon Compliance section of the Act mandates that laborers and mechanics on projects funded by the Act must be paid prevailing wages. The Secretary of Labor has the authority to enforce these labor standards. The Act requires states to submit reports on the performance of programs funded by grants, including data collection and sharing, within 2 years of receiving the grant. The Secretary must include collected data in the report and incorporate it into Department of Energy databases with protections for confidential business data. Authorization of $250,000,000 for this Act to be appropriated and used by State Energy Offices for developing State energy plans."
