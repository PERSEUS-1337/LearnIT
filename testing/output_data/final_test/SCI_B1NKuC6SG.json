    "content": "Language style transfer involves transferring the content of a source sentence to a target style without parallel training data. An encoder-decoder framework is proposed in this paper, where each sentence is encoded into content and style representations. By combining the content with the target style, a sentence aligned in the target domain can be decoded. Two loss functions, style discrepancy and cycle consistency, are used to constrain the encoding and decoding functions. The effectiveness of the approach is validated. Style transfer in natural language involves migrating the content of a sentence from one style to another without parallel data. A proposed model demonstrates effectiveness in sentiment modification of restaurant reviews and dialog response revision with a romantic style. This approach utilizes deep neural networks to achieve style transfer of text, such as converting language to Shakespearean or rewriting product reviews with a preferred sentiment. Style transfer in natural language involves migrating the content of a sentence from one style to another without parallel data. Recent approaches have been proposed for style transfer with non-parallel data, focusing on learning a latent representation of the content disentangled from the source style. These approaches assume data have only two styles, but in practical settings, sentences may be in more than two styles. In practical settings, sentences can be in multiple styles, not just two. For example, reviews can be neutral or have fine-grained negative sentiments like anger or sadness. A chatbot with a consistent persona can use a framework that combines human dialog data with a language style transfer model for coherent responses. In this paper, the challenge of language style transfer is addressed, where the source data can have various styles. The goal is to transfer the sentence's style while preserving its original content. Previous approaches aligned the latent content spaces of source and target domains or inferred the original content from the transferred sentence. In this work, an encoder-decoder framework is developed to transfer sentences from a source domain to a target domain with different language styles. The training data is non-parallel, and sentences in the source domain can have various styles while those in the target domain have a consensus style. Each sentence is encoded into two latent representations, one for content and the other for style. The goal is to ensure that the style representation of a source sentence aligns with the target style representation. The study introduces a model for transferring sentence styles, focusing on consistency between source and target styles. A cycle consistency loss is used to prevent content changes. Evaluation is done on sentiment modification and dialog response tasks. Previous approaches mainly focus on visual data, while BID7 disentangles content from image attributes. In our work, we introduce a model for transferring sentence styles using cycle consistency to maintain content. Previous approaches have focused on visual data, while our approach addresses the non-parallel data problem in language style transfer. Several methods have been proposed for language style transfer, including BID14 which revised the latent representation of a sentence guided by a classifier, BID1 which encoded textual property values with embedding vectors, BID4 which used a variational auto-encoder to disentangle content and style, and BID17 which considered transferring between two styles simultaneously using adversarial training. In the Professor-Forcing framework BID8, the goal is to align sentences generated in one style to the data domain of another style. The model adopts adversarial training but cannot align data from the target domain to the source domain. The problem formulation involves two data domains, one with various language styles (X1) and one with the same language style (X2). The task is to design a model that can learn from non-parallel training data to transfer sentences from X1 to their counterparts in X2. The model aims to transfer sentences from one style (X1) to another style (X2) by decomposing each sentence into style and content representations. The encoding module uses functions to obtain these representations, allowing for style transfer between different domains. The model utilizes a function g(x) to encode style representation, learning shared style representation y and parameters in g(x) jointly. A reconstruction loss is employed in the decoding module using a probabilistic generator G, with an adversarial loss introduced for style transfer using non-parallel training data. The goal is to enable style transfer between different domains by distinguishing between different style representations. The discriminator D aims to differentiate between different outputs of the generator G, while the generator aims to confuse the discriminator. The approach involves using a continuous approximation for gradient propagation during adversarial training over discrete sentences. This includes averaging word embeddings using a multinomial distribution and a temperature parameter. The framework used is similar to Professor-Forcing, matching sequences of output words. The framework follows Professor-Forcing BID8, matching sequences of output words using a discriminator D. One sequence is teacher-forced by ground-truth samples, while the other has inputs self-generated by previous approximations. However, the framework is under-constrained, allowing arbitrary values for minimizing losses, potentially affecting the representation of content and style. The framework, inspired by Professor-Forcing, uses a discriminator to match output sequences. However, it is under-constrained, leading to issues with content and style representation. To address this, a style discrepancy loss and cycle consistency loss are proposed to ensure content preservation and style alignment. The framework introduces a style discrepancy loss to align style representations with target styles, ensuring content preservation and style consistency. This loss function incorporates a probability density function to measure the discrepancy between style representations and target styles. The framework introduces a style discrepancy loss to align style representations with target styles, ensuring content preservation and style consistency. This loss function incorporates a probability density function to measure the discrepancy between style representations and target styles. The generator should preserve the content of the original sentence and have the capacity to recover the original sentence in a cyclic manner. The model combines content from an encoded sentence with its original style for decoding, aiming to generate the original sentence with high probability. Additionally, it computes cycle consistency loss for regularization by transferring a sample sentence into a different style and ensuring it can be decoded back to the original sentence. The full model includes a style discrepancy loss and cycle consistency loss for alignment and preservation of content and style. The model's full loss function includes parameters balancing different parts, with a training objective involving an encoder, generator, and discriminator. The encoder and style encoder are implemented using RNN and CNN, respectively. The generator takes content and style representations as input. The discriminator and pre-trained discriminator are CNNs. Raw data is from the Yelp Dataset Challenge Round 10, consisting of restaurant reviews categorized based on star ratings. The text discusses the process of selecting and processing data for positive, negative, and neutral reviews from the Yelp Dataset Challenge Round 10. The data is categorized based on star ratings, with positive and negative reviews sourced from BID17 and neutral reviews filtered and sampled separately. The datasets are constructed with multiple styles, including Positive+Negative (Pos+Neg) and Neutral+Negative (Neu+Neg).

Chat data is sourced from a real Chinese dialog dataset with personalized language styles. Romantic sentences are collected from online novel websites and filtered by human annotators. The dataset includes romantic dialog sentences collected from online novel websites and filtered by human annotators. The model is implemented using Tensorflow with GRU as the encoder and generation cells in an encoder-decoder framework. Dropout is applied in GRUs with a probability of 0.5. The word embedding, content representation, and style representation dimensions are set to 200, 1000, and 500 respectively. The style encoder follows a CNN architecture with specific filter sizes and feature maps. The model D s is pre-trained with high testing accuracy for Yelp and Chat datasets. Balancing parameters are set, and the model is trained using the Adam optimizer. Pre-trained word embeddings are used for training the classifier. Comparison with the state-of-the-art language style transfer model is conducted. The STB model is built on an auto-encoder framework for transferring sentences between different styles. It aligns content spaces of source and target domains using adversarial training methods. The model's modules include encoder, decoder, and discriminator, with a model-based evaluation metric used for classification. Evaluation classifier testing accuracy is 95.36% for Yelp and 87.05% for Chat datasets. Training is repeated three times for each experiment setting. The STB model achieves high accuracy in classifier testing for Yelp and Chat datasets. Experiments show that incorporating cycle consistency loss improves performance for both STB and the proposed model. The full model can generate grammatically correct positive reviews without altering the original content better than other methods. Our full model outperforms other methods in generating grammatically correct positive reviews without altering the original content. However, some mistakes are still present, such as adding additional information not in the original sentence. Our model outperforms STB and our proposed method in TAB0. As the number of positive sentences in the source data increases, the performance of STB decreases drastically due to alignment issues. In contrast, our model remains stable even with more positive samples, showing less sensitivity to multiple sentiments. Our model with cycle consistency loss performs the best. The setting can be made more challenging by using a pre-trained discriminator to filter out highly probable positive samples. Our model outperforms STB and our proposed method in TAB0 by remaining stable even with more positive samples. When testing our second dataset with neutral and negative reviews, our model utilizes all data with styles similar to the target style. Experimental results show that STB suffers a performance drop with neutral data mixed in the source domain, while our model remains stable. In real applications, target data is limited to simulate scenarios with small amounts of data. Experimental results show that our model outperforms STB (with Cyc) in all cases, achieving better performance and stability even with 10k target samples. Our model achieves better performance and robustness on Chat compared to STB (with Cyc) in all cases. Examples show successful transfer of sentences into a romantic style with some romantic phrases used. The encoder-decoder framework for language style transfer allows for the use of non-parallel data and source data with various unknown language styles. It encodes sentences into latent representations for content and style, enabling the generation of sentences aligned in the target domain. Two loss functions, style discrepancy and cycle consistency, constrain the encoding and decoding functions to ensure proper style representation and the ability to transfer sentences back to their original form. Our proposed method for style transfer outperforms the state-of-the-art method BID17. Human evaluations on 200 Yelp samples rated content preservation, sentiment consistency, fluency, and overall quality. Five annotators provided ratings which were averaged for evaluation. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art method BID17 in sentiment accuracy and overall quality on Yelp data. We experiment on revising modern text in the language of Shakespeare using a small dataset. The model achieves a classification accuracy of 95.1% and STB with cycle consistency loss achieves 94.1%. Both models tend to generate short sentences and change the content of source sentences more in this experiment due to the scarcity of training data. Shakespeare's style vocabulary has 8559 words, with 60% appearing less than 10 times, while the source domain has 19962 words with only 5211 common words. The source domain has 19962 words, with only 5211 common words with Shakespeare's style vocabulary. Thus, aligned words/phrases may not exist in the dataset."
