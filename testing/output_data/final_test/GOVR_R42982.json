    "content": "On August 24, 2016, Colombian government negotiators and the FARC signed a final peace agreement in Havana, Cuba after almost four years of peace talks. The FARC delegates unanimously supported the agreement at their National Guerrilla Conference on September 17, 2016. Colombian President Santos and FARC leader Timochenko signed the final agreement in Cartagena on September 26, 2016. A peace plebiscite vote on October 2, 2016, narrowly rejected the agreement. On October 7, 2016, President Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to end the 50-year civil war in Colombia. A revised peace accord was reached on November 12, 2016, and ratified by the Colombian Congress on November 30, 2016. The Constitutional Court approved a fast-track mechanism for implementation on December 13, 2016, followed by unanimous approval of a law by the Congress on December 28, 2016. On December 28, 2016, the Colombian Congress unanimously approved a law benefiting rank-and-file FARC, a precondition for their demobilization process in concentration zones. Colombia's history of political violence stems from the late 19th century, with leftist groups forming guerrilla organizations in the 1960s due to rural neglect and poverty. The civil conflict between these groups and the government has persisted for over 50 years. Colombia has a history of political violence dating back to the late 19th century, with leftist groups like FARC and ELN engaging in terrorist attacks, kidnapping, and extortion. Right-wing paramilitaries, such as the AUC, emerged in the 1980s to combat the guerrillas. The country's involvement in the drug trade has fueled the conflict by funding both sides. The shift of cocaine production from Peru and Bolivia to Colombia in the 1980s increased drug violence and funded both left-wing and right-wing armed groups. By the late 1990s, the FARC, ELN, and AUC were deeply involved in the drug trade, leading to their designation as Foreign Terrorist Organizations by the U.S. government. The armed conflict in Colombia has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths, over 25,000 missing persons, and more than 6 million displaced individuals, creating a humanitarian crisis that disproportionately affects certain groups. The FARC's use of land mines has caused over 11,000 deaths and injuries since 1990, making Colombia's casualty rate second only to Afghanistan. The FARC, originally a rural peasant movement, grew into the armed wing of the Colombian Communist Party dedicated to rural insurgency and social equality. This has led to a humanitarian crisis disproportionately affecting women, Afro-Colombians, and indigenous populations, leaving many dispossessed and impoverished. The FARC, initially focused on social equality, expanded through criminal activities like drug trafficking and violence against Colombian targets. By the early 2000s, they controlled a significant portion of Colombia's cocaine trade. The FARC attempted to enter politics through the Patriotic Union (UP) party but were targeted for assassination, leading to the UP's demise. They later withdrew from politics to focus on military efforts. President Pastrana granted a demilitarized zone for negotiations, which the FARC used to regroup and re-arm. President Pastrana granted a demilitarized zone for FARC negotiations, but they used it to regroup and re-arm. He then initiated Plan Colombia to end armed conflict, drug trafficking, and promote development. The US Congress approved $1.3 billion for counternarcotics efforts in Colombia and neighboring countries. In the late 1990s, the Colombian government faced collapse due to the drug-fueled FARC insurgency. The FARC controlled up to 40% of Colombian territory, with no state presence in 16% of municipalities. By 2002, disillusionment with peace negotiations led to the FARC's peak size and power, with 16,000-20,000 fighters. President Uribe, elected in 2002, implemented a \"democratic security\" policy to combat FARC and ELN, making citizen security a priority. His administration saw notable security gains and economic stability, although criticized by human rights organizations. Plan Patriota, launched in late 2003, aimed to assert state control over national territory. The Uribe Administration launched Plan Patriota, a U.S.-supported offensive against FARC guerrilla forces in rural southern Colombia. The campaign deployed 18,000 troops to retake FARC-held territory, reducing their ranks and seizing cocaine processing equipment. However, critics highlight the displacement of civilians and the lack of a strategy to maintain control of the reclaimed land. Despite these challenges, progress was made in weakening the FARC during President Uribe's second term. In 2008, significant progress was made in weakening the FARC guerrilla group. The Colombian military bombed the camp of FARC's second in command, killing him and 25 others, sparking controversy. The FARC's supreme leader died of a heart attack, and another member of the ruling secretariat was murdered. Additionally, the Colombian government rescued 15 long-time FARC hostages in July 2008. In July 2008, the Colombian government rescued 15 FARC hostages, including three U.S. defense contractors and French Colombian presidential candidate Ingrid Bentancourt. President Juan Manuel Santos continued aggressive security policies, leading to the killing of FARC leaders \"Mono Jojoy\" in 2010 and Alfonso Cano in 2011. In 2011, the Colombian military killed FARC's top leader Alfonso Cano, who was replaced by Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o Echeverri (\"Timole\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez\" or \"Timochenko\"). The FARC announced a willingness to open a political dialogue with the government and released hostages in 2012. The FARC had around 8,000-9,000 fighters in 2012, mainly operating in remote rural areas along the jungle borders with Venezuela and Ecuador. In 2011, the Colombian military killed FARC's leader Alfonso Cano, who was replaced by Timochenko. The FARC announced willingness for political dialogue with the government and released hostages in 2012. By 2012, FARC and ELN had diversified income sources to cattle rustling, illegal logging, and gold mining. Despite military victories, there was a rise in rebel attacks on infrastructure, possibly to strengthen their position in peace talks. The Colombian government set criteria for peace talks with FARC in 2011 and early 2012, including hostage release, cease-fire, end to land mines, and halt in child soldier recruitment. Despite military gains, FARC's ability to adapt and threaten Colombia remained strong. President Santos shifted focus to dismantling FARC's key units in 2012, but a clear end-game was not apparent. Despite FARC's weakened state and the government's military superiority, an end-game was not clear. Observers debated whether negotiations were more favorable than continuing an unwinnable war. Some believed FARC could continue fighting for another 10-15 years if talks failed. The smaller ELN, inspired by Fidel Castro and Ch\u00e9 Guevara, was formed in 1965 with left-wing intellectuals, students, and Catholic radicals. The ELN, a left-wing insurgent group formed in 1965, has been ideologically motivated and funded itself through extortion and kidnapping. It has targeted the country's infrastructure, especially the oil and electricity sectors. Despite a reduction in size and strength since the 1990s, the ELN has periodically revived. The ELN, a left-wing insurgent group formed in 1965, has weakened due to government campaigns and clashes with the FARC. It is now based in the northeastern part of Colombia near the Venezuelan border. With fewer than 2,000 fighters, the ELN still carries out kidnappings and bombings. The group has engaged in peace discussions with the Colombian government, including talks during the Santos Administration. The ELN, a left-wing insurgent group in Colombia, expressed interest in joining peace talks with the government, separate from the FARC negotiations. The Santos Administration initiated preliminary talks with the ELN's leadership in June 2014, discussing a framework for formal negotiations. The ELN, a left-wing insurgent group in Colombia, is in discussions for separate peace talks with the government. Recent evidence suggests the ELN has increased its violence and formed alliances with criminal groups. This comes as the FARC has escalated attacks on infrastructure. The ELN is in discussions for peace talks with the government, but deadlines have been missed due to delays in releasing kidnap victims. Paramilitary groups formed in the 1980s to protect against FARC and ELN threats, later uniting under the AUC banner. The AUC, a paramilitary group in Colombia, engaged in violent activities against suspected insurgent supporters and battled with FARC and ELN. They funded themselves through drug trafficking and controlled a significant portion of cocaine production. In 2003, President Uribe made a peace deal with the AUC for demobilization, with amnesties proposed under the Justice and Peace Law. The AUC had between 8,000 to 20,000 members during demobilization in 2004. The demobilization of the AUC in Colombia officially ended in April 2006, with over 31,000 members surrendering and turning in 17,000 weapons. Despite some leaders remaining at large until August 2006, most complied with President Uribe's order to surrender. However, critics argue that the demobilization was partial and flawed, with concerns about lack of accountability for crimes and inadequate reparation for victims. Many former paramilitaries did not demobilize, and some who did have returned to criminal activities. The demobilization of the AUC in Colombia officially ended in April 2006, with over 31,000 members surrendering and turning in 17,000 weapons. Despite some leaders remaining at large until August 2006, most complied with President Uribe's order to surrender. However, critics argue that the demobilization was partial and flawed, with concerns about lack of accountability for crimes and inadequate reparation for victims. Many former paramilitaries did not demobilize, and some who did have reentered criminal life by joining smaller criminal organizations known as Bacrim. The Bacrim, considered the biggest security threat to Colombia today, engage in various violent crimes, including drug trafficking and political killings. They are seen as successors to the paramilitaries and are believed to be tolerated by corrupt officials, with slow prosecution of their crimes. The Bacrim both compete with and cooperate with the FARC and the ELN, with a presence in over a third of Colombia's municipalities. The Bacrim, responsible for 30% of human rights violations in Colombia, are primarily involved in drug trafficking, extortion, and violent crimes. Los Urabe\u00f1os emerged as the dominant Bacrim in 2013, with nearly 3,000 members by 2015. After the peace accord with the FARC, there may be a territorial reorganization of narco-paramilitary groups, with Bacrim vying for control of FARC drug and illegal mining businesses. In the 1990s, illegal armed groups and drug trafficking organizations threatened Colombia's police and justice system. President Pastrana recognized the need to strengthen Colombia's police and military to regain control over the territory, leading to a 60% growth in armed forces between 1998 and 2002. After failed negotiations with the FARC, President Uribe shifted focus to defeating the guerrillas. President Uribe's government focused on defeating the guerrillas through the \"democratic security policy,\" with initiatives like Plan Patriota in 2003. The Colombian military and police significantly increased in numbers and underwent reforms, with support from the United States under Plan Colombia. This assistance amounted to approximately 10% of Colombia's security expenditures between 2000 and 2009. Plan Colombia, initiated between 2000 and 2009, aimed to strengthen democratic institutions, combat drug trafficking and terrorism, promote human rights, and foster economic development in Colombia. The U.S. provided critical assistance, including funding for counternarcotics support, improved mobility for armed forces and police, and training in logistics and planning support. Since 2008, U.S. assistance under Plan Colombia has gradually declined as Colombia's security and development conditions improved. The National Consolidation Plan (PNC) launched in 2009 aimed to integrate security, development, and counternarcotics efforts by consolidating state presence in weakly governed areas. The PNC aimed to reestablish state control in strategic \"consolidation zones\" where illegal armed groups operate. The consolidation strategy in Colombia was reorganized under the Santos Administration, with peace negotiations with the FARC being the fourth attempt in 30 years. President Santos emphasized learning from past errors in negotiations with the guerrilla organization. President Betancur initiated peace talks with guerrillas in 1982, offering amnesty without disarmament. Negotiations with FARC began after a cease-fire in 1984, but disarmament remained a challenge. During the peace talks initiated by President Betancur in 1982, negotiations with FARC lasted from May 1984 to June 1987. The FARC announced the establishment of the Uni\u00f3n Patri\u00f3tica (UP) political party in May 1985, which won seats in national and local elections. However, the UP was targeted by enemies, resulting in the deaths of over 3,000 members. The Uni\u00f3n Patri\u00f3tica (UP) political party, established by FARC during peace talks in 1985, faced violence with over 3,000 members killed. This led FARC to withdraw from politics and focus on military efforts. Lessons learned emphasized the need for guarantees for insurgent groups' integration into the political process. FARC leaders now prioritize security and viability in political participation, as seen in negotiations since 2012. The second precedent involved negotiations under President Pastrana that began in 1998, with the FARC demanding negotiations within a demilitarized zone. The FARC used the zone to regroup militarily, launch attacks, grow coca, and hold hostages, showing a lack of commitment to the peace process. During President Pastrana's term, peace negotiations with the FARC were ongoing until he closed them down in 2002. This led to widespread support for a hardline approach to security, culminating in \u00c1lvaro Uribe's presidency. Uribe's tough stance against the FARC, highlighted by a failed assassination attempt during his inauguration, made him popular. Juan Manuel Santos, who served as defense minister under Uribe, promised to continue the security policies during his campaign for office. President Santos, who had served as defense minister under Uribe, continued security and trade policies while pursuing a reform agenda called \"democratic prosperity.\" He expressed openness to negotiating an end to the armed conflict and initiated peace talks with the FARC in 2012. Santos implemented reforms that shifted the government's approach to the internal conflict, focusing on victims and combatants. The Colombian government proposed the Victims and Land Restitution Law to compensate victims of the conflict with economic reparations and land restitution. The law, costing $32 billion over 10 years, aimed to return stolen land to former owners and address land distribution, a core concern of the FARC. Additionally, the Peace Framework Law provided a transitional justice structure for a potential peace process. The Colombian government passed laws to compensate conflict victims and provide incentives for combatants to provide information about their crimes in exchange for reduced sentences. A constitutional reform bill expanded the jurisdiction of military courts, criticized for potentially increasing impunity for human rights crimes. The Colombian government passed laws to compensate conflict victims and incentivize combatants to provide information about their crimes. A constitutional reform bill expanding military jurisdiction was ruled unconstitutional by Colombia's Constitutional Court in October 2013. The Santos Administration introduced legislation to expand military jurisdiction again, but it was not approved. The Ministry of Defense replaced the controversial legislation with one that limited adjudicating powers. The Colombian government replaced a piece of legislation to limit military tribunals' powers to only military service cases, transferring civilian murder cases to civilian courts. Improved relations with Ecuador and Venezuela under President Santos led to greater cooperation in trade, counternarcotics, and security. Former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela played a significant role in these developments. Former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez facilitated FARC's participation in peace talks with the Santos government in 2012. President Santos announced secret talks with FARC in Cuba to end the conflict, with no concessions to the Colombian military. The ELN also showed interest in joining the negotiations. On September 4, 2012, the surprise announcement of formal talks between the government and FARC was followed by detailed information. Negotiations would begin in October in Oslo, Norway, and continue in Cuba. Both sides announced their negotiating teams, with influential actors like Humberto de la Calle, General Jorge Enrique Mora, Luis Carlos Villegas, General Oscar Naranjo, Frank Pearl, and Sergio Jaramillo. The FARC team for the formal talks included Luciano Mar\u00edn Arango (\"Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez\"), Seuxis Paucias Hern\u00e1ndez (\"Jes\u00fas Santrich\"), Ricardo Tillez (\"Rodrigo Granda\"), Jes\u00fas Carvajalino (\"Andr\u00e9s Paris\"), and Luis Alberto Alb\u00e1n (\"Marco Le\u00f3n Calarc\u00e1\"). The FARC requested Ricardo Palmer (\"Sim\u00f3n Trinidad\") be freed from a US prison to join the negotiations, but he was not released. The FARC repeatedly requested the presence of Ricardo Palmer (\"Sim\u00f3n Trinidad\") for the talks, but he was never granted. The August 2012 framework for negotiations outlined six key themes, including rural development, political participation, ending the armed conflict, illicit drugs, victims' reparations, and implementation of the final agreement. Land and rural development were crucial topics for the FARC, with support from Cuba, Norway, Venezuela, and Chile in the negotiation process. The peace talks in Colombia were supported by Cuba, Norway, Venezuela, and Chile. The announcement was praised by various nations and international organizations. The formal launch took place in Oslo, Norway, in October 2012, with the FARC pushing for a bilateral cease-fire. The FARC team pushed for a bilateral cease-fire during the peace talks in Colombia. The substantive phase of the talks began in Cuba with the FARC announcing a two-month unilateral cease-fire. The Colombian government refused a bilateral cease-fire until a final accord was reached. The discussions in Havana focused on rural development and land policy, the first topic on the agenda. The meetings in Cuba were described as the second phase of the peace process. The peace talks in Havana were conducted with confidentiality, avoiding public posturing seen in prior negotiations. President Santos aimed for a November 2013 deadline, coinciding with his reelection bid. The FARC remained cautious about deadlines, and the talks were shielded from the media, with limited details disclosed. Regular press statements were released on a government website. The Santos government's peace talks with the FARC were a significant political development during his second term. Despite widespread mistrust of the FARC, support for the talks was high among Colombians. Former President Uribe was a vocal opponent, criticizing the negotiations as a concession to terrorists. Former President Uribe opposed Santos's reform measures, appointments, and security policy, launching the Democratic Center political movement in 2012. He announced his campaign for senator in 2014. The FARC implemented a two-month cease-fire in 2012, with reduced attacks showing leadership control. During a unilateral cease-fire in 2012, closed-door talks in Cuba were held without interruption. However, after the cease-fire ended in January 2013, attacks and kidnappings increased, raising concerns about the influence of violence on the peace talks. Public support fluctuated as the military situation evolved and difficult issues were addressed in the negotiations. The FARC-government peace talks in 2013 saw violence levels spike periodically, with insurgents focusing on infrastructure sabotage. The Santos government vowed to continue operations against illegal armed groups, including the FARC, without agreeing to a bilateral cease-fire until a final accord was reached. Unilateral cease-fires by the FARC were not consistently honored, with both parties aware of the significance of the talks. The FARC-government peace talks in 2013 saw periodic spikes in violence, with a focus on infrastructure sabotage. Unilateral cease-fires were bookended by both parties, with a tacit understanding that increased violence could impact the peace talks. The complex issues of land and rural development were resolved in May 2013, followed by the FARC's political participation in November 2013. Details of the agreements were initially undisclosed, with only general outlines made public. The principle of \"nothing is agreed until everything is agreed\" guided the negotiations until a comprehensive agreement was signed by both parties. The FARC-government peace talks in 2013 resolved complex issues of land and rural development in May 2013. The agreement included the redistribution of farmland through a land bank and formalization of land ownership, providing legal protection for farmers, infrastructure, and land improvement. The FARC's demand for 9 million hectares of land in autonomous \"peasant reserve zones\" was rejected, but the number of peasant reserve zones would likely increase for rural development programs. The joint declaration in November 2013 outlined the agreement on political participation, including the FARC's role in a post-conflict democracy and measures to ease political participation for opposition movements in Colombia. It envisions a new \"opposition statute\" guaranteeing rights of the political opposition, enhanced media access, improved processes for forming new political parties, citizen oversight through \"Councils for Reconciliation and Coexistence,\" and security for opposition political candidates. The establishment of special temporary districts for historically conflictive areas to elect legislators to Colombia's Chamber of Representatives was a controversial element in the agreement on political participation. Late in 2013, the FARC-government negotiations focused on illicit drug crops and drug trafficking, including counternarcotics cooperation with the United States. During the peace process between Colombia and the United States, coca eradication and alternative development were key features of the final partial agreement signed in May 2014. Civil society groups provided input through proposals at public forums, with a focus on ending aerial spraying of illegal crops and compensating victims of spraying. During the peace process between Colombia and the United States, civil society groups provided input through public forums on issues like physical side effects, loss of food crops, and water contamination. President Santos set a target date for negotiations in November 2013, but it passed without an agreement. The peace process was intertwined with the 2014 elections, with polls showing support for Santos' initiative but skepticism about its success. Changes to the negotiating teams occurred in 2013, including Santos appointing a new member in November. In November 2013, President Santos made changes to the government's negotiating team for the peace process with civil society input. Two women, Mar\u00eda Paulina Riveros and Nigeria Renteria, joined the team, with Riveros becoming one of the lead negotiators. Renteria would coordinate with victims groups and women's organizations due to the high number of female victims in the conflict. The FARC also adjusted its negotiating team during this time. The FARC made adjustments to its negotiating team, including fighters from the southern bloc to dispel rumors. National elections were held during the peace negotiation, with former President Uribe running for the Senate and becoming an opponent of the peace talks. His party, the Democratic Center, aimed to defeat President Santos and his policies, particularly the peace negotiations. The peace negotiations in Colombia were heavily criticized by former President Uribe, who voiced his opposition in the Senate and lower chamber. The March legislative elections set the stage for the presidential election in May 2014, where President Santos campaigned on a peace platform. His main rival, \u00d3scar Iv\u00e1n Zuluaga, was nominated by the Democratic Center party and opposed Santos's peace efforts. In the May 2014 presidential elections in Colombia, \u00d3scar Iv\u00e1n Zuluaga, nominated by the Democratic Center party, opposed President Santos's peace talks. Zuluaga won the first round with 29.4% of the vote, but Santos ultimately secured reelection with 51% of the vote in the June runoff, signaling support for continuing the peace negotiations despite Zuluaga's hardline stance on security. During the 2014 presidential elections in Colombia, a unilateral cease-fire was declared, leading to peaceful elections. A breakthrough in peace talks was achieved just before the first-round vote, with an agreement on combating illicit drugs. The agreement focused on eradicating coca, combating drug trafficking, and addressing drug production and trafficking. Secret exploratory peace talks were also revealed by the Santos government before the second-round vote. The Colombian government launched secret exploratory peace talks with the ELN insurgent group to develop a framework agreement for formal talks. The talks were parallel to negotiations with FARC in Cuba. President Santos emphasized peace as a priority during his second term inauguration. The 27th round of talks with FARC led to the establishment of a Historical Commission on the Conflict and Its Victims to write a consensus report on the conflict's origins. A consensus report on the origins of the conflict and its impact on civilians was being compiled over four months. A subcommittee involving Colombian military officers, FARC members, and a gender subcommittee were established. Victims' perspectives were included in the peace talks, with five delegations of victims participating in discussions on reparations and justice. In September 2014, the Colombian government and FARC negotiators made public the full texts of three partial agreements on land, political participation, and drug trafficking to increase transparency. However, in November 2014, the FARC captured Brigadier General Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo Alzate and two companions, leading President Santos to suspend the peace talks. In November 2014, the FARC captured Brigadier General Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo Alzate in Choc\u00f3, leading President Santos to suspend peace talks. The FARC released the captives on November 30, 2014, after negotiations by mediators from Cuba and Norway. The talks resumed on December 10, 2014, with some analysts seeing the abduction as strengthening the process. The FARC declared an indefinite, unilateral cease-fire on December 20, 2014, urging the Colombian government to agree to a bilateral cease-fire. President Santos announced on January 14, 2015, that discussions on a bilateral cease-fire would begin soon. Talks resumed in early February 2015, with the progress of the bilateral cease-fire proposal remaining uncertain. The FARC announced it would stop recruiting youth under 17, but the fate of underage members already recruited was unclear. A report by Colombian historians on the conflict's origins was presented to negotiators. Senator Uribe went to Washington to discuss the issue with U.S. Congress members. Senator Uribe traveled to Washington, DC, to meet with Members of the U.S. Congress to discuss his opposition to the peace process. President Obama appointed U.S. diplomat Bernie Aronson as Special Envoy to the FARC-government peace talks. Aronson met with negotiating teams in Havana and the Colombian government and FARC agreed to remove land mines as a confidence-building measure. More than 11,000 Colombians have been injured or killed by land mines since 1990, with half of Colombia's departments having mined areas. A team oversaw mine removal efforts in Meta and Antioquia, involving FARC, government, and community representatives. The Colombian military temporarily ceased bombing FARC encampments for a month, coordinated by the Norwegian People's Aid organization. President Santos formed an Advisory Commission of Peace with prominent leaders supporting the peace process. In September 2015, President Santos met with FARC chief Timochenko in Havana and announced a final agreement would be signed by March 23, 2016. By December 15, 2015, a partial agreement on victims of the conflict was signed, outlining a transitional justice system. Four partial agreements had been concluded by the end of 2015 during more than 45 negotiation rounds. In January 2016, a commission was set up to work on a bilateral cease-fire, and the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 2261 to monitor and verify the cease-fire. President Obama and Colombian President Santos celebrated the 15-year anniversary of Plan Colombia, which received $10 billion in support from the U.S. Congress. Obama proposed a new \"post-peace accord\" approach. President Obama proposed a new approach to U.S.-Colombian cooperation called Peace Colombia, with a funding request of $450 million. The FY2017 congressional budget justification requested $391 million for this initiative. However, funding for FY2017 and the Peace Colombia request was not completed in 2016. A continuing resolution passed by Congress in December 2016 funded assistance programs to Colombia at slightly below the FY2016 level ($300 million) through April 28, 2017. The balance of FY2017 assistance levels will be determined after the 115th Congress takes office. In mid-February, FARC negotiators, including lead negotiator Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez, held a rally in La Guajira, Colombia. In La Guajira, Colombia, FARC negotiators held a political rally in February 2016, causing a crisis in peace talks. The Colombian government and FARC resolved most issues in July 2016 after over 50 rounds of negotiations. In mid-July, Colombia's Post-Conflict Minister suggested a final accord would be signed by the end of August 2016 after over 50 rounds of peace talks. The U.S. Congress showed bipartisan support for the peace process, with the Senate passing a resolution in April 2016. The Colombian Constitutional Court approved a peace plebiscite on July 18, 2016, and on August 24, 2016, the final accord was reached between the two sides. In mid-September 2016, the FARC held its 10th National Guerrilla Conference, where delegates unanimously voted to accept the peace accord negotiated with the Santos government. On September 26, 2016, world leaders were invited to a ceremony in Cartagena, Colombia, for the official signing of the accord. President Santos traveled across Colombia to educate citizens on the benefits of the peace accord, while critics, led by former President Uribe, mobilized a campaign to reject it. Former President Uribe led a campaign to reject the peace accord, citing weaknesses such as inadequate punishment for FARC violations and overly generous guarantees for their political role. Colombian voters rejected the accord by a slim margin, revealing polarization over resolving the violent insurgency. The No campaign against the peace accord focused on discontent with President Santos and his administration, rather than the accord's merits. After the accord was rejected, the government negotiated changes with opposition leaders and the FARC team over 41 days. Despite the No campaign leaders largely rejecting the changes, the Colombian government claimed they were significant, touching 56 of 57 categories of changes. The Colombian Congress ratified the new peace accord on November 30, 2016, with overwhelming support. The timing of FARC's demobilization and disarmament was a key issue, requiring the enactment of laws, including an amnesty law, to trigger the process. Without amnesty for fighters who committed political crimes, the FARC refused to disarm. The FARC refused to move into concentration zones despite amnesty for fighters who committed political crimes. The Colombian government has pardoned over 110 guerrillas, with more pardons expected. The Constitutional Court approved a fast-track mechanism for implementing the peace accord, allowing expedited legislative processes for necessary laws. The fast-track mechanism approved by the Colombian Congress grants the president special executive powers to expedite laws for the peace accord. An amnesty law was unanimously approved to benefit FARC members accused of lesser crimes, a crucial step for the demobilization process. Challenges for the peace accord include maintaining public support and dealing with spoilers who seek to disrupt the talks. The challenges for the Santos government in implementing the peace accord include dealing with spoilers who aim to disrupt the talks, uncertainty surrounding the FARC's unity of command, and the influence of negotiations with the ELN. Maintaining public support for the peace process, which could take up to 10 years, is crucial for the government's investment in the process. Key sectors such as the military, private sector, and civil society groups will play a critical role in supporting or challenging the peace accord implementation. The 2018 presidential elections in Colombia could serve as a referendum on the new peace accord, with Senator Uribe's party opposing the agreement. Concerns about Colombia's cocaine exports may influence international support for the peace implementation. The surge in illicit drug cultivation in Colombia, particularly in coca bush and cocaine, has raised alarm. The surge in cocaine production in Colombia has not been effectively addressed due to delays in implementing drug-crop eradication programs. Past efforts to make peace with insurgent groups have been hindered by violence instigated by paramilitaries and rogue factions within the groups. The potential actions of paramilitary successor groups, known as Bacrim, in response to the new peace accord between the government and FARC remain uncertain. Analysts predict violent competition for control of drug trafficking routes and mining interests as FARC demobilizes, leading to increased violence against Colombian human rights defenders. In 2016, 71 HRDs were killed in Colombia, prompting U.S. Members of Congress to address the violence. Concerns arise about whether the FARC negotiating team can represent all FARC forces. Some FARC leaders oppose the peace accord and plan to continue illicit activities like drug trafficking and illegal mining. Various commentators speculate about which FARC fronts will demobilize or reject the terms of the demobilization. In mid-December 2016, the FARC leadership rejected five commanders in Colombia's southeast who refused to accept the new accord. Observers suggest that there is unity of command within the organization to get up to 90% of the FARC to demobilize.
