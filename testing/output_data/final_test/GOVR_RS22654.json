    "content": "The consideration of a vetoed bill in the House is a matter of high privilege, with the chamber voting to override or sustain the veto shortly after receiving the message from the President or Senate. Time for debate is controlled by committee members, and a two-thirds majority is needed to repass the bill over the President's veto. The Speaker lays the veto message before the House, reads it, and puts the question of overriding the veto to a vote. The House can consider overriding a veto by making preferential motions before the Speaker states the question. These motions include postponing consideration to a named day, referring it to committee, or laying the vetoed bill on the table. Debate on overriding a veto takes place under the hour rule, and a motion to remove the bill from the table can be made at any time. The process of overriding a veto in the House involves an hour of debate under the hour rule. The Speaker recognizes the committee chair and ranking minority member to manage the debate, with other Members given time to speak. After the hour, a majority vote can move to override the veto, requiring two-thirds of Members present to repass the bill. Votes are recorded electronically as per the Constitution. The modern House records Members' votes electronically. A veto override vote is final, and if unsuccessful, the bill is referred to committee. If the House overrides a veto on a Senate bill, it becomes law. Senators enter a unanimous consent agreement to reconsider a vetoed bill. The Senate often agrees by unanimous consent to consider a vetoed bill, which requires a two-thirds majority vote by roll-call. It is common for the bill to be held at the desk until terms of consideration are agreed upon. All 100 Senators do not need to support the bill for it to be considered. The Senate has various options for handling a veto message, including referring it to committee, postponing consideration, or overriding the veto with a two-thirds majority vote. The majority leader can also move to proceed to another matter, and the veto message can be tabled or indefinitely postponed. The Senate can debate overriding a veto, which can be limited by unanimous consent or cloture. Cloture requires three-fifths of Senators or 60 Senators to end debate. Two-thirds of Senators must agree to override the veto and repass the bill, with a roll-call vote required. The Senate can debate overriding a veto, which requires two-thirds of Senators to agree and repass the bill with a roll-call vote. If the Senate fails to override a veto, the House is not involved. If the override vote is successful, the bill becomes law."
