    "content": "DOD adopted evolutionary acquisition with spiral development (EA/SD) in 2001 as its preferred approach for developing new weapon systems. This method aims to make the acquisition system more responsive to changes in threats, technology, and warfighter needs, while also increasing control over costs, program-manager accountability, and participation of high-tech firms. The goals of EA/SD include getting new capabilities to U.S. personnel quickly, incorporating user feedback, reducing technical development risks, and involving new technologies in weapon programs. The EA/SD method aims to reduce technical development risks in weapon programs by rapidly developing an initial version that meets a fraction of the requirement, allowing for field experience to inform later versions. The EA/SD method aims to reduce technical development risks in weapon programs by rapidly developing an initial version that meets a fraction of the requirement. This initial version is then used to develop later versions of the weapon until a version that meets the 100% standard is achieved. Each block of development includes phases for conceiving, developing, producing, and sustaining the weapon system, governed by acquisition rules and regulations. Spiral development, an iterative process, occurs in the second phase within a block to refine capabilities through interaction between developer, tester, and user. Spiral interaction in EA/SD allows for refining system requirements through collaboration between developer, tester, and user. EA/SD is more flexible than SSFC in accommodating changes in program requirements, technology, and warfighter needs. It also offers various entry points into the acquisition process, unlike SSFC which had a fixed entry point at the beginning of the program. Under EA/SD, programs can enter different phases depending on maturity, with the final system capability determined either at the start with well-understood technologies or along the way with emerging technologies. This approach can create uncertainty in large weapon acquisition programs but allows for flexibility in adapting to changing needs. Applying EA/SD to various weapon programs, including the F-16 fighter and M-1 tank, can reduce uncertainty in outcomes. In 2001, DOD made EA/SD the preferred acquisition strategy for all weapon programs. This approach is now being used in multiple defense programs, such as the ballistic missile defense program and the Navy's surface combatants program. The ballistic missile defense program, operating under different oversight rules since 2002, has embraced the EA/SD model with improvements in acquisition policy according to a 2003 GAO report. The GAO report recommends that the Secretary of Defense strengthen DOD's acquisition policy by implementing additional controls to ensure decision makers follow a knowledge-based approach in product development. The GAO report recommends strengthening DOD's acquisition policy with additional controls to ensure decision makers follow a knowledge-based approach. DOD partially concurred with the recommendations, believing current controls are sufficient but will continue to monitor for needed improvements. Congress may face issues with oversight of weapon acquisition programs due to uncertainty over EA/SD and SSFC approaches. The GAO report raises concerns about DOD's oversight of EA/SD programs, specifically regarding budget justification and incomplete information on program progress. Supporters argue DOD is aware of the need for oversight. Congress may question how DOD's oversight of EA/SD programs compares to SSFC weapon acquisition programs. The GAO report raises concerns about DOD's oversight of EA/SD programs, particularly in terms of program definition and budget justification. Congress faces challenges in allocating defense spending and overseeing newly initiated weapon acquisition programs under EA/SD. The GAO report raises concerns about DOD's oversight of EA/SD programs, particularly in terms of program definition and budget justification. Congress may have less information to approve new weapon acquisition programs under EA/SD, leading to challenges in allocating defense spending and measuring program performance. Funding projections for EA/SD programs may be more volatile due to potential refinements in performance requirements, making long-range projections less reliable compared to systems pursued under the SSFC. Supporters of EA/SD argue that it can improve congressional oversight of DOD weapon acquisition programs by providing more reliable information focused on specific development blocks, as opposed to long-range projections under the SSFC approach. They believe that the historical accuracy of DOD in projecting future events is not perfect, making the information provided under EA/SD more dependable for Congress to use in its oversight role. Critics argue that information provided in connection with an SSFC weapon acquisition program can give Congress an illusion of understanding the program, while EA/SD has the potential to draw Congress into programs without a clear idea of objectives. Questions for Congress and DOD include the impact of limited initial details on new weapon acquisition programs and oversight, and how program information with longer time horizons may affect oversight of weapon development programs. The curr_chunk discusses the potential impact on weapon development programs if program information with longer time horizons but less reliability is exchanged for information with greater short-term reliability. It also raises questions about DOD's preference for EA/SD and the implications of this approach on providing specific answers to congressional inquiries. Additionally, it mentions a requirement in H.R. 5122 / P.L. 109-364 to review and revise weapon test and evaluation policies in light of new acquisition approaches. The Senate Armed Services Committee supported incremental acquisition and directed GAO to assess current acquisition policies and regulations to ensure they support knowledge-based, evolutionary acquisitions. GAO submitted the required report in November 2003, as mandated by Section 802 of the conference report on the FY2003 defense authorization act. The Senate Armed Services Committee required the Department of Defense to report on applying statutory and regulatory requirements to EA/SD programs for major acquisition programs. Section 803 outlined conditions for pursuing DOD acquisition programs as EA/SD efforts and mandated annual status reports for research and development programs under EA/SD for five years. Section 132 mandated the Air Force to submit a list of acquisition reform \"pathfinder programs\" to Congress and required status reports for these programs. These provisions were discussed in the FY2003 defense authorization bill. The Senate Armed Services Committee required the Department of Defense to report on applying statutory and regulatory requirements to EA/SD programs for major acquisition programs. The FY2003 defense authorization bill included provisions and comments on the EA/SD process."
