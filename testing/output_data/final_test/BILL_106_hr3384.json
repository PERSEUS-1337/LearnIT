    "content": "The Act titled \"Energy and Climate Policy Act of 1999\" is established for the purpose of addressing energy and climate policies. Congress finds that there are uncertainties in the science of climate change, but human activities may contribute to increasing global greenhouse gas concentrations, requiring a long-term global effort for stabilization. Developing countries will be major greenhouse gas emitters, necessitating an international response. The Kyoto Protocol fails to meet Senate Resolution 98 conditions, and the President has not submitted it for Senate debate and ratification. The purpose of this Act is to strengthen provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to promote voluntary efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy efficiency under the United States Constitution. The President has no intention to implement any portion of the Kyoto Protocol before Senate ratification. The Act aims to enhance provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to encourage voluntary actions to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and enhance energy efficiency. The President does not plan to enforce any part of the Kyoto Protocol without Senate approval. The Office of Global Climate Change is established. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 is amended to establish an Office of Global Climate Change within the Department of Energy. The Office will coordinate departmental issues and policies related to climate change, with a director appointed by the Secretary. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 is amended to establish an Office of Global Climate Change within the Department of Energy. The Office's duties include reporting to Congress, participating in the development of climate change policies, and implementing strategies to address greenhouse gas emissions. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 is amended to establish an Office of Global Climate Change within the Department of Energy. The Office's duties include developing and implementing a public awareness program on potential global climate change and voluntary measures to mitigate its effects. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 is amended to establish an Office of Global Climate Change within the Department of Energy, which includes promoting research, development, and diffusion of environmentally sound technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 is amended to establish an Office of Global Climate Change within the Department of Energy, with developing country Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change having the authority to participate in relevant Department of Energy programs. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 is amended to establish an Office of Global Climate Change within the Department of Energy, with developing country Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change having the authority to participate in relevant Department of Energy programs. Additionally, there is a provision for the national inventory and voluntary reporting of greenhouse gases. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 is amended to update the national inventory of greenhouse gas emissions annually using available data, including voluntary reporting starting in 2001. It also includes provisions for identifying emissions reductions and avoidance achieved. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 is amended to update the national inventory of greenhouse gas emissions annually using available data, including voluntary reporting starting in 2001. It includes provisions for identifying emissions reductions and avoidance achieved through various measures such as agricultural activities, energy efficiency, forestry activities, fuel switching, methane recovery, renewable energy use, and more. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 is amended to update the national inventory of greenhouse gas emissions annually using available data, including voluntary reporting starting in 2001. Amendments include recognizing voluntary reductions or avoided emissions of greenhouse gases to encourage private sector efforts in reducing global emissions. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 is amended to establish a program for public recognition of entities achieving greenhouse gas reductions. The Secretary of Energy will review guidelines for accuracy improvements through public comment. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 is amended to establish a program for public recognition of entities achieving greenhouse gas reductions. An opportunity for public comment on potential changes to guidelines for accuracy and reliability of greenhouse gas reductions is provided, with a focus on encouraging voluntary emission reductions by the private sector. Potential changes include verification processes and reference cases for reporting project-based activities. The review will assess the inclusion of benchmark and default methodologies for 'greenfield' projects, address potential duplicate reporting of greenhouse gas emissions reductions, consider costs and benefits of changes, impacts on participation, and provide reasonable options consistent with the voluntary nature of the program. The Secretary, in consultation with the Administrator, will propose guidelines for improving accuracy of reported greenhouse gas reductions. Consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture and the Administrator of the Small Business Administration is required. The Secretary, in consultation with the Administrator, will propose guidelines for improving accuracy of reported greenhouse gas reductions. The guidelines will involve the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Commerce, the Administrator of the Energy Information Administration, small businesses, and farmers to address greenhouse gas emission reductions. The Secretary shall revise guidelines under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 within 18 months of enactment to reflect the amendments made. The effective date of the provisions is specified in subsection (a) (5) and (6). The provisions of subsection (a) (5) and (6) of this section will be effective on the date of enactment of this Act. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 defines key terms related to climate change, including agricultural activity, climate change, climate system, and greenhouse gases. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 defines greenhouse gas reduction as the certification of one metric ton of greenhouse gas emissions reduced, and greenhouse gas sequestration as the extraction or natural process of storing greenhouse gases. The term 'forest products' refers to goods made from trees, while 'forestry activity' includes actions that impact forest use and productivity, such as tree establishment, enhanced forest management, and pest control. The term 'forest activity' encompasses various practices like weed control, nutrient application, pest management, forest protection, conservation for carbon benefits, and biomass energy use. Exclusions are land use changes due to war or natural disasters. 'Management of grasslands and drylands' involves seeding, cultivation, and nutrient management, while 'ocean seeding' refers to a specific practice. Ocean seeding is the process of adding nutrients to oceans to enhance the biological fixation of carbon dioxide."
