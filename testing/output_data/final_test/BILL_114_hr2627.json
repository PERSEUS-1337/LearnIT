    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Salad Bars in Schools Expansion Act\". Congress finds that in the United States, a significant number of school-aged children are overweight or obese and do not consume the recommended daily amount of fruits and vegetables. More than 30 million children participate in the National School Lunch Program daily, with a majority qualifying for free or reduced-price meals. Serving more fruits and vegetables in school meals can improve children's eating habits and health, aligning with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Research shows that school salad bars are an effective way to increase children's consumption of a variety of foods. Salad bars are an effective strategy for school food authorities to meet nutrition standards by serving a variety of fruits and vegetables daily. They empower students to try new produce and demonstrate a commitment to wellness in schools. Expansion of salad bars in schools is emphasized as an effective strategy to meet nutrition standards and promote wellness among students. The Salad Bars in Schools Expansion Act amends Section 18 of the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to promote the use of salad bars in schools through marketing, communications, training, and technical assistance provided by the Secretary. The Secretary shall establish a grant program to provide funding for schools to install salad bars, along with offering webinars, training workshops, implementation resources, nutrition education, and strategies for parent engagement. Grants will be awarded on a competitive basis to eligible entities. The grant program provides funding for schools to install salad bars, with priority given to schools serving a high percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Eligible entities must submit an application to the Secretary to receive the grant. The Salad Bars in Schools Expansion Act grant program provides funding for schools to install salad bars, with priority for schools in food deserts or providing nutrition education. The program terminates 5 years after enactment, and grantees must submit evaluations to the Secretary. A report is due to the Committee on Education within 1 year of enactment. The Secretary must submit a report to relevant committees on promoting salad bars in schools, the number of schools with salad bar programs, schools with new salad bars from the grant program, and evaluations from grantees. Additionally, guidance on salad bars in the national school lunch program must be revised within 90 days. The Secretary will revise the policy memorandum on salad bars in the National School Lunch Program within 90 days of submitting a report. Definitions include 'durable equipment' and 'eligible entity' referring to schools or school food authorities. A 'food desert' is defined as a census tract with a significant number of residents. A 'food desert' is a census tract with a substantial share of residents living in low-income areas with limited access to a grocery store or healthy food options. SEC. 4. PROHIBITION ON NEW APPROPRIATIONS. No additional funds authorized for this Act and its amendments; existing funds will be used instead."
