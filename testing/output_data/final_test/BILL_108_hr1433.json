The Ex-Offenders Voting Rights Act of 2003 includes findings that emphasize the importance of the right to vote for offenders to reintegrate into society. Congress has the ultimate supervisory power over Federal elections to ensure equal opportunity for all citizens to vote. State laws on voting qualifications must align with the Constitution. Currently, laws vary across the nation regarding voting rights for ex-offenders. Approximately 3.9 million individuals, including 500,000 women, are unable to vote due to felony convictions. State disenfranchisement laws disproportionately affect ethnic minorities, with 14 states disenfranchising ex-offenders even after they have completed their sentences. Despite the possibility of regaining the right to vote in theory, it is often difficult in practice. In some states, ex-offenders need a pardon from the Governor or action from the parole board to regain voting rights. Federal offenders face additional barriers, with only a Presidential pardon as a method to restore voting rights. Many lack the resources needed to succeed in restoring their voting rights. Thirteen percent of African-American adult males, or 1.4 million men, are disenfranchised, with 3 in 10 expected to be disenfranchised in the next generation. Hispanic citizens are also disproportionately affected. Congress should address these discrepancies for fairness and equal protection. The purpose of the Act is to restore voting rights to ex-offenders who have completed their sentences. The Act aims to restore voting rights to ex-offenders who have served their sentences. The Act defines \"correctional institution or facility\" as a place for convicted individuals and \"election\" as various types of voting events. The Act defines \"election\" as different types of voting events, including a primary election for nominating candidates for federal offices like President or Vice President. It also defines terms like \"parole\" and \"probation\" in the context of court-imposed conditions. The Act defines \"election\" as various voting events, including primary elections for federal offices. It also explains terms like \"parole\" and \"probation\" in relation to court-imposed conditions, which may involve the individual paying damages, periodic reporting, or supervision by a court officer. SEC. 4. RIGHTS OF CITIZENS.\n\nThe right to vote in Federal elections cannot be denied to a U.S. citizen based on a criminal conviction, except if the individual is currently serving a felony sentence in prison or on parole/probation for a felony offense. The Attorney General can take legal action to address violations of the Act, while individuals aggrieved by violations can notify the state election official and file a civil action if the violation is not corrected within a specified timeframe. Individuals aggrieved by violations of the Act can file a civil action to obtain relief, especially if the violation occurred within 30 days before a federal election. SEC. 6. RELATION TO OTHER LAWS. This Act does not prohibit states from enacting less restrictive voting laws for federal elections. The rights and remedies provided by this Act are in addition to those under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the National Voter Registration Act of 1993."
