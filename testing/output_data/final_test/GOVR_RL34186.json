    "content": "Half the nation's electricity comes from coal, delivered to power plants by railroads. Concerns over reliable coal deliveries, limited rail system capacity, and related issues led to congressional hearings in 2006. This report analyzes coal transportation by rail, including problems since 1990, implications of rail capacity limits, the role of coal inventories, and proposed legislation to improve rail service to coal-fired plants. Data and analysis gaps complicate measuring rail service and capacity issues, determining the need for federal action, and evaluating solutions. Since 1990, there have been nine instances of coal supply disruptions to power plants due to rail transportation issues, including weather, demand surges, integration problems from railroad mergers, and maintenance programs. The most significant events occurred in 1997, 1999, and 2005, resulting in widespread congestion and delivery delays. However, the cost implications of these disruptions remain unclear, with no comprehensive estimates available from the electric power industry or government agencies. The electric power industry has faced coal transportation service problems due to rail service delays since 2005, with estimated costs totaling $228 million. The average speed of coal unit trains has declined, and railroads are reluctant to offer strong service quality guarantees. Capacity constraints on the rail system have contributed to these issues. Since the Staggers Rail Act in 1980, railroads have aligned capacity with demand by increasing traffic, shedding assets, and avoiding excessive capacity. However, the lack of buffer capacity may lead to congestion and delays in coal and commodity deliveries. Wall Street's conservative approach to capital spending has also impacted the industry's resiliency. The railroad industry has seen a significant increase in coal and other rates, boosting profits since 2004. Factors contributing to this include demand growth, limited competition from trucks, and the ability of railroads to exercise pricing power. The Government Accountability Office and the Surface Transportation Board are conducting studies on this issue. Power plant coal stocks serve as a backstop to rail system capacity. Power plant coal stockpiles act as a \"shock absorber,\" delaying the need for expensive alternative fuel or electricity supplies in case of delivery delays. Stocks have been decreasing since the 1970s, with a 40% drop by the late 1990s. Cost-cutting efforts by the power industry, including regulated utilities and independent power producers, have been a primary factor in this decline. Since the 1990s, independent power producers have maintained lower coal stocks compared to regulated utilities, reflecting their exposure to market forces. Despite longer supply lines, the power industry reduced stocks due to service guarantees in rail contracts and decreased risk of coal miner strikes. However, since 2006, coal stocks have increased as rail service improved, with recognition of the risk of coal supply shortages. The power industry has recognized the risk of coal supply shortages due to capacity constraints on the rail network. Legislative proposals in Congress aim to address rail service issues and offer tax incentives for rail system capacity expansion. These incentives are intended to encourage investments in rail infrastructure by various parties, including power plants and coal mines. The tax incentives aim to increase rail system capacity, benefiting coal and other shippers, transportation planners, and the rail industry by reducing financial risks associated with capital spending. Limited public information on rail capacity and service for coal shipments poses challenges in evaluating the proposals. The rail industry may consider detailed capacity and service data to be business sensitive and proprietary, posing challenges in evaluating the benefits of rail tax incentives. Steps can be taken to prevent disclosure of confidential information, such as aggregating carrier-specific data. Coal shippers desire a reliable rail network, but this may require investments in buffer capacity that the industry may find unaffordable, even with tax incentives. Excess capacity has historically been a financial burden on the railroad industry. The close balance between rail capacity and demand has allowed the railroad industry to raise rates and increase profits. Some groups argue for more public control over rail tax incentives, but the industry believes private managers should decide on investments. Implementing proposals to limit tax incentives for specific traffic categories, like coal shipments, may be challenging due to the network nature of railroads. The regulatory restructuring proposals aim to introduce more competition into the rail industry by removing antitrust law exemptions and revising the current regulatory scheme. The industry views these proposals as \"re-regulation\" that could restrict pricing and operational freedom, potentially hindering the industry's revival. The regulatory restructuring proposals aim to introduce more competition into the rail industry by removing antitrust law exemptions and revising the current regulatory scheme. This could potentially hinder the industry's revival by restricting pricing and operational freedom. The emphasis on enhanced competition in the proposals aligns with the current regulatory regime's goal of allowing competition to establish reasonable rates. However, there is a risk that the outcome may result in more regulatory control instead of market reliance, depending on the implementation details. The success of the regulatory restructuring bills may heavily rely on how the proposed legislation is executed. The evaluation of regulatory restructuring proposals focuses on factors like the severity of coal and rail service issues, financial health of the rail industry, and the uncertainty surrounding revenue adequacy determinations by the STB. Some parties criticize the STB's methodology, particularly its use of a \"single-stage discounted cash flow\" model which may overstate revenue adequacy in the railroad industry. Concerns also exist about relying too heavily on one financial ratio to determine revenue adequacy, contrasting with the evaluation of multiple factors in electric power rate cases. The report discusses potential improvements in coal rail service without extensive regulatory changes. Suggestions include increased public visibility of rail service issues, a rail public advocate, and new requirements for reliable service. Background information on coal and rail in the U.S. power system is provided, along with analysis of legislative proposals related to tax incentives and regulatory restructuring. Coal's significant role in U.S. electricity generation is highlighted, with projections showing an increase in coal burn by power plants. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects a 21% increase in annual coal burn by power plants between 2005 and 2020, with most coal being transported to power plants by rail. Railroads accounted for over 70% of coal shipments in 2005, due to the distance between coal mines and power plants. Truck shipments are uneconomic over 50 miles, barge is practical only for mines near water, and conveyors are limited to coal mines adjacent to power plants. Rail transportation of coal has become more important as western coal is shipped long distances to various markets. The Powder River Basin (PRB) in Wyoming and Montana is the nation's largest source of coal, accounting for 38% of all coal produced in the US in 2005. PRB coal is in high demand due to its environmental and cost advantages, emitting fewer air pollutants when burned and being strip-mined at low cost. The western share of coal production is projected to increase to 58% by 2020, leading to greater national dependence on long rail hauls of coal to fuel power plants. The Powder River Basin (PRB) in Wyoming is the largest source of coal in the US, accounting for 38% of production in 2005. PRB coal is in high demand for its environmental benefits and low cost of strip-mining. Railroads, primarily Union Pacific Railroad and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway, transport the coal to power plants across the country. The concentration of infrastructure in the PRB area makes it a crucial source of fuel for electricity. The 103 mile \"Joint Line\" in Wyoming is the busiest stretch of railroad in the world, handling over 60 loaded coal trains a day. A proposed project by the Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern Railroad (DM&E) aims to open a new route into the Powder River Basin (PRB) for coal transportation, potentially increasing rail capacity and routing options. The DM&E project to open a new rail route into the Powder River Basin has faced delays due to financing issues and opposition from some landowners and communities, including the city of Rochester, Minnesota, and the Mayo Clinic. The Federal Railroad Administration rejected a loan guarantee for the project in 2007. Canadian Pacific Railway announced plans to purchase DM&E and potentially pursue the project. Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) plans to acquire the DM&E and potentially pursue the Powder River Basin (PRB) project. CP expects to finalize the acquisition by the end of 2007, pending approval from the STB. The PRB project is seen as a potential opportunity, with CP aiming to leverage DM&E's access to U.S. agricultural and ethanol markets. However, there is uncertainty regarding CP's commitment to the PRB project, with construction potentially starting as late as 2025. Observers speculate that CP's significant investment in the deal indicates intent to pursue the PRB plan. The DM&E's PRB line could be a major rail construction project in the U.S., adding capacity to the coal transportation market. The project could connect to 101 coal-fired plants and play a significant role in freight transportation. The rail industry, according to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), competes with water transport for heavy, low-value commodities and with trucking for higher-value shipments over longer distances. Four dominant carriers, UP, BNSF, Norfolk Southern Railway, and CSX Transportation, account for 92% of Class I railroad operating revenues. The rail industry is characterized by two duopolies in the east and west, but the market leverage of railroads varies by commodity, customer, and geography. Competition from trucks is higher for general merchandise than for heavy bulk goods like coal. The competitive environment changes over time, with coal rates declining for years before sharply increasing recently. Market power in the rail industry varies across markets and time. Since 2004, the freight market has been favorable for railroads, allowing them to increase rates and achieve strong financial results. The North American railroads were reported to be in their best financial shape in decades in 2007. Class I railroad industry profits grew significantly in 2005 and 2006, with improved return on investment. Today's rail industry is highly concentrated and profitable, contrasting with the situation in the 1970s. In the 1970s, the rail industry was in poor financial and physical condition with 39 Class I railroads. The industry was tightly regulated by the Interstate Commerce Commission until the mid-1970s. Concerns exist about changing the regulatory system and its potential impact on the industry's financial and operational progress. In the 1920s, railroads faced competition from trucks and barge shipments, leading to a decline in market share from 63% to 50% between 1950 and 1975. This loss of market share resulted in financial and physical decay, with major bankruptcies and low returns on investment. The industry was in serious economic trouble. In the 1970s, the railroad industry experienced a serious economic decline, with bankrupt carriers owning 15% of route miles. The industry was operating uneconomic railroad lines due to the reluctance of the ICC to allow abandonments. A 1978 DOT report highlighted the industry's poor economic condition, low return on investment, and deteriorating physical plant. Despite the challenges, the extent of the industry's troubles should not be overstated. The rail industry's troubles in the 1970s and early 1980s were not uniform, with the Northeast and Midwest facing the most severe problems. Despite weaknesses, financially strong carriers were able to fund their capital requirements internally. Parts of the rail system were in good financial and physical condition, while others showed acute weakness. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the rail industry faced challenges, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest. Despite some weaknesses, financially strong carriers could fund their capital needs internally. Congress passed the Staggers Rail Act in 1980 to address industry issues through deregulation. This legislation established a national Rail Transportation Policy focused on promoting competition, minimizing federal regulatory control, ensuring fair rates, and maintaining a safe and efficient rail system. The Staggers Act aimed to maintain reasonable rates, prevent predatory pricing, and protect shippers from market abuses. It sought to balance competition in the rail freight market, ensure financial recovery of the industry, and restore its financial integrity. The Staggers Act aimed to balance competition in the rail freight market and ensure financial recovery of the industry by giving railroads discretion to set rates in response to market conditions. The ICC exempted certain traffic categories from regulation, allowing shippers to appeal rates only if they were \"captive\" to one railroad. The Staggers Act allowed railroads to set rates based on market conditions, leading to rapid consolidation in the industry. The Class I rail industry shrank from 39 carriers to seven between 1980 and 2002, with four accounting for most traffic and revenues. Railroads focused on long-haul movements on their own tracks for profitability. The Staggers Act granted railroads wide discretion to optimize traffic flows and enter into confidential contracts for customized rail service. It also gave the ICC authority to direct railroads to interchange traffic in the public interest or for competitive rail service. Regulatory powers were retained by the federal government, including rate appeals and approval of mergers. The ICC Termination Act of 1995 replaced the ICC with the STB, an independent regulatory agency with authority over mergers, traffic interchange, emergency powers, business practices, and financial reports in the rail industry. The Act made limited changes to rail regulation, maintaining the regulatory regime established by the Staggers Act. Despite deregulation in 1980, Class I railroads have improved productivity, but cost-efficiency and revenue generation have been slower to improve. Railroads have improved productivity through technology and management practices, reducing employment and miles of railroad operated. Despite increased traffic, revenue generation has been slow. Intermodal traffic saw significant growth, while coal traffic also increased. The railroads' share of domestic surface freight has slowly increased back to 50%. Between 1980 and 2005, railroads improved productivity by increasing freight-revenue ton-miles per employee by 425% and ton-miles per mile of road by 217%. Operating cost per revenue ton-mile declined by over 50% between 1983 and 1996 but has shown little improvement since. Revenue generation has been harder to consistently achieve than productivity gains, with operating margins fluctuating over time. The improvement in real-dollar margins after 2003 is consistent with reported increases in rail rates due to tight capacity and other factors. Railroads have achieved cost reductions by shifting costs from carriers to shippers, such as encouraging power companies to provide railcars for coal transportation. This cost-shifting combined with rate reductions can save money for both railroads and shippers. The railroads have tightened capacity and increased market power, leading to cost-shifting to power companies for infrastructure improvements. This response is rational due to limited capital budgets and aligning capacity with business volume since deregulation in 1980. The railroads have tightened capacity and increased market power by cutting staff and adding capacity in certain sectors. The changing traffic mix has led to a tradeoff between coal and intermodal traffic, with intermodal traffic taking priority for speed and timeliness. When intermodal and coal trains conflict, intermodal trains are typically given priority, reducing the effective carrying capacity of slower trains. Capacity constraints in the rail network can lead to reduced resiliency and increased congestion during unexpected events. Shortages in infrastructure, equipment, or labor can limit the system's ability to handle disruptions, causing widespread delays throughout the network. Capacity constraints in the rail network can lead to reduced resiliency and increased congestion during unexpected events. A late afternoon thunderstorm at a hub airport, for example, can cause delays that cascade throughout the system, affecting airplanes destined for that hub and causing disruptions for travelers between cities with clear weather. Unlike airlines, railroads have limited mobility within their track and yard systems, leading to congestion that can persist for weeks or months, reducing fluidity in the rail network. Capacity constraints in the rail network can lead to reduced resiliency and increased congestion. Trains may be late, unable to carry contracted traffic, and power plants can run short of fuel. The rail system has been identified as capacity constrained since the mid-1990s, causing serious transportation problems. The Wall Street Journal reported in 1998 that railroads are facing resource shortages to handle more business. Ways to increase capacity include running more trains, increasing train velocity, reducing headway between trains, and running bigger trains. These strategies aim to alleviate congestion and improve efficiency in the rail network. Increasing rail system capacity can be achieved through various methods such as running bigger trains with more cars and locomotives, improving track infrastructure, and implementing technological advancements. Examples include adding double-track, straightening curves, and using track-side sensors for detection. Railroads must manage staff effectively to ensure smooth operations, avoiding overstaffing while having enough crews to handle traffic. In 2004, UP faced delivery shortages due to being short-staffed, highlighting the importance of personnel planning. Crews must be synchronized with train positioning to prevent delays, as stalled trains can block tracks and cause further disruptions. Staff shortages cannot be quickly resolved as it takes months to train new crews. Railroads allocate capacity to balance customer demands, operational constraints, and financial goals. Capacity is assigned priorities for different classes of rail traffic, with passenger and time-sensitive intermodal traffic receiving the highest priority. Pricing is another method of allocation, with railroads required to provide service to any shipper under federal law. Price rationing of available capacity is commonly used in the industry. The rail industry uses \"price rationing of available capacity\" to manage traffic by adjusting prices based on demand. Railroad companies may use high prices to release capacity for more profitable use and prevent system overloading. Maintaining a balance between traffic accepted and capacity owned is crucial to avoid severe congestion. Railroads manage traffic by adjusting prices based on demand to prevent system overloading. Increasing capacity involves capital investment in equipment or infrastructure, making railroads capital intensive. Maintaining a balance between traffic and capacity is crucial to avoid congestion. Class I railroads invested an average of 17% of their annual revenues in capital from 1998-2005, compared to 3% for all manufacturing industries and 5% for the truck transportation sector. Capital spending varied since 1983, peaking at $7.6 billion in 1998 before dropping to $5.0 billion in 2001 due to factors like the 2001 recession and efforts to pay down debts from mergers in the 1990s. Since 2001, railroad capital spending has increased continuously to $7.2 billion in 2006, driven by volume growth and higher rates. Capital investment as a percentage of revenues has remained steady at 15-16% from 2000-2005, compared to 22% in 1998. Investment proportional to traffic has also been consistent, ranging from 3.3 to 3.7 mills per revenue ton mile in constant 2000 dollars, lower than the 5.5 mills in 1998. Railroad capital spending increased to $7.2 billion in 2006, driven by volume growth and higher rates. Investments are tailored to short-term demand changes to improve return on investment, avoiding excess capacity. The industry avoids a \"build ahead\" approach to maintain financial viability. Railroads focus on building and staffing for current or expected business, avoiding excess capacity to maintain financial viability. They invest in assets where they can expect long-term traffic and revenues, managing capital budgeting like any other firm. The railroad industry, coal production, and power industries face long-term strategic investment decisions amidst uncertainties in future coal flows due to regulatory actions. Despite these uncertainties, investments in coal-related projects continue, complicating long-term planning for railroads. Producers and railroads seek assistance from the STB to plan for coal-sourcing shifts in the East. CSX cites a lack of solid information for capital expenditures. Wall Street pressures railroad management to reduce capital investments due to poor returns. Tight rail system capacity allows railroads to increase rates and profits. The BNSF CEO notes the rail market has reached an equilibrium of demand and capacity after 25 years. The GAO identifies a capacity-constrained environment. The GAO identified a capacity-constrained environment in the rail industry contributing to rate increases. Railroad capital spending is estimated to allocate 15-20% for capacity expansion, roughly $1-2 billion annually. Data on coal-specific capacity-expansion investments are variable, with BNSF's annual coal-related spending ranging from over $400 million to zero from 1994 to 2005. Investments in coal train loading and unloading facilities have increased system capacity by improving train utilization. However, historical data on spending by mining and power companies on rail-related infrastructure is lacking. Policy development would benefit from quantitative measures of railroad capacity utilization and service quality. The lack of public data on railroad capacity is due to the difficulty in measuring and defining rail system capacity, which is further complicated by the private ownership of rail networks. Despite challenges, making more data on rail system capacity publicly available is feasible. There are no standard definitions or measures of rail system capacity, making it challenging to determine the greatest possible output while maintaining a minimum acceptable level of service. The concept of rail system capacity is complex and lacks standard definitions or measures. It is influenced by factors such as track quality, single or double tracking, signaling systems, and service quality. Capacity is also determined by the cost of service and willingness of shippers to pay. Without considering cost, the concept of capacity is meaningless. Railroad network capacity is not a single metric but varies for each type of traffic, depending on factors like traffic mix, acceptable costs, and other variables. Estimates of rail system capacity are used by the industry, with drivers including volume, train density, physical plant elements, and productivity. While defining capacity utilization for an entire rail system in a single index may be questionable, it is possible to define capacity for key aspects. Railroads estimate the current and projected capacity of parts of their systems in order to make investments. Capacity varies for different corridors and categories of traffic, with some areas at capacity while others are not. For example, CSX and Union Pacific have reported capacity utilization for specific corridors like the Sunset Corridor and the South Central corridor. Railroads like BNSF and UP estimate the current and projected capacity of their systems to make investment decisions. CANAC, a rail engineering firm, evaluates PRB coal production forecasts and infrastructure capacity. Recommendations made in 1999 were implemented by September 2006. A new study of the Joint Line began in Fall 2005, prompting Union Pacific and BNSF to advance construction plans to meet projected growth in demand for Southern PRB coal. Developing a system-wide capacity index may be challenging, but corridor-specific capacity measures are being considered. The federal government does not collect data to estimate rail system capacity, and the railroad industry is not required to provide estimates. The National Industrial Transportation League suggested a joint project with the Association of American Railroads to create an objective measure of capacity for the rail industry. AAR expressed doubts about the value and feasibility of publishing capacity estimates. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) expressed doubts about creating a capacity metric for the rail system, citing complexity and potential misuse. Despite concerns, capacity estimates are used by railroads and the absence of published estimates may hinder informed analysis and decision-making. The Canadian National Railway suggested organizing efforts to project future traffic growth over capacity-constrained lanes for more efficient investment. Confidentiality issues regarding rail capacity data may be addressed by aggregating or masking published data if needed for rail policy development. The lack of national planning for rail congestion leads to a lack of systematic management of the nation's rail congestion needs. Individual railroads operate efficiently but there is no baseline for service or true measure of the country's rail system requirements. The national planning process for rail congestion is lacking due to the privately owned and operated rail network. Trends show a projected 60% growth in freight traffic by 2020, leading to a push for increased rail capacity to displace truck transportation. The national planning process for rail congestion is lacking due to the privately owned and operated rail network. Trends show a projected 60% growth in freight traffic by 2020, leading to a push for increased rail capacity with the primary goal of displacing growth in truck traffic. AASHTO estimates an unfunded annual need for $2.65 billion to $4.15 billion of additional freight-rail infrastructure improvements over 20 years, focusing on new capacity for general merchandise traffic on rail instead of trucks. However, cost estimates are considered 'first approximations' based on extrapolation from other studies and professional judgment. Long-term, system-wide cost estimates comparable to those for highways and transit systems do not exist. Rigorous national-level assessments of rail system capacity needs and expansion costs do not exist. Coal-fired power plants maintain coal stocks for short-term variability and emergencies, determining plant tolerance for delays in coal shipments. However, tying up working capital in large stockpiles incurs costs. Power plants may find it more economical to store more coal on-site rather than pay railroads for excess capacity. CSX CEO suggested utilities keep higher inventory levels for flexibility in case of supply chain unreliability. Having larger stockpiles could be a better economic tradeoff for utilities. The electric power industry has reduced coal stocks to improve financial results and cut inventory holding costs. Coal inventories are measured in \"days of burn\" and have declined since the 1970s. This reduction was influenced by factors such as decreased threat of coal miner strikes and opposition to larger stocks. Production shifted to non-union western mines, with opposition to larger stocks at state public utility commission rate hearings. Changes in coal inventory levels were influenced by performance guarantees in rail transportation contracts and the sale of coal-fired power plants to independent power producers (IPPs) after power market restructuring. IPPs, accounting for 24% of coal consumption by 2006, face more financial risk and potential rewards compared to utilities. Utilities have regulated rates and monopoly territories, while IPPs have more profit potential but lack regulatory benefits. The electric power industry, particularly independent power producers (IPPs), has been reducing coal inventories to cut costs and increase profits. This trend has been influenced by coal transportation issues and the shift towards longer supply chains from western coal mines. By reducing stockpiles, power companies are increasing their risk of coal supply interruptions. The electric power industry, especially independent power producers, has been decreasing coal inventories to save money and boost profits, increasing the risk of coal supply interruptions. In 2005, coal transportation problems led to a sharp decline in coal stocks, hitting record lows. Stocks began dropping in 2004, coinciding with decreased coal train speeds and claims of deteriorating rail service. Rail service has improved since the 2005 derailments in the Powder River Basin, with power companies rebuilding coal stockpiles. Electric power sector coal inventories increased to 51 days of burn in 2006, the highest since 2002. Both rail and power industries are pursuing cost-minimizing strategies, potentially impacting the reliability of the coal supply chain. The issue of cost-sharing for improving reliability between power companies and railroads remains unresolved. The trend towards increased coal stocks suggests power producers are bearing higher inventory costs to improve reliability. Rail system capacity constraints have led to degraded service quality for freight traffic, with serious consequences. The issue of cost-sharing for improving reliability between power companies and railroads remains unresolved. Rail system capacity constraints have led to degraded service quality for freight traffic, with major US railroads experiencing congestion due to mergers, bad weather, and spikes in demand. Customers have complained about long transit times and equipment shortages, with average train speeds declining in recent years. Coal trains have seen a drop in speed on major rail systems, leading to complaints from coal shippers about service quality. Despite recovering from the coal service disruption in 2005, some power plants were still not receiving their contracted coal tonnage. The increase in deliveries to Louisiana and Arkansas coal plants was achieved by adding trains, not by restoring pre-2005 standards. Faster trains enhance system capacity, while slower trains consume it. Rail service issues extend beyond coal traffic, with average speeds dropping for intermodal trains since 2002. Rail velocity for intermodal trains has not improved in the past 15 years, unlike other modes of transportation. UPS faces rail service issues in the Western U.S., while seeing improvements in the East. Different railroad companies have varying perspectives on service quality, with BNSF and CSX noting the need for improvement, while NS considers its service superior since 2003. The industry trade association highlights challenges in coal service. Rail carriers have become increasingly unwilling to provide strong service quality guarantees for coal shipments and other freight due to tightened rail capacity. According to NITL, obtaining meaningful service provisions in contracts is virtually impossible. Foundation Energy Sales testified that rail contracts often lack service requirements, while EEI stated that railroads are now unwilling to accept responsibility for guaranteed service. EEI stated that railroads are now unwilling to accept responsibility for guaranteed performance at any meaningful level, with service standards deteriorating over time. Railroads have gained more market power, leading to a decline in competition. The use of force majeure clauses to excuse delays in coal delivery has increased, but data to verify this claim is lacking. Data on railroad service is limited and anecdotal, with average freight traffic speed being the only available metric. The rail industry has been publishing a valuable set of service indicators since 1999, showing system-wide performance measures for each of the seven Class I railroads. These indicators include average speed of unit coal trains, intermodal trains, number of railcars on the system, and dwell time trains spend in key rail yards. However, the data is limited as it is not comparable between railroads and does not allow for identifying problem corridors. The AAR data on railroads is not comparable between carriers, limiting the ability to identify service issues. The metrics provided online for the most recent 53 weeks lack consistency before 2005 and may not include all measures used by the railroads. The Canadian National railroad uses a different methodology for performance measures. In 2005, major delays in PRB coal shipments occurred due to track instability caused by coal dust infiltration, leading to a months-long maintenance program and a delivery shortfall of about 30 million tons. UP and BNSF invoked force majeure clauses in their contracts to excuse non-performance. In 2005, major delays in PRB coal shipments occurred due to track instability caused by coal dust infiltration, leading to a months-long maintenance program and a delivery shortfall of about 30 million tons. The UP recommended power companies conserve coal, while BNSF stated that almost every BNSF-served plant using PRB coal was below target on inventory. Customers were unable to increase coal stockpiles until late 2005 or Spring of 2006, and it was advised to have contingency plans for alternate coal and transportation. The UP stopped accepting new customers for PRB coal service for almost two years from July 2005 to March 2007 due to service delays and lack of capacity. The UP system experienced a severe meltdown in 1997, leading to an emergency order allowing traffic diversion. The after-tax cost to UP was around $450 million, including lost business and customer claims. Disruptions in coal transportation date back to the 1970s, with significant events in the 1990s and beyond. Nine episodes of disrupted coal service since 1990 were identified, triggered by various factors like severe weather and capacity issues. The UP system experienced a severe meltdown in 1997, leading to an emergency order allowing traffic diversion. Disruptions in coal transportation date back to the 1970s, with significant events in the 1990s and beyond. Factors causing disruptions include severe weather, capacity issues, integrating merged rail systems, and major maintenance projects. Tight railroad capacity increases the chance of future disruptions in coal and other freight services. Transport systems become more fragile at full capacity, leading to breakdowns and longer recovery times. Evaluating the seriousness of this situation depends on understanding the consequences of past disruptions in coal transportation service. The shipper incurs costs to compensate for undelivered coal by purchasing power from other sources, finding alternative coal supplies, or increasing coal deliveries. These steps can prevent power plants from running out of coal but result in higher costs due to market-wide increases in coal prices and rail rates. The costs of transportation problems for a regulated electric utility may be passed on to ratepayers or absorbed in profits. Estimating direct costs involves creating a \"what-if\" scenario of power system operation without disruptions. Quantitative information on the costs of coal delivery shortfalls is scarce, with no comprehensive estimates available. Published estimates range from \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" to \"roughly $4-6 million.\" Estimates of costs related to electric power groups range from \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" to \"roughly $4-6 billion to the economy,\" but these estimates are undocumented. A list of 27 electric power generators that took steps to compensate for coal delivery shortfalls in 2005-06 is provided in Appendix B, compiled from various sources. Some entities reported incurring higher costs, while others did not disclose their costs for various reasons. The research uncovered reported costs totaling $228 million due to the 2005-06 rail transportation disruption in the electric power industry. Four entities accounted for almost 80% of these costs. Arkansas Electric Power Cooperative reported costs in the millions but did not provide a precise figure. These costs were incremental to normal operating expenses and do not include market-wide increases in coal and transportation prices. There is no comprehensive analysis of the overall costs and consequences of the disruption. The rail policy debate is plagued by information gaps, making it challenging to assess past and current rail service, transportation disruptions, and the need for government intervention. Despite rates not being the main focus, the relationship between rail system capacity and rates is crucial for evaluating legislation aimed at expanding capacity. Since 2004, there has been a \"pricing renaissance\" in the railroad industry, with rates increasing for the first time since the early 1980s, rising by approximately 10% in 2005. This significant change marks a reversal of a 20-year trend. The reversal of a 20-year trend in the railroad industry shows a significant change in rates, driven by capacity shortages and increased demand for coal and containerized imports. Despite declining service quality, railroads are now able to raise rates, with recent increases following a long period of decline. Rates for coal dropped more than the all-traffic average, with a significant decrease between 1985 and 2004 followed by a real dollar increase in 2005. The rate index declined by 40% between 1985 and 2004, with a 62% decline in real terms. In 2005, real coal rates increased by 13.3%, more than double the industry-wide average. The decline in coal and other rail rates was due to various factors such as railroad productivity gains, competition between railroads, surplus capacity, and the Staggers Act allowing customized contracts with shippers. The shift from declining to increasing rates happened abruptly. The shift from declining to increasing rail rates occurred abruptly around 2004 due to factors like tightening rail capacity, decreased capital spending, and increased intermodal traffic. Trucking capacity limitations and rising fuel costs also contributed to the growth in intermodal shipments. The trucking industry is facing challenges in recruiting and retaining drivers due to rising fuel costs and highway congestion. This has led to a shift towards intermodal rail for long-haul traffic, reducing the importance of trucks as a check on rail rates. Trucking companies are increasingly allocating trucks to intermodal pickups and deliveries, allowing railroads to carry containers over longer distances. This trend is seen as favorable to the rail industry in the long term. Some carriers are increasing purchases of rail intermodal containers, chassis, and trailers. Rates have risen due to higher fuel costs and industry consolidation. Railroads have been able to increase rates for coal shipments significantly. Rates for new coal transportation agreements have increased by 20% to 40% for shippers with competitive alternatives and by 40% to 70% for captive shippers. Rates for new PRB rail transportation agreements have generally declined since 1984 but saw a 100% increase from 2004 to 2006. The increase in rates extends beyond coal traffic, with new rates reportedly running 10% to 30% above pre-2004 levels as of late 2006. Railroads argue that higher rates are necessary for financial viability and capacity expansion. The UP railroad emphasizes the need for reinvestible rates to invest in capacity and expand traffic. Coal shippers criticize rate increases as unreasonable, but higher rates may be necessary for financial viability. The STB's rate appeals process is seen as ineffective in addressing unreasonable rate hikes. The 2006 GAO study of rail rates highlighted the potential abuse of market power by railroads. Legislative proposals in Congress aim to address rail service and rate issues through tax incentives and regulatory restructuring. S. 1125 and H.R. 2116 were introduced to improve coal transportation reliability to power plants. The Freight Rail Infrastructure Capacity Expansion Act of 2006 (FRICEA) aims to address freight congestion on highways by increasing capacity on railroads. It includes a 25% tax credit for rail investments to incentivize capital spending. Funding constraints may hinder railroads from meeting future infrastructure needs on their own. The Freight Rail Infrastructure Capacity Expansion Act of 2006 includes a tax credit for rail investments to incentivize capacity expansion. The tax credit is available to any taxpayer making qualified investments, not just railroads. Another incentive allows immediate deduction of qualifying rail capital investments from gross income to enhance modal tax equity. This aims to address the discrepancy in tax treatment between railroads and other freight modes like trucks and barges. The tax treatment of freight investment costs aims to level the financial playing field between transportation modes. Advocates argue for modal equity in tax treatment to optimize resource allocation, potentially increasing rail capacity investment. Concerns arise over whether trucks and barges fully cover the public infrastructure costs, with estimates showing they may only pay 50-80% and 20% respectively. The tax treatment of freight investment costs aims to achieve modal equity in tax treatment to optimize resource allocation. Inland waterways pay only about 20 percent of the Corps of Engineers' navigation project costs, leading to inefficient resource use. FRICEA defines two main categories of railroad property, excluding land and rail cars from Qualified Freight Rail Infrastructure Property. The tax credit applies to investments in Qualified Freight Rail Infrastructure Property and Qualified Locomotive Property, excluding land and rail cars. To qualify as \"new,\" the property or locomotive must increase capacity and meet EPA emission standards. Infrastructure property that replaces existing property does not qualify as \"new\" except for expanded or replacement bridges and tunnels. The tax credit under FRICEA applies to Qualified Freight Rail Infrastructure Property to increase rail capacity. Qualified Locomotive Property that is not \"New\" does not qualify for the tax incentive. The tax credit reduces investment basis for tax depreciation calculations and cannot be combined with the expense option on the same investment dollar. FRICEA is effective for investments made between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2012, aiming to enhance system capacity for coal and other shippers while promoting a more reliable rail network and reducing freight traffic on highways. The discussion of FRICEA policy issues focuses on control of tax incentives, meeting investment expectations, and tracking results. The rail industry sees an advantage in leaving investment decisions to the railroads. The issue of modal-neutral funding and potential revenue offsets under Congressional rules is also mentioned. The rail industry believes that railroads are best equipped to identify chokepoints and determine where infrastructure expansion would be most beneficial. Some shippers and the government are concerned about lack of control over incentives under FRICEA. The American Public Power Association insists that any tax credit for railroad infrastructure must be accompanied by necessary reforms. The GAO has raised doubts about the effectiveness of rail tax incentives, citing difficulties in encouraging investment. The rail industry believes railroads are best suited to identify infrastructure needs. Concerns exist over lack of control over incentives under FRICEA. The effectiveness of rail tax credits in encouraging investment is questioned. Investments triggered by FRICEA could impact coal shipments if focused on intermodal traffic. The rail industry believes railroads are best suited to identify infrastructure needs, but concerns exist over lack of control over incentives under FRICEA. Specific qualifications shippers recommend for FRICEA include tying the credit to mandatory railroad reliability standards and focusing on capacity expansion for domestic shipments. Regulatory oversight is recommended to ensure the tax credit is used in the public interest. Mixing intermodal trains with bulk freight trains can consume network capacity rapidly and cause delays for other traffic. The proposed qualifications for FRICEA lack specificity and may be difficult to implement, potentially requiring individual government review for each investment. This level of scrutiny could hinder the additional investment the program aims to promote. It is important to note that the railroad shipper community is diverse, with different interests, such as intermodal shippers who may not support restrictions that direct investments towards specific groups. Intermodal shippers may not back restrictions favoring captive coal traffic. Some shippers, like the National Mining Association and TXU, support FRICEA. Congress could explore less intrusive restrictions, like targeting investments with system-wide impacts. This approach could complement current public-private partnerships for rail projects. The alternative approach to directing FRICEA investments may require less federal supervision but has potential disadvantages, including pre-judging investments, limited tax incentives, and constraints on private sector managers. Information on rail capacity and service quality is limited, leading to differing views on current issues and benefits. The differing views on current capacity and service issues, benefits, and success for FRICEA are most pronounced between shippers, like power producers, and railroads. Shippers seek fast, reliable service and sufficient capacity, while railroads are cautious about investing in excess capacity. The rail industry has tightened capacity by increasing efficiency and not overbuilding, leading to higher rates and revenues. While this has impacted service reliability for some shippers, it has been positive for investors. In early 2007, railroads were buoyed by new financial reports. In early 2007, railroads were buoyed by new financial reports validating their strategy of maintaining tight capacity and firm pricing. The rail industry emphasizes the pricing advantages of limited surplus capacity, leading to increased value for services and improved returns. Companies like BNSF and CSX have focused on reducing excess capacity to drive profitability, with demand for services outstripping supply. UP aims to leverage strong demand to improve revenue yield by swapping out less efficient assets. The strategy of minimizing excess capacity to support prices is not unique to the railroad industry, as seen in other industries like electric power. Warren Buffett emphasizes the importance of having some excess capacity for safety and wise utility regulation. In a deregulated market, operators have an incentive to reduce reserves to drive profitability. The railroad industry may deliberately maintain tight capacity to increase pricing power, especially in highly concentrated markets. However, the effectiveness of the Federal Railroad Infrastructure Capacity Expansion Act (FRICEA) in improving rail system service and resiliency is uncertain due to limited public data on capacity and service metrics. This raises questions about the impact of FRICEA on coal capacity and service changes. The Federal Railroad Infrastructure Capacity Expansion Act (FRICEA) may not require defining a service and capacity baseline or detailing investments using FRICEA incentives. Confidentiality of data from railroads, coal producers, and power companies may be a concern. Congress may need better public data on rail capacity and service, which could be addressed by aggregating or masking published data. Key issues for evaluating tax incentive proposals include public influence on FRICEA incentives and how to manage confidentiality concerns. The Federal Railroad Infrastructure Capacity Expansion Act (FRICEA) raises questions about practicality, burden, and expected outcomes. Coal and other shippers seek a resilient rail network but face challenges in investment and industry dynamics. The government may need more data on rail capacity and service to evaluate FRICEA's effectiveness. The 110th Congress is considering rail regulatory restructuring bills to address concerns raised by coal and other shippers regarding rail service and rates. The bills fall into two categories: comprehensive restructuring and repeal of railroad antitrust exemptions. S. 953, the Railroad Competition and Service Improvement Act of 2007 (RCSIA), is one of the bills introduced for discussion. Legal analysis of the bills and disagreements on the application of antitrust laws to the railroad industry are not covered in this report. The Railroad Competition and Service Improvement Act of 2007 (RCSIA) was introduced in the 110th Congress to ensure competition in the rail industry, reliable rail service, and a process for challenging rate disputes. The bill aims to amend federal rail regulation to emphasize head-to-head competition, reasonable rates, and efficient rail transportation service. The Railroad Competition and Service Improvement Act of 2007 (RCSIA) aims to ensure competition, reasonable rates, and efficient rail transportation service. A rail bottleneck occurs when only one railroad has physical access to a customer, allowing them to charge high rates. The Surface Transportation Board (STB) has authority to address bottlenecks through reciprocal switching and joint terminal access, but this authority is narrowly construed. The Railroad Competition and Service Improvement Act of 2007 (RCSIA) allows shippers to open bottlenecks and create competitive rail access, potentially reversing the policy of keeping shipments on a single railroad's tracks. RCSIA aims to promote competition, reasonable rates, and efficient rail transportation service. Section 105 of RCSIA allows a Governor to petition the STB to designate an \"area of inadequate rail competition\" if served by one carrier with rates exceeding 180 percent of direct costs, causing economic adversity. The STB must provide remedies within 60 days, including reciprocal switching and expedited arbitration of rate disputes. The Rail Competition and Service Improvement Act (RCSIA) aims to ban \"paper barriers\" or \"interchange commitments\" that restrict short line railroads from interchanging certain traffic with other carriers. This would increase competition in the rail system, but implementing the ban could be complex and contentious due to existing agreements with such restrictions. The Rail Competition and Service Improvement Act (RCSIA) aims to eliminate interchange restrictions that impact sale prices and lease rates for Class I railroads. This could have unpredictable effects on rates, operations, and transaction viability. The bill includes provisions for rail service quality, such as requiring reliable and efficient transportation, addressing timely delivery failures, and prioritizing contract service over common carrier service. The Rail Competition and Service Improvement Act (RCSIA) includes provisions for creating an Office of Rail Customer Advocacy within DOT to handle rail customer complaints and participate in STB proceedings. Shippers of agricultural products can demand binding arbitration for service and rate issues, but this option is not available for coal or other goods. The current STB rate appeal process has been criticized as ineffective, especially by coal and other shipper interests. Since the passage of Staggers, most rate cases have involved coal shipments to power plants due to the significant volume and revenue at stake. The Rail Competition and Service Improvement Act (RCSIA) directs the STB to develop a new rate appeal process based on a railroad's cost of service, similar to electric utility rate cases. This process aims to be completed within nine months, reduce litigation costs, and shift the burden of proof to the railroad to demonstrate the reasonableness of the rate. It also prohibits using the cost of a hypothetical competitor in the appeal process. The rate appeal process, under the Rail Competition and Service Improvement Act (RCSIA), allows agricultural shippers to opt-out and use binding arbitration. It is designed to let railroads charge captive customers rates that include system-wide costs. A cost-based rate appeal process could reduce non-attributable costs significantly. A cost-based rate appeal process could potentially reduce non-attributable costs for captive customers in the railroad industry. However, the financial impact on the industry is uncertain due to insufficient information on rail competition, rates, and revenue adequacy. Section 401 of the bill would allow the STB to initiate investigations on its own, suspend railroad practices believed to be unlawful, and respond within 90 days to complaints requesting injunctive relief. Similar legislation was introduced in previous sessions of Congress but did not progress further. The bills aim to amend antitrust laws for railroads, eliminating exemptions that are against the public interest. The exemptions historically allowed the rail industry to coordinate rates and operate in ways not acceptable in a free market. The ICC Termination Act of 1995 continued these exemptions, including allowing the STB to initiate investigations and suspend unlawful practices. The Congress chose to continue exemptions for railroads in 1995, giving the Surface Transportation Board (STB) sole jurisdiction over railroad mergers. Railroads are generally exempt from Sherman Act antitrust actions for treble damages if government-approved rates are involved. Joint rates approved by the STB are also exempt from antitrust review, limiting avenues for antitrust inquiry. The proposed legislation aims to eliminate exemptions for railroads from antitrust laws, potentially allowing for challenges to bottleneck rates and paper barriers. Advocates believe this could lead to more scrutiny of rail mergers by the Department of Justice (DOJ) compared to the Surface Transportation Board (STB). The railroads oppose these antitrust proposals. The railroads oppose antitrust proposals, stating they are already subject to antitrust laws and STB regulation. Exemptions are narrowly applied to prevent dual jurisdiction and address special circumstances, such as preventing interruptions in rail operations. The proposed changes are deemed unnecessary as the STB can enforce antitrust laws and the federal government can seek injunctive relief. The AAR argues that the federal government can seek injunctive relief and there is no exclusion for railroads in antitrust provisions. Proponents of legislation want to change decisions made by the STB. Regulatory restructuring bills aim to improve rail service and lower rates. Proponents aim to improve rail service and lower rates by introducing measures to increase competition and tie rates to costs. The railroad industry opposes these proposals, arguing they would hinder pricing and operational freedom, leading to financial and service quality setbacks. According to the AAR, reregulation could result in significant revenue losses for U.S. freight railroads, impacting their ability to fund necessary capacity improvements. The rail industry opposes measures to increase competition and tie rates to costs, fearing it would hinder pricing and operational freedom, leading to financial setbacks. Critics argue for more innovation and customer focus, while the industry claims to be at the forefront of technological advancements. The National Industrial Transportation League expressed concerns about the potential impact of reregulation on revenue and capacity improvements. The Industrial Transportation League emphasizes the importance of competition in the rail market to drive efficiencies, innovation, and growth. They believe that competition leads to cooperation between transportation providers and customers, resulting in improved service and increased demand. The current restructuring proposals aim to enhance service by increasing competition, aligning with the regulatory regime's focus on allowing competition to establish reasonable rates for transportation services. The bills aim to establish reasonable rates for rail transportation through competition, but it is uncertain if market forces will truly be the outcome. They do not mandate specific rail service standards or address limited information on rail service and capacity. The emphasis on rate relief and competition assumes high rail rates are a significant national issue, but there is a lack of thorough analysis on captive shippers and rates paid. According to a 2006 study by GAO, shippers in certain markets may be paying excessive rates due to lack of competition. While captivity in the freight railroad industry seems to be decreasing, captive shippers are still paying well above the threshold for rate relief. This could be due to reasonable economic practices or market power abuse. A more thorough analysis of competitive markets nationally is necessary to assess competition and pricing practices accurately. The GAO recommended that the STB conduct a comprehensive study of rail competition and rates, which the STB initially rejected but later agreed to in 2007. The effectiveness of the legislation, particularly RCSIA, is uncertain as it will depend on how it is implemented. The implementation of reciprocal switching in railroads may not align with the intended objectives. A new competing railroad would have to pay a fee to the incumbent railroad for using its tracks, potentially eroding the competitive value. The recommended approach aims to keep the incumbent financially whole but could hinder competition. The Rail Competition and Service Improvement Act (RCSIA) requires the STB to replace its current rate appeal process with a cost of service approach similar to other regulatory systems. However, traditional utility rate cases can be complex, time-consuming, and expensive. RCSIA's nine-month time limit on rate cases may not significantly impact the accessibility and affordability of the process. Section 105 of RCSIA allows the STB to designate areas of inadequate rail competition and implement various remedies, making it challenging to assess its geographic and regulatory scope and impact on rail rates, revenues, service, and profits. The Rail Competition and Service Improvement Act (RCSIA) may reintroduce regulation into the rail industry, posing challenges for the STB in creating a regulatory framework and handling increased workload. The impact of rail restructuring proposals on returning the industry to financial health is uncertain, as they may reduce railroad revenues and profits. The STB, a small agency with limited resources, may struggle to effectively execute additional duties under RCSIA. The restructuring proposals could reduce railroad revenues and profits, potentially crippling the industry. This could lead to deteriorating service for coal and other shippers. The proposals may change the current approach to railroad rate setting, known as \"constrained market pricing,\" which was developed in 1985 by the ICC. This approach is based on the principles that the railroad industry is not revenue adequate and must be able to price its services based on customer price sensitivity. Demand-sensitive differential pricing is widely used in the rail industry, where rates to captive customers are constrained by the option to appeal to the STB if rates exceed 180% of direct costs. The Surface Transportation Board (STB) allows shippers to appeal rates that exceed 180% of direct costs if they are captive customers. The STB then compares rates to the costs of a hypothetical most-efficient competitor to determine a rate ceiling. Constrained market pricing in the rail industry aims to help achieve financial recovery by charging high rates to captive customers and low rates to those with competitive options. Rail restructuring proposals could impact this pricing system by reducing the number of captive shippers and the rates they pay. The rail industry's constrained market pricing system may be affected by rail restructuring proposals, potentially impacting captive shippers and the rates they pay. If the industry is revenue adequate, it could better withstand competition and regulation changes, leading to lower costs, greater efficiency, and better service. However, if regulatory restructuring undermines the industry's finances, it could result in deteriorating rail service for coal and other traffic. This raises concerns about balancing lower rates with maintaining quality service. The Norfolk Southern CEO highlighted the challenge of meeting rail customers' demands for more capacity, better service, and lower rates. There is a lack of consensus on how to reconcile these conflicting priorities, with some suggesting that increased competition could drive innovation and efficiency. It is important to assess whether the rail industry is achieving the objectives set by the Staggers Act. The STB annually determines revenue adequacy for Class I railroads, but the reliability of these determinations is questionable. The ICC's methodology for revenue adequacy dates back to a 1981 decision, focusing on whether a railroad's return on investment equals its cost of investment capital. Adequate revenues are crucial for railroads to compete for financing and maintain their facilities and services. The ICC emphasizes the importance of railroads earning a fair market rate of return to retain investments and attract new capital. Revenue adequacy is a long-term concept requiring a return on investment equal to the cost of capital over time. The ICC does not specify a specific period for achieving this threshold, as it varies based on the carrier's traffic base and economic stability. The ICC emphasizes the importance of railroads earning a fair market rate of return to retain investments and attract new capital. Revenue adequacy is a long-term concept requiring a return on investment equal to the cost of capital over time. The ICC does not guarantee any railroad a return equal to the cost of capital, stating that railroads should earn such a return only if they provide a desired service efficiently. The financial performance of the railroad industry has been poor, with the Class I railroad industry as a whole never being revenue adequate over 27 years. The ICC and STB made 445 individual determinations of revenue adequacy for railroad companies, finding them to be lacking in revenue. The ICC and STB made 445 determinations of revenue adequacy for railroad companies, finding them lacking in revenue. Railroads were found to be revenue adequate in just 32 instances, with the Union Pacific, CSX, and BNSF having few findings. The consistent inability of the railroad industry to achieve revenue adequacy over a quarter century could lead to capital shortages and disinvestment. The only valid test of revenue adequacy is that railroad revenues yield a rate of return equal to the opportunity cost of capital. The ICC and STB found that railroad companies were lacking in revenue adequacy, with only 32 instances of revenue adequacy out of 445 determinations. The railroad industry consistently fell short of achieving revenue adequacy over a quarter century, leading to potential capital shortages and disinvestment. The key point is that railroad revenues must yield a rate of return equal to the opportunity cost of capital to remain competitive in the market for funds. Despite this, railroads continued to invest billions in their systems, even when unable to earn a rate of return equal to the cost of capital. The rail industry consistently fell short of achieving revenue adequacy over a quarter century, leading to potential capital shortages and disinvestment. Despite this, railroads continued to invest billions in their systems, even when unable to earn a rate of return equal to the cost of capital. Optimistic investors put money into the industry in anticipation of financial results that were not realized, leading to discrepancies between revenue adequacy and available investment capital. The ICC made adjustments to its methodology in 1986 after realizing it did not accurately reflect the state of the rail industry. According to Standard and Poor's, the rail industry is considered unhealthy until it earns at least its cost of capital, but some believe it is actually fit as a fiddle. The rail industry has struggled to achieve revenue adequacy for over a quarter century, leading to potential capital shortages. Despite this, railroads continued to invest billions in their systems. The ICC's definition of cost of capital is questioned, with discrepancies between revenue adequacy conclusions and statements made by railroads to financial analysts. This raises doubts about the accuracy of financial tests in determining industry health. The STB's methodology for determining the rail industry's financial performance has faced criticism, particularly regarding the cost of equity capital estimation. Critics argue that the Board's approach may underestimate the industry's actual financial performance, leading to uncertainty about the accuracy of STB determinations. The STB uses a \"single-stage discounted cash flow\" (DCF) model to estimate the cost of equity, but critics argue that using the current high growth rate of the railroads in the DCF formula leads to an overstated cost of equity. This methodological pitfall is well-documented in financial literature. The STB proposed changing the cost of equity estimation method from the DCF model to CAPM in 2007. The new method could significantly reduce the railroad industry's overall cost of capital, making it revenue adequate in 2005. This adjustment highlights a potential issue with the STB's revenue adequacy methodology. The STB's revenue adequacy methodology aims to assess the financial state of the railroad industry using a single measure. However, the complexity of financial analysis, especially in determining the cost of equity capital, raises doubts about the reliability of this approach. The literature on estimating equity costs is vast and lacks a universally accepted definition, leading to methodological uncertainty in using a single financial ratio for revenue adequacy assessment. The appropriate rate of return for utility rate hearings is typically determined through a contested process, not just a formula. Financial models can provide a 'zone of reasonableness' for return on equity, but the exact determination is subjective and requires judgment. Prior to the Staggers Act, the ICC used a qualitative evaluation of multiple financial indicators instead of relying on a single financial ratio for revenue adequacy assessment. The ICC adopted a methodology in 1981 for revenue adequacy assessment, rejecting a multi-indicator standard due to subjectivity. The STB noted advantages of the ICC's method but acknowledged the challenge of avoiding judgment in revenue adequacy determination. The CAPM approach proposed by the STB for future determinations also requires specific assumptions. The STB notes disputes over applying the CAPM model and the need for judgment in financial analysis. There is no consensus on revenue adequacy in the railroad industry, with opinions varying on achieving returns equal to cost of capital. The Financial Times reported in 2007 that industry consolidation and solid demand have improved pricing in the rail sector, allowing it to earn its cost of capital. However, there are concerns about how long this trend can continue. A study in 2005 found that rail industry returns were approaching but had not yet reached the industry cost of capital. A transportation investment analyst testified in 2001 that railroads do not earn their cost of capital and actually destroy capital every year. The STB's revenue adequacy determinations may not be reliable for evaluating the industry's financial condition and regulatory restructuring proposals. The regulatory restructuring proposals aim to address coal and other rail service issues, including rates and competitive access. Existing data on service, capacity, and market power for captive shippers are incomplete. There is a need for ongoing data analysis by executive agencies. The STB plans a one-time study on rail competition and rates. Congress may evaluate the financial condition of railroads to determine revenue adequacy. The regulatory restructuring proposals aim to address rail service issues, including rates and competitive access. The financial state of the railroads needs rigorous analysis to determine revenue adequacy. Implementation details of the proposals are undefined, leading to uncertain outcomes. The curr_chunk discusses the potential for improving coal rail service through limited regulatory changes, such as increasing public visibility of rail service issues, creating a rail public advocate, and implementing new requirements for reliable rail service. It also includes appendices detailing significant disruptions in coal deliveries to power generators since 1990 and the costs of a disruption in rail transportation of coal in 2005-2006."
