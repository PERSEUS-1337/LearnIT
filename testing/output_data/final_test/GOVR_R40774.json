    "content": "The Constitution grants Congress the power of the purse, allowing them to spend, collect revenue, and borrow. Congress has developed rules and practices for budget-related legislation, with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 establishing the current framework. This act includes the annual adoption of a concurrent resolution on the budget to set spending levels, revenue, surplus/deficit, and public debt. Standing committees in both chambers of Congress oversee the budget resolution. The House Budget Committee's structure includes members from Ways and Means, Appropriations, and Rules committees, with guaranteed representation for revenue-raising and discretionary spending matters. This setup allows for continued involvement in decisions affecting each committee's jurisdiction. The House Budget Committee has 39 members, with term limits of four in any six successive Congresses. Members have increased participation in committee activities through rotating and representational membership. The House Democratic Caucus has additional term limits, while the House Republican Conference does not have a comparable rule. The House Budget Committee has 39 members with term limits of four in any six successive Congresses. Members have increased participation through rotating and representational membership. The Budget Committee is designated as a nonexclusive committee for both Democrats and Republicans. It has jurisdiction derived from the Budget Act and House Rule X, with no subcommittees but occasional task forces on specific issues. The Budget Committee in the House has jurisdiction over budget-related matters and must approve bills before they can be considered. Its responsibilities include the budget resolution, reconciliation, budget process reform, oversight of the Congressional Budget Office, and enforcing special controls over the federal budget. The Budget Committee in the House is responsible for developing the annual budget resolution, which sets spending and revenue levels. It can initiate changes in tax and spending policy through the resolution, but other committees handle legislation implementation. The Budget Committee in the House focuses on developing the budget resolution by examining budget projections, the President's budget request, and holding hearings with key officials. This committee sets the parameters for legislation consideration in the House. The Budget Committee in the House analyzes the President's budget and compares it to CBO's assumptions. They gather information from other House committees, hold hearings with Members testifying, and receive \"views and estimates\" from committees on budget preferences and plans. House rules require committees to submit estimates of new budget authority and outlays within six weeks of the President's budget submission. During budget resolution deliberations, the Budget Committee uses CBO baseline data as a starting point. They develop and mark up the budget resolution, allowing for the offering of amendments to budget aggregates and functional categories. Subsequent amendments can be offered even if categories have already been amended. After adopting aggregates and categories, the budget resolution text is considered for further amendment before a final vote on reporting it. The final vote on reporting the budget resolution occurs after the House and Senate adopt their own versions and agree to reconcile differences in conference. The Budget Committee represents the House in negotiations, and a joint explanatory statement accompanies the conference report with spending allocations. The budget resolution divides spending among 20 functional categories, not corresponding to committee jurisdictions. The Senate operates with spending levels allocated to committees based on 302(a) allocations from the budget resolution. Conference committees determine these allocations, which may include reconciliation instructions for committees to develop legislation aligning with the budget resolution. The Budget Committee is responsible for packaging legislative language recommended by committees into reconciliation bills without substantive revision. If only one committee is instructed to make changes, those changes are reported directly to the chamber. The Budget Committee cannot make substantive revisions to the reconciliation legislation recommended by committees, but may collaborate with House leadership on alternatives for floor amendments. The Budget Committee has jurisdiction over the budget process and can propose rule changes in the budget resolution or as a separate measure. They may create task forces to research potential reform issues and hold hearings to gather input from various sources. For example, during the 105th Congress, a Task Force on Budget Process was created. The 105th Congress Budget Committee created the Nussle-Cardin Task Force to examine budget reform issues and recommend changes, including making the budget resolution a joint resolution. Budget resolutions impacting House rules are referred to the Rules Committee. The Budget Act established the Congressional Budget Office, with oversight responsibility given to the Budget Committee. The Budget Committee oversees the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), reviewing its functions and duties. This includes holding hearings to examine CBO practices. The Budget Committee also plays a role in selecting the CBO Director, with recommendations from the House and Senate Budget Committees. The Budget Chair has authority to revise budget levels in annual resolutions. The Budget Committee has the authority to adjust budget levels and other matters in the annual budget resolution through provisions known as \"reserve funds.\" These funds allow for adjustments to committee spending allocations under certain conditions, such as legislation being reported or amendments being offered. Deficit-neutral reserve funds require any excess spending to be offset by equivalent reductions elsewhere. The Budget Committee Chair can adjust committee spending allocations to prevent a point of order under Section 302 of the Budget Act. The \"fungibility rule\" allows for adjustments to budget resolution levels when committees are instructed to develop legislation that changes revenue and direct spending laws. The Budget Act permits further revisions to the budget resolution. For more details, refer to CRS Report RL33122. The Budget Committee provides summary budget scorekeeping reports to Members of the House monthly to measure the budgetary effects of legislation against budget resolution levels. The Parliamentarian relies on these reports to determine if legislation violates fiscal limits. The Budget Committee provides monthly budget scorekeeping reports to the Parliamentarian to determine if legislation violates fiscal limits. The Director of CBO issues tabulations of congressional budget action to assist the Budget Committee in scorekeeping. The Budget Committee provides scorekeeping reports to the Speaker for each fiscal year, following established procedures."
