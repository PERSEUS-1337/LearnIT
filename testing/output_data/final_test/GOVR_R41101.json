The policy aims to streamline the process and avoid administrative issues. The cost-share policy for FEMA's public assistance program, established in 1980, requires state and local governments to pay 25 percent of eligible costs. In 1988, amendments to the Stafford Act set a minimum federal share of 75 percent for disaster assistance. States must have accumulated over $133 in damages per capita to qualify for a cost-share waiver for certain sections of the Act. The federal share for disaster assistance is set at a minimum of 75 percent of eligible costs, as stated in the Stafford Act. This includes various types of emergency assistance such as overtime payments for safety personnel, reimbursements for state actions like evacuation plans, and provision of federal resources. Section 406 covers the repair or replacement of public infrastructure in categories like debris removal, emergency protective measures, road systems, and water control. Assistance for debris removal under Section 407 is generally used for the clearance of debris from publicly owned lands, including main public roads. Non-profit organizations providing critical services may also be eligible for this assistance. FEMA has made cost-share adjustments for Public Assistance categories C through G in less than 0.5% of all major disasters declared since 1985. An exceptional event is required for a state to qualify for a reduction in cost-share, with adjustments from 25% to 10% significantly reducing costs for state and local governments. The cost-share amount was set at $64 per capita for the Midwest floods of 1993, with FEMA increasing this through rulemaking in 1999. The $64 amount had been in use since 1985, and adjusting it to current dollars in 1999 was necessary. The per capita amount for cost-share adjustments increased from $64 in 1985 to $133 in 2013, exceeding FEMA's disaster declaration threshold. Concerns were raised about the lack of analysis in raising the threshold, potentially discouraging states from implementing mitigation measures. FEMA's response did not address the issue of individual state capabilities. FEMA's response acknowledged the need to adjust the $64 threshold for disaster economic impact. They are open to working with states on cost-share adjustments but see it as a separate long-term effort. Commenters suggested lowering the threshold to $50 per capita, but FEMA believes in adjusting the 1985 threshold annually using the Consumer Price Index. Some question FEMA's per capita threshold for disaster grants, suggesting it may be too high for states to qualify for reduced cost-share. In catastrophic events like Hurricane Katrina, the cost-share was adjusted early on, while in others like Hurricane Floyd, waivers were granted. In 1999, Hurricane Floyd hit North Carolina, and the cost-share waiver was not granted until one year later when eligible costs exceeded the state per-capita threshold. The time taken to determine the threshold can impact decision-making at the state and local levels. A total of 244 cost-share adjustments have been made for major disaster declarations in the last 24 years. The waivers can be categorized into repairs/replacements, U.S. territories, limited time waivers, and other historical waivers. Category 1 and Category 2 represent cost-share adjustments for the PA program, with Category 1 focusing on adjustments beyond emergency work and Category 2 providing adjustments to U.S. territories. U.S. territories account for over 25% of all cost-share adjustments, with waivers granted for various reasons detailed in the report. The Insular Areas Act allows for waivers of local matching funds under $200,000 for U.S. territories like American Samoa, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands. Category 3 cost-share adjustments are short-term waivers based on FEMA's judgment of severity, ranging from 48 hours to 319 days. These waivers provide limited relief at the start of disasters. The regulation allows for up to 100% Federal funding for emergency work in the initial days of a disaster, based on FEMA's discretion. Over 40% of approved cost-share adjustments have been for a limited time period, with recent trends showing a preference for this approach. Recent trends in emergency declarations show a shift towards using emergency authority primarily for Direct Federal Assistance (DFA), funded by the federal government. This targeted approach aims to aid state and local governments quickly and decisively during the emergency phase, such as clearing debris from major roads for expedited recovery. While valuable, some argue that FEMA should have this option available early on in a disaster. The growing frequency of cost-share adjustments reflects the increased scope and impact of large scale disasters, with state and local governments expecting cost-share waivers to be more common. This shift in policy has led to discussions on the intergovernmental response to disasters. The intergovernmental response to disasters often involves tensions over federal funding control and cost-share waivers for emergency work and infrastructure repair. Regulations stipulate per capita amounts and damage estimates for waivers, with a recommendation for up to 100% federal funding for emergency work in the initial days of a disaster. During disasters, federal funding control and cost-share waivers for emergency work and infrastructure repair can lead to tensions. Regulations specify per capita amounts and damage estimates for waivers, with a recommendation for up to 100% federal funding in the initial days of the disaster. Extended periods of cost-waivers have been seen in events like those in Alabama and Missouri in 2011. Congress also included cost-share waivers for Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Wilma, and Dennis, providing relief for the Other Needs Assistance program. The ONA waiver provided effective relief for states absorbing costs during disasters. The ONA program helps pay for personal belongings, medical expenses, and furniture. The federal share for ONA is fixed at 75%, requiring legislation to adjust. The IHP program includes 100% federal funding for temporary housing. The HMGP cost-share waiver has only been granted once for the WTC declaration in 2001. The President can contribute up to 75% for hazard mitigation measures under Section 404 of the Stafford Act. The President can contribute up to 75% of the cost of hazard mitigation measures. Cost-share reduction legislation for the Gulf Coast did not address the HMGP section, keeping the cost-share at 75% federal and 25% state and local. The declaration for New York after 9/11 required no cost-share for hazard mitigation work. The federal contribution for the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program can be up to five percent of the estimated aggregate amount of grants. The Hazard Mitigation Grant Program allows the President to contribute up to 75% of the cost of hazard mitigation measures. Congress has provided a formula under P.L. 109-295 to determine the amount of funds available for hazard mitigation based on the size of disasters. This formula adjusts the percentage of funds based on the estimated damages, with the majority of disaster declarations receiving a 15% federal contribution. The cost-share policy under the Stafford Act was influenced by the Mount Saint Helens volcano eruption in 1980. The principle of states having a financial stake in their recovery was a key aspect of federal assistance programs. During the 1980s, the cost-share policy was not a major topic of discussion. In response to the devastation caused by Hurricane Hugo and Hurricane Andrew, FEMA and the President George H.W. Bush Administration developed a formula to reduce the cost-share burden on heavily impacted states like Florida and Louisiana. For Hurricane Andrew, federal funding was 75 percent for the first $10 per capita of State population and then 100 percent for all remaining costs. Florida paid a cost-share of about $33 million, while Louisiana paid $10.5 million. The total assistance provided was $718 million, with FEMA covering all costs above $132 million. The federal cost-share for Florida was 95.6% and for Louisiana was 87%. The formula for cost-share adjustments after the 1993 multi-state floods along the Mississippi included a per capita amount of $64 and a threshold based on the national GDP. The nine Midwestern states impacted by the flooding qualified for a reduced cost-share based on this threshold. Total cost projections for these states at the time of adjustment totaled $900 million. The flooding of the Red River in 1997 was a significant disaster event for North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota. North Dakota qualified for a cost-share adjustment with per capita costs of $617, South Dakota with $94, but Minnesota did not meet the threshold with $61 per capita damage. Disaster costs never reached 0.1% of the GDP in 1993, which was over $6.6 trillion. In 1997, Minnesota did not meet the per capita damage threshold for disaster assistance despite President Clinton and House leaders promising help. Legislative changes in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 ensured that assistance to Minnesota counties affected by the Red River flooding would be at least 90 percent. This was the first legislative waiver of disaster costs for state and local governments since 1980. The 110th Congress deliberated on cost-share waivers for disaster assistance programs, including waivers based on per capita thresholds and legislative waivers regardless of damage amounts. The attention was warranted due to the significant cost-share reductions granted in the legislation, including a waiver of all state and local cost-shares for four programs under the Stafford Act. The 110th Congress deliberated on cost-share waivers for disaster assistance programs, including waivers based on per capita thresholds and legislative waivers regardless of damage amounts. The legislation included a waiver of all state and local cost-shares for four programs under the Stafford Act, with the federal share set at 75%. Section 4501 of P.L. 110-28 specified the federal share of assistance for states affected by Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma, Dennis, and Rita. The 110th Congress deliberated on cost-share waivers for disaster assistance programs, including waivers based on per capita thresholds and legislative waivers regardless of damage amounts. Legislation included a waiver of all state and local cost-shares for four programs under the Stafford Act, with the federal share set at 75%. Per capita damage for Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama from Hurricane Katrina, and for Louisiana from Hurricane Rita, had already been accounted for in the waivers provided for five states. The 110th Congress considered cost-share waivers for disaster assistance programs, including waivers for states affected by hurricanes. Legislation included waivers for all state and local cost-shares for certain programs, with the federal share set at 75%. The decision to include Florida and Texas in the waivers may have been to avoid separating related damages from a devastating hurricane season. The waivers were also granted in recognition of the assistance provided by these states to Mississippi and Louisiana in 2005. The \"Limitation\" in the legislation aimed to ensure that waivers were only granted for pre-existing projects related to the event. The legislation provides cost-share waivers for disaster assistance programs, with a 90% federal, 10% state and local cost-share for projects not submitted prior to the bill's enactment. Congress has previously adjusted state cost-shares, including reducing them for states affected by Hurricane Rita in 2006. The legislation aims to treat all counties and parishes equally for cost-share adjustments under the Stafford Act following Hurricane Rita, recognizing Texas' efforts in sheltering evacuees from Hurricane Katrina. This helps lessen Texas' cost-share for public assistance damage resulting from Hurricane Rita. FEMA provided 100% cost-shares to 44 states that hosted Hurricane Katrina evacuees, reimbursed under Section 403 of the Stafford Act. These states offered shelter, food, and services to evacuees while coordinating with FEMA for assistance. In response to Hurricane Ike, FEMA and the Administration provided all eligible funding without a cost-share, reducing cost-shares for damages from the hurricane. This included reducing the state and local share for permanent rebuilding work and eliminating all state and local cost-shares for emergency work. The legislation applied to two disaster declarations for Hurricane Ike in 2008, DR-1791 for Texas and DR-1792 for Louisiana. Louisiana had sustained damage from Hurricane Gustav earlier, which had its cost-share adjusted. The decision to adjust the cost-share for Louisiana after Hurricane Gustav was important to reduce administrative confusion. This approach was similar to previous congressional actions for disasters like Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Dennis, and Wilma. Additionally, cost-share waivers were also included for disasters in Kentucky and West Virginia in 2009. In early 2013, federal costs were being compiled to determine cost-share adjustments for permanent repair work under Section 406 for states affected by disasters. Declarations for Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York included a cost-share adjustment for Direct Federal Assistance. Additional declarations extended assistance for an extra five days with a 100% federal cost-share. Broad waivers of 100% were provided for Gulf Coast states under P.L. 110-28. The Gulf Coast states received 100% federal assistance under P.L. 110-28, similar to the response after the 9-11 attacks. Cost-share waivers were also granted after the Columbia Space Shuttle tragedy. The consideration of cost-share waivers is linked to how disasters are declared and political favoritism in decision-making. After Hurricane Andrew and Hurricane Iniki, political influences were seen in disaster cost-share assistance decisions, with the federal share of disaster assistance increased to nearly 100% by President Bush during his re-election campaign. Presidential and congressional influences have been noted in decisions for disaster declarations and spending, with suggestions of political motivations as disaster damage and costs have grown. Presidential and congressional influences impact disaster declaration rates and FEMA spending across states. States important to the President see more declarations, while states with congressional representation on FEMA oversight committees receive higher disaster expenditures. However, further studies have found no statistical evidence linking party similarity or committee membership to success in securing disaster declarations. Since 1989, the odds of a president approving a governor's disaster request have increased to about 80.3%. The broader authority under the Stafford Act allows for more discretion in declaring disasters, leading to higher approval rates. States have also improved their capacity to make effective requests, resulting in more successful declarations. The discussion focuses on disaster declaration decisions and overall spending, with a potential openness for increased congressionally directed spending for all disasters. Congress has historically legislated assistance by specific incident and prescribed the form and amount of assistance. Between 1803 and 1947, 128 specific acts expressed sympathy for disasters. Between 1803 and 1947, 128 specific acts provided sympathy and token financial assistance for disasters. The current assistance available goes beyond token, with states showing a clear interest in disaster recovery work. Cost-share waivers could complicate the federal-state partnership in funding Stafford Act programs. Waivers can offer relief to states with significant disaster damage but may also weaken the cooperative relationship between the two levels of government. The adjustment of cost-shares following disasters, particularly in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, remains a topic of interest for states and localities receiving major disaster declarations. While waivers can provide relief to states with significant damage, they may also undermine the state's investment in its own recovery efforts and accountability. Congressional discussions on cost-shares often trace back to the legislative changes made after Hurricane Katrina, which have set a precedent for future disaster responses. Congress may consider legislative adjustments to Stafford Act cost-share requirements for future disasters, examining the need for exceptions to current regulatory waivers or expanding such waivers. Recent congressional actions show recognition of financial burdens from disaster damage and a willingness to adjust cost-share amounts for events not of the same scale as previous adjustments. These changes can set public policy expectations and increase overall disaster costs to the federal government. The federal government has started budgeting for disaster spending through increased annual appropriations, reducing the dependency on emergency spending. Cost-share adjustments could impact budget choices for the Obama Administration and Congress."
