Iran's support has bolstered Syria, Hezbollah, and Hamas in recent years. Iran, Syria, Hezbollah, and Hamas have increased their stockpiles of rockets, with over 60,000 rockets aimed at Israel. Iran is also expanding its arsenal of ballistic and cruise missiles, posing a threat to its neighbors, Israel, and US forces in the region. Preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons is a top national security priority for the United States, with successive administrations declaring it unacceptable. President Obama emphasized the determination to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons in 2012. The United States, along with its allies, must use all elements of national power to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, including diplomacy, economic sanctions, and military preparations. Despite diplomatic efforts and sanctions, Iran has not abandoned its nuclear program. Additional pressure may be needed, including the credible threat of military action.
