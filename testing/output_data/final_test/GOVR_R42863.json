    "content": "The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 (Perkins IV) supports the development of academic and career skills among secondary and postsecondary students in CTE programs. It was authorized through FY2013 and funded at $1.1 billion in FY2014. CTE programs offer occupational and non-occupational preparation at various education levels. CTE programs provide education and training for specific occupations or careers, typically requiring two years or less of postsecondary education. The Obama Administration's Blueprint aimed to enhance the quality of CTE programs. The Blueprint aims to improve CTE programs by aligning them with labor market needs, promoting collaboration among institutions and industry partners, implementing an accountability system, and supporting innovation through state policy reform. The House has held hearings on reauthorization of the act in the 113th Congress. The House in the 113th Congress has held two hearings on reauthorization of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act. The report is divided into three sections: a brief history of federal legislation supporting CTE, an examination of Perkins IV programs and provisions, and statistics on funding and participation. The aim is to reduce reliance on foreign vocational schools, improve domestic wage earning capacity, and support innovation through state policy reform. Federal funding for vocational education began with the Smith-Hughes Act in 1917, expanding with the George-Barden Act in 1947 to include more vocations. The National Defense Education Act of 1958 focused on critical areas like science and mathematics, providing funding for technical occupations related to national defense. Congress further supported vocational education development in states and territories through grants for faculty salaries. The Vocational Education Act of 1946 amended previous acts to allocate funds for vocational education subjects, support salaries, teacher training, program development, counseling, and equipment. In 1963, the Vocational Education Act increased federal support for vocational education schools and work-study programs. The Vocational Education Act of 1946 allocated funds for vocational education subjects, teacher training, and equipment. In 1968, the Vocational Education Amendments modified existing programs and established a National Advisory Council on Vocational Education. In 1984, the act was renamed the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act, emphasizing job skills acquisition and accessibility for special populations. The Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act Amendments of 1990 (Perkins II, P.L. 101-392) created the Tech-Prep program to coordinate vocational education activities. It allocated funds for state programs and required 75% to go to local recipients, focusing on providing special populations like disadvantaged, disabled, and limited English-proficient students with access to high-quality vocational education. Programs to eliminate sex bias aimed to prepare students for nontraditional training and employment. The Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act Amendments of 1990 (Perkins II, P.L. 101-392) focused on providing vocational education to special populations and eliminating sex bias in nontraditional training. The Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 1998 (Perkins III) increased funds to local levels and allowed for reserves for high-need areas and state institutions. The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act of 2006 (Perkins IV; P.L. 109-270) renamed the act to focus on CTE, strengthened accountability through core performance indicators, sanctions for not meeting performance levels, and incentive grants for exceeding levels set under Perkins III and the Workforce Investment Act. The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act of 2006 (Perkins IV) strengthened accountability for CTE programs by requiring grantees to meet performance levels, linking CTE provisions with academic standards, and allowing consolidation of funding under the Basic State Grants program. Perkins IV is the main federal funding source for CTE programs. Perkins IV, the main federal funding source for CTE programs, authorizes federal funding for various programs aimed at developing academic and career skills of students in CTE programs. Federal funds account for 5% of CTE expenditures, with the rest funded by state and local funds. Perkins IV aims to support the development of Career and Technical Education (CTE) through grant programs like Basic State Grants, Tech Prep, and Tribally Controlled Postsecondary Career and Technical Institutions (TCPCTI). Recipients are expected to establish academic and technical standards, promote professional development for CTE educators, and foster partnerships with educational institutions and businesses. Perkins IV supports CTE through grant programs and national research initiatives. CTE is defined as organized educational activities that provide individuals with technical knowledge and skills for further education and careers. Perkins IV funds support CTE programs by providing Basic State Grants to states, which then distribute the funds to support CTE activities at secondary and postsecondary levels. These activities aim to develop career and technical skills in students. Perkins IV funds support CTE programs by providing Basic State Grants to states for developing career and technical skills in students. The funds are used for instructional materials, equipment, professional development, counseling, curriculum development, and program assessment to achieve federal education policy goals. The Secretary of Education reserves a percentage of funds for outlying areas, Native American programs, and Native Hawaiian programs from the Basic State Grants appropriation. Initial allotments for Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands have been proportionally reduced due to insufficient appropriations since FY2008. The outlying areas use their allotments for teacher and counselor training. The outlying areas use their allotments to train teachers and counselors; develop curricula; and improve CTE in secondary schools and institutions of higher education. The Native American programs set-aside of 1.25% provides competitive grants or contracts to Bureau of Indian Education (BIE)-funded schools, federally recognized Indian tribes, tribal organizations, Alaska Native entities, and consortia. Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and Alaska Native entities may use their funds to support CTE programs in BIE-funded secondary schools, with an equal match of funds required from the BIE. Secondary CTE programs in BIE-funded schools are not eligible under NACTEP. NACTEP funds can be used for CTE programs and services, student stipends, and direct assistance. Special consideration is given to applicants involved in tribal economic development plans and tribally controlled colleges or universities offering accredited CTE programs. Funds can support new or existing CTE programs that lead to academic and skill proficiency through competency-based applied learning. Stipends may be provided to CTE students with income at or below the national poverty level. Funds from NACTEP can be used to provide direct assistance to students in CTE programs, including tuition, dependent care, transportation, books, and supplies. Recipients can also consolidate funds with other eligible programs to enhance job training and employment opportunities. In FY2007, the Secretary competitively awarded five-year grants to 30 entities in 14 states, including tribally controlled colleges, tribes, and tribal organizations. The awards ranged from $240,000 to $602,000 annually and were extended through FY2013. In FY2013, 31 new two-year grants were awarded to similar entities. Additionally, grants are awarded to community-based organizations from funds reserved for the Native Hawaiian program. The Secretary awards grants to community-based organizations serving Native Hawaiians for CTE programs. Grants were awarded to ALU LIKE, Inc. in FY2007 and extended through FY2013. New awards were given to multiple grantees in FY2009 using funds from previous years. The Secretary extended FY2009 awards through FY2013 and awarded new grants to ALU LIKE, Inc. for the 2013-2014 academic year using FY2012 funds. Funds are allocated to states based on a formula favoring states with larger populations of high school age and lower per capita income. Each state designates an eligible agency for CTE administration. The formula for allocating funds for CTE programs depends on three population groups: ages 15-19, 20-24, and 25-65. It also considers the state's allotment ratio, calculated based on per capita income. States with lower income than the national average receive higher allotment ratios. The formula for allocating funds for CTE programs is based on three population groups: ages 15-19, 20-24, and 25-65, and the state's allotment ratio determined by per capita income. States with lower income receive higher ratios. Allotment ratios above 0.5 are adjusted to 0.60 or 0.40 to ensure fairness. The Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico have a fixed ratio of 0.60. 50% of funding is allocated based on the state's proportion of persons aged 15-19 multiplied by the allotment ratio. The formula for allocating funds for CTE programs is based on three population groups: ages 15-19, 20-24, and 25-65, and the state's allotment ratio determined by per capita income. States with lower income receive higher ratios. Allotment ratios above 0.5 are adjusted to 0.60 or 0.40 to ensure fairness. The Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico have a fixed ratio of 0.60. Funding is allocated based on state populations aged 15-19 and 20-24, with percentages determined by allotment ratios. The base formula allocates funding for state grants based on the state's population aged 25 to 65 and allotment ratio. 15% of the funding is allocated initially, and the remaining 15% is based on the state's initial allocations for three population groups. The initial state allocation for state grants is determined based on the population aged 15 to 65, with specific allocations for different age groups. The largest portion of funding (50%) is allocated based on the age group of persons aged 15 to 19. The initial state allocation for state grants is determined based on the age group of persons aged 15 to 19, inclusive\u2014the Perkins IV priority population group. States with lower per capita incomes receive additional grant funds. Provisions in the law adjust initial allocations based on total funding available. Funding for state grants is adjusted to ensure no state receives below certain minimum grant amounts. This includes a hold harmless provision based on FY1998 grants and a 0.5% minimum allocation. The 0.5% minimum may be adjusted using a special rule based on prior year grants and population demographics. The state receives the larger of the adjusted 0.5% minimum or the FY1998 grant as its minimum allocation. In FY1998, state grant funding is adjusted to ensure no state receives below its minimum grant amount. Initial allocations are adjusted based on whether they are below or above the minimum grant amount, with further adjustments possible if needed. If total funding exceeds FY2006 levels, allocations are altered to provide more funding to states that did not receive the 0.5% minimum. Figure 1 demonstrates how the formula works in practice. The new money is allotted to states based on an inverse proportion of how far below the minimum grant amount of 0.5% each state's FY2006 grant is. States further from the 0.5% minimum receive a larger proportional increase above their FY2006 grant amount compared to states with an initial allocation closer to the minimum. None of the small states could receive more than the minimum grant amount of 0.5%. The remaining funds are allotted to other states based on the initial allocation. The new money is allocated to states based on an inverse proportion of how far below the minimum grant amount of 0.5% each state's FY2006 grant is. States may reserve up to 10% of their state grant funds for state leadership activities and up to 5% or $250,000 for program administration. Administrative activities include planning, evaluation, compliance reviews, technical assistance, and data systems maintenance. States must match the Perkins IV administrative reservation with an equal amount of funds from nonfederal sources. In 2009-2010, states distributed at least 85% of state grant funds to local recipients such as LEAs and community colleges. Up to 10% of funds could be reserved for rural/high CTE providers. 15 states did not reserve any funds for rural/high CTE providers. On average, states reserved 6.5% of funds for these providers. States then decided how to split funds between secondary and postsecondary education, with an average of 61% going to secondary education providers. Perkins IV provides three methodologies for states to distribute funds to secondary education providers, favoring local providers serving a larger population living below the poverty level. 61% of funds, on average, are allocated to secondary education providers. Perkins IV provides three methodologies for states to distribute funds to secondary education providers, with 70% of funds allocated based on poverty levels in the school district served by the LEA. The remaining 30% is distributed based on population comparison among participating LEAs in the state. Adjustments are made for changes in district boundaries and inclusion of various education providers. States may use alternative formulas if they better target funds based on poverty levels. The Perkins IV Act provides three methods for states to distribute funds to secondary education providers based on poverty levels and population comparison. States may use alternative formulas if they better target funds. LEAs must receive grants over $15,000 and can form consortia to meet this requirement. Waivers are available for rural or charter schools. Postsecondary education providers are also eligible for distributions. Education Providers Eligible recipients at the postsecondary level include LEAs, area CTE schools, tribally controlled colleges, ESAs, public or nonprofit IHEs, and consortia. Perkins IV offers three methods for states to distribute funds to postsecondary providers, favoring those serving disadvantaged CTE students. Funds are allocated based on the number of federal Pell Grants received. The distribution of funds to postsecondary education providers under Perkins IV is based on the number of federal Pell Grant recipients and recipients of BIE assistance enrolled in CTE programs. States have flexibility to use alternative formulas if they target funds effectively to economically disadvantaged individuals. If the state allocation to postsecondary education is 15% or less of total grant funds, funds can be allocated competitively or through alternative methods. Perkins IV provides states flexibility in funding postsecondary education providers for CTE programs. States can choose programs and measure achievement. To receive funding, the state agency must submit a six-year plan involving stakeholders like teachers, parents, and industry representatives. The state plan for CTE programs under Perkins IV includes descriptions of supported activities, career and technical programs of study, professional development strategies, and integration of academics with CTE. It can be submitted as part of a Section 501 Unified Plan authorized by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. The state plan for CTE programs under Perkins IV includes descriptions of supported activities, career and technical programs of study, professional development strategies, and integration of academics with CTE. States may reserve up to 10% of their allocation for state leadership activities, including assessments of CTE programs, technology use, professional development, and strengthening academic and technical skills of students. The state plan for CTE programs under Perkins IV includes activities to improve academic and technical skills, prepare students for nontraditional fields, support partnerships, and serve individuals in state institutions. States must reserve funds for these activities. The state plan for CTE programs under Perkins IV includes activities to support individuals with disabilities, special populations in high-demand occupations, and provide technical assistance for local providers. Leadership funds can also be used for improving academic and career counseling, supporting CTSOs, and establishing articulation agreements between secondary and postsecondary education providers. Perkins IV requires eligible recipients to develop and improve CTE programs at the local level. Local secondary and postsecondary education providers must submit plans to the state agency detailing how CTE activities will be carried out, how academics will be integrated with CTE, and how faculty professional development will promote academic standards integration. The plan must also include how students will gain industry experience, and how all relevant stakeholders will be involved. The local education providers must ensure the sufficiency of size, scope, and quality of CTE programs offered, promote achievement of special populations, and continually evaluate and improve performance. Funds are used to support CTE programs that link secondary and postsecondary education, provide industry experience, and ensure academic and technical skill attainment. At least one program must align with a state-approved career and technical program of study. Perkins IV requires local education providers to have industry experience, use technology in CTE, provide professional development, and assess programs. It limits administrative costs to 5% and lists permitted uses of funds, such as involving parents, businesses, and labor organizations, providing career guidance, and assisting CTSOs. The Native American Career and Technical Education Program (NACTEP) focuses on equipment acquisition, academic and technical skill support, and transitioning CTE students to baccalaureate programs. States and local providers must meet performance goals outlined in Perkins IV to receive federal funding, with sanctions for non-compliance. Core indicators of performance at the secondary level are crucial for CTE student success. The six required core indicators of performance at the secondary level for CTE students include attainment of state-determined proficient levels in mathematics, reading, and science, career and technical skill proficiencies aligned with industry standards, graduation rates, and placement rates. Compliance with these indicators is necessary to receive federal funding under the Native American Career and Technical Education Program (NACTEP), with sanctions for non-compliance. The core indicators of performance for CTE students at the postsecondary level include attainment of career and technical skill proficiencies, industry-recognized credentials, retention in education, placement in military service or employment, and participation in CTE programs leading to nontraditional fields. The state sets annual performance goals for core indicators of CTE student success, with input from local providers and approval from the Secretary. Additional indicators may be identified by states, with their own performance levels, which do not require Secretary approval. States report annually to the Secretary on these performance levels. States annually report to the Secretary on the progress of CTE students served by Perkins IV in achieving state performance levels, including special populations and ESEA Title I subgroups. Data must be disaggregated by various demographics and publicly disseminated. Local education providers may accept state adjusted levels of performance or negotiate new levels. They must report annually on CTE student progress. States failing to meet 90% of performance levels must create improvement plans. The Secretary may withhold state funds if improvement plans are not implemented or if performance levels are not met for three consecutive years. The state may withhold funds from local providers who do not meet performance standards, using the funds for technical assistance or improvement activities. Additionally, Title II of Perkins IV authorizes a state grant program called Tech Prep to coordinate vocational education activities. The Tech Prep program combines secondary and postsecondary vocational education into a 2+2 model, with grants awarded to consortia for program development. States must coordinate Tech Prep activities with other state plan activities. In 2010-2011, 28 states consolidated Tech Prep funds into Basic State Grants. Tech Prep funds not consolidated are allocated to local providers through competitive or formula-based grants. Eligible providers are consortia of secondary and postsecondary education providers. Eligible postsecondary providers offer two-year degrees or certificates. Consortia in the Tech Prep program include nonprofit or proprietary IHEs offering two-year programs, baccalaureate degree-granting IHEs, employers, business intermediaries, and labor organizations. Requirements include operating under an articulation agreement for credit transfer, combining secondary and postsecondary education or apprenticeship, integrating academic and CTE instruction, and providing technical preparation. The Tech Prep program includes worksite learning experiences, technical preparation in high-demand occupations, building student competence in academic subjects and technical skills, leading to industry-recognized credentials or degrees, high-skill employment, or further education. It must meet state academic standards and provide professional development for educators and counselors. The Perkins IV Tech Prep program requires equal access for special populations, preparatory services for non-CTE participants, coordination with Basic State Grants activities, and additional uses of funds like equipment acquisition and career guidance. Consortia must report on performance indicators for Tech Prep participants, including the number served, enrollment in postsecondary education, completion of credentials, and earning postsecondary credit. The Tech Prep program requires consortia to report on performance indicators for participants, including enrollment in postsecondary education, completion of credentials, and earning postsecondary credit. Consortia must also meet minimum performance levels on core indicators of performance and specific indicators related to employment and degree completion. Perkins IV mandates performance levels for consortia receiving Tech Prep grants, with consequences for failing to meet them. National activities include collecting performance data, assessing CTE students, and appointing an advisory panel for program evaluation. The Perkins IV legislation mandates performance levels for Tech Prep grant recipients, with consequences for non-compliance. A national research center is to be established to conduct research and evaluation to enhance CTE programs and faculty development. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) provides CTE statistics, and the Perkins Collaborative Resource Network (PCRN) serves as an information-sharing portal for policymakers and practitioners. The University of Louisville received grants totaling $4.5 million in FY2007-FY2010 and $2.5 million in FY2011-FY2012 for the National Research Center for Career and Technical Education. A new contract worth $6.2 million was awarded to the Research Triangle Institute for FY2013-FY2016 to operate the National Center for Innovation in Career and Technical Education. The last evaluation of Perkins and vocational education was completed in 2004, showing that CTE provided earning benefits for most students, including economically disadvantaged students. The evaluation of Perkins IV highlighted the challenges in integrating secondary CTE and academic instruction, recommending a focus on either academic education or CTE with streamlined accountability requirements. Perkins IV also authorizes grants to two tribally controlled postsecondary career and technical institutions. Under the TCCUAA and Navajo Community College Act, UTTC and NTC receive funds from the Tribal Technical Colleges program for their postsecondary CTE programs. These funds support CTE programs for Indian students and institutional support costs, including maintenance, equipment, special instruction, boarding, transportation, daycare, family support programs, and student stipends. The Tribal Technical Colleges program provides funds to UTTC and NTC for their postsecondary CTE programs, including maintenance, equipment, instruction, and student support. If sufficient funds are not available, each institution receives a per student payment based on previous year's funding per FTE Indian student and current FTE enrollment, plus inflation. The Secretary has a complaint resolution procedure for grant determinations. The Secretary provides assistance and funding to state-designated entities for occupational and employment information dissemination. Funds can be used for career guidance, academic counseling, and improving access to information related to academics and career goals. Coordination and communication among Perkins IV program administrators and labor market information planners are also supported to avoid duplication of efforts and promote information sharing. The Basic State Grants, national programs, Section 118, Tech Prep, and TCPCTIP are authorized for FY2007-FY2012. Perkins IV appropriations declined from $1.304 billion in FY2007 to $1.080 billion in FY2013 but increased to $1.133 billion in FY2014. Advance funding provides notice of federal funds availability for carrying out programs. The availability of federal funds for ongoing education activities and projects is provided to state and local officers. Total appropriations for Basic State Grants have decreased from $1.18 billion in FY2007 to $1.06 billion in FY2013, but increased to $1.118 billion in FY2014. The Tech Prep program received funding until FY2010 but has not been funded since then. The 2004 NAVE evaluation suggested eliminating Tech Prep due to its failure to integrate education effectively. The Administration's FY2011 budget requested $0 for Tech Prep. In 2009-2010, 26 states consolidated Tech Prep funds into Basic State Grants, with one state consolidating part of its funds. Appropriations for TCPCTIP increased from $7.4 million in FY2007 to $8.2 million in FY2010 before declining to $7.7 million in FY2014. Perkins IV provisions specify grantee treatment of private school staff and students, fiscal considerations, and the relationship between Perkins IV and WIA. Perkins IV requires eligible agencies and recipients to involve secondary education staff and students from nonprofit private schools in CTE professional development activities. It also mandates meaningful participation of secondary school students enrolled in nonprofit private schools in CTE programs. Additionally, eligible recipients must consult with representatives of nonprofit private schools to discuss the participation of their students in Perkins IV-funded CTE programs. Perkins IV mandates supplement not supplant and maintenance of effort requirements for CTE programs. States cannot use funds for services already provided, required by law, or for non-CTE students. States must maintain or exceed CTE expenditures per student. If Perkins IV appropriations decrease, states can decrease fiscal effort proportionally. Unduplicated CTE course enrollment counts are crucial for tracking student participation. Enrollment in CTE courses increased from 10.6 million students in 2001-2002 to 13.0 million in 2006-2007, then declined to 12.1 million in 2007-2008, and was reported at 12.5 million in 2009-2010. Male students are overrepresented at the secondary level (53%) but underrepresented at the postsecondary level (45%). White students make up over half of participants at all levels, with 54% at the secondary level, 57% at the postsecondary level, and 62% at the adult level. Approximately half of participants are economically disadvantaged (51%). At the secondary level, popular career clusters for CTE concentrators include business management (21%), agriculture (17%), information technology (16%), and human services (15%). Postsecondary CTE concentrators are mainly in health sciences (42%) and business management (23%). Adult CTE programs focus on health sciences (48%) and transportation (16%). Performance results reported by ED are for the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 program years, showing each state's progress in achieving. In the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 program years, states reported their performance results on core indicators of performance. In PY2008-2009, 10 states met or exceeded their performance levels, compared to 12 states in PY2009-2010. 27 states had to develop improvement plans in PY2008-2009 for not meeting at least 90% of their performance levels. In PY2009-2010, 28 states required an improvement plan, with 49 states meeting or exceeding the graduation rate indicator and 30 states meeting or exceeding the placement after secondary education indicator. For postsecondary core indicators, 14 states met or exceeded their performance levels in PY2008-2009, compared to 10 states in PY2009-2010. 25 states failed to meet at least 90% of their performance levels in PY2008-2009, leading to improvement plans, with 15 states requiring plans in PY2009-2010. The technical skill attainment indicator was met or exceeded by 48 states, while student placement after postsecondary education was met by fewer states. In PY2009-2010, the indicator of student placement after postsecondary education was met or exceeded by the fewest (28) number of states."
