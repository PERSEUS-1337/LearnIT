    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Screening Hearts in Newborns for Early Detection of Congenital Heart Defect Act\" or the \"SHINE Act\". It aims to improve newborn screening, evaluation, and intervention for critical congenital heart defects. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide grants to States for statewide newborn screening programs, evaluation, and intervention for critical congenital heart defects. This includes developing programs, data collection, surveillance, and training of personnel. The purpose is to monitor the efficacy of these programs. The curr_chunk focuses on developing and monitoring statewide programs for CCHD screening of newborns, providing educational and medical interventions for newborns with critical congenital heart defects, and ensuring early intervention through referral and delivery of information and services. The curr_chunk discusses programs mandated by part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act for newborns with critical congenital heart defects, including family-to-family support mechanisms. Data collection on statewide newborn CCHD screening and intervention programs is also emphasized for quality improvement and policy development. The curr_chunk focuses on encouraging state agencies to adopt efficient models for follow-up care of newborns with critical congenital heart defects. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will provide technical assistance through grants or cooperative agreements for CCHD information and surveillance systems and applied research. The curr_chunk discusses cooperative agreements for technical assistance to State agencies for newborn CCHD screening programs, data collection, and information systems. This includes standardized procedures for data management, evaluation of surveillance systems, and technical assistance on data collection and management. The curr_chunk discusses the study of costs, effectiveness, and interventions for newborn critical congenital heart defects, including evaluation programs conducted by State-based programs. Further research on causes and risk factors for critical congenital heart defects is also highlighted. The curr_chunk focuses on assessing the health, cognitive, and neurodevelopmental status of children for intervention programs. It also mentions data reporting to the Department of Health and Human Services. The National Institutes of Health will conduct research on new screening techniques. The curr_chunk focuses on the efficacy of new screening techniques and technology, including clinical studies and intervention research. It also involves the development of expanded coding terminology for pulse oximetry screening for CCHD. The Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, in coordination with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will guide the assessment and improvement of screening standards for congenital heart defects. They will also assist States in establishing newborn CCHD screening programs and developing data collection systems. The FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health will provide guidance on pulse oximeters for screening neonatal patients, based on recommendations from the Interagency Coordinating Committee on Newborn and Child Screening. This includes funding surveillance activities for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will fund surveillance activities to monitor the link between critical congenital cyanotic heart defect (CCHD) and infant mortality. The National Institutes of Health will fund research to determine the relationships among screening technology, diagnostic processes, care provided, and health outcomes of newborns with CCHD. The Health Resources and Services Administration will guide the development of screening standards and infrastructure for point-of-service screening for CCHD. The Health Resources and Services Administration is recommended to fund the development of education and training materials for families and healthcare professionals regarding screening and treatment of critical congenital cyanotic heart defect (CCHD). Collaboration and consultation with various agencies are emphasized in carrying out programs related to CCHD. The curr_chunk discusses collaboration with various agencies and organizations involved in newborn screening, early intervention services, and support for individuals with congenital heart defects. Specialty organizations, healthcare professionals, third-party payers, and government agencies collaborate to develop policy recommendations for congenital heart defects. Collaboration is key in developing policy recommendations for newborn screening programs, including critical congenital heart defect (CCHD) screening. These recommendations are updated regularly and shared on the Department of Health and Human Services website. Definitions for CCHD and newborn CCHD screening are provided in the text. Authorization of Appropriations: Sums are authorized to be appropriated for fiscal years 2017 through 2021 to carry out this section."
