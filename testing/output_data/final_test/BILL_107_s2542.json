    "content": "The \"Medicare Incentive Access Act of 2002\" allows for incentive payments in Medicare health professional shortage areas through a demonstration project. The Secretary will establish a demonstration project to designate medicare health professional shortage areas in selected States and provide incentive payments to primary care physicians for services in these areas. The Secretary will designate medicare health professional shortage areas in selected States and provide incentive payments to primary care physicians for services in these areas. The designation will be based on inadequate access to primary care physicians for individuals enrolled under part B and residing in the area. The Secretary may not make incentive payments to physicians in a demonstration state during the operation of the demonstration program, regardless of their eligibility for bonus payments under section 1833(m). The incentive payment for physician services under the demonstration project is 40 percent of the payment amount under part B. This does not affect the coinsurance amount individuals enrolled under part B are required to pay. Under the demonstration project, incentive payments to primary care physicians will be automated. The Secretary will conduct the project in 5 selected States as demonstration sites. Payments for outpatient critical access services of critical access hospitals will be determined as if this section had not been enacted. The demonstration project will provide incentive payments to primary care physicians in designated Medicare health professional shortage areas based on zip codes. The project will run for a 3-year period, with automated payment increases for services provided in selected States. The Secretary will establish a methodology with Federal rural health research centers to designate Medicare health professional shortage areas in selected States based on population enrolled under part B. The Secretary will establish a methodology with Federal rural health research centers to designate Medicare health professional shortage areas in selected States based on population enrolled under part B. The methodology may be similar to methodologies used for designating health professional shortage areas under the Public Health Service Act. The research centers selected will consult with State and local medical societies in establishing the methodology. The designation of an area as a Medicare health professional shortage area will not affect its designation under the Public Health Service Act. The Secretary has the authority to waive requirements for the demonstration project. A report must be submitted within 6 months of project completion. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress after completing the demonstration project. The report will evaluate the project's impact on access to primary care physicians for individuals enrolled under part B, comparing its effectiveness with other projects. The report will also assess the adequacy of incentive payments for stabilizing, maintaining, or increasing access. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress evaluating the impact of a demonstration project on access to primary care physicians for part B enrollees. The report will compare effectiveness with other programs and assess the adequacy of incentive payments for stabilizing access. Funding for incentive payments will come from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. The legislation appropriated $6,000,000 to establish a methodology and specified that the funds would remain available until expended."
