    "content": "The \"Interstate Transportation of Municipal Waste Act of 1993\" amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to address the interstate transportation of municipal waste. The \"Interstate Transportation of Municipal Waste Act of 1993\" allows a Governor to restrict out-of-state municipal waste disposal in landfills or incinerators under their jurisdiction if requested by the local government and solid waste planning unit. Prior public notice and comment are required before submitting a request. The \"Interstate Transportation of Municipal Waste Act of 1993\" allows a Governor to restrict out-of-state municipal waste disposal in landfills covered by exceptions. Limits are set on the quantity of out-of-state waste received for disposal and disposal of waste at landfills with documented shipments exceeding certain thresholds in 1991. The \"Interstate Transportation of Municipal Waste Act of 1993\" allows a Governor to restrict out-of-state municipal waste disposal in landfills by setting limits on the quantity of out-of-state waste received for disposal and prohibiting disposal in landfill cells that do not meet design and location standards and leachate collection requirements. Beginning in 1997, a Governor can further limit out-of-state municipal waste disposal by reducing the annual quantity limitation to 20% in 1998 and 1999, and to 10% in subsequent years. Any limitation imposed by the Governor must apply statewide, not discriminate against specific landfills, or shipments based on the state of origin. The Governor must respond to requests regarding out-of-state municipal waste without discrimination based on landfill or state of origin. Governors intending to limit waste disposal must submit quantity data for review and public comment. The Administrator must determine the quantity of out-of-State municipal waste received at landfills covered by exceptions for disposal in each State during 1991 and 1992 within 60 days of receiving information from a Governor. A final determination by the Administrator is not subject to judicial review. Within 180 days of the enactment of this section, a list of the quantity of out-of-State municipal waste received at each landfill during 1991 and 1992 must be published for public review. The authority to prohibit out-of-State municipal waste disposal does not apply to landfills in operation before the enactment of this section that received out-of-State waste in 1991 and comply with state laws on design, location, monitoring, and financial assurance. The authority to prohibit out-of-State municipal waste disposal does not apply to landfills or incinerators meeting specific criteria outlined in the legislation. The legislation requires landfills and incinerators to comply with State laws regarding facility design and operations. The term 'affected local government' refers to elected officials in the city, town, borough, county, or parish where the facility is located. The Governor must designate this entity within 90 days of the enactment of the section. The term 'municipal waste' refers to refuse generated by the general public or from various sources, while 'out-of-State municipal waste' includes waste generated outside of the state, and potentially outside of the United States. The term 'affected local solid waste planning unit' pertains to a political subdivision with authority over solid waste management planning. The term 'municipal waste' refers to waste from residential, commercial, institutional, or industrial sources, consisting of various materials. It excludes hazardous waste, waste from response actions, and separated materials like metal, glass, and plastic. The curr_chunk discusses solid waste that is transported for recycling or reclamation, waste generated by industrial facilities for treatment, and waste generated during air transportation services. The curr_chunk discusses various types of waste that are excluded from being classified as municipal waste, including industrial waste, medical waste, and returned materials for credit or reuse. The Solid Waste Disposal Act is amended to include a new item regarding the interstate transportation of municipal waste."
