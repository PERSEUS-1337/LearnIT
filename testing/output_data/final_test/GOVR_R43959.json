    "content": "The Federal Perkins Loan program allocates federal funds to institutions of higher education to create revolving loan funds for low-interest loans to students with exceptional financial need. It is authorized under Title IV, Part E of the Higher Education Act and supersedes previous loan programs. Institutions contribute federal and institutional capital to capitalize the revolving loan funds. The Federal Perkins Loan program provides low-interest loans to students with exceptional financial need. Institutions contribute federal and institutional capital to create revolving loan funds. Perkins Loans are available to undergraduate and graduate students, with a fixed interest rate of 5% per year. Repayment is deferred during certain circumstances, and individuals in public service may qualify for loan forgiveness. Public service individuals, such as teachers and law enforcement officers, can have their Perkins Loans cancelled. The Secretary of Education reimburses institutions for these cancellations using separate funds. In the 2013-2014 academic year, 1,500 institutions disbursed $1.2 billion in new Perkins Loans to 539,000 students. The authorization for FCCs under HEA Section 461(b)(1) expired in FY2014. The Perkins Loan program, which expired in FY2014, was automatically extended for an additional year through FY2015 due to the absence of legislation to extend or repeal it. The Department of Education considers the authorization of appropriations under HEA Section 461(b)(1) to control the program's duration. The Perkins Loan program is authorized through September 30, 2015, with discretionary appropriations for FCCs authorized annually. HEA Section 465(b) states that the Secretary shall pay institutions for cancelled loans for public service jobs, although there is no explicit authorization of appropriations language. Congress has previously appropriated funds for reimbursing IHEs. Funds for Perkins Loan cancellations were last appropriated in FY2009, but institutions can still extend new loans using revolving funds. Some IHEs can transfer funds from the Federal Work-Study program to continue offering Perkins Loans despite the lack of new appropriations. Despite not receiving new FCCs under the Perkins Loan program, IHEs must cancel loan balances for individuals who complete service requirements. This leads to a decrease in the revolving student loan fund, affecting the ability to extend new Perkins Loans to students. IHEs have not been reimbursed for loan cancellations in years, but ED calculates reimbursement payments annually. It is uncertain if IHEs will be reimbursed for costs associated with loan cancellations. IHEs participating in the Perkins Loan program may not extend Federal Perkins Loans to new borrowers after September 30, 2015, unless a first disbursement is made to a student for the 2015-2016 award year before October 1, 2015. Reimbursement for costs associated with loan cancellations is uncertain, as the statutory authority for appropriations under the HEA expired in 2014 and may expire again if Congress does not take action before October 1, 2015. IHEs can make remaining disbursements of Perkins Loans to students after September 30, 2015. A grandfathering provision allows students who received Perkins Loans before October 1, 2015, to receive loans for up to five additional years. Borrowers with outstanding Perkins Loans are responsible for payments, and cancellation benefits remain eligible upon completion of service requirements. ED has not issued guidance to IHEs yet. When IHEs end participation in the Perkins Loan program, outstanding loans are assigned to ED for collection. If the program's authorization is not extended, similar procedures may be used. HEA Section 466(a) required a capital distribution of each IHE's Perkins Loan fund by March 31, 2004. Borrowers with outstanding Perkins Loans are responsible for payments, and cancellation benefits remain eligible upon completion of service requirements. The HEA required IHEs to distribute Perkins Loan assets and late collections by October 1, 2012, but ED determined that this deadline was superseded by later legislation, allowing IHEs to delay distribution until the end of FY2015. The HEA required IHEs to distribute Perkins Loan assets and late collections by October 1, 2012, but ED allowed IHEs to delay distribution until the end of FY2015. Future wind-down procedures for Perkins Loan portfolios have not been released yet, and the cost to the federal government if the program is extended is unclear. Continuing the program could postpone the return of federal funds. Continuing the Perkins Loan program could delay the return of federal funds, potentially creating a cost to the government. The Congressional Budget Office has not determined how to calculate cost estimates in this situation yet."
