SEC. 301 limits the deduction for oil, natural gas, or primary products under section 199. SEC. 302 prohibits major integrated oil companies from using last-in, first-out accounting. The amendment to Section 472 of the Internal Revenue Code prohibits major integrated oil companies from using a specific inventory method for taxable years ending after December 31, 2013. Taxpayers affected by this change must initiate and implement a new accounting method. The amendment requires taxpayers to make accounting method changes with the consent of the Secretary of the Treasury. The adjustments needed under section 481 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 must be spread out over a period of up to 8 taxable years. MODIFICATIONS OF FOREIGN TAX CREDIT RULES FOR INTEGRATED OIL COMPANIES.

Any amount paid to a foreign country or possession of the United States by such companies will not be considered a tax under certain conditions. The amended Section 901 of the Internal Revenue Code introduces special rules for major integrated oil companies classified as dual capacity taxpayers.

The amendments made by this section to Section 901 of the Internal Revenue Code specify exceptions for taxes that do not apply to dual capacity taxpayers or citizens/residents of a foreign country.

TITLE IV--THE BUFFETT RULE\n\nSEC. 401. FAIR SHARE TAX ON HIGH-INCOME TAXPAYERS. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to add a new part for a Fair Share Tax on high-income taxpayers. The Fair Share Tax on high-income taxpayers imposes an additional tax for a taxable year based on the taxpayer's adjusted gross income exceeding a certain dollar amount. The Fair Share Tax imposes an additional tax on high-income taxpayers for a taxable year, calculated as the excess of the tentative fair share tax over the sum of regular tax liability, tax imposed by section 55, and payroll tax, minus allowable credits. The tentative fair share tax is 30% of the excess of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income over the modified charitable contribution deduction for the taxable year. The modified charitable contribution deduction is calculated based on the ratio of itemized deductions allowable under section 170 for the taxable year. The modified charitable contribution deduction is determined based on the ratio of itemized deductions allowable under the regular tax for the taxable year. If an individual does not itemize deductions, the deduction is zero. A high-income taxpayer is defined as someone with an adjusted gross income above a certain threshold. The adjusted gross income threshold for high-income taxpayers is $1,000,000, with a 50 percent limit for married individuals filing separately. This amount is subject to inflation adjustments for taxable years beginning after 2014. The adjusted gross income threshold for high-income taxpayers is $1,000,000, with a 50 percent limit for married individuals filing separately, subject to inflation adjustments for taxable years after 2014. Amounts adjusted under subparagraph (A) are rounded to the next lowest multiple of $10,000. Payroll tax is calculated as the excess of taxes imposed on the taxpayer under specific sections over the deduction allowable under section 164(f) for the taxable year. For estates and trusts, adjusted gross income is computed as described in section 67(e). The tax imposed under section 59B is not considered tax imposed by this chapter for certain purposes, such as determining credits under this chapter or for section 55. Additionally, a conforming amendment was made to section 26(b)(2) of the Code. Title V of the document discusses the \"Sense of the House\" on the need for a fair, balanced, and bipartisan approach to long-term deficit reduction. The amendments made in Part VII regarding the Fair Share Tax on High-Income Taxpayers will be effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2013. The House emphasizes the need for a balanced, bipartisan approach to deficit reduction, rejecting sequestration as harmful. It suggests replacing the 10-year sequester with a plan that increases revenues without burdening middle-income Americans, reduces long-term spending, and protects vital programs while investing in education and research. The House proposes replacing the 10-year sequester with a plan that increases revenues, reduces long-term spending, and protects vital programs while investing in education, science, research, and critical infrastructure for global competitiveness."
