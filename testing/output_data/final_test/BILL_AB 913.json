    "title": "AB 913",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature reaffirms campus law enforcement agencies' authority for providing police services on campuses and mandates written agreements with local law enforcement for investigating violent crimes, sexual assaults, and hate crimes. Local law enforcement agencies must have written agreements with campus law enforcement agencies for investigating violent crimes, sexual assaults, and hate crimes. The agreements designate operational responsibilities and geographical boundaries, reviewed every five years. Each agency covers its investigation costs unless specified otherwise. In this section, existing agreements between campus and local law enforcement agencies meeting standards are not affected. Campus law enforcement agencies retain authority to provide police services on their campuses. Key terms defined include \"local law enforcement agencies,\" \"Part 1 violent crimes,\" and \"hate crime.\" The Kristin Smart Campus Safety Act of 1998 defines key terms like \"hate crime\" and \"sexual assault\" and sets minimum standards for written agreements between campus and local law enforcement agencies for investigating crimes on university and college campuses. Independent postsecondary institutions are also defined in the Act. The Legislature reaffirms campus law enforcement agencies' primary authority for providing police or security services and investigating criminal activity on campuses. Community college districts must adopt rules for written agreements with local law enforcement agencies regarding investigations of violent crimes on campus. Local law enforcement agencies must have agreements with community college campus law enforcement agencies if campuses are within their jurisdiction. Written agreements under this section designate law enforcement agencies responsible for investigating violent crimes, outlining geographical boundaries and costs. Existing agreements between community college and local law enforcement agencies are unaffected. The section clarifies that community college campus law enforcement agencies can still provide police services. It defines \"local law enforcement agencies\" as city or county agencies responsible for police services in the community. \"Part 1 violent crimes\" are specified as specific types of crimes according to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Handbook. The Legislature aims to provide clear information on operational responsibilities for investigating crimes on community college campuses by setting minimum standards for written agreements between campus law enforcement and local agencies. Upon a community college district adopting a rule to update agreements, it will be subject to Section 67381 instead of the current section. The Legislature encourages community college districts to update agreements between campus law enforcement and local agencies. If costs are mandated by the state, reimbursement will be provided to local agencies and school districts."
