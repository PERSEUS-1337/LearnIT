The founding of Jamestown in 1607 brought together people from different backgrounds to form a multicultural society. The institutions developed during its first 9 decades continue to influence the United States in various aspects. The National Park Service, the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities, and the Jamestown-Yorktown Foundation collectively own and operate resources related to Jamestown's early history.
