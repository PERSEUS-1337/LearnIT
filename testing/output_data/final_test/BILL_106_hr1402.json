    "content": "The required use of Option 1A as the price structure for Class I milk under consolidated Federal Milk Marketing Orders is mandated in Section 1. In implementing the consolidation and reform of Federal milk marketing orders, the Secretary of Agriculture must use Option 1A for pricing fluid or Class I milk, with corrections and modifications up to April 2, 1999. This requirement does not affect the implementation schedule specified in the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. The Secretary of Agriculture must use Option 1A for pricing fluid or Class I milk, with corrections and modifications up to April 2, 1999, as specified in the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1999. Compliance with this requirement should be expedited and not subject to certain notice and hearing provisions. The Secretary of Agriculture must comply with specific provisions related to rulemaking, public participation, and the Paperwork Reduction Act. Additionally, the announcement of minimum milk prices under Federal milk marketing orders is subject to certain regulations. Before the Secretary complies with specific provisions, the minimum prices announced will be the only applicable prices under Federal milk marketing orders. SEC. 2. Necessity of using formal rulemaking to develop pricing methods for Class III and Class IV milk; modified manufacturing allowance for cheese. Congressional Finding: The Class III and Class IV pricing formulas in the final decision for the reform of Federal milk marketing orders do not adequately reflect public comments on the original proposed rule. Further emergency rulemaking is needed. The Secretary of Agriculture is required to conduct formal rulemaking to reconsider these pricing formulas. The final decision on the pricing formula for Class III and Class IV milk must be implemented within 10 months of the Act's enactment. If a court order delays implementation, the time of the injunction will extend the deadline accordingly. If the Secretary of Agriculture fails to implement new Class III and Class IV pricing formulas within the required time period, assessments from milk producers or handlers under section 8c of the Agricultural Adjustment Act cannot be collected until the pricing formulas are in place. Services provided under that section will not be reduced, and costs will be covered by funds available for the Agricultural Marketing Service. The Department's Agricultural Marketing Service will not delay the implementation of final decisions on Federal milk marketing orders. The Secretary of Agriculture will modify the formula for determining Class III prices until new pricing formulas are in place. The Secretary of Agriculture will modify the formula for determining Class III prices by replacing the manufacturing allowance with a new amount. The implementation of the modified formula will be expedited and not subject to certain requirements. The Secretary of Agriculture will modify the formula for determining Class III prices by replacing the manufacturing allowance with a new amount. This modification is not subject to certain requirements, including provisions of section 553 of title 5, United States Code, a referendum conducted by the Secretary of Agriculture, the Statement of Policy effective July 24, 1971, and the Paperwork Reduction Act. The modification may affect minimum milk prices announced under Federal milk marketing orders. Before the Secretary implements the modified formula, the minimum prices announced will be the only applicable minimum prices under Federal milk marketing orders for the specified months. SEC. 3 extends the milk price support program to 2000 and adjusts the support rate. SEC. 4 introduces a Dairy Forward Pricing Pilot Program. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish a pilot program allowing milk producers to enter into forward price contracts with handlers. Payments under these contracts will satisfy minimum milk price requirements. The program applies to federally regulated milk marketing. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish a pilot program for forward price contracts between milk producers and handlers for federally regulated milk not intended for fluid use. The program will terminate on December 31, 2004, and a study will be conducted on its impact on milk prices paid to producers in the United States. The Secretary may use authorities under section 8d for a study on forward price contracts between milk producers and handlers. A report on the study results must be submitted to the Senate and House Committees on Agriculture by April 30, 2002. The House of Representatives passed the bill on September 22, 1999. Clerk: JEFF TRANDAHL."
