    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Highways Bettering the Economy and Environment Pollinator Protection Act\". Congress finds that roadside vegetation management practices aim to secure motorist safety, reduce noxious weeds, stabilize soil, and promote native forbs and grasses. Federal and State highway departments face budget shortfalls, and integrated vegetation management can reduce maintenance costs. Native plants require less active management and support pollinators like bees, birds, and butterflies. Pollinators like bats, Monarch butterflies, and other butterflies are facing population decline due to habitat loss. Supporting native forbs and grasses along roadsides can benefit pollinator populations by providing migratory corridors and helping them adapt to climate change. Planting noninvasive milkweed species can create way stations for Monarch butterflies and other pollinators. Highway rights-of-way managed by States offer 17 million acres of pollinator habitat conservation opportunity, benefiting neighboring lands with improved pollination services for agriculture and wildlife ecosystems. Similar opportunities exist on other transportation rights-of-way. SEC. 3. Administrative provisions to encourage pollinator habitat and forage on transportation rights-of-way. Section 319 of title 23, United States Code is amended to include the enhancement of habitat and forage for pollinators on transportation rights-of-way. This involves conducting integrated vegetation management practices, reducing mowing, and planting native forbs and grasses to support Monarch butterflies, native pollinators, and honey bees. The amendment to Section 319 of title 23, United States Code involves enhancing habitat and forage for pollinators on transportation rights-of-way. This includes planting native forbs and grasses, like milkweed, to support Monarch butterflies and other migrating pollinators. Partnerships with stakeholders are encouraged to support these efforts, along with research on the benefits of integrated vegetation management practices. The Secretary of Transportation will provide a report to Congress within 18 months of the Act's enactment, analyzing current programs and authorities for implementing habitat enhancements for Monarch butterflies and other pollinators on transportation rights-of-way. This includes assessing actions taken by State transportation departments to reduce mowing and enhance habitat through plantings of native forbs and grasses. The Secretary of Transportation will report to Congress on current programs and authorities for enhancing habitats for Monarch butterflies and other pollinators on transportation rights-of-way, including State actions to reduce mowing and plant native forbs and grasses. Recommendations for further action will also be included. The Secretary of Transportation will report to Congress on programs and authorities for enhancing habitats for Monarch butterflies, pollinators, and honey bees on transportation rights-of-way. This includes State actions to reduce mowing and plant native forbs and grasses. Amendments are made to provide habitat, forage, and migratory way stations for Monarch butterflies, pollinators, and honey bees."
