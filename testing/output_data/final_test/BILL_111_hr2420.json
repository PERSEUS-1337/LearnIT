The Congress declares that assisting in meeting the essential needs of the United States for electrical products is in the national interest. A uniform Federal regulation of restrictions on certain substances in electrical products is crucial for economic, environmental, and social well-being. Disparities among State laws could create barriers to interstate commerce and distort competition. Technological and industrial innovation in electrical products can improve living standards, increase productivity, create new industries and jobs, and promote environmentally friendly production and disposal. The purpose of this Act is to enhance economic, environmental, and social well-being in the US by ensuring efficient technological development and innovation in electrical products. It aims to prevent disparities among state laws regarding toxic substances in these products, establish uniform federal regulation, and enforce penalties under the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976. The purpose of this Act is to establish a uniform federal scheme of regulation for efficient technological development and innovation in electrical products, preventing disparities among state laws regarding toxic substances. The Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 is amended to include regulations on electroindustry products, defining them as equipment used for electricity transmission or medical imaging. National standards prohibit the manufacture of electroindustry products with lead, mercury, or hexavalent chromium concentrations exceeding 0.1% after July 1, 2010. The Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 has been amended to regulate electroindustry products, which are defined as equipment used for electricity transmission or medical imaging. National standards prohibit the presence of lead, mercury, or hexavalent chromium exceeding 0.1% in these products after July 1, 2010. Additionally, the products must not contain concentrations greater than 0.01% of cadmium in any homogeneous material. The Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 has been amended to regulate electroindustry products, which are equipment used for electricity transmission or medical imaging. National standards prohibit the presence of lead, mercury, or hexavalent chromium exceeding 0.1% in these products after July 1, 2010. Additionally, products with a voltage rating of 300 volts or above, or used in fixed installations, must not contain concentrations greater than 0.01% of cadmium in any homogeneous material. The curr_chunk discusses lighting equipment, signaling protection systems, healthcare communications, emergency call systems, and surface transportation information management systems. The curr_chunk discusses medical diagnostic imaging and therapy equipment, communications systems in healthcare facilities, shunt capacitors, series capacitors, and equipment for electricity metering. The curr_chunk focuses on electrical equipment such as distribution transformers, testing equipment for meters, high voltage fuses, power circuit breakers, steam turbine generators, and electrical wire and cable products. The curr_chunk discusses various electrical equipment including appliance wires, flexible cords, electrical conduit, high intensity discharge lamps, and arc welding equipment. Lead is also mentioned when used in steel or aluminum alloys. The curr_chunk discusses the use of lead in aluminum alloys, copper alloys, high melting temperature solders with 85% or more lead, and specific solders for various applications in electrical equipment. The curr_chunk discusses the use of lead in multilayer capacitors, printed circuit board assemblies, and glass for specific electronic applications. The curr_chunk discusses various applications where lead is used, such as in fluorescent lamps, electrical connector coatings, and gateway hardware for lighting controls protocols. The curr_chunk discusses the use of cadmium and hexavalent chromium in electrical components like connectors, coatings, and alloys for wire conductors. The curr_chunk discusses the permissible limits of mercury in various types of fluorescent lamps. The curr_chunk specifies the permissible limits of mercury in different types of fluorescent lamps, including compact fluorescent lamps, high output linear fluorescent lamps, preheat linear fluorescent lamps, and luminaires containing mercury-added lamps. Additionally, it allows for the processing and use of specified chemical substances in electroindustry products as determined by the Administrator. The Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 prohibits states from imposing requirements on electroindustry products that are more stringent than national standards or related to specified chemical substances. The Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 prohibits states from imposing requirements on products containing specified chemical substances that are more stringent than national standards. States can apply for exemptions from certain requirements under specific conditions to protect against health or environmental risks associated with the use of these substances. The Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 prohibits states from imposing more stringent requirements on products with specified chemical substances than national standards. Compliance with national standards can be shown through various methods, including manufacturer certifications or testing following Administrator guidelines. Guidelines for testing lead, mercury, hexavalent chromium, cadmium, PBB, and PBDE concentrations in electroindustry products must be established within one year of the Act's effective date. Authorization of $1,000,000 for the Administrator in fiscal year 2009 to implement the provisions of the Act."
