    "content": "Caregiving involves providing a wide range of services to individuals with disabilities or conditions that limit their ability to care for themselves. Long-term care services are often needed for those who require assistance over an extended period, with the likelihood increasing with age. Care can be provided in various settings, including at home, in assisted living facilities, or in nursing homes. Formal caregiving involves paid individuals employed by long-term care organizations. This report focuses on family caregiving, which involves informal care provided primarily by spouses and children to the older population. Family caregiving activities include assisting with personal care needs and activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) such as managing money, preparing meals, and taking medications. Family caregivers provide hands-on assistance with personal care, managing money, preparing meals, and taking medications. They also access health care services, communicate with providers, and advocate for the care recipient. Caregivers may arrange formal care for temporary relief or on a permanent basis. Formal care may supplement or substitute for informal caregiving activities. Family caregivers fulfill the majority of long-term care needs for older persons with chronic disabilities in the United States. More than 90% of older care recipients receive informal care, either alone or in combination with formal care. The demand for informal care provided to older relatives can last many years due to demographic trends like increased life expectancy. The aging population and difficulty in recruiting paid long-term care workers have put pressure on family caregivers. Federal and state governments are focusing on expanding programs to support family caregivers as the demand for caregiving is expected to increase. The increasing demand for informal care for older individuals may be limited by demographic trends like smaller family sizes and increased divorce rates, reducing the availability of caregivers. Factors such as women's increased labor force participation and family members living farther away can also impact the ability to provide care. Family caregivers come from diverse backgrounds and may face challenges such as stress and financial hardship. Family caregivers face increased physical and emotional strain due to assisting disabled or cognitively impaired family members. They provide skilled care at home with little training, including medical equipment and medications. The federal government supports family caregivers through programs like the National Family Caregiver Support Program. The Family Caregiver Support Program, established under the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2000, aims to sustain informal caregiving to reduce the need for publicly financed care. Concerns arise due to demographic shifts affecting the supply of family caregivers, potentially impacting the ability to meet the increasing demand for long-term care assistance by older individuals. Federal programs recognize family caregivers as vital to the long-term care delivery system and provide direct support to them. The government has established programs and initiatives to provide direct support to caregivers, including respite care, education, tax relief, and cash assistance. Federal programs also offer home and community-based long-term care services to care recipients, indirectly benefiting caregivers by supplementing or substituting informal care with paid support. These services, with varying eligibility criteria and benefits, aim to reduce caregiver burden and improve caregiving skills. About 5.5 million adults aged 65 and older receive long-term care services, with 70% living in the community and 30% in institutional settings. Eligibility for assistance requires limitations in at least two ADLs, with over half of those in the community having three or more limitations. Among older individuals receiving long-term care in the community, the majority rely on informal care, with some also receiving formal care. Gender and living arrangement influence the type and amount of informal care received, with women more likely to receive care. Half of those with severe impairments rely solely on informal caregivers for their personal care needs. Research findings suggest that women are more likely to receive informal care, while men receive a greater amount of care. Older men typically receive assistance from one caregiver, usually their spouses, while older women tend to have multiple caregivers. The type of care received varies by gender, with men more likely to receive help with personal care, housekeeping, and meal preparation, and women more likely to receive help with transportation, shopping, and home repairs. Living with someone else results in receiving more informal care, while those who live alone, are unmarried, and live in public housing are more likely to use paid care. Income of the care recipient also influences the type of care received. The income of the care recipient influences the type of care received. Poor and near poor older care recipients with severe disabilities are more likely to receive paid personal care assistance, while those with higher incomes rely more on unpaid assistance. Estimates show that there are 7 million to 54 million informal caregivers. Estimates of informal caregivers range from 7 million to 54 million, with wide variation due to differences in definitions, care provided, and data collection methods. Methodological considerations make it difficult to compare estimates across surveys. Table 3 displays the range of caregiver estimates from national surveys, highlighting survey characteristics and methodology. According to the 1999 National Long Term Care Survey, an estimated 7 million individuals provide care to those aged 65 and older, with spouses and adult children being the most common caregivers. The survey uses a less restrictive measure of disability, focusing on help with activities of daily living (ADLs) or instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) for at least three months. Informal care to the older population with long-term care needs is primarily provided by spouses and adult children. Family caregiving activities are concentrated, with most care recipients receiving help from one caregiver. Marital status influences the caregiver relationship, with married care recipients more likely to be helped by their spouse, while unmarried recipients receive assistance from multiple helpers, often adult children. Women are the majority of informal caregivers to older adults due to their longer life expectancies. In the 2002 Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), daughters were more than twice as likely than sons to provide care to their parents, regardless of the parent's marital status. Male caregivers have increased in numbers, with a 50% rise in men reporting they were primary caregivers from 1984 to 1994. Male caregivers are more likely to be spouses, while women are more likely to engage in physically demanding caregiving tasks. In the 2002 Health and Retirement Survey, daughters were more likely than sons to provide care to their parents. Male caregivers have increased in numbers, with a rise in men reporting they were primary caregivers. Women are more likely to engage in physically demanding caregiving tasks. Spouse caregivers may face challenges due to their own age and health issues. In the 2002 Health and Retirement Survey, adult children in their 40s and 50s are the primary caregivers for their older parents, with most living separately from them. Concerns about long-distance caregiving and a shortage of family caregivers have been raised, but some researchers argue that society is actually less mobile than before. Data shows that the majority of frail older adults have at least one adult child providing care. The 2002 HRS reveals that most frail older adults have at least one adult child living nearby, with some having multiple children within 10 miles. Long-distance caregivers, often playing a secondary role, are typically siblings living more than an hour away. Despite primary caregivers usually being closer, a significant number of long-distance caregivers are the main providers, residing an average of 450 miles away. They manage services, assist with IADLs, and visit monthly. Long-distance caregivers face time-consuming and costly challenges, spending an average of $392 per month on travel and expenses. Many are part of the \"sandwich generation,\" balancing care for aging parents and dependent children. Concerns arise about the increasing caregiving burden as the population ages, with approximately 3.5 million individuals responsible for both. According to a 2004 survey, over one-third of family caregivers have a child under 18 living at home. Caregivers under 50 are more likely to have a child at home. Some researchers argue that the \"sandwich generation\" phenomenon is not the norm, as only a small subset simultaneously care for a child and parent. Researchers argue that the \"sandwich generation\" phenomenon is an exception rather than the norm, with child care and eldercare activities usually occurring sequentially. Data shows that only about 1% of women aged 45 to 56 have both a parent and a child living with them. Expanding the definition of the \"sandwich generation\" to include those providing financial or caregiving support to both a child and a parent increases the percentage to 9%. Many caregivers are balancing work with caregiving responsibilities. In a 2002 survey, 35% of workers provided care for a relative aged 65 or older. Employed caregivers often adjust their work schedules, reduce hours, or take leave to care for older family members. Workplace policies like flexible schedules and telecommuting can assist family caregivers. The 2002 Families and Worklife Institute survey showed a significant increase in elder care resource and referral services over the past decade. Federal initiatives like the Family and Medical Leave Act provide job-protected unpaid leave for qualifying employees. Family caregivers spend an average of 46 hours per week assisting older disabled relatives. Primary ADL caregivers provide an average of 46 hours of care per week, while primary IADL caregivers offer about 83 hours per month. Spouses, daughters, and sons are the main caregivers to disabled older adults, with a wide variation in caregiving hours reported. The NAC/AARP 2004 survey found that caregivers provide varying amounts of care, with 48% offering up to 8 hours per week and 17% providing over 40 hours per week. Caregiving intensity increases for older individuals with cognitive impairment, ranging from 4.6 hours per week for those without dementia to 46.1 hours per week for those with severe dementia. The 2004 NAC/AARP survey found that caregivers provide varying amounts of care, with 48% offering up to 8 hours per week and 17% providing over 40 hours per week. Caregiving intensity increases for older individuals with cognitive impairment. The average duration of care was 4.3 years, with almost 30% of caregivers assisting for five years or more. Older caregivers were more likely to have been providing care for 10 years or more. Caregivers may face physical strain, emotional stress, and financial hardship, but some find personal satisfaction in forming close relationships and fulfilling a sense of duty. Factors associated with caregiver stress include lack of choice in taking on caregiving responsibilities, poor caregiver health, heavy caregiving burden, and limited backup assistance. Caregivers experiencing high stress are more likely to provide over 20 hours of care per week, assist recipients with more than three ADLs, lack backup assistance, and face challenges in providing care. Caregiver health is influenced by age, gender, education, income, and living arrangements with the recipient. Caregivers facing increased responsibilities may experience higher levels of stress, leading to adverse health outcomes such as elevated blood pressure, weakened immune systems, and increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Older spouse caregivers under stress have higher mortality rates compared to non-caregivers of the same age. Research shows that highly stressed caregivers are more likely to have their care recipients enter nursing homes, with a 12% increase within one year and a 17% increase over a two-year period. Initiatives to reduce caregiver stress could also lower the rate of nursing home admissions. Providing care to an older person can impact a caregiver's mental health, with studies showing high levels of depressive symptoms among caregivers, especially those assisting individuals with dementia. About 30% of dementia caregivers experience depression, and over 40% report high emotional stress. Research indicates that caregivers require more support and information on accessing services. A national study found that 35% of caregivers to older adults expressed a need for personal time, but almost one-third were unaware of available resources. Almost one-third of caregivers are unsure where to seek information on care, especially high-stress caregivers who need help with caregiving, time-off, and financial assistance. Those assisting individuals with Alzheimer's or dementia, living with the care recipient, or aged 50 and older are more likely to use supportive services. Caregivers of individuals with high disability levels often face financial hardship and seek information on financial aid for the care recipient. High-stress caregivers facing financial hardship seek information on getting financial help for the care recipient. Research shows that high-stress caregivers are more likely to have used paid help for ADLs, adult day care, or respite compared to low-stress caregivers. The main reasons for not using these services among high-stress caregivers are lack of awareness and affordability. Providing care to an older relative can be a significant financial burden for some family caregivers. Family caregivers face significant financial burden, with an average annual out-of-pocket expense of $5,531, exceeding 10% of their median income. Long-distance caregivers have the highest expenses, while common costs include household goods, food, travel, and medical care. Difficulty arises in distinguishing care-related expenses from general household expenses. The economic value of caregiving for older persons with disabilities, especially in co-resident households, can be substantial. Caregiver expenses may be paid for with their own money or household funds. The value of informal care is often measured by the cost of replacing unpaid care with paid care, with estimates varying based on factors like the caregiving population and hourly wage rates for caregivers. The economic value of informal caregiving is estimated to be between $149 billion to $483 billion, with various studies providing different estimates. This includes the annual cost of replacing informal caregiving with paid home care, the imputed value of informal caregiving, and the economic value of caregiving using different hourly wage rates for caregivers. Some estimates may overstate the economic costs of informal caregiving, including activities that family members would have done regardless of the care recipient's disability status. Caregivers who take time out of the workforce not only lose wages but also fail to accrue savings and benefits, putting them at economic risk over their lifetimes. Lost economic productivity from caregiving activities is another measure of economic cost. In a study by MetLife, informal caregivers experienced economic consequences due to caregiving. The study by MetLife found that family caregivers lost an estimated average of $659,000 in total pre-taxable wealth over a lifetime. Additionally, caregiving costs U.S. businesses between $17.1 and $33.6 billion annually in lost productivity. Government programs provide support to family caregivers through grant programs and initiatives under the Older Americans Act and Title XX of the Social Security Act. These programs offer information, respite care, and training to caregivers. Some states offer respite care as a covered service through Medicaid home and community-based waivers. Family caregivers can now be hired by Medicaid beneficiaries, receiving cash assistance. The Family and Medical Leave Act provides unpaid leave for eligible employees to care for a family member with a serious health condition. Tax provisions offer caregivers direct tax relief. Federal programs provide long-term care services to care recipients, indirectly benefiting caregivers by supplementing or substituting informal care. Access to benefits that directly assist caregivers is often limited by program funding and may be insufficient in coverage and duration. Coverage for direct benefits to caregivers may vary across states, with federal programs typically limited to recipients meeting specific age, financial, and functional eligibility criteria. Some states use state funds to provide programs that indirectly assist caregivers. The federal government funds programs to support family caregivers of older individuals through various initiatives under the Older Americans Act (OAA). These programs include information and referral services, respite care, caregiver training, and support. The OAA also indirectly assists caregivers by providing home and community-based services. The National Eldercare Locator Service is developed under Title II of the OAA to help caregivers and older individuals. The National Eldercare Locator Service (1-800-677-1116, weekdays, 9:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., EST, http://www.eldercare.gov) connects caregivers and older adults with state and local agencies on aging and community-based organizations. It provides information and referral programs, services for every ZIP code, and resources for transportation, meals, housing, Alzheimer's hotlines, and adult day care. It helps identify local resources and enables long-distance caregivers to access information about services nationwide. The National Eldercare Locator Service provides information and referral services for transportation, home-delivered meals, housing options, Alzheimer's hotlines, adult day care, respite services, home health services, long-term care ombudsmen, and legal assistance. Funding for the program in FY2008 is approximately $800,000. Another initiative, the Aging and Disability Resource Center program, aims to improve access to long-term care services and supports at the community level through collaboration between AoA and CMS. The ADRC initiative, a collaboration between AoA and CMS, provides grants to streamline access to long-term care services at the community level. ADRCs serve as single points of entry for long-term care benefits funded under Medicaid, OAA, and state programs. Approximately 140 ADRC pilot sites in 40 states, DC, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands have received grant funding through this program. The ADRC program initiative received funding in FY2003, FY2004, and FY2005, with continued support in FY2007 for 12 states. Over $42 million in grants were awarded by AoA and CMS from FY2003 to FY2007. Additionally, CMS invested $8 million in FY2008 for person-centered hospital discharge planning models in 7 states. The NFCSP offers services for caregivers in areas such as health information, accessing services, counseling, respite care, and supplemental services. The NFCSP provides services for caregivers aged 60 and older, prioritizing those with the greatest economic or social need. Priority is also given to caregivers of individuals with severe disabilities, including Alzheimer's disease. Funding for NFCSP in FY2008 was $153.4 million, accounting for 8% of total OAA expenditures. Approximately 15.5% of caregivers received assistance in locating services, 2.0% received counseling and training, and 1.0% received respite care from selected NFCSP services in FY2006. These services assist only a small percentage of family caregivers, but Title III home and community-based services offer a broad array of supportive services to indirectly help caregivers by enabling older adults to stay in their own homes. In FY2005, transportation services provided over 36.5 million rides for critical daily activities. Personal care, homemaker, and chore services offered more than 20 million hours of assistance with daily tasks. Case management services provided nearly 4 million hours of needs assessment and care planning. Adult day health care delivered over 7 million hours of services. These services aim to support caregivers indirectly by enabling them to continue working and directly by providing respite from caregiver responsibilities. In FY2008, funding for OAA supportive service programs is $351.3 million. CMS launched \"Ask Medicare\" to assist family caregivers with accessing information about Medicare and health care services. The Alzheimer's Disease Demonstration Grants to States program provides competitive grants to address the specific needs of Alzheimer's patients. The Alzheimer's Disease Demonstration Grants to States program aims to expand diagnostic and support services for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, their families, and caregivers. States can use funds for respite care and supportive services. Administered by the Administration on Aging, the program was created under the Older Americans Act Amendments of 1987 and reauthorized in 1990 and 1998. The Partnerships Act of 1998 re-authorized funding for ADDGS until FY2002, with Congress continuing to appropriate funding. The Senior Companion Program (SCP) under the DVSA provides older adults the opportunity to assist homebound individuals with disabilities. SCP volunteers offer companionship, transportation, and in-home tasks to help older individuals remain independent. Funding for SCP in FY2008 is $46,144. The SSBG block grant, authorized by Title XX of the Social Security Act, provides funding for a variety of social services, including respite care for caregivers. Services like adult day care, home-delivered meals, and home-based services indirectly benefit caregivers. The program is administered by the Administration for Children and Families, which allocates funds to states and territories for service provision. The SSBG block grant allows states to determine service provision through state agencies, grants, or contracts with private organizations. States have flexibility in using SSBG funds, with no federal eligibility requirements except for TANF transfers. In 2006, SSBG fund allocations were $1.70 billion, with $944 million from TANF transfers. However, services for caregivers are limited compared to total SSBG expenditures, and services vary by state. In 2006, SSBG expenditures for home-based services, information and referral, and adult day care were less than 8% of total SSBG expenditures. The Medicaid program covers long-term care services for eligible persons with disabilities in institutional and home settings. Medicaid home and community-based services aim to help beneficiaries live independently, with respite care being an optional service for family caregivers. Respite care is an optional Medicaid service that provides assistance to family caregivers, offering them a break from their caregiving duties. Some states also offer consumer-directed service delivery models, allowing beneficiaries to hire family members for long-term care services and receive monetary compensation. This can help caregivers replace lost wages or continue providing care at home. Family caregivers may benefit from Medicaid home and community-based services by providing care in the care recipient's home, increasing the supply of direct care workers, and relieving the strain of hands-on care. These services include personal care, case management, and adult day health services. Congress passed the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to assist workers in balancing work and caregiving activities. The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) allows workers to take unpaid leave to care for family members with serious health conditions without risking their jobs. Employers with at least 50 employees within 75 miles must provide this job-protected leave. Employees are entitled to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year for their own health conditions, newborn care, or adoption. A U.S. Department of Labor survey found that most employees used FMLA for their own health reasons. As of 2008, 45 states and the District of Columbia had family and medical leave laws similar to the FMLA, but with differences in coverage and scope. Some employers offer paid leave benefits, and employees can access more favorable benefits under state law or from their employer. Tax provisions like the dependent care tax credit and employer-provided dependent care assistance programs provide benefits to caregivers of older family members. The exclusion from income for employer-provided dependent care assistance programs (DCAP) and tax provisions like the dependent care tax credit provide indirect assistance to family caregivers. Eligibility rules and limitations may apply, but caregivers may be eligible for a tax credit to offset costs of formal care for a qualifying child or disabled spouse/dependent. Special rules allow disabled individuals to be classified as dependents even with gross income over a certain amount. The Dependent Care Tax Credit (DCTC) provides a tax credit for qualifying individuals who incur expenses for child or dependent care necessary for employment. The credit is calculated as a percentage of qualified employment-related expenses, limited to $3,000 for one individual or $6,000 for two or more. The credit rate ranges from 35% to 20% based on adjusted gross income, with expenses capped at the earned income of the taxpayer or the lesser earning spouse for married couples. The Dependent Care Tax Credit (DCTC) provides a tax credit for qualifying individuals with expenses for child or dependent care necessary for employment. The credit is reduced to 20% for taxpayers with AGI over $43,000. The credit is nonrefundable and limited by the taxpayer's regular income tax liability. Lower income taxpayers may not benefit from the credit, as it is dependent on AGI thresholds. Employers with a DCAP can exclude up to $5,000 of earnings for qualified dependent care expenses, which applies to income and employment taxes. The DCAP must meet nondiscrimination rules and can be funded through a cafeteria plan. The exclusion amount cannot exceed the taxpayer's earned income or the lower-paid spouse's income for married couples. The $5,000 limit applies regardless of the number of qualifying individuals. The DCAP allows for up to $5,000 of earnings to be excluded for qualified dependent care expenses, regardless of the number of qualifying individuals. Families with one qualifying person may find DCAP more beneficial than DCTC, which has a $3,000 limit on qualifying expenses. Taxpayers can use both DCTC and DCAP in the same year but not for the same expenses. DCAP exclusion reduces qualifying DCTC expenses. Taxpayers' income tax savings from DCAP depend on their marginal tax rate. A taxpayer in the 25% bracket would save $1,250 (i.e., $5,000 x 25%) and $383 in employment taxes ($5,000 x 7.65%) by claiming a tax exemption for an older adult as a dependent. The definition of a qualifying relative is broad, including various family members and non-relatives who lived with the taxpayer all year as a household member. To claim a qualifying relative as a dependent, the taxpayer must provide more than half of the person's support during the year. The relative must have a gross annual income less than the exemption amount. Tax savings depend on the taxpayer's marginal tax rate, with potential savings of $350 in the 10% bracket and $875 in the 25% bracket. Unmarried caregivers may be eligible for a more advantageous tax filing status. Unmarried taxpayers can claim head of household filing status if they paid more than half the cost of keeping up a home and a qualifying person lived with them for more than half the year. This status is more advantageous than the single filing status, with a higher standard deduction and more favorable tax brackets. In 2008, head of household tax rate starts at $43,650 taxable income. Caregivers can deduct unreimbursed medical expenses exceeding 7.5% of AGI for themselves, spouse, or dependents. Qualifying dependents with income over $3,500 can also have medical expenses deducted. Expenses must be for mental or physical illness, not general health, including equipment, supplies, and health insurance. The tax deduction for medical expenses includes health insurance premiums, transportation costs, and long-term care expenses. However, it is not widely used as most taxpayers opt for the standard deduction. Only a small percentage of tax returns claim a medical expense deduction. Congress may need to consider expanding federal support for family caregivers as the elderly population grows. Some policy makers may prefer enhancing services or providing federal income tax relief to family caregivers, leading to tradeoffs between caregiver support and other federal programs. Alternatively, some suggest increasing state assistance and providing technical support to states for caregiver services. Congress may also consider that the federal government has limited responsibility in assisting unpaid family caregivers. The federal government may need to evaluate existing funds instead of providing additional assistance to family caregivers. Three policy areas are discussed: enhancing caregiver services, assisting employed caregivers with workplace accommodations and income security, and providing tax credits. Many caregivers express the need for more support to help with their responsibilities. Policy makers and advocates suggest enhancing caregiver services by providing respite care, education, and training to improve care quality and prevent burnout. Targeting services for specific illnesses like Alzheimer's and assessing caregiver needs for eligibility determination are also recommended. The caregiver assessment process identifies services and support for family caregivers, including back-up support, counseling, and respite care. It also assesses caregiver health, willingness to provide care, and training needs. Family caregivers may face work disruptions such as arriving late, leaving early, or reducing hours due to elder care responsibilities, impacting income and job security. Work disruptions can impact income and job security, especially for those caring for older disabled family members. Providing workplace accommodations like unpaid leave and paid time off for caregiving can help alleviate financial burdens. Flexible workplace policies and publicly funded programs that support family caregivers can prevent individuals from leaving the workforce and provide income security. Tax relief measures, including targeted tax credits and expanded tax relief, can provide income security for family caregivers of disabled older individuals. These measures can offset expenses related to caregiving such as transportation, assistive devices, home modifications, dietary supplements, adult day health care, and medical services. Additionally, broadening the taxpayer population eligible for tax relief can further support family caregivers. Expanding tax relief measures for family caregivers could include broadening the definition of dependents to cover disabled older relatives not living with the taxpayer and including eldercare expenses. This report will be updated as needed."
