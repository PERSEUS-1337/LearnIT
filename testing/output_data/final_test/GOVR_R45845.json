Both provisions affect different groups of beneficiaries, with some individuals being impacted by both. As of December 2018, 263,775 beneficiaries had their benefits reduced by both WEP and GPO, creating complexities in benefit calculations and administration. This report examines the current-law provisions of the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), who is affected by both provisions, the size of the affected population, issues related to Social Security overpayments, the impact of the two offsets on benefits and household wealth, and how extending Social Security coverage through Section 218 agreements affects those affected by both provisions. The Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) was enacted in 1983 to remove an unintended advantage in the Social Security benefit formula for workers with pensions from noncovered employment. It affects about 7% of workers not covered by Social Security, including state and local government employees and some federal employees hired before 1984. Social Security beneficiaries with pensions from noncovered employment may be impacted by the WEP and the Government Pension Offset (GPO). The Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) adjusts Social Security benefits for workers with pensions from noncovered employment. It aims to prevent an unintended advantage for those who have not contributed substantially to Social Security. The WEP reduces the initial monthly benefit by using a different formula for calculation. It applies to individuals with pensions from noncovered work and fewer than 30 years of substantial earnings in covered employment. In 2019, the WEP reduces the share of the first $926 of average indexed monthly covered earnings. In 2019, the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) reduces Social Security benefits for workers with pensions from noncovered employment. The reduction amount ranges from $833.40 to $370.40 per month, with a maximum decrease of $463.00. The impact of the WEP reduction is smaller for workers with more years of substantial covered employment. Additionally, the WEP guarantees that the benefit reduction is limited to one-half of the noncovered pension. Social Security spousal and survivors benefits are paid to spouses of retired, disabled, or deceased workers covered by Social Security. The Social Security dual entitlement rule states that a person's spousal benefit is reduced by their own retired or disabled worker benefit, with the higher amount being paid. The Government Pension Offset (GPO) reduces spousal or survivors benefits by two-thirds of a noncovered government pension. This affects Social Security beneficiaries who receive pensions from noncovered employment. Beneficiaries are impacted by the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and Government Pension Offset (GPO) if they receive a noncovered government pension and have reduced Social Security benefits. The WEP affects retired workers, while the GPO affects those entitled to spousal benefits. Examples show how these provisions affect Social Security benefits. The retired worker's spousal benefit is reduced to zero under the dual entitlement rule. The worker's total retirement benefits amount to $1,600, based on the WEP formula and a noncovered pension. Spouses and survivors are only affected by the GPO if they are not entitled to Social Security benefits based on their own earnings record. The spousal benefit is reduced by two-thirds of the noncovered pension, resulting in a net spousal benefit of $400. Social Security beneficiaries are affected by both the WEP and the GPO if they receive WEP-adjusted retired worker benefits and a reduced spousal benefit. In some cases, the spousal benefit remains positive after the GPO reduction. The net spousal benefit is calculated by reducing the spousal benefit by the worker's benefit and two-thirds of the noncovered pension. In some cases, the Social Security spousal benefit may be reduced to zero after the GPO reduction. The spousal benefit for a worker ends at zero if based on the spouse's working record, resulting in total benefits of $1,600. Around 2.3 million Social Security beneficiaries had benefits reduced by the WEP, the GPO, or both as of December 2018. Over 11% were subject to both provisions, with those affected by both the WEP and GPO accounting for 38% of spouses and survivors affected by the GPO and 14% of beneficiaries affected by the WEP. This section discusses issues related to dually entitled Social Security beneficiaries affected by both the WEP and the GPO, including overpayments and the impact on benefits. The improper payments occurred because SSA did not properly impose the WEP and GPO on dually entitled beneficiaries who also receive a pension based on noncovered employment. In a January 2013 report, SSA's Office of the Inspector General identified overpayments to dually entitled beneficiaries, estimating approximately $349.5 million for WEP reduction and $320.6 million for GPO offset. SSA overpaid dually entitled beneficiaries by $231.9 million from 2013 to 2017. Without corrective action, annual overpayments of approximately $46.4 million may continue. In 2018, OIG identified beneficiaries with improper GPO and WEP reductions. SSA planned system alerts to prevent further improper payments. The OIG identified improper payments to Social Security beneficiaries due to failure to report pension information, leading to overpayments. GPO errors were a significant factor in the increase of overpayment error rates. Proposals have been suggested to improve the collection of pension information for administering the WEP and GPO. The President's FY2020 budget includes a proposal for up to $70 million for administrative expenses related to the WEP and the GPO. SSA is in discussions with the IRS to obtain noncovered pension information. The WEP and the GPO reduce Social Security benefits for couples, with the largest impact on households affected by both provisions. The study found that the present value of lifetime Social Security benefits and total household wealth were lower among households subject to both the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and Government Pension Offset (GPO) than among households subject to either provision alone. About one-quarter of state and local government employees, or approximately 6.4 million individuals, are not covered by Social Security. Social Security coverage for state and local government employees can be extended through a voluntary Section 218 Agreement. If employees vote in favor, all current and future employees under the public retirement system will be covered. Adoption of this agreement may lead to some beneficiaries being subject to the Windfall Elimination Provision and Government Pension Offset. Without Social Security coverage, a worker may have no retired-worker benefits and reduced spousal benefits due to the Government Pension Offset (GPO). If coverage is later added, the worker may receive positive retirement benefits based on their own earnings record, subject to both the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and GPO. This would result in dually entitled Social Security retirement and spousal benefits. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of Social Security coverage on retirement and spousal benefits, including reductions due to the dual entitlement rule and the Government Pension Offset (GPO). It provides examples of how extending a spouse's Social Security coverage can affect benefits, resulting in dually entitled benefits for the beneficiary. The curr_chunk explains how the Social Security spousal benefits are affected by the dual entitlement rule and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), resulting in reduced or zero benefits for beneficiaries. It also discusses how extending Social Security coverage through a Section 218 Agreement can impact future beneficiaries by potentially reducing the impact of these provisions. The curr_chunk discusses how a dually entitled beneficiary subject to both the WEP and the GPO might be exempted from the GPO under certain conditions, such as switching from a noncovered to a covered position for at least five years."
