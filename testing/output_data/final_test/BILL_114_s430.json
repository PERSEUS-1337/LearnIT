    "content": "The Act titled \"Protecting Children from Electronic Cigarette Advertising Act of 2015\" aims to address the findings and express the sense of Congress regarding electronic cigarette advertising. Congress finds that electronic cigarettes have not been fully studied, leading to uncertainty about their potential risks, nicotine levels, and benefits. Most e-cigarettes contain varying levels of nicotine, a highly addictive drug with cardiovascular impacts. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of nicotine, as stated by the Surgeon General. The use of electronic cigarettes among youth has increased significantly, with a study showing a tripling in usage from 2011 to 2013. This trend raises concerns about potential addiction to nicotine and the possibility of it being a gateway to other tobacco products. Marketing tactics targeting youth, such as using cartoons and sponsoring popular events, are contributing to this issue. According to a study in Pediatrics, youth exposure to e-cigarette ads increased by 256% from 2011 to 2013, reaching 24 million children. Congress believes the FTC should ban e-cigarette advertising to protect youth health. PROHIBITION ON MARKETING OF ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES TO CHILDREN. Electronic cigarette is defined as a device delivering nicotine or other chemicals via vaporized solution. It excludes FDA-approved tobacco cessation products. Prohibition on advertising electronic cigarettes to children. Prohibition on advertising electronic cigarettes in states where sales to children under 18 are prohibited by law. No advertising that promotes or appeals to children under 18. The Federal Trade Commission enforces violations of unfair or deceptive acts related to electronic cigarette advertising, with the same powers and jurisdiction as under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Federal Trade Commission enforces violations of unfair or deceptive acts related to electronic cigarette advertising, with penalties and privileges under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC will also establish rules for enforcement, and states can take action through their attorney general if residents are affected by violations. The attorney general of the State can bring a civil action on behalf of residents in federal court to stop violations, ensure compliance, seek damages, and impose civil penalties for violations of electronic cigarette advertising regulations. The amount for non-compliance with subsection (b)(1) is calculated by multiplying the number of days out of compliance by a maximum of $16,000, with adjustments for inflation based on the Consumer Price Index. The Federal Trade Commission has rights regarding enforcement. The attorney general of a State must notify the Federal Trade Commission before bringing a civil action, including a copy of the complaint, with exceptions for feasibility. The attorney general of a State must notify the Federal Trade Commission before initiating a civil action, with exceptions for feasibility. The FTC can intervene in the civil action and be heard on all matters arising from it. The attorney general of a State can file petitions for appeal in a civil action. State attorney generals have investigatory powers to conduct investigations and compel witnesses. If the Federal Trade Commission takes action for a violation, State attorney generals cannot bring a civil action during that time. A civil action can be brought against a defendant named in the Commission's complaint for a violation. The action can be filed in a district court meeting venue requirements or another court of competent jurisdiction. Process serving can occur in any district where the defendant resides. The defendant can be sued in a district court where they reside or can be found. State officials authorized by the state can also bring civil actions under the same requirements as attorneys general. This does not prevent state officials from pursuing legal action for violations of state laws. The section does not limit the FDA's authority to regulate electronic cigarette marketing, including to children. It does not override state laws unless they conflict with this section."
