    "content": "The Act titled \"Safe Drinking Water Estrogenic Substances Screening Program Act\" establishes a screening program for estrogenic substances under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Title XIV of the Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to include a screening program for substances with estrogenic effects in humans. The Administrator is required to develop the program within one year and implement it within two years. The Administrator is mandated to implement a screening program for substances with estrogenic effects in humans, as outlined in Title XIV of the Safe Drinking Water Act. This program includes testing all active and inert ingredients in certain products, with the possibility of testing other substances if widespread exposure is a concern. The Administrator has the authority to exempt substances from testing requirements if they do not have estrogenic effects in humans. Additionally, manufacturers must conduct testing and submit information to the Administrator as part of the screening program. If a person fails to submit required information within the specified time period, the Administrator will issue a notice of intent to suspend the sale or distribution of the substance. The suspension will become final after a 30-day period unless action is taken. If a person fails to submit required information, the Administrator will issue a notice of intent to suspend. A hearing can be requested to determine compliance with the requirements. After a hearing, the Administrator's decision is final. Suspensions can be terminated if full compliance is achieved. The Administrator will take necessary regulatory action for substances with potential adverse effects on humans. The Administrator will report to Congress within 4 years of enacting the subsection, detailing findings from the screening program, recommendations for further testing, research on substances' impact on human health, and any necessary actions based on the findings."
