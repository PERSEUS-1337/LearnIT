    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"TRANSFER Act\" and includes a grant program for innovative technology transfer approaches. The Small Business Act is amended to include a grant program for innovative technology transfer approaches, defining terms like 'covered agency' and 'eligible institution' as part of the program. The Small Business Act is amended to establish a grant program for innovative technology transfer approaches involving higher education, Federal laboratories, and nonprofit entities. Key terms like 'Federal laboratory' and 'institution of higher education' are defined within the program. The Small Business Act is amended to establish the Innovative Approaches to Technology Transfer Grant Program for improving commercialization of federally funded research by small businesses through eligible institutions. Grants can be used to accelerate technology transfer. The Innovative Approaches to Technology Transfer Grant Program may provide funding for translational research, technology commercialization, prototype construction, market research, intellectual property rights, mentoring, and business opportunities. The Innovative Approaches to Technology Transfer Grant Program offers funding for various activities such as providing advice, mentoring, entrepreneurial education, project management, and technology and business development expertise to innovators. It also conducts outreach to small businesses as potential licensees of federally funded research and technology. Eligible institutions must submit an application to a covered agency to receive a grant under the program. The application for a grant under the Innovative Approaches to Technology Transfer Grant Program must be submitted to a covered agency with required information on innovative technology transfer approaches that can be adopted by other eligible institutions. The application for a grant under the Innovative Approaches to Technology Transfer Grant Program must include a plan to implement proven technology transfer and commercialization strategies, contribute to local and regional economic development, ensure sustainability after grant funds are used, and assemble a plan for greater commercialization of federally funded research and technology. The Innovative Approaches to Technology Transfer Grant Program requires eligible institutions to establish an oversight board to manage award programs and evaluate project applications on a competitive basis. The oversight board of eligible institutions evaluates project applications, determines award recipients, sets milestones and award amounts, monitors project progress, and reallocates funds from underperforming projects to those with more potential. The oversight board assembled under clause (i) must consist of members with relevant technical, scientific, or business expertise, with three-fifths from industries like start-ups, venture capital, technical enterprises, and financial institutions known for success. The oversight board must adopt policies to prohibit conflicts of interest, ensure disclosure of relevant relationships, and establish recusal procedures in case of conflicts. An eligible institution may use existing oversight boards to ensure compliance with conflict of interest policies. Grant amounts under the program shall not exceed $3,000,000. The institution receiving a grant must make awards for projects supporting specific activities, with a maximum amount of $100,000 provided in phased amounts based on project milestones. Authorized expenditures for the program are based on a percentage of the extramural research budget. The covered agency must expend a certain percentage of its extramural budget for research and development for its program, with specific percentages allocated for fiscal years 2015, 2016, and 2017. Additionally, any portion of the budget spent on the program will count towards the agency's STTR expenditure requirements. Each covered agency must develop a program evaluation plan to collect data on outcomes from technology transfers, including follow-on funding sources, within 3 years of awarding a project to an eligible institution. The covered agencies must collect data on outcomes from technology transfers, including the number of projects resulting in licenses to start-up or established companies, invention disclosures, patent applications, and patents issued within 5 years of receiving an award from an eligible institution under the program. The covered agencies must collect data on outcomes from technology transfers, including the number of projects resulting in licenses to start-up or established companies, invention disclosures, patent applications, and patents issued within 5 years of receiving an award from an eligible institution under the program. This includes information on revenue, sales, or other measures of products that have been commercialized as a result of projects receiving an award. The covered agencies are required to collect data on outcomes from technology transfers, including the number and location of jobs created as a result of projects receiving an award from an eligible institution under the program. Additionally, they must submit an evaluative report to Congress by September 30, 2018, with any other data deemed appropriate by the covered agency. The House of Representatives requires a report from covered agencies evaluating program activities, including implementation details, selection processes for grants, fund usage, and data collection. This is for program transparency and best practices dissemination. The Administrator will include information on covered agency programs, such as program evaluation plans, recipients of awards by State, and award usage on the public database for transparency and best practices dissemination."
