    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Technology Bill of Rights for the Blind Act of 2010\". Congress acknowledges that rapid advances in technology have led to complex user interfaces on everyday products, making them inaccessible to blind or low-vision individuals. This includes devices like consumer electronics, home appliances, and office equipment such as copiers and fax machines. The lack of accessibility in electronic devices like copiers and fax machines poses a threat to blind individuals' job opportunities. Additionally, inaccessible electronic kiosks hinder blind people from making purchases, checking in for flights, and accessing public information, impacting their independence and productivity unnecessarily. Text-to-speech technology is widely used in various devices, making them accessible to both blind and sighted users. Manufacturers are incorporating nonvisual technology, such as talking menus, to enhance usability. Apple, Inc. is an example of a company that has implemented such features in their products. Blind and low-vision individuals should have equal access to electronic devices like iPhones and iPods, with features like tactile markings or audible tones making them accessible. All manufacturers can make their products usable for everyone, not just those with normal vision. The Secretary will conduct a study on how blind consumers can access covered devices nonvisually. This includes reviewing existing research, commissioning additional research, consulting with blind consumer groups, and manufacturers. A report on the findings must be submitted to Congress within 2 years of the Act's enactment. SEC. 4. The Secretary will establish minimum nonvisual access standards for covered devices within 180 days of the report submission. These standards will ensure blind consumers can access the devices nonvisually. A 2-year effective date will apply to devices manufactured after the standard is set. The Secretary will establish an Office of Nonvisual Access Compliance within 2 years of the Act's enactment. The Office will assist in conducting studies, preparing reports, and educating manufacturers on minimum nonvisual access standards for covered devices. The Secretary will investigate complaints regarding noncompliance with nonvisual access standards for covered devices and enforce compliance with these standards. Additionally, the Secretary may conduct other investigations to ensure adherence to these standards. The Secretary will enforce nonvisual access standards for covered devices, taking enforcement action if a manufacturer fails to comply. This includes providing notice, opportunity to correct violations, and imposing civil penalties. If the Secretary, through the Director, takes action on a violation, the manufacturer will be notified of the violation and given a time period to correct it to avoid a civil penalty. If the violation is not corrected within the specified time period, a civil monetary penalty may be assessed against the manufacturer. The Secretary may assess a civil monetary penalty of at least 10 percent of the retail value of the noncompliant device for each unit manufactured without notice in certain cases. The Secretary may assess a civil monetary penalty based on the retail value of the noncompliant device for each unit manufactured without notice. SEC. 6. PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. A blind consumer can take legal action against a manufacturer of a covered device that does not comply with nonvisual access standards. The court may award monetary damages if the device is found to be in violation of the standards. The court may provide equitable relief, including injunctive relief and attorneys' fees, for a noncompliant office technology device. Punitive damages may be awarded for willful violations by the manufacturer. SEC. 7. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION. Nothing in this Act shall limit the rights of blind or low-vision individuals under other law. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions for terms like \"blind consumer,\" \"consumer electronic device,\" and \"covered device\" are provided. A blind consumer is defined as an individual with severe vision impairment, a consumer electronic device is designed for end-users, and a covered device includes various electronic products manufactured for sale in the United States. The term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the Office of Nonvisual Access Compliance. An \"electronic kiosk\" is an interactive device for selling goods or conveying information to the public. An \"encounter\" involves the purchase or use of a consumer electronic device or home appliance. The term \"home appliance\" refers to an electric appliance designed for residential use. The term \"minimum nonvisual access standard\" is a standard for nonvisual access. \"Nonvisual access\" means using a device without relying on eyesight. The term \"Office\" refers to the Office of Nonvisual Access Compliance. The term \"Office\" refers to the Office of Nonvisual Access Compliance established under section 5(a). The term \"office technology device\" refers to an electric device or computer software application designed for office use. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Commerce."
