    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include the Paul D. Coverdell Teacher Liability Protection Act of 2001, providing liability protection for teachers. The Paul D. Coverdell Teacher Liability Protection Act of 2001 acknowledges the challenges faced by teachers, principals, and school professionals due to frivolous lawsuits, violence in schools, and the need for a safe environment to improve educational opportunities. The Paul D. Coverdell Teacher Liability Protection Act of 2001 aims to clarify and limit the liability of teachers, principals, and school professionals to maintain order and discipline in schools, emphasizing the importance of protecting educators from frivolous lawsuits to ensure a safe and appropriate educational environment for children nationwide. The purpose of the Paul D. Coverdell Teacher Liability Protection Act of 2001 is to provide educators with the tools needed to maintain order, discipline, and an appropriate educational environment for children. The Paul D. Coverdell Teacher Liability Protection Act of 2001 preempts state laws inconsistent with the Act, except for laws providing additional protection for teachers. States can elect nonapplicability of the Act to civil actions against teachers by enacting specific legislation. The Act also limits liability for teachers. Liability Protection for Teachers under the Paul D. Coverdell Teacher Liability Protection Act of 2001 includes immunity for harm caused by acts or omissions within the scope of employment, compliance with laws, and proper licensing. The Paul D. Coverdell Teacher Liability Protection Act of 2001 provides immunity for harm caused by teachers within the scope of their responsibilities, as long as it was not due to willful misconduct, gross negligence, or operating a vehicle without proper licensing. This does not affect civil actions brought by schools or governmental entities against teachers. The Paul D. Coverdell Teacher Liability Protection Act of 2001 provides immunity for harm caused by teachers within their responsibilities, except for willful misconduct or gross negligence. State laws imposing risk management procedures or making entities liable for teacher actions are exceptions. Limitations on punitive damages based on teacher actions are also included. The Paul D. Coverdell Teacher Liability Protection Act of 2001 provides immunity for harm caused by teachers within their responsibilities, except for willful misconduct or gross negligence. Punitive damages against a teacher can only be awarded if clear and convincing evidence shows willful or criminal misconduct, or conscious indifference to the harmed individual's rights or safety. This provision does not create a new cause of action for punitive damages and does not override any existing federal or state laws limiting punitive damages. The limitations on the liability of a teacher under the Paul D. Coverdell Teacher Liability Protection Act of 2001 do not apply in cases involving certain serious misconduct, such as crimes of violence, sexual offenses, violations of civil rights laws, or acts of international terrorism. The limitations on liability under the Paul D. Coverdell Teacher Liability Protection Act do not apply in cases involving serious misconduct, including crimes of violence, sexual offenses, violations of civil rights laws, or intoxication at the time of misconduct. \"SEC. 15005. LIABILITY FOR NONECONOMIC LOSS.\" In civil actions against teachers, liability for noneconomic loss is determined based on the teacher's responsibility. Each defendant teacher is liable for a portion of noneconomic loss in proportion to their responsibility for the harm. The court will issue separate judgments for each defendant. The trier of fact determines the percentage of responsibility for each person involved in the claimant's harm, including teachers, to allocate noneconomic loss. \"SEC. 15006. DEFINITIONS.\" The term 'economic loss' refers to pecuniary loss resulting from harm, including loss of earnings, medical expenses, burial costs, and loss of business opportunities. 'Harm' encompasses physical, nonphysical, economic, and noneconomic losses. 'Noneconomic losses' include physical and emotional pain, suffering, mental anguish, disfigurement, and loss of enjoyment of life. The term 'school' refers to public or private educational institutions, including kindergarten, elementary, secondary schools, and homeschooling. The term 'State' includes all states of the United States, territories, and political subdivisions. A 'teacher' is defined as an educational professional working in a school. The Paul D. Coverdell Teacher Liability Protection Act of 2001 will take effect 90 days after enactment. It applies to any claim for harm caused by a teacher's act or omission filed on or after the effective date, regardless of when the harm occurred."
