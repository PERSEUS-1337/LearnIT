    "content": "STATE PROGRAMS FOR CLEAN UP OF MUNICIPAL WASTE LANDFILL SUPERFUND SITES. Amends the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 by adding a new section regarding Municipal Waste Landfill Sites. State Programs: States can develop and submit programs to the EPA for remediating qualified municipal waste landfills. The Administrator must approve or disapprove the program within 180 days based on compliance with specified provisions. Upon approval, the program falls under the regulations of this title. Upon approval of a state program for remediating qualified municipal waste landfills, the provisions of this title (excluding specific sections) do not apply to covered landfills. If the program is disapproved, the Administrator must provide reasons and allow for corrections and resubmission. The President will establish regulations for response actions, including a presumptive remedy and closure consistent with the Solid Waste Disposal Act. The presumptive remedy for remediating qualified municipal waste landfills includes waste consolidation, final cover with specific requirements, landfill gas control, surface water controls, and leachate control where feasible and necessary. The landfill remediation process includes control of leachate, ground water monitoring, assurance of no contamination migration, and institutional controls to prevent future exposure to waste. The landfill site must have beneficial uses authorized by the local land control authority, such as parkland or waste management facilities. Residential use is not allowed at sites with presumptive remedies. Site security and a post-closure care plan are required to maintain containment measures. Additional protections may be required if the presumptive remedy is deemed insufficient based on site-specific risk factors. The President will reimburse States with approved municipal waste landfill remediation programs for costs incurred in cleaning up hazardous substances at qualified landfills listed on the National Priorities List, using funds from the Hazardous Substance Superfund up to $5 billion. Reimbursement for remediation costs is provided based on Hazard Ranking System rankings, with higher-ranked facilities receiving priority. No reimbursement is given for transaction or related costs. Reimbursement is effective for costs incurred after State program approval. Transition provisions apply for remediation started before program approval and not completed by January 1, 1994. The President may reimburse costs for remediation if it meets specified criteria. The Administrator cannot reimburse costs for remediation completed before January 1, 1994. A State with an approved remediation program covering qualified landfills may be exempt from liability for hazardous substance releases. The exemption under this subsection applies to qualified landfills, except for those where remediation was completed before January 1, 1994, or if a person violated laws related to waste disposal. Liability for injuries, damages, or other claims resulting from releases or threatened releases is subject to this exemption. The term 'qualified municipal waste landfill' refers to landfills listed on the National Priorities List and designated by the Administrator as owned by a municipality or county, or privately-owned sites receiving municipal waste. The Administrator will publish a list of such sites within 30 days. The Administrator will publish a list of qualified municipal waste landfill sites within 30 days after the enactment of this section. Payment of up to $5 billion for remediating municipal waste landfills under Section 127 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980."
