    "content": "Since the 1960s, emission standards for motor vehicles have significantly reduced emissions by at least 95%. However, due to the increasing number of vehicles on the road and their higher mileage, emissions from cars and trucks remain a major contributor to air pollution issues. The Clean Air Act has mandated emission standards for new automobiles since 1965, with amendments made over the years. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is required to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for common pollutants. The EPA sets National Ambient Air Quality Standards for pollutants from various sources to protect public health. Despite reductions in major pollutants since 1970, air quality still does not meet standards in many areas. On-road vehicles are significant contributors to carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, and particulate matter emissions. Emission requirements for new vehicles have been strengthened over the years, with the most recent \"Tier 2\" standards implemented in 2000. The \"Tier 2\" standards, implemented in February 2000, required vehicle manufacturers to reduce tailpipe emissions of pollutants like carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, nitrogen oxides, non-methane organic gases, and particulate matter. The standards aimed to control ground-level ozone pollution by targeting NMOG and NOx emissions. Manufacturers had flexibility in averaging NOx emissions across their fleets to meet the standards, with a significant reduction in overall tailpipe emissions required. The Tier 2 standards, implemented in 2000, required an 80% reduction in PM emissions and less stringent reduction in CO emissions for new vehicles up to 10,000 pounds. Oil refiners had to limit sulfur levels in gasoline to 30 ppm nationwide by 2005 to prevent catalytic converter fouling and reduce NMOG, NOx, and CO emissions. The EPA and NHTSA have been regulating vehicle fuel economy and emissions since 1975. They have issued joint rulemakings to tighten passenger CAFE and GHG standards for MY2017-2025, aiming for nearly 41.0 mpg in MY2021 and 49.7 mpg in MY2025. GHG emissions from new vehicles are expected to decline by about 50% as a result of these standards. These regulations are not directly associated with the Tier 2/Tier 3 standards, but they would assist in reducing NMOG, NOx, and CO emissions. In February 2011, EPA began scoping new emissions standards for conventional pollutants from cars and light trucks as mandated by a May 2010 memorandum from the White House. Over 149 million Americans are currently experiencing unhealthy levels of air pollution, linked with respiratory and cardiovascular problems. Motor vehicles, especially in urban areas, are a significant source of air pollution linked to respiratory and cardiovascular issues. EPA introduced Tier 3 standards in 2014 to address emissions from passenger cars and light trucks. The Tier 3 standards, effective June 27, 2014, focus on integrating vehicle and fuel systems to lower emissions. Controversial prior to release, they set limits on tailpipe emissions for NMOG and NOx. Congressional members expressed concerns over costs and urged further study. The Tier 3 standards, effective June 27, 2014, focus on reducing emissions by setting limits on tailpipe emissions for NMOG, NOx, and particulate matter for light-duty vehicles and some medium and heavy-duty vehicles. The standards represent significant reductions compared to current standards, with approximately an 80% reduction in NMOG and NOx for light-duty vehicles and a 60% reduction for heavy-duty vehicles. The standards apply to all light-duty vehicles and trucks, regardless of the fuel they use. The EPA is extending the regulatory useful life period for tailpipe standards from 120,000 miles to 150,000 miles. Different phase-in schedules apply between MY2017 and MY2025, with flexibilities for manufacturers including credits for early compliance and the ability to offset higher-emitting vehicles with cleaner models. Fleet-average standards for NMOG+NOx require manufacturers to calculate weighted average emissions. Additional lead time is provided for small businesses and a hardship provision allows for extra compliance time if needed. The EPA requires manufacturers to calculate weighted average emissions for each model year and compare it to applicable standards. PM standards vary by vehicle class and test procedures, with separate standards for each vehicle. Tier 3 also includes standards for fuel vapor-related evaporative emissions, with a 50% reduction from current standards applying to all light-duty and on-road gasoline-powered heavy-duty vehicles. Flexibilities, credit programs, and lead time are provided, with a hardship provision for small businesses. The EPA's Tier 3 standards include flexibilities, credit programs, and lead time for small businesses. The new gasoline sulfur standards aim to make emission control systems more effective for both existing and new vehicles. Tier 3 standards include an ABT program for refiners and importers to meet emission standards, with a three-year delay for small refiners. The program updates federal emissions test fuel specifications to match current gasoline and future ethanol content, including 10% ethanol by volume and lower sulfur and octane levels. The Tier 3 vehicle and fuel standards aim to reduce emissions of NOx, VOC, PM 2.5, and air toxics by implementing lower sulfur gasoline with 10% ethanol. EPA projects a significant reduction in SO2 emissions, as well as decreases in NOx, VOC, and CO emissions by 2030. The Tier 3 vehicle and fuel standards aim to reduce emissions of NOx, VOC, PM 2.5, and air toxics by implementing lower sulfur gasoline with 10% ethanol. Emissions of various air toxics are projected to be reduced by 10% to 30%, leading to decreased ozone levels and improved air quality by 2030. EPA expects these standards to prevent between 660 and 1,500 PM-related premature deaths and between 110 and 500 ozone-related premature deaths annually. The Tier 3 standards aim to reduce emissions and improve air quality by implementing lower sulfur gasoline with 10% ethanol. It is estimated that the standards would prevent 1,500 PM-related premature deaths, 500 ozone-related premature deaths, 2,200 asthma-related hospital admissions, and other health issues. The annual health benefits are projected to be between $7.4 billion and $19 billion. Auto manufacturers support the standards as they facilitate the use of new technology and harmonize U.S. fuel requirements with foreign fuels. The Tier 3 gasoline sulfur standards aim to harmonize U.S. fuel requirements with foreign fuels, benefiting auto manufacturers by enabling streamlined production and decreased compliance costs. The EPA proposal has garnered support from Members of Congress, industry, environmental and public health groups, as well as governors and state officials. The Tier 3 standards aim to tighten regulations on vehicles and gasoline to improve air quality. Some stakeholders believe that without these standards, more controls on stationary sources of pollution would be necessary. However, trade organizations argue that the impact on air quality would be minimal. Studies show improvements in ozone and particulate concentrations with Tier 2 standards, but project small additional reductions with Tier 3. API argues that the Tier 3 proposal overlooks previous sulfur standards' success in reducing ambient ozone levels. They claim that the new rules would not provide significant benefits but impose high costs on gasoline production. API also highlights the need to consider the rule's impact alongside other EPA mandates for the refinery sector. EPA's analysis of the Tier 3 standards aligns with studies showing modest improvements in ozone and particulate reductions. EPA estimates that by 2030, ozone and fine particulate levels would decrease an additional 50% on average under the Tier 3 standards. The economic cost imposed by the standards will affect vehicle manufacturing and petroleum refining sectors. Vehicle design changes are expected to increase production costs, with price increases ranging from $46 to $65 for cars, $73 to $88 for trucks, and $33 to $75 for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles covered by the rule. This price increase may lower the quantity of vehicles sold. The potential impact of the new fuel standards on gasoline prices has sparked controversy. Refiners argue that meeting the standards will be costly, with estimates of nearly $10 billion in refinery capital expenditures and a 1% increase in refinery GHG emissions. Some Senators have raised concerns about the price of gasoline rising due to the new standards. The EPA's proposed rule aims to reduce gasoline sulfur levels, which could increase manufacturing costs by 6 to 9 cents per gallon and refinery GHG emissions by 1%. However, the EPA estimates that this would only add less than a penny to the price of a gallon of gasoline. Refinery costs typically make up 10.6% of the retail cost of gasoline, and the sulfur control for Tier 3 would only add 0.2 percentage points to this component. Studies support the EPA's evaluation of gasoline sulfur control costs. The EPA estimates the annual compliance cost of the program in 2030 to be approximately $1.5 billion, with benefits ranging from $6.7 billion to $19 billion. The final rule allows a three-year delay for small refiners and includes flexibility measures for the refining industry to meet the standards."
