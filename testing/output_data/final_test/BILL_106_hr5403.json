    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Miami Nation of Indiana Act\". The Miami Nation of Indians of Indiana, Inc., is the modern governing body of the Miami Nation of Indiana, descendant of the signatory of the Treaty of 1854. The Miamis historically lived in northern and central Indiana, entering into treaties with the US ceding land between 1795 and 1840. The 1840 Treaty required all Miamis to... In 1840, the Miamis were required to move west of the Mississippi River, but they resisted and only half were forcibly removed to Kansas. Some Miamis stayed in Kansas while others remained in Indiana. In 1854, the Federal Government recognized the Indiana Miamis as a separate tribe and negotiated treaties with them. In 1897, the Secretary of the Interior withdrew the acknowledgement of the Indiana Miamis as a federally recognized Indian tribe. Congress never authorized the termination of the Indiana Miamis, making the 1897 termination by the Secretary of the Interior invalid. Tribes like the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma received benefits from the Indian Reorganization Act. The Indiana Miamis have continued to carry out governmental functions through a tribal council despite being denied recognition under the Indian Reorganization Act. The Department of the Interior admitted in 1990 that the trust relationship with the Indiana Miamis was wrongfully terminated, but no action has been taken to correct the error. There has been administrative neglect, violation of treaty obligations, and misapplication of Federal law towards the Indiana Miamis for over 100 years. The Indiana Miamis have faced injustice and administrative neglect for over 100 years. Their dignity and self-esteem should be restored through the restoration of Federal recognition. The Act defines key terms such as \"Tribe,\" \"Secretary,\" \"member,\" \"State,\" \"reservation,\" and \"service area.\" It also addresses the restoration of Federal recognition, rights, and privileges for the Miami Nation of Indiana. Federal recognition is restored to the Miami Nation of Indiana, along with rights and privileges that were previously diminished. The Tribe and its members are eligible for Federal services and benefits without the need for a reservation. Federal services and benefits are available to federally recognized Indian tribes and their members without the need for a reservation. Eligibility for these services and benefits will not affect other financial aid programs or benefits received by the Tribe or individual. The Indian Self-Determination Act applies to grants, contracts, and benefits for tribes. The Act does not impact hunting, fishing, trapping, gathering, or water rights of the Tribe and its members. It also does not alter property rights, contractual obligations, or tax responsibilities, except as specified in the Act. TRANSFER OF LAND TO BE HELD IN TRUST. Upon application, the Secretary shall accept real property in Indiana into trust for the Tribe, subject to certain conditions. Trust lands include those within the Tribe's service area and become part of the reservation. Gaming rights of the Miami Nation of Indiana are suspended under this Act. The Miami Nation of Indiana can engage in all gaming activities under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, but Congress must approve class III gaming. Any real property taken into trust for the Tribe is exempt from local, State, and Federal taxation once transferred to the Secretary. The Secretary will accept the Tribe's current membership roll, membership criteria, and constitution."
