    "content": "The 2018 farm bill reauthorized and amended USDA agricultural conservation programs, including working lands, land retirement, easement, conservation compliance, and partnership/grants. Most programs receive mandatory funding until FY2023. Other conservation programs, like watershed and emergency programs, have permanent authorities and annual appropriations outside the farm bill. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized and amended USDA agricultural conservation programs, including working lands, land retirement, easement, conservation compliance, and partnership/grants. This section discusses programmatic-specific amendments made to various conservation programs and subprograms, with a focus on the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) as the primary land retirement program. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is the primary land retirement program authorized in the 2018 farm bill. It offers financial compensation to landowners to remove land from agricultural production for 10-15 years to improve soil, water quality, and wildlife habitat. CRP has general and continuous enrollment options to enroll land based on specific conservation practices or resource needs. The 2018 farm bill introduced amendments to the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), including new pilot programs and changes to existing subprograms. Congressional debate focused on increasing enrollment limits without raising costs. The bill gradually raises the enrollment cap from 24 million acres in FY2019 to 27 million acres in FY2023, while reducing rental rates and incentive payments. The 2018 farm bill amended the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) by introducing new pilot programs and changes to existing subprograms. It gradually raises the enrollment cap from 24 million acres in FY2019 to 27 million acres in FY2023, while reducing rental rates and incentive payments. Cost-share payments are limited to the actual cost of establishing approved practices, with minimum enrollment levels set for continuous and grassland contracts. The bill authorizes USDA to enter into agreements with states for targeted continuous CRP enrollment contracts to address specific environmental objectives. The 2018 farm bill amended the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) to allow for targeted continuous CRP enrollment with additional financial incentives. The bill expands eligible partners to include nongovernmental organizations (NGO) and formalizes agreement requirements, including matching fund contributions. Payments from partners can be in cash, in-kind, or through technical assistance. The Farmable Wetlands Program (FW) was created in the 2002 farm bill as a pilot within CRP to enroll farmable or prior converted wetlands into CRP for additional financial incentives. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized the FW program with a 750,000 acre enrollment limit. The 2014 farm bill authorized grassland contracts under CRP for grassland, rangeland, and pastureland with select grazing practices allowed in exchange for payments. The 2018 farm bill reauthorizes the contracts and increases the enrollment limit to not less than 2 million acres by FY2021. The 2018 farm bill prioritizes enrolling expiring CRP land, land at risk of development, or land of ecological significance. It introduces the CLEAR 30 pilot program for 30-year contracts aimed at improving water quality. Landowners must adhere to approved plans and receive compensation in thirty annual cash payments. The 2018 farm bill introduces the SHIPP pilot program under CRP for less productive farmland, with annual rental payments and low-cost perennial cover crops. Eligible land must meet specific criteria and no more than 15% of a farm can be enrolled in the pilot. The SHIPP pilot program under CRP allows participants to enroll up to 15% of their farm in the program, with a maximum of 50,000 acres. Participants plant low-cost, USDA-approved cover crops at their expense and receive 50% of the general CRP annual rental payment. Contracts last three to five years and allow for harvesting, haying, and grazing outside of nesting periods. Program participants in working lands programs receive conservation planning and technical assistance to implement various conservation practices addressing natural resource concerns. They also receive federal financial support to defray costs of installing or maintaining practices. The main programs, EQIP and CSP, receive more than half of conservation program funding. The 2018 farm bill amended both programs, with EQIP reauthorized and expanded. Detailed analysis of amendments is provided in tables. EQIP is reauthorized and expanded in the enacted bill, providing financial and technical assistance to producers for conservation practices on eligible lands. The program is reauthorized through FY2023 with increasing mandatory funding levels. Amendments focus on water quality, quantity-related practices, and soil health improvement. The 2018 farm bill reauthorizes and expands EQIP, providing assistance for conservation practices on eligible lands. Changes include a shift in funding allocation towards wildlife-related practices, expansion of water conservation system payments, and eligibility for irrigation and drainage entities. Priority is given to applications that reduce water use. The 2018 farm bill reauthorizes CSP, providing financial and technical assistance to producers for conservation activities. The bill combines elements from both the House and Senate-passed versions, maintaining CSP while also creating a stewardship contract within EQIP. The enacted 2018 farm bill reauthorizes the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) with amendments, shifting from acres to total funding as the limiting factor. This change is projected to reduce the program by over $12.4 billion over ten years. The bill also amends CSP's ranking criteria to focus on conservation benefits and adds a cost competitive selection criteria. The 2018 farm bill expands the Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG) program under EQIP to include new project eligibility such as community colleges and urban farming. It authorizes a new on-farm conservation innovation trial with $25 million annually from total EQIP funding for testing new conservation techniques. The 2018 farm bill expands the Conservation Innovation Grants program to include new project eligibility like community colleges and urban farming. It also authorizes a new Conservation Incentive Contract under EQIP, limited to select priority resource concerns within specific geographic regions, with annual payments to incentivize increased conservation stewardship. The new EQIP incentive contracts, similar to CSP contracts, address priority resource concerns and provide annual payments for adopting, maintaining, and improving practices. However, they differ from CSP by having no stewardship threshold for entry, no comprehensive requirement for addressing resource concerns, no whole-farm enrollment, and no limit on payments. The impact of EQIP incentive contracts on CSP enrollment and general EQIP contracts remains unclear. Amendments under the commodities title of the 2018 farm bill changed how base acres are used to calculate eligibility for certain programs. The 2018 farm bill changed base acre usage for commodity support programs, making acres ineligible if not planted to a program-eligible crop in the last ten years. These acres can now enroll in a Grassland Conservation Initiative under CSP, with separate requirements from other CSP contracts. The grassland initiative does not require whole-farm enrollment and has no stewardship threshold for entry, only needing to meet one priority resource concern by the end of the contract. This differs from CSP contracts, which require meeting stewardship thresholds for multiple concerns. The Grassland Conservation Initiative under CSP offers short-term contracts with no renewal option, allowing participants to terminate without penalty. Payments are not subject to CSP limits but capped at $18 per acre. Easement programs like the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program provide financial assistance for land-use restrictions, including agricultural land easements and wetland reserve easements. The Healthy Forests Reserve Program focuses on forestry conservation efforts. The 2018 farm bill reauthorizes and amends ACEP, focusing on the Agricultural Land Easement (ALE) program. The bill provides additional flexibilities to ACEP-eligible entities, including \"buy-protect-sell\" transactions and amends nonfederal cost share requirements. The 2018 farm bill reauthorizes and amends ACEP, with a focus on the Agricultural Land Easement (ALE) program. Eligible entities can contribute the federal share or 50% of it if private landowner contributions are included. Flexibilities include geographical differences, easement terms, and certification criteria. Amendments reduce USDA's role in ALE administration. WRE amendments mainly focus on compatible use and vegetative cover requirements. The 2018 farm bill expands ACEP to include consultation with the state technical committee, consideration of land management requirements, and improving easement functions. It allows for the establishment or restoration of an alternative vegetative community on the entirety of the WRE if it benefits wildlife or meets local resource needs. Congress specified new directions regarding USDA's handling of ACEP easements. Mandatory funding for ACEP is increased to $450 million annually for FY2019 through FY2023. The 2018 farm bill made amendments to the RCPP program, shifting it to a stand-alone program with its own contracts. Prior to this, RCPP utilized 7% of existing conservation programs through projects defined by eligible partners. USDA issued no regulations for RCPP, instead operating it with the regulations of covered programs. Amendments in the 2018 farm bill changed this approach, establishing RCPP with its own contracts. The 2018 farm bill shifted the RCPP program to a stand-alone program with its own contracts, moving away from using existing conservation programs. The bill expanded the list of covered programs to include EQIP, ACEP, CSP, HFRP, CRP, and WFPO. RCPP aims to leverage federal conservation funding for partner-defined projects, providing flexibility to partners in project contributions and reporting requirements. The RCPP program under the 2018 farm bill has seen changes in funding allocation, with mandatory funding increased to $300 million annually. The program no longer receives a percentage of funding from covered programs, impacting its overall scale. Funding is now split 50% for state and multi-state projects and 50% for projects in critical conservation areas. The WFPO program provides technical and financial assistance for erosion prevention and land/water resource conservation, with project costs shared with local partners. Smaller projects can be authorized by the NRCS Chief, while larger projects require approval. The 2018 farm bill made amendments to the WFPO program, including the authorization of permanent mandatory funding of $50 million annually. Provisions require producers to maintain conservation on highly erodible land and not convert wetlands to crop production. These provisions, known as conservation compliance, were originally authorized in the 1985 farm bill. The 2018 farm bill also amended wetland conservation provisions to specify exemptions for affected landowners. The enacted bill authorizes annual discretionary appropriations for wetland mitigation banking and introduces a compliance requirement called Sodsaver for crop production on native sod. Agricultural conservation has been a stand-alone title in all farm bills since 1981, with the conservation title expanding with each passing omnibus farm bill. The conservation title in farm bills has expanded over the years, with the 2018 farm bill focusing on differences between House and Senate versions. It includes targeting funds, shifting funds among conservation programs, and addressing environmental regulations through voluntary measures. The 2014 farm bill aimed to simplify and consolidate programs, while the 2018 bill does not create new programs but requires existing ones to meet specific levels. The 2018 farm bill does not create new programs but requires existing ones to direct funding or acres to specific issues. This may reduce flexibility in funding allocation and limit resources for activities not meeting the specified provisions. Most conservation programs in the bill receive mandatory funding. Conservation programs in the 2018 farm bill receive mandatory funding, making up 7% of the total projected spending. Funding for the conservation title is budget neutral over 10 years but increases in the first five years and decreases in the last five years. While most titles received an increase in funding, the conservation title did not. The 2018 farm bill conservation title receives mandatory funding, making up 7% of total projected spending. While most titles saw an increase in funding, the conservation title did not. Funding is budget neutral over 10 years, with a shift towards working lands programs over land retirement activities. The level of total mandatory program funding for land retirement programs has declined relative to working lands programs. The separation between land retirement and working lands programs has become blurred due to increased compatible use allowances for grazing and pasture use. There is debate over the appropriate mix of land retirement and working lands programs, with some supporters divided over the benefits of shorter-term land retirement programs versus longer-term easement programs. Easement programs impose permanent or longer-term land-use restrictions in exchange for government payments, seen as a more cost-effective investment in sustainable ecosystems. Supporters of easement programs emphasize cost-effective investment in sustainable ecosystems for long-term wildlife and land preservation benefits. Short-term land retirement programs offer increased flexibility and broader participation compared to permanent easement programs. The 2018 farm bill introduced new subprograms under CRP for longer-term contracts (30 years under CLEAR30) and shorter-term contracts (3-5 years under SHIPP). Congress has focused on partnership programs with state and local communities to target conservation funding to local resource concerns, leveraging private and federal funding. The 2014 farm bill replaced partnership programs with RCPP, and the 2018 farm bill made amendments to conservation programs. The 2018 farm bill amended and expanded partnering opportunities under RCPP, CREP, and CIG, replacing some partnership programs. These programs, although relatively small compared to others in the conservation title, focus on voluntary conservation practices to address environmental concerns and reduce the need for traditional regulatory programs. Regulatory certainty is emphasized, allowing for voluntary measures to address specific resource concerns in exchange for assurance against future regulations. The 2018 farm bill also authorizes USDA to provide technical assistance under farm bill conservation programs. The 2018 farm bill authorizes USDA to provide technical assistance for regulatory assurances to producers and landowners under conservation programs. It makes existing regulatory certainty measures permanent, including the Working Lands for Wildlife Initiative. This initiative allows private landowners to receive exemptions from potential future regulatory actions related to at-risk species by making wildlife habitat improvements and maintaining them for 15-30 years. The bill also allows for the initiative to be expanded to include CRP. The 2018 farm bill includes a provision encouraging watershed-level partnerships between nonpoint and point sources to advance the Clean Water Act goals. Tables in the appendix detail Title II programs and funding under the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018. Funding levels are repeated within program tables, organized by section number of the farm bill. The 2018 farm bill organizes funding levels by section number, with relevant amendments for a complete program overview."
