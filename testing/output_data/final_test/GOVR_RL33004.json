    "content": "Under federal law, there are two types of pension plans: defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. In a defined benefit plan, an employee is promised a future annuity based on factors like years of employment and highest salary. The employer contributes to a pension fund to cover benefits, bearing the investment risk. If the plan is terminated, benefits are insured by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Terminated employees receive vested benefits as an annuity. In a defined contribution plan, the employer promises to make a specified contribution to the employee's pension account, typically a percentage of the employee's salary. The employee bears the investment risk, and benefits are not insured by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Hybrid plans combine elements of defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Cash balance plans are a type of hybrid plan that combines elements of defined benefit and defined contribution plans. These plans resemble defined contribution plans as the employee's future benefits are stated as an account balance. The account is hypothetical and represents the benefits accrued through employer contributions and interest credits. The interest rate can be fixed or tied to an index rate, and other factors like age and length of service may also be considered in the benefit formula. The employer contributes to the general pension fund in a cash balance plan. In a cash balance plan, the employer contributes to the pension fund and bears investment risk for promised benefits. Benefits are insured by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation in case of plan termination. Employees can receive vested benefits as a lump-sum payment upon termination. Employers have been converting traditional plans to cash balance plans, which involves amending the plan without termination. Benefits can only be decreased in limited circumstances with approval from the Treasury Secretary. An amendment to a pension plan may not reduce benefits already accrued but can decrease future benefit accruals with notice to participants. Claims of age discrimination in cash balance plans are governed by ERISA, IRC, and ADEA, added by OBRA in 1986. Participants can take legal action under ERISA and ADEA. Cash balance plans or conversions to such plans may violate laws related to benefit accrual based on age, as outlined in ERISA, IRC, and ADEA. The primary claims involve the cessation or reduction of benefit accrual due to age. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 has impacted claims that cash balance plans violate age discrimination laws. The Act applies to periods after June 29, 2005, while pre-Act law is relevant for plans existing before that date. Courts have generally found that cash balance plans do not violate age discrimination laws. The age discrimination provisions in ERISA, the IRC, and the ADEA prohibit an employee's rate of benefit accrual from being decreased on account of age. Employees claiming age discrimination with cash balance plans have been younger than normal retirement age. Some employers argue that these provisions do not apply to them. Some employers argue that age discrimination provisions do not apply to employees in cash balance plans who are younger than normal retirement age. Employees argue that the ADEA applies to those at least 40 years old, regardless of retirement age. Courts have varied in their conclusions on this issue. Another issue is determining an employee's \"rate of benefit accrual\" under a cash balance plan, with claims of discrimination based on the definition of this phrase. The argument revolves around whether age discrimination provisions apply to cash balance plans, specifically regarding the conversion of benefits into an age 65 annuity to test for age discrimination. The rate of benefit accrual decreases as the employee's age increases due to interest credits and compounding interest. The rate of benefit accrual in cash balance plans decreases as the employee's age increases, impacting the amount of the age 65 annuity. Arguments have been made that age discrimination provisions should not require testing with an age 65 annuity, but rather with the rate at which contributions are made to the employee's hypothetical account. This approach would not inherently violate discrimination laws. The rate of benefit accrual in cash balance plans is generally constant or increases with age, potentially violating age discrimination provisions. In the case of Cooper v. IBM Pers. Pension Plan, a court ruled that IBM's cash balance plan violated ERISA regulations. The court determined that an age 65 annuity should be used to express benefits in cash balance plans, similar to defined benefit plans. The court found that the use of an age 65 annuity to determine benefit accrual in cash balance plans violated ERISA regulations due to the interest credit component, making benefits greater for younger employees. The ruling suggested that cash balance plans were inherently discriminatory. The Seventh Circuit reversed a ruling that cash balance plans were discriminatory, stating that younger employees accruing more interest did not equate to age discrimination. The court clarified that \"benefit accrual\" and \"accrued benefit\" were not the same, with the former referring to employer contributions and the latter to monetary gain. IBM's plan was defended by comparing age discrimination provisions for different types of retirement plans. The court upheld IBM's cash balance plan, stating that the continued crediting of interest was not discriminatory under the age discrimination provision for defined contribution plans. The court also rejected claims of age discrimination based on more favorable benefits under the prior plan, emphasizing that as long as vested interests were not reduced, IBM was within its rights to make such decisions. The plaintiffs' petition for Supreme Court review was denied in January 2007. Courts have generally found that \"rate of benefit accrual\" in retirement plans is based on employer contributions, not age discrimination. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that cash balance defined benefit plans do not inherently violate age discrimination laws. Cash balance defined benefit plans do not violate age-based reductions in benefit accrual under ERISA. The Hirt decision may signal the end of age discrimination claims. Courts also analyze if conversions to cash balance plans breach ADEA through disparate treatment and impact theories, focusing on adverse effects on older workers. The difficulty of proving intentional discrimination in cash balance plan conversions can lead to disparate impact claims. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 may limit future claims, but some argue that opportunities still exist. Courts have ruled that plaintiffs cannot recover under ADEA if their ERISA claims fail. Proponents argue that knowingly treating older workers less favorably in a cash balance plan is evidence of discrimination, while opponents disagree, stating it does not prove individualized discrimination. Proponents of discrimination claims in cash balance plan conversions argue that it disproportionately affects older workers, who lose expected benefits without gaining new ones. Older employees may be disadvantaged due to the traditional plan's weighted formula favoring longer-serving employees. Older employees may lose out on benefits in cash balance plans due to the constant accrual rate, preventing increased accrual in later years. Wear-away, a concern for discrimination claims, disproportionately affects older workers when the value of accrued benefits under the traditional plan exceeds the starting balance in the cash balance plan conversion. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 aims to eliminate wear-away in cash balance plans for older employees with high starting balances. However, the provision only applies to plan conversions after June 29, 2005, leaving plans converted before this date subject to wear-away claims. Opponents have argued that plaintiffs failed to exhaust administrative remedies by not filing a timely complaint with the EEOC. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act may allow these cases to proceed, addressing time limits for filing discrimination charges. The Act triggers filing periods each time discriminatory compensation is paid. In the Tomlinson v. El Paso cash balance plan case, the court had... In the Tomlinson v. El Paso case, the plaintiff filed a motion to reconsider the time-barred ADEA claim in light of the Ledbetter legislation. Opponents argue that disparate impact claims cannot be brought under the ADEA, citing previous cases where federal circuits did not recognize such claims. The Supreme Court allowed disparate impact claims under the ADEA in Smith v. City of Jackson, clarifying that age discrimination claims can be brought under a disparate impact theory. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 clarified the legality of cash balance plans under certain requirements. The Act amends ERISA, the IRC, and the ADEA to provide standards for non-discriminatory cash balance plans. The IRS has issued proposed regulations for implementing these standards. The Act ensures that a plan is not age discriminatory if a participant's accrued benefit is equal to that of a younger individual who is similarly situated in all aspects except age. Benefits can be in the form of an annuity. The Act introduces new rules for applicable defined benefit plans, including cash balance plans, to prevent age discrimination. A cash balance plan must meet an interest credit requirement to comply with ERISA, the IRC, and the ADEA. The plan must provide interest credits at a rate not exceeding the market rate of return and not less than zero. Treasury guidance is expected for calculating the market rate. The Act introduces new requirements for plan conversions, specifying that a converted defined benefit plan must satisfy age discrimination provisions by providing participants with the sum of pre-conversion and post-conversion accrued benefits. Additionally, the plan must credit participants with any early retirement benefits or subsidies earned under the prior plan. Certain circumstances are exempt from violating age discrimination provisions under the Act. The Act introduces new requirements for plan conversions to ensure compliance with age discrimination provisions. Plans must allow for offsets of benefits, disparities in contributions or benefits, and pre-retirement indexing of accrued benefits. These provisions aim to protect employees' benefits from devaluation due to inflation. Effective for periods beginning on or after June 29, 2005, the new provisions regarding cash balance plans are in place. The Act introduces new requirements for plan conversions to ensure compliance with age discrimination provisions, effective for periods beginning on or after June 29, 2005. The provision relating to plan conversions applies to conversions adopted on or after June 29, 2005. The Act clarifies that cash balance plans were not age discriminatory prior to its effective dates, leaving the issue for periods not covered by the Act to be evaluated by the courts."
