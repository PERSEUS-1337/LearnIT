    "content": "The \"Interstate Slamming Prevention Act of 1997\" enhances protections against slamming. The \"Interstate Slamming Prevention Act of 1997\" enhances protections against slamming by amending subsection (b) of section 258 of the Communications Act of 1934 to address liability for additional charges collected after violation and fees for changing back to the previously selected carrier. The \"Interstate Slamming Prevention Act of 1997\" amends section 258 of the Communications Act of 1934 to provide additional penalties and protections for telecommunications carriers that violate verification procedures. Additional fines, penalties, and forfeiture penalties may be imposed by the Commission for violations. Subscribers are granted additional protections against unauthorized changes in providers of telephone services. The Federal Communications Commission may prescribe requirements for telecommunications carriers to establish toll-free complaint numbers and provide complaint information to the Commission regarding changes in service. The deadline for these regulations is April 30, 1998, and reports to Congress are required. The Federal Communications Commission must establish toll-free complaint numbers for telecommunications carriers by April 30, 1998. A report to Congress is required by October 31, 1998, detailing unauthorized changes in subscribers' service providers, including a list of carriers with the highest number of complaints. The telecommunications carriers may be fined under the Communications Act of 1934. Subscribers could potentially take legal action against carriers for unauthorized changes in service providers. The Commission will assess the need for minimum statutory penalties for violations under the Communications Act of 1934 and evaluate if current fines are enough to deter carriers from unauthorized changes in service providers. The Commission will provide Congress with annual updates on specified information for the preceding year."
