    "content": "Counterfeiting in North Korea is a secretive criminal activity, making information on its scope limited. Production of counterfeit U.S. currency is likely kept confidential to protect intelligence operations. However, involvement in distributing \"Supernotes\" becomes evident through criminal investigations and arrests. The DPRK government aims to maintain its ruling regime and be recognized as a nuclear power, requiring funds to finance its trade deficit. Legal means include borrowing, foreign investments, aid, and selling services, while illegal methods involve counterfeiting and other illicit activities. The DPRK government aims to finance its trade deficit through legal means like borrowing, foreign investments, aid, and selling services, while illegal methods involve counterfeiting, illegal sales of military equipment or technology, drugs, counterfeit cigarettes, and pharmaceuticals, as well as shipping illegal cargo between third countries. Allegations of counterfeiting by North Korea are part of a pattern of illicit activities linked to Pyongyang, including drug trafficking, counterfeit cigarettes, and pharmaceuticals. Reports suggest that DPRK may tolerate criminal behavior on a larger scale, with links to counterfeit cigarette trafficking and counterfeit $100 U.S. notes. The extent of DPRK authorities' complicity in these illegal activities is unclear, but they are likely aware of them. Supernotes have been seized in various countries, including the United States and South Korea. Recent seizures of supernotes have been reported in various countries, including a large seizure in Pusan, South Korea. The State Department has evidence of North Korean involvement in money laundering, counterfeiting, and other illicit activities through front companies. National Intelligence Director John Negroponte addressed DPRK's production and smuggling of counterfeit U.S. currency in 2006. In 2003, William Bach from the U.S. Department of State mentioned cases of counterfeiting with North Korean connections, including an incident in Macao where North Korean trading company executives were arrested for depositing counterfeit notes in a bank. Counterfeiting of foreign currency is not new to North Korea, with links to Macao banks and North Korean diplomats. South Korean media reports cite North Korea's production of counterfeit U.S. $100 banknotes worth $15 million annually, with evidence of three banknote forging agencies operating in North Korea. Reports also mention the discovery of over $4.6 million in fake dollar bills since 1994. In 2006, a closed briefing by South Korea's National Intelligence Service revealed that North Koreans were arrested for counterfeiting in the 1990s, but no evidence of counterfeit currency production after 1998 was found. South Korean sources confirm that the National Intelligence Service found no evidence of North Korea producing counterfeit currency after 1998. However, South Korean authorities have seized counterfeit U.S. currency, including $100 bills in 2005, without tracing the source. The United States provided examples of DPRK counterfeit notes, determining that $140,000 worth of seized counterfeit notes in 2005 were made in North Korea in 2001. On June 13, 2003, South Korea, the United States, and Japan expressed concern about North Korea's illegal activities, including drug smuggling and counterfeiting. Chinese investigators confirmed DPRK counterfeiting in January 2006. In August 2005, undercover operations in New Jersey and California targeted China's Triad criminal syndicates, seizing $4 million in counterfeit North Korean currency, illicit narcotics, and counterfeit goods. Illicit narcotics, counterfeit brand cigarettes, and pharmaceuticals were seized. Chao Tung Wu, a Taiwanese in custody for dealing in counterfeit bills, mentioned a government producing counterfeit notes, believed to be North Korea. Sean Garland, a member of an Irish Republican Army faction, was arrested for circulating Supernotes in Britain and Eastern Europe. Counterfeit Supernotes were seized in Hong Kong from a Chinese-American man in transit from Macau. In April 2006, a Korean reporter claimed that obtaining fake $100 bills likely manufactured in North Korea was easy in the Chinese town of Dandong. Counterfeit bills fetch about 40% of their face value, while carefully made $100 Supernotes sell for $60 to $70 each. North Koreans call the fake dollars \"kattalio\" and the business of dealing in them \"the kattalio game.\" Pyongyang warned of severe punishment for those involved in illegal activities like fake notes after Banco Delta financial sanctions. Two men were publicly executed for such crimes in March 2006. The circulation of counterfeit notes in North Korea has reportedly decreased since the sanctions. The circulation of counterfeit notes in North Korea has reportedly decreased since the imposition of Banco Delta sanctions. However, there are reports of an increase in counterfeit notes within North Korea. In July 2007, South Korean newspaper reported $100 Supernotes circulating among North Korean merchants at a value of $70 each. Merchants used counterfeit bills due to the lack of large denominations in the DPRK won and rapid inflation. North Korea denies state involvement in counterfeiting activities and resists U.S. pressure on the matter. The state-run Korean Central News Agency reported that Pyongyang opposes illegal acts like counterfeiting and drug trafficking. The DPRK Foreign Ministry stated that there is no evidence of counterfeit notes or money laundering, but they will actively participate in international actions against money laundering. The DPRK claims to have mechanisms in place to combat illegal acts and will punish offenders severely. Some doubt the DPRK's ability to produce counterfeit notes due to lack of technology and resources. Some doubt North Korea's ability to produce high-quality counterfeit bills due to lack of technology and resources. While some suggest the counterfeiting may not be government-sponsored, others argue that North Korea could be an exception to this norm. Defectors have pointed to government sponsorship of counterfeiting, but their testimonies have not been confirmed. The Pyongyang regime is widely believed to engage in various criminal activities for profit, including counterfeiting. The production of high-quality counterfeit bills, known as Supernotes, requires sophisticated equipment that is tightly controlled and restricted for sale to governments. Given North Korea's closed authoritarian regime, it is likely that any counterfeiting activity is government-sponsored or under government control. The counterfeiting of U.S. currency by North Korea is considered an act of economic warfare and a direct attack on the U.S. financial system. Counterfeiting by North Korea is seen as an attack on the U.S. financial system. The extent of counterfeiting could potentially damage the economy, but the amount is relatively small compared to the total U.S. currency supply. The U.S. Federal Reserve estimates that a significant portion of currency is held outside the country. In the United States, most transactions are done electronically or by checks, not cash. 73% of currency in circulation consists of $100 notes, which are counterfeited by North Korea. Counterfeiting can reduce confidence in the dollar, affecting international transactions. This could lead to a surcharge on certain denominations or refusal to accept certain dollar denominations. Americans relying on cash transactions may be impacted if counterfeiting increases, potentially lowering the dollar's exchange value. Counterfeiting by North Korea, though relatively small compared to total U.S. currency, is significant for Pyongyang's funding of travel, foreign purchases, and privileged lifestyles. Generating $15-25 million annually, it violates U.S. law. The Treasury and Federal Reserve are responsible for addressing counterfeiting, with the Federal Reserve ensuring currency integrity and the Treasury issuing and protecting U.S. currency. The Bureau of Engraving and Printing, under the Secretary of the Treasury, is redesigning the $100 note in FY2007. The Secret Service investigates counterfeiting activities and provides training, while the U.S. has pursued law enforcement and political pressures against North Korea's alleged counterfeiting. Criminal prosecutions have targeted individuals involved in distributing counterfeit currency linked to North Korea. The U.S. is seeking extradition for Sean Garland, accused of conspiring with North Korea to produce counterfeit U.S. dollars. The U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on Banco Delta Asia for money laundering activities involving North Korea. On September 20, 2005, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network imposed special measures against Banco Delta Asia for money laundering activities involving counterfeit U.S. currency. This led to a run on accounts at the bank, prompting the government of Macau to take over BDA's operations and halt withdrawals, including shutting down North Korea-related accounts. The crackdown on Banco Delta Asia had significant financial effects on North Korea, with accounts from DPRK banks and trading companies being targeted. Kim Jong-Il was surprised to find secret accounts and non-existent or deceased account holders. The action led to tougher measures by banks in China, Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, and Singapore, impacting North Korean account holders. In Macau, the North Korean trading firm closed as Banco Delta Asia was placed into receivership, depriving DPRK companies of international financial support and hindering legitimate North Korean trade. The crackdown on Banco Delta Asia had significant financial effects on North Korea, with accounts from DPRK banks and trading companies being targeted. DPRK banks and traders are struggling to find other lenders for their overseas business due to severed contacts with North Korea by banks from other nations. North Korea's Li Gun met with Assistant U.S. Treasury Secretary Daniel Glaser to discuss the issue and possible actions to resolve it. In response to the financial sanctions on Banco Delta Asia, a joint U.S.-North Korean task force was formed to address counterfeiting concerns. North Korea was given access to the U.S. banking system and received technical assistance on identifying counterfeit bills. North Korea agreed to return to six-party talks in December 2006 but refused to discuss denuclearization until the financial sanctions were lifted. Pyongyang sent financial experts to meet with U.S. officials to discuss the sanctions. In the first meeting of a working group on U.S. financial sanctions during the six-party talks, the U.S. side suggested resolving the Banco Delta Asia issue by punishing counterfeiters. This was seen as a shift in the U.S. position, linking the issue to the talks. A new agreement on North Korea's nuclear program was reached on February 13, 2007, with a pledge to settle the financial sanctions issue within 30 days. The U.S. aimed to resolve financial sanctions against Banco Delta Asia and frozen North Korean accounts within 30 days. DPRK recovered $25 million through the New York Federal Reserve Bank in June 2007. China, overseeing Banco Delta Asia, faced pressure to ensure clean banking practices. After the Banco Delta Asia action, Chinese banks refrained from transactions with North Korean-related firms. China investigated accusations against Banco Delta Asia, confirming suspicions. Ernst & Young audit found no evidence of money laundering for North Korea. China urged North Korea to address the issue. North Koreans used Chinese banks for transactions, possibly moving accounts to southern China. U.S. Treasury suggested North Korea's involvement in illicit activities. The U.S. Treasury suggested North Korean agencies transferred assets to banks in China, while Austrian banks continued transactions with North Korea. The political/security strategy aims to deter counterfeiting by increasing costs and reducing benefits through initiatives like the Illicit Activities Initiative and diplomatic pressures. The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) is a global effort involving over 60 countries, with formal participation from 11 countries including Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. It aims to prevent the transfer of weapons of mass destruction-related items to or from nation states and non-state actors through intelligence sharing, diplomatic efforts, and law enforcement. South Korea joined the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) after North Korea's second nuclear test, causing tensions with Pyongyang. Policymakers are divided on how to address North Korea's illicit activities, with some advocating for regime change to induce a crisis and overthrow Kim Jong-il. The U.N. resolution in June 2009 includes provisions for searching ships suspected of carrying banned nuclear or missile cargo. The United States and South Korea are taking a firm stance against North Korea's illicit activities, such as counterfeiting, drug trafficking, and missile exports. While some policymakers advocate for regime change to address these issues, others prefer negotiations to bring North Korea into compliance with international standards. Both countries are committed to curbing Pyongyang's illegal activities and have made it clear that such behavior is unacceptable. Seoul has tried to compromise with the US on North Korea's counterfeiting activities, but the bigger question is why the US is focused on this instead of North Korea's nuclear activities. South Korea's President has taken a tougher stance on North Korea compared to the previous administration. The US aims to stop North Korea's illicit behavior. The United States aims to exert financial pressure on Pyongyang independently of other countries to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and achieve denuclearization. Japan also cooperates with the US in addressing North Korea's illicit activities, including counterfeiting, to strengthen policy coordination with the US and the European Union. The Obama Administration's current strategy is to protect US interests and coordinate sanctions towards North Korea with Japan and South Korea. The United States aims to protect its interests and coordinate policy and sanctions towards North Korea with Japan, South Korea, China, and Russia. They are prepared to engage in bilateral talks under the Six-Party Talk umbrella for serious negotiations on denuclearization. The Obama Administration may impose new financial sanctions on North Korea, citing currency counterfeiting as a rationale. Congress plays a role in oversight and holding hearings on U.S. policy towards North Korea. The U.S. has suggested that North Korea join the Asia-Pacific Group on Money Laundering. North Korea experts believe it will not be easy for North Korea to join the Asia-Pacific Group on Money Laundering, a 30-member group aimed at preventing illegal financial activities in the region. The BDA action and UN sanctions have harmed North Korean elites, but policies aiming for economic collapse in North Korea are currently off the table. China provides enough food and fuel to prevent a collapse to avoid dealing with a flood of immigrants and economic issues. The BDA sanctions on North Korea have led to more serious talks with the United States and other countries. Ceasing counterfeiting of U.S. currency is crucial for normalization of relations. The Patriot Act has given the U.S. a powerful tool to disrupt financial activities. The Patriot Act has provided the US with a powerful tool to disrupt financial activities of unsavory regimes. The use of this tool is still under development and requires coordination between various departments. US law enforcement actions against foreign banks have far-reaching consequences for the banking industry. Banks may be asked to cooperate in enforcing laws that could hurt their customers or reduce their earnings. The Patriot Act has given the US a tool to disrupt financial activities of unsavory regimes, leading to law enforcement actions against foreign banks. BDA-type actions raise concerns about US leverage with the banking community and cooperation on international issues. The question arises whether foreign banks will continue to take unpopular measures if the US reverses course due to national security interests or diplomatic reasons."
