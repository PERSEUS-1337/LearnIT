    "content": "Companies access funding from various sources, with capital markets being the largest source for U.S. nonfinancial companies in 2016, representing 65% of all financing. U.S. capital markets are deep and liquid, with companies relying more on them compared to companies in the euro area, Japan, or China. Access to capital allows businesses to grow, innovate, create jobs, and raise society's overall standard of living. The importance of U.S. capital markets lies in their role in funding allocation for growth, job creation, and raising living standards. Recent trends include a decline in public companies, concentration of capital in larger firms, growth of private capital with less regulation, and challenges posed by financial technology. The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 was passed to address these trends and expand capital access for smaller companies. The JOBS Act has introduced new options for expanding capital access, especially for smaller companies. The 115th Congress has considered proposals like S. 488, a capital formation package with 32 titles that have passed the House with bipartisan support. S. 488, also known as JOBS Act 3.0, builds on previous legislation to address concerns and boost capital markets. Seven provisions in S. 488 are discussed in this report. The report discusses seven provisions in S. 488, which were previously introduced as standalone legislation. It provides background and analysis on proposals related to capital formation through public and private offerings, as well as the regulatory environment. The report also explores key policy issues and their connection to legislative discussions, offering a framework for viewing the proposals in aggregate. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is highlighted as the principal regulator of U.S. capital markets. In capital markets, the SEC requires securities offerings to be registered or exempt from registration. Issuers seeking funding are involved in public offerings with no fund limits and detailed disclosure, allowing resale on secondary markets. Private offerings, placements, or unregistered offerings are exempt from SEC registration and mainly available to select investors. Private offerings, also known as private placements or unregistered offerings, are available to sophisticated financial institutions or individual investors. They do not trade on stock exchanges and provide firms with more control over their affairs and lower compliance costs compared to public offerings. Public offerings, on the other hand, include initial public offerings (IPOs) and subsequent public offerings, allowing companies to offer shares to the general public in exchange for cash. The IPO process is a significant turning point for companies \"going public.\" The IPO process is commonly seen as the turning point for companies \"going public.\" Going public allows a company's shares to be owned by the public, providing access to capital, liquidity premium, publicity, and brand awareness. However, there are drawbacks to consider. There are drawbacks to going public, including compliance costs and changes to business operations. Compliance costs can be burdensome for small and medium-sized businesses, while going public can lead to market pressure, reduced control, and increased shareholder activism. Some research suggests that going public can hinder corporate innovation, but there are also examples of innovative public companies. An IPO is when a company offers its shares to the public for the first time, allowing investors to participate in its growth. The process involves selecting underwriters, lawyers, and accountants to prepare for the issuance of securities. It consists of three phases, starting with the pre-filing period where registration statements and disclosure documents are prepared to satisfy SEC requirements. The disclosure documents serve the dual purpose of satisfying SEC registration requirements and communicating with investors. During the waiting period, the company waits for SEC approval of its registration statements, addresses SEC comments, and prepares for roadshow presentations. Roadshows are presentations made to market the upcoming securities offering to investors. The post-effective period begins after the SEC declares the IPO registration effective, allowing actual sales to investors. The JOBS Act established streamlined compliance options for emerging growth companies (EGCs) to go public with reduced regulatory requirements. To qualify as an EGC, an issuer must have annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion. EGCs can take advantage of scaled disclosure and other forms of relief during their IPO process. EGCs' IPOs can benefit from scaled disclosure requirements, exemption from certain reporting obligations, \"test-the-waters\" communications with investors, and a confidential SEC review process. These advantages are available to EGCs due to the JOBS Act, which established streamlined compliance options for companies with annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion. The SEC expanded benefits initially limited to EGCs to all companies as of July 10, 2017. Test-the-waters and confidential review features are valuable for companies in uncertain valuation industries like biotech and pharmaceuticals. The ability to submit confidentially and \"test-the-waters\" with investors provides flexibility to issuers. Most companies now use the confidential review option to incorporate feedback before public disclosure. Companies now use the process to incorporate feedback before public disclosure and announcement, reducing IPO processes from up to seven months to less than 50 days. Private offerings allow companies to raise capital using registration exemptions under the Securities Act, with Regulation D being the most commonly used exemption. Regulation D includes SEC rules 504 and 506, with different offering amounts. Regulation A aids small to medium-sized companies with less disclosure requirements. Regulation A+ exempts offerings up to $50 million annually under specified conditions. Regulation Crowdfunding allows securities offerings through internet crowdfunding. Rule 144 A is for resale transactions to qualified institutional buyers. The SEC oversees U.S. capital markets, regulating various participants like broker-dealers and investment advisors. Rule 147 A allows companies to raise funds within their home state without federal registration. The SEC works alongside state regulators, SROs, and the CFTC in overseeing securities markets. The SEC regulates securities exchanges and SROs like FINRA, MSRB, and PCAOB through a three-pronged approach focusing on disclosure-based rules, antifraud measures, and rules for market participants. The Securities Act of 1933 ensures \"truth in securities\" by providing investors with necessary information for informed decisions. The SEC does not provide investment recommendations. The SEC regulates securities exchanges and SROs through a disclosure-based approach, ensuring investors have necessary information. Registration with the SEC is required for public offerings, including financial statements and company details. Private offerings also involve registration. Private offerings involve a scaled-back registration process limited to sophisticated investors. The SEC's primary concerns are promoting disclosure, fair dealing, and fraud protection to help investors make informed decisions. Securities are not government-guaranteed and can lose value. The SEC requires accurate information but does not guarantee it. Banking regulation focuses on risk control and mitigation to ensure the safety of financial institutions and the overall system. The government examines banks to prevent excessive risks and protect taxpayer money. This approach differs from the SEC's emphasis on disclosure and fraud protection in private offerings for securities. Regulators heavily focus on examination programs to oversee financial institutions' operations and risk mitigation methods. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation allocates half of its budget to examination-based supervision and consumer protection. SEC regulation relies less on examinations, ceding some to SROs like FINRA. Congress debates modifying capital market regulations to ease companies' access to capital markets and promote growth. The section analyzes key policy issues in public and private capital markets, assessing proposals to facilitate access to capital. It also examines emerging fintech issues related to crowdfunding and initial coin offerings, focusing on the relationship between capital formation and investor protection. Expanding capital access promotes democratizing capital markets by allowing greater investment opportunities. The curr_chunk discusses the balance between capital formation and investor protection in capital markets. It highlights the challenges policymakers face in allowing issuers to choose fundraising methods without SEC registration, which can increase costs and deter investment. This balance is crucial for maintaining market integrity and transparency while also ensuring access to investment opportunities for a wider range of investors. The relationship between public and private offerings has become more blurred since the 2012 JOBS Act, creating hybrid offerings that combine features of both. Regulation A+ is an example of a private offering that could potentially trade on public exchanges. Capital access regulation is now more tailored, but the debate on its appropriateness continues. The ongoing debate surrounds the tailored regulation of securities offerings. Key attributes, such as maximum offering amount and filing requirements, play a crucial role in determining the capital access capacity of each offering program. For example, Regulation Crowdfunding has a $1 million size limit per year, while public offerings have no maximum amount but require full disclosure. Higher disclosure levels are associated with larger offering sizes. Higher levels of disclosure lead to larger offering size limits, broader investor access, and reduced resale restrictions. Nonaccredited investor access is limited, with more disclosure allowing for participation by less sophisticated investors. Resale restrictions determine the ability for securities to enter secondary markets, with private offerings like Regulation D facing limitations on resale options. Preemption of state registration or qualification is also a factor in securities regulations. States impose securities regulations concurrent with SEC regulations. Certain offering programs face state registration requirements, which can be challenging and costly for issuers operating in multiple states. Regulations like A-Tier 2, D-Rule 506, and Crowdfunding preempt state laws, creating a tailored system for smaller companies to raise capital. SEC Chairman Clayton emphasized a scaled regulatory approach in securities regulation. Congress and the SEC are working to develop a capital formation ecosystem. The SEC and Congress are working on developing a scaled regulatory approach to capital formation, allowing small companies to raise capital through offerings like Regulation A and EGC. Legislative proposals are being considered to expand this approach further. The number of U.S.-listed domestic public companies has declined by half since the mid-1990s, while listings in other developed countries have increased. In 2017, U.S. IPOs raised $49.3 billion through 189 offerings, more than double the previous year. The number of U.S.-listed domestic public companies has declined by half since the mid-1990s. In 2017, $24.2 billion was raised through 111 offerings, significantly below the pre-1999 average of 547 IPOs per year. The average size of public companies has grown four-fold between 1996 and 2017, with more than half of U.S. market capitalization held by around 140 companies with $50 billion or more in market value. The average size of publicly listed companies has increased, leading to a total market capitalization that remains high. Smaller-company IPOs were down before the JOBS Act, with smaller firms facing challenges in accessing capital. The JOBS Act somewhat improved access to capital for smaller companies through the EGC program, but the total number of IPOs has not significantly increased. The number of IPOs remains below its long-term average despite improvements following the JOBS Act. Debate continues on whether regulatory relief is needed to address the decline, with arguments focusing on structural changes in the economy and high costs of disclosure. Critics suggest that increased regulation may have unintended consequences for companies seeking capital. Critics argue that securities regulations enacted in the past two decades have significantly increased public company compliance requirements, leading to high costs for companies accessing capital. Key regulations include the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (1999), Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002), Global Settlement ruling (2003), Regulation National Market System (2005), and Dodd-Frank Act (2010). Public companies in 2011 faced initial regulatory compliance costs of $2.5 million and ongoing annual costs. The initial regulatory compliance cost for public companies in 2011 was around $2.5 million, with annual ongoing costs of $1.5 million. Some argue that these high costs discourage companies from going public, leading to an increase in private offerings as an alternative. In 2017, U.S. companies raised $2.43 trillion privately, surpassing the $2.06 trillion raised from public markets. This shift is attributed to economies of scope and increased disclosure obligations for public companies. Economies of scope may lead smaller companies to be acquired rather than operate independently due to declining profitability in product markets. Smaller public companies face challenges like low liquidity and limited analyst coverage, hindering the benefits of going public. Market infrastructure supporting smaller IPOs, such as specialized investment banks and analyst coverage, is considered lacking compared to larger companies. This has contributed to increased merger and acquisition activities and the delisting of public companies in recent years. The market infrastructure for smaller public companies is lacking compared to larger IPOs, leading to agency conflicts between owners and managers. Some organizations may rely more on private debt to avoid these conflicts. Financial globalization has increased capital flow globally. Financial globalization has significantly increased as countries remove barriers to capital flows. Recent studies show that while the rest of the world has seen more IPOs due to this, U.S. IPO activity has not benefited similarly. The global capital flow could impact the demand and supply dynamics of U.S. domestic capital markets, affecting IPO-related capital needs. The 115th Congress is considering expanding EGC benefits and other regulatory-relief proposals in response to public offering issues. The bipartisan JOBS Act of 2012 created the IPO On-Ramp for smaller companies to access public offerings. Around 87% of firms filing for an IPO after April 2012 were EGCs, utilizing features like confidential SEC review and reduced disclosure of financials. The 115th Congress is considering expanding EGC benefits and other regulatory-relief proposals to address public offering issues. The majority of IPO firms adopt features like reduced disclosure of financials through EGC status. New proposals in the 115th Congress aim to expand EGC benefits and extend the time EGCs can maintain their status. Proponents argue that the EGC regime promotes capital formation without compromising investor protection, suggesting it as a model for additional regulation. The test-the-waters and confidential-review features of the EGC framework are particularly valuable for companies in uncertain stock valuation industries. The EGC status benefits companies in industries with uncertain stock valuation and regulatory approval timing. Biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have seen significant benefits from EGC status, with many biotech companies going public under this framework. Critics argue that EGC allows for lighter regulatory standards, potentially enabling financially weak companies to conduct IPOs. The JOBS Act enabled financially weak companies to conduct IPOs, leading to concerns about lower quality and underpricing. SEC registration and disclosure are crucial for securities regulation and valuation. Firms benefit from disclosing information to reduce capital costs and attract investors. Current debates about disclosure focus on disclosure costs and information overload. Issuers must provide a significant amount of company information during the SEC registration process, with different levels of filings required for public and private offerings. Some question the efficacy of disclosures, suggesting they may be too exhaustive and counterproductive. Some companies struggle with determining what information to disclose during the registration process. Materiality is a key concept governing the disclosure of information under securities laws, focusing on the importance of the disclosure to a reasonable investor. SEC Rule 405 limits required information to matters that a reasonable investor would find important in deciding to purchase the security. Case law further defines materiality in terms of its significance to investors. The concept of \"materiality\" in courts is defined by whether undisclosed information would significantly alter the total mix of available information for a reasonable investor. Regulators and issuers face challenges in applying consistent standards for materiality, leading to a principle-based approach that allows companies flexibility in providing disclosures they deem important to investors. A principle-based approach allows companies flexibility in determining materiality on a case-by-case basis, similar to how courts assess it. However, the lack of a clear threshold for disclosure can create challenges for investors and companies. Different interpretations of materiality, especially in disclosing cyber breaches, highlight the difficulty in knowing when to disclose. Public offerings have more stringent disclosure requirements compared to private offerings, starting with a detailed registration statement outlining the business, security offered, and management team. The reporting of public company regulatory compliance costs in 2011 estimated average costs of $2.5 million, with ongoing costs of $1.5 million. Disclosure requirements have increased over time, with concerns about the readability of disclosed information. For example, Walmart's IPO prospectus in 1970 was less than 30 pages, compared to today's filings that can be hundreds of pages long. Studies show that the median text length of key SEC filings doubled between 1996 and 2013. The text length of key SEC filings doubled between 1996 and 2013, with decreased readability and a shift towards more detailed disclosures due to increased SEC rules and guidance. This has led to regulatory discussions on \"information overload\" and the challenge of tailoring disclosed information to different types of investors, such as institutional investors who may prefer more detailed reporting. The current disclosure regime does not cater to different investor preferences, leading to debates on the benchmark for disclosure requirements. Legislative proposals and SEC actions aim to ease disclosures, including initiatives on Regulation S-K and completion of studies mandated by Congress. The SEC proposed amendments to Regulation S-K on October 11, 2017, incorporating recommendations from studies to modernize and simplify disclosures for issuers of securities offerings. Regulation S-K is a key part of the integrated disclosure regime, containing nonfinancial statement disclosure requirements under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. The SEC proposed amendments to Regulation S-K to modernize and simplify disclosures for issuers. The proposal includes approximately 30 changes that could impact disclosure document preparation and reduce costs. Congress has also proposed bills to amend disclosure requirements, focusing on exemptions for issuers and expanding eligibility for smaller companies to use simplified registration forms. These proposals aim to enhance readability and usefulness of disclosures. The SEC proposed amendments to Regulation S-K to modernize and simplify disclosures for issuers, aiming to enhance readability and usefulness without excluding material information. Compliance costs for issuers also stem from navigating federal and state-level regulations, with each state having its own securities regulator enforcing \"blue sky\" laws. SEC requires disclosure of information about securities and issuers, while states have their own approach to securities regulation. State securities laws predate federal statutes and allow regulators to police their jurisdictions, creating tension with federal securities laws and state corporate law. Companies must convince states that their offerings are fair to investors. The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 (NSMIA) preempted state registration for public offerings trading on national exchanges like NYSE, AMEX, and Nasdaq. NSMIA was a milestone for \"covered securities,\" exempting them from state blue sky laws' registration and qualification requirements. Covered securities include those listed on certain exchanges, issued by registered investment companies, sold to SEC-defined qualified purchasers, or meeting certain exemptions. The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 (NSMIA) preempted state registration for public offerings trading on national exchanges like NYSE, AMEX, and Nasdaq. Covered securities are exempt from state blue sky laws' registration and qualification requirements, including those listed on certain exchanges, issued by registered investment companies, sold to SEC-defined qualified purchasers, or meeting certain exemptions. Public offerings not meeting covered securities criteria may need to comply with state-level regulations, leading to increased operational complexity and costs. State regulations aim to prevent fraud or manipulation of securities offerings locally and are unlikely to be eliminated due to political reasons. The National Securities Exchange Regulatory Parity Act is a legislative proposal that could impact blue sky laws. The National Securities Exchange Regulatory Parity Act proposes changes to blue sky laws by allowing securities to be listed on any national exchange approved by the SEC, potentially exempting them from state registration. Critics fear this could lead to a race to the bottom as exchanges may lower listing standards to attract business. Private offerings have become more popular than public offerings in recent years for raising capital. Private offerings have outpaced public offerings in recent years as the preferred option for raising capital, with institutional investors contributing to this trend. The term \"unicorn\" is used for privately funded startups valued at $1 billion or more. Private offerings have become the preferred option for smaller companies to raise capital, with concerns persisting about their difficulties accessing funds. The JOBS Act has not effectively revived public capital access for companies with market capitalization under $75 million. The SEC's Advisory Committee on Small and Emerging Companies highlighted the challenge of identifying potential investors for small businesses. This has led to an increased reliance on private offerings as an alternative funding source, potentially reducing the need for companies to go public. Congress has initiated policy changes and legislative proposals in response to these challenges. Congress has proposed policy changes to ease firms' access to private offerings, focusing on expanding investor access, increasing the upper limit for Regulation A+, and creating a new exemption for micro offerings. Policymakers could widen the accredited investor definition, increase the number of nonaccredited investors allowed to participate, and allow broader outreach to eligible investors. Some legislative proposals in the 115th Congress aim to increase investors' access to private offerings, balancing investor protection with capital formation needs. Concerns exist about lack of disclosure in unregistered offerings, exposing investors to higher risk. \"Accredited\" investors are typically allowed to participate in these offerings. According to federal securities regulations, accredited investors are financially sophisticated individuals or institutions who can sustain financial losses and protect themselves from adverse circumstances. The concept aims to identify those who can bear the risk of investing in unregistered securities and protect ordinary investors from excess risk and potential fraud. The SEC defines an accredited investor based on income and net worth criteria. An accredited investor is defined as someone with a net worth over $1 million or an annual income of over $200,000. This status allows them to access investment opportunities not available to non-accredited investors, such as private company investments and hedge funds. The criteria for accreditation has been criticized for equating higher net worth with investing sophistication. The definition of an accredited investor equates higher net worth with investing sophistication, raising concerns about eligibility for higher-risk investing. While numeric thresholds provide clear criteria, some argue that financial sophistication cannot be accurately measured solely based on income or wealth. This has led to objections to the current accredited investor definition. The SEC Threshold Rule restricts nonaccredited investors in private securities offerings based on registration thresholds. The JOBS Act raised the shareholder registration threshold to 2,000 persons or 500 nonaccredited investors to prevent companies from going public due to shareholder numbers. The JOBS Act raised the shareholder registration threshold to 2,000 persons or 500 nonaccredited investors to prevent companies from going public due to shareholder numbers. Issuers market private offerings at promotional events sponsored by angel investors, venture capital associations, nonprofits, or universities to attract investor financing. The JOBS Act created a new private offering category under Regulation D, allowing issuers to engage in general solicitations to accredited investors while verifying their accredited status. Some market participants advocate for further removal of general solicitation restrictions to reduce compliance costs and uncertainty. Critics raise concerns about investor protection, especially regarding nonaccredited investors participating in events for accredited investors. Another proposal is to expand Regulation A+ to facilitate capital formation for small to medium-sized companies through private offerings with certain limits on investor access. Regulation A+ was implemented in 2015 to expand offerings for small to medium-sized companies, with two tiers allowing for securities offerings up to $20 million and $50 million in a 12-month period. Tier 1 is subject to state and federal registration requirements, while Tier 2 allows for larger offerings. Regulation A+ allows for securities offerings up to $20 million and $50 million in a 12-month period, with Tier 2 exempt from state securities law registration. Despite its potential, some believe it has fallen short due to low capital raised and rare public trading. Only eight mini-IPOs were listed in 2017, with seven trading below their offer prices. In 2017, mini-IPOs faced challenges with seven out of eight trading below offer prices. These companies had lower stock availability for trading compared to traditional IPOs, making them more volatile. The financial industry heavily used Regulation A+, with proposals in Congress to expand its limits and issuer base. Some believe expanding Regulation A+ could alleviate size-related concerns for market intermediaries and enhance capital formation. However, others argue it may reduce incentives for companies to go public, potentially undermining investor protection and market liquidity. Concerns have been raised about the immediate expansion of Regulation A+ as the regime is still in its early stages. In 2015, the upper limit for Regulation A+ was increased to $50 million from $5 million, leading to questions about the optimal timing for program extension. Demand for seed and startup capital for U.S. small businesses is high, but some companies may be too small to issue private offerings under existing exemptions. Startup capital and access to capital are significant constraints for many startups. The Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act proposes a new private offering exempting certain micro funding from federal registration and state laws. It aims to help small businesses raise capital from family and friends without legal issues. Opponents of the micro offering legislation raise concerns about investor protection due to reduced disclosures and the absence of provisions to disqualify individuals with criminal records. One point of contention is the lack of resale restrictions for micro offerings, which could lead to potential securities fraud schemes. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that only a small number of securities transactions would be affected by the expanded exemption. The development of financial technology (\"fintech\") has disrupted industries and led to new capital access options not overseen by the SEC regulatory regime. Policymakers are considering whether these innovations fit within the existing regulatory framework or if adjustments are needed. This impacts not only the SEC but also other financial regulators in the US and globally. Crowdfunding and initial coin offerings (ICOs) are popular fintech tools regulated by the SEC if classified as securities. Crowdfunding involves raising money through small individual investments from many people. Crowdfunding involves small investments from many people, with four types: donation, reward, peer-to-peer lending, and equity crowdfunding. Equity crowdfunding and some peer-to-peer lending may be regulated by the SEC as securities. Title III of the JOBS Act allows for internet-based securities offerings up to $1 million over 12 months to assist small businesses. Title III of the JOBS Act allows small and startup businesses to conduct low-dollar capital fundraising from a retail investor base over the internet. The crowdfunding final rule, effective since May 16, 2016, enables direct connection between investors and entrepreneurs, providing new investment opportunities and access to seed capital. Securities-based crowdfunding typically involves small, young, prerevenue, and non-profitable issuers. Crowdfunding for small, young, prerevenue, and non-profitable businesses has shown potential for facilitating growth. A study revealed that 70% of reward-based crowdfunding projects led to startup creation. Securities-based crowdfunding, while still relatively small compared to global crowdfunding, saw 163 offerings seeking $18 million in target amounts. However, only around $10 million was raised for 33 offerings in the same period, possibly due to underreporting. The SEC monitors crowdfunding volume through issuer filings. The SEC tracks crowdfunding volume through issuer filings, but not all issuers file. Securities-based crowdfunding is a small part of the global crowdfunding total. Non-securities-based crowdfunding campaigns may not involve profit-seeking businesses. Peer-to-peer lending may fall under banking regulators' oversight. Crowdfunding expands capital access and utilizes the \"wisdom of the crowd\" concept. Crowdfunding democratizes funding access, allows crowd quality assessment, and is relatively fraud-free. It demonstrates real-world demand for products/services and may reduce disclosure needs. Regulation Crowdfunding specifies financial statements. Some caution is raised about the balance between capital access and investor protection in equity crowdfunding. Concerns include high risk, low liquidity, compliance issues, and offering bad terms to investors. Regulatory concerns also exist regarding fraud, disclosure, transparency, and lack of secondary market liquidity. The Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) securities were developed in 2013 by Y Combinator for investing in startups expecting institutional capital later. SAFE investors receive deferred equity for future shares, making it the second-most-popular crowdfunding offering type. Startups favor SAFE for its simplicity and terms, but concerns exist about its risk to retail investors. The SEC issued an investor bulletin in May 2017 to explain SAFE to retail investors, emphasizing investor protection. Funding portals, established by the JOBS Act, allow internet-based platforms to facilitate securities-based crowdfunding without SEC registration. As of February 20, 2018, there were 38 registered funding portals. Funding portals, created by the JOBS Act, enable online platforms for securities-based crowdfunding without SEC registration. Concerns arise over investor protection as some portals have been expelled by FINRA, casting doubt on their reliability. Legislative proposals aim to ease crowdfunding restrictions for issuers and portals, promoting access to capital for small businesses. Critics argue that these proposals could deregulate riskier startups, potentially reducing investor protections. State securities regulators also express concerns about the impact on investor access and disclosures. Initial coin offerings (ICOs) are a new way of raising capital through crowdfunding on blockchain technology. Unlike traditional crowdfunding, ICOs offer digital coins to supporters instead of products or ownership stakes. These coins can be redeemed for goods or services, or held as investments in the company's success. State securities regulators are still assessing the need for changes to improve crowdfunding laws. ICOs involve exchanging cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies for tokens issued by companies. They offer verifiable transactions, lower costs, and the ability to transfer without intermediaries. Some ICOs are considered securities and are subject to regulation based on promised returns. In the US, securities ICOs must register with the SEC or obtain an exemption. Many ICOs do not conform with traditional restrictions on private offerings, allowing wide access to investors and trading in secondary markets. ICOs could comply with securities laws by registering or seeking exemptions, such as through Regulation Crowdfunding. Only one ICO has filed for registration as of March 6, 2018. The SEC has increased enforcement efforts on ICOs, with only one filing for registration. Promoters are not following securities laws, leading to warnings to retail investors. State securities regulators have also issued alerts, with the SEC halting ICOs and issuing subpoenas. Enforcement efforts have focused on ICOs involving SAFTs, offering investors tokens at a future date. The SEC has concerns about ICOs funding nonexistent businesses and intervened to prevent public companies from capitalizing on ICO hype with name changes. Examples include Eastman Kodak's stock price doubling after announcing KodakCoin and Long Island Iced Tea's stock spiking after changing its name to Long Blockchain. The SEC intervened in companies changing their names to capitalize on blockchain hype, leading to some companies removing \"blockchain\" from their names. Long Blockchain faced delisting from Nasdaq due to misleading statements. ICO regulatory actions vary globally, with warnings in the US and Europe, bans in China and South Korea, and support in Switzerland. ICO funding surged in 2017, reaching $19.4 billion by June 2018 from $0.2 billion in mid-2016. The ICO method, initially for startups, may impact capital formation for large companies. Crypto assets from ICOs are a new asset class, defined by the IMF as digital currencies using encryption techniques. This new asset class has gained attention for its rapid growth, maturing practices, and regulatory recognition. The FSB issued a report in July 2018 to establish metrics for monitoring crypto-assets. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) issued a report in July 2018 to monitor the crypto-asset market risk, market capitalization, and institutional exposures. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton raised concerns about the regulation of cryptocurrency markets. The SEC has not yet established ICO-specific rules or exemptions, leading to fragmented regulation at federal and state levels. The SEC, CFTC, IRS, state regulators, and FinCEN have varying regulations on ICOs and virtual currencies. SEC Chairman Clayton stated that most ICOs are securities offerings, but as of February 2018, none were registered. This lack of registration suggests many issuers may be violating securities laws, posing challenges for both issuers and investors in understanding and navigating the regulatory landscape. Investor protection concerns arise in ICOs due to scams, business failures, lack of compliance with securities laws, and high volatility in cryptocurrency valuations. Retail investors face challenges in understanding risks without proper disclosure. Cryptocurrency trading platforms face challenges with inefficient money-transmission services and lack of protection against fraud and theft. Blockchain transactions are irreversible and can be transferred to anonymous criminal accounts, leading to new waves of theft involving cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency trading platforms are facing regulatory scrutiny due to inefficiencies in trading activities across state lines. The SEC has raised concerns about investor protection on online platforms for trading digital assets, leading to increased federal regulation for crypto exchanges. Cybersecurity risks, such as hacker attacks, pose a threat to investors' funds and personal information. Additionally, scalability issues in current blockchain networks limit their capacity for transactions. Blockchain networks face scalability issues, as evidenced by the congestion caused by CryptoKitties on Ethereum in November 2017. Discussions on blockchain design have arisen due to the need for every transaction to be processed by all network nodes, limiting concurrent transactions. New solutions from Oasis Labs and Block.one have attracted significant investments, but their scalability remains unproven."
