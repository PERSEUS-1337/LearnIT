The Soil and Water Resources Conservation Act of 1977 is amended to extend deadlines and update programs until December 31, 2022 and 2023. Sections are renumbered and new sections are added. The Soil and Water Resources Conservation Act of 1977 is amended to extend deadlines and update programs until December 31, 2022 and 2023. Section 8 introduces a Conservation Programs Assessment. The Secretary may conduct a conservation effects assessment project to quantify the environmental and economic impacts of conservation practices, improve conservation efficacy, and develop a science base for managing the agricultural landscape. The project can be carried out at national, regional, and watershed scales, encompassing various types of lands. Activities may include research, literature reviews, modeling, and assessments. The Secretary may conduct a conservation effects assessment project to quantify environmental and economic impacts of conservation practices, improve efficacy, and develop a science base for managing the agricultural landscape. This includes research, literature reviews, modeling, assessment, monitoring, data collection, outreach, extension education, and other determined activities. \"Goals and assessment process for conservation programs are outlined in Section 9.\" The Secretary will identify natural resource and environmental objectives, periodically revise them, and assess outcomes for conservation programs under the Food Security Act of 1985. The Secretary will establish a monitoring and evaluation process to assess progress and gather information for improving conservation program implementation. The Secretary will allocate one percent of annual funding from the Commodity Credit Corporation for new enrollments in conservation programs to establish a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation process. This process will assess progress towards natural resource and environmental objectives, as well as the impact of individual and collective programs and initiatives. The Secretary will establish a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation process to assess progress towards natural resource and environmental objectives, as well as the impact of conservation programs. This process will include quality criteria, conservation practices, a schedule for implementation, and coordination with other conservation programs. The monitoring and evaluation process will include detailed information on monitoring frequency and data aggregation at various levels. It will consider the cumulative nature of conservation, interactions between activities, differing times for effects to be realized, and measurement challenges. The Secretary will provide conservation activity and program data to cooperators and researchers for public research and evaluation to improve conservation outcomes, with assurances of public availability and protection of personally identifiable information. The National Technical Committee may approve research that aligns with the section's purpose. The Secretary can use cooperative agreements with various entities for the monitoring evaluation process. The process is overseen by the Natural Resources Conservation Service with support from a national committee. The National Technical Committee, appointed by the Secretary, includes individuals with relevant technical and scientific expertise from various agencies such as the Agricultural Research Service, Economic Research Service, Farm Service Agency, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Forest Service, National Institute for Food and Agriculture, and United States Geological Survey. The National Technical Committee, appointed by the Secretary, includes individuals with relevant technical and scientific expertise from various agencies such as the United States Geological Survey, Environmental Protection Agency, State and tribal agencies, land grant university natural resource research programs, and nongovernmental organizations with expertise in conservation issues. The committee is exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Secretary ensures transparency of the national technical committee proceedings and recommendations to the public. On-farm monitoring activities are voluntary for producers with potential compensation. The Secretary is required to report on objectives and methods to Congress periodically. The report includes quantitative, measurable, and time-bound conservation outcome objectives for programs under the Food Security Act of 1985. It also describes the methods used to measure outcomes and cost-effectiveness, as well as providing guidance to conservation project partners. The Secretary will report on the progress towards achieving conservation program objectives and outcomes, including cost-effectiveness evaluation, for programs under the Food Security Act of 1985. The Secretary will evaluate the cost-effectiveness of conservation programs and initiatives, make recommendations for program improvement, and coordinate reports with the conservation effects assessment project authorized by section 8."
