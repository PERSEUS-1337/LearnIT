    "content": "I'm sorry, but you have not provided any text for me to summarize. Please provide the text that needs to be condensed. Chapter 13 of title 31, United States Code, is amended by inserting a new section for continuing appropriations if regular appropriation bills or resolutions are not passed before the fiscal year begins. This allows for funding to continue projects or activities from the previous fiscal year if necessary. Appropriations and funds for projects or activities in a fiscal year under this section shall not exceed the rate of operations from the previous fiscal year's regular appropriation Act or continuing resolution. The funds are available from the beginning of the fiscal year until the earlier of the date of the regular appropriation Act or resolution. Appropriations or funds for projects in a fiscal year under this section are subject to conditions from the previous fiscal year and cover all expenses incurred during the applicable period. Expenditures for projects or activities in a fiscal year under this section must be charged to the appropriate appropriation when a regular appropriation bill becomes law. No appropriation is made if there is no authorization of appropriations for the project. This section does not apply if another law provides funding or authority for the project. The term 'regular appropriation bill' refers to bills making appropriations for various categories of projects and activities, including agriculture, rural development, commerce, justice, defense, and state departments. The Department of Defense, government of the District of Columbia, Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, Housing and Urban Development, Energy and water development, Foreign assistance, Department of the Interior, Military construction, Department of Transportation are included in regular appropriation bills. The term 'continuing resolution' refers to a joint resolution for ongoing appropriations for a fiscal year, covering various government departments and agencies. The analysis of chapter 13 of title 31, United States Code, is amended to include a new item for continuing appropriations. These amendments will apply to fiscal years starting after September 30, 1995."
