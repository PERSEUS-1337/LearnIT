    "content": "The Act titled the \"Rural Students College, Career, and Community Readiness Act of 2007\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 provides findings related to the Act. Congress finds that roughly 1 in 4 public schools in rural America account for 14.5% of total public school enrollment. Rural students have lower educational aspirations compared to urban and suburban peers, with fewer residents obtaining a 4-year degree. Half of rural secondary school students live in counties without 4-year institutions of higher education. There is a lack of research on effective rural education strategies, despite the importance of rural schools in economic development and community growth. Effective rural policy emphasizes developing human capital through education, including promoting higher education from childhood to adolescence and exposing youth to career opportunities. The purpose of effective rural policy is to develop human capital through education and expose youth to career opportunities. The Act aims to enhance educational and career outcomes for rural, low-income students in grades 7-12 by improving academic motivation, performance, graduation rates, college-preparatory coursework participation, college entrance exam participation, application to higher education, enrollment, and program completion. The Act aims to prepare rural students to become leaders, complement workforce development efforts, and increase the number of skilled individuals in rural communities to enhance local economies.
