    "content": "The Act titled \"International and Foreign Language Studies Act of 2004\" is cited as the short title. Congress finds that the increasing foreign language needs in the Federal Government are due to security threats, new nation states, and globalization. American businesses also require employees with international experience. Currently, 34,000 Federal employees need foreign language skills. Translator and interpreter shortages have impacted agency operations and the military. In 2002, the United States Army reported serious shortages of translators in critical languages like Arabic, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, Persian-Farsi, and Russian. The number of Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowships awarded in 2003 was 30 percent lower than in 1967. In the 2000-2001 school year, foreign language degrees conferred were only 1 percent of total undergraduate degrees, less than .05 percent of total masters degrees, and 1 percent of total doctoral degrees. In the 2003 National Survey of Student Engagement, only 2/5 of undergraduates took foreign language coursework, while 1 in 5 studied abroad. Only 1 percent of US undergraduates studied abroad in 2001-2002. 79 percent of Americans in 2002 agreed students should have a study-abroad experience in college. Over 40 percent of Americans were more likely to support increased State funding for foreign language education post-9/11. SEC. 3. REFERENCES.
