    "content": "China, like other developing countries, initially relied on foreign technology for economic development. Despite importing equipment and plants from the West between 1972 and 1978, attempts at developing indigenous technology through reverse engineering had limited success. Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms in the late 1970s led to a shift in attitudes towards foreign capital, with foreign investment initially restricted to four Special Economic Zones. During the second stage of economic reforms in China (1984-91), Hainan Island and fourteen coastal cities were opened to foreign capital. The government eliminated time restrictions on joint ventures, provided assurances against nationalization, and granted preferential tax treatment for foreign-owned businesses. China revised its laws on foreign-owned enterprises and joint ventures in 2000 and 2001, easing export performance and domestic content requirements. China revised its laws on foreign-owned enterprises and joint ventures in 2000 and 2001 to attract foreign investment. The government eased export performance and domestic content requirements, ensured transparency in the legal framework, and provided financial incentives such as tax reductions and exemptions. Priority areas for foreign investors include agriculture, resource development, infrastructure, and high technology industries. However, corruption and bureaucratic hurdles still hinder foreign investment. China's market attracts foreign investment with its large population, rising incomes, and developed social infrastructure. Despite widespread corruption and bureaucratic hurdles, the government is imposing harsh punishments on corrupt officials. Labor is abundant, wages are low, and discipline problems are rare in the eastern and coastal regions, making it favorable for foreign investors. In 2002, China surpassed the United States as the most attractive destination for foreign investment, with investors showing a more positive outlook towards the Chinese market. The surge in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into China coincided with a global trend of increased outflow of foreign capital in the late 1990s. The global economy saw a significant increase in foreign investment from $225 billion in 1990-95 to $1,492 billion in 2000. This growth was driven by factors related to globalization, including governments liberalizing capital flows, privatization of government-owned enterprises, cost reductions in production and technology, and increased competition leading to market expansion and production cost reduction. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in China saw a significant increase in the 1990s, rising to $52.7 billion in 2002. Despite global recessionary conditions, FDI inflows continued to grow, accounting for 6% of the world total in 2001. Chinese statistics on FDI differ from other nations, with most investment coming from \"Greater China\" or the three major. In 2001, FDI into China mainly came from \"Greater China\" and major industrialized markets like the United States, Japan, and the European Union. Hong Kong was the top source, providing $16.7 billion or 36% of China's total FDI. Taiwan and Macao also contributed, with some investments flowing through Hong Kong or offshore tax havens. Singapore provided 4.6% of the FDI. Overall, nearly 47% of FDI inflows into China originated from the Greater China region. In 2001, FDI into China came from major investors like the United States, Japan, and the EU. Offshore tax havens accounted for 15% of total FDI flows, originating from countries like the US, EU, Japan, Taiwan, and the PRC. Joint ventures were the main entry vehicles for foreign capital in China. Foreign Direct Investment in China involved foreign partners providing capital, while domestic partners contributed land, buildings, and assets. Joint ventures were the primary investment vehicle, with 80% of FDI inflows going into joint ventures. Wholly foreign-owned enterprises accounted for only 10% of FDI inflows. In the 1990s, joint ventures in China declined in importance, accounting for less than 10% of FDI inflows in 2002. Joint equity enterprises peaked in 1991 at around half of total inflows but dropped to 28% by 2002. Chinese partners initially provided expertise in land, labor, and political connections, but foreign partners' management skills became more crucial over time. More foreign companies now prefer wholly-owned enterprises for complete control. Chinese authorities have become more confident in allowing foreign enterprises to operate without a native partner, with the share of wholly-owned enterprises in FDI rising to 60% by 2002. The largest share of FDI inflows into China has been invested in manufacturing, taking advantage of the rapidly growing domestic market and resources for export. In 2001, foreign direct investment in China shifted towards industries like pharmaceuticals, electrical machinery, transport equipment, and telecommunications, with less going into traditional sectors like textiles. Real estate, electricity, water, and social services also saw significant FDI inflows. Foreign direct investment in China in 2001 was mainly concentrated in the coastal regions in the east, with 88% invested in the eastern region, 9% in the Central region, and 3% in the Western region. Initially, foreign capital was allowed mainly in the Special Economic Zones in Guangdong and Fujian provinces. Guangdong province absorbed almost half of the FDI in China during the 1980s and remained a significant recipient in the 1990s. Foreign direct investment in China's regional development was initially directed towards the east coastal areas, with economic forces also influencing the flow of FDI. The eastern coastal regions, such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, have the largest populations, rapid growth rates, well-developed infrastructure, and access to major ports. Many overseas Chinese have connections to these regions, with a significant portion of FDI coming from them. Proximity to Hong Kong played a role in attracting FDI to Guangdong province. The economic reform in China led to a rise in wage levels, rents, and overhead costs in Hong Kong, prompting industries to relocate to Guangdong province. Hong Kong historically provided technology, capital, and management skills to Guangdong. In preparation for Hong Kong's reversion to China in 1997, Beijing opened its territory to foreign investment to reduce the economic gap between Guangdong and Hong Kong. The economic boom in eastern coastal regions of China has created disparities in income and living standards, leading to migration from other parts of the country. State-owned enterprises in non-coastal regions are struggling to compete with more efficient plants, causing labor unrest. This situation is particularly concerning for Beijing due to the presence of ethnic minorities in these regions. The economic boom in eastern coastal regions of China has led to income disparities and migration. State-owned enterprises in non-coastal regions are facing labor unrest due to competition with more efficient plants. Beijing's policy now prioritizes attracting foreign investment to lagging middle and western Chinese regions, offering incentives such as tax cuts and infrastructure funding. U.S. multinational corporations are investing in affiliated companies in China, but there is a discrepancy between U.S. and Chinese data on direct investment. Since 1990, U.S. direct investment in China totaled $33.97 billion, with discrepancies in reporting criteria and data collection methods between the two countries. U.S. FDI in China has been increasing, with discrepancies in data collection methods between the two countries. According to Chinese figures, American FDI into China was $456 million in 1990, reaching $4.7 billion in 2001. U.S. figures show an increase from a few hundred million per year in the early 1990s to nearly $2 billion in 2000. The United States is the second largest source of FDI for China, accounting for about 10.5% of China's total inflows during 1999-2001. In 2001, U.S. FDI in China and Hong Kong combined accounted for only 3% of total U.S. FDI abroad. Most U.S. FDI goes to developed economies in Europe, Japan, and Canada. The total assets of nonbank foreign affiliates of U.S. companies in China were $32.12 billion in 2000, up from $18.59 billion in 1997. The U.S. affiliated companies in China reported 252,400 employees earning an average of US$6,846 per year, producing $3.94 billion in gross product. This accounted for 0.4% of China's nominal GDP. U.S. firms in China include many large multinational corporations, with 1,466 companies operating in 2002. In 2002, American companies established affiliates in China for various reasons, with the highest percentage aiming to establish a presence in China, increase exports, and benefit from low labor costs. The headquarters of parent companies investing directly in China were concentrated in the West Coast, industrialized mid-West, Mid-Atlantic, and Texas. The majority of U.S. companies were headquartered in California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Texas, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Ohio, and Connecticut. The U.S. corporations interviewed for the GAO Survey expressed mild optimism about China's WTO commitments but had concerns about the consistent application of laws, protection of intellectual property rights, enforcement of contracts, independence of judicial bodies, and equal treatment between Chinese and foreign entities. Other concerns included transparency of laws and interactions between government and business, including subsidies to Chinese firms. The U.S. corporations interviewed for the GAO Survey expressed optimism about China's WTO commitments but had concerns about the consistent application of laws, protection of intellectual property rights, and interactions between government and business. Local officials in China are more focused on protecting local businesses and jobs, often evading or circumventing laws, especially in intellectual property rights enforcement. According to U.S. data, a significant portion of U.S. foreign direct investment in China is in manufacturing, particularly in the electronic and electrical equipment sector. This is due to the large domestic market and low-cost labor. U.S. retailers, like Wal-Mart, are also expanding into China to cater to the growing consumer market. Wal-Mart has 20 joint-venture stores in China, including supermarket centers and Sam's Club warehouse sales operations. Critics argue that foreign investment in China may lead to a greater U.S. trade deficit. U.S. companies in China primarily sell their output in China, with only a small percentage exported back to the United States. In 2001, the U.S. trade deficit with China reached $83 billion, contributing to 20% of the overall U.S. trade deficit. The largest sectoral deficits were in electrical machinery, toys, sports equipment, footwear, machinery, and furniture/bedding, totaling $55.3 billion or 66% of the total deficit with China for that year. The U.S. trade deficit with China in 2001 totaled $55.3 billion, accounting for 66% of the total deficit. The deficits in electrical machinery and machinery sectors saw significant growth, shifting from surpluses to deficits. Foreign affiliated firms play a significant role in high-technology exports from China. The rising U.S. trade deficit with China is not directly caused by U.S. majority owned firms in China, as they maintain a rough balance in two-way trade. Much of the increase in Chinese exports to the U.S. comes from foreign affiliates and Chinese-owned companies. U.S. investment in China can lead to displacement of potential U.S. exports to China, as affiliates manufacture and sell U.S. brand name products traditionally made at home. Additionally, some of the U.S. trade deficit with China is being shifted from other economies in Asia. The U.S. trade deficit with China is being shifted from other economies in Asia as foreign-owned firms from various Asian countries invest in production facilities in China to lower production costs. For example, Nike contracts production of footwear in China from assembly plants owned by companies from South Korea and other Asian nations. Imports of footwear and furniture from China have increased significantly, while imports from countries like South Korea and Taiwan have decreased. This trend raises concerns for U.S. labor. Labor conditions in China have raised concerns for U.S. labor interests due to substandard workplace conditions. While Beijing has passed some labor laws, enforcement is lax, and independent unions are not allowed. American-operated manufacturing facilities in China generally have good working conditions, but worker exploitation has been reported in plants contracted to East Asian affiliated companies. Reported abuses include physical punishment and verbal humiliation. Some U.S. companies have adopted codes of conduct to address labor conditions in contracting factories in China, including Levi Strauss, Mattel, Nike, Reebok, Avon, Dole Food, and Toys R Us. However, monitoring working conditions in China is challenging, especially when production is subcontracted, and enforcement remains a problem. Some organizations, like the National Labor Committee in New York and NGOs in Hong Kong, have found violations of worker rights and poor conditions in Chinese factories producing for export. These factories are often not U.S.-owned but contract with U.S. companies. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) plays a significant role in the Chinese economy, but its exact impact is hard to determine due to the country's economic opening to the world. Foreign affiliates in China account for a significant portion of industrial value-added, tax revenue, and exports. FDI inflows contribute 10 to 15% of China's total gross fixed capital formation. Studies show that FDI has a small quantifiable effect on GDP but a larger impact on exports, with about 13% of changes in output attributed to FDI. Foreign affiliates play a significant role in China's exports, with 93% of electronic circuits and 85-96% of other high-tech products coming from foreign affiliated companies. This has led to a shift in China's export composition, with a decrease in primary products and an increase in high-technology exports. As a result, China's share of world trade rose from 1.6% in 1985 to 6% in 2000. China's share of world trade increased from 1.6% in 1985 to 6% in 2000. FDI helps ease foreign exchange constraints for developing nations, allowing for economic growth. China added $43 billion to its foreign exchange reserves in 2001, primarily through a current account surplus. China's $17.4 billion current account surplus, $37.4 billion net direct investment inflow, and deficit in portfolio investment were offset by FDI, which prevented a foreign exchange shortage and supported rapid growth. This reliance on foreign investors has helped modernize Chinese industries and export structure, but also led to concerns about China exporting deflation to the global economy. China's low-priced exports, driven by its currency pegged to the dollar, have been causing deflation concerns globally. Many countries have initiated anti-dumping cases against Chinese imports, indicating a trend of price undercutting in various industries. Foreign direct investment in China impacts security through economic growth, technology transfers, and military funding. China's military spending has been increasing, with a reported total of $20 billion in 2002. The U.S. Department of Defense estimates China's military spending to be closer to $65 billion, with projections of a three- to four-fold increase by 2020. FDI contributes about 10 to 15% to the GDP growth driving this rise in military expenditures. Foreign direct investments involve technology transfers that can enhance the competitiveness of Chinese exports, potentially threatening U.S. firms and security. A 1998 study by the U.S. Department of Commerce investigated the impact of technology transfers to China on American interests. The Bureau of Industry and Security investigated the impact of technology transfers to China on U.S. commercial competitiveness and security. The report suggests that China poses no immediate threat to U.S. economic competitiveness in high-tech industries but could become a major competitor in the future. It also highlights that the U.S. is paying a high price for access to China's market in terms of lost exports and job opportunities. Additionally, technology transfers in the automobile sector have improved Chinese capabilities. The report concludes that Chinese firms are learning more from joint ventures with European Union companies than from American firms in aircraft manufacturing know-how. While there is a potential risk of military spin-offs due to co-production agreements with foreign firms, China's abilities in military aircraft manufacturing and reverse engineering are still poor. Foreign technology transfers are unlikely to improve these capabilities. China has made progress in satellite technology with 8% of the market for international commercial satellite launches. U.S. export laws control exports of sensitive technologies like satellite technology to China. American firms accused of providing space technology to China allegedly assisted directly in launching satellites. Technology transfers have helped China catch up in some electronics-related sectors. Technology transfers have enabled China to catch up in some electronics-related sectors, particularly in co-production and assembly. However, China still mainly produces low-tech electrical products like televisions and refrigerators. While progress has been made in semiconductors, China still lags behind in producing the latest computer chips. A study found that it would take several years for China to replicate transferred technologies. European companies are investing in research and development to stay ahead of Chinese competition, drawing parallels to England's Industrial Revolution. Concerns arise about the U.S. defense industrial base's dependency on Chinese imports and the risk of disruptions to corporate operations. Some U.S. businesses are reducing investments in China. Some U.S. businesses are limiting investments in China to reduce risk and diversify supply. China is not a major supplier for high-technology products and parts, accounting for less than 17% of U.S. imports. However, it is a significant supplier for toys, puzzles, and footwear, with 82% of U.S. imports of toys and 57% of U.S. imports of footwear with leather uppers coming from China. Payless Shoes, for example, relies on China for 80% of its shoe supply, which could be severely impacted by a disruption in supplies from China. The growing FDI in China poses security-related issues for the U.S. and other foreign companies, as their economic interests could be at risk in case of hostilities. Foreign-affiliated firms in China could serve as \"hostages\" for Beijing and pressure governments to avoid actions that disrupt their businesses. Confidence of investors in China's stability is crucial for continued FDI growth. Investor confidence in China's stability is vital for FDI growth. Beijing's need to maintain stability incentivizes seeking peaceful solutions, though it can lead to U.S. businesses aligning with Beijing on certain issues. Potential hostilities with China could arise along the Taiwan Strait, making investment relations between the PRC and Taiwan crucial for stability. Taiwanese businesses have invested billions in mainland China since 1990, primarily in coastal provinces. Taiwanese businesses have invested billions in mainland China since 1990, with estimates reaching as high as $100 billion. Most of this investment is routed through Hong Kong or tax havens to avoid political complications and secure incentives. Over 400,000 Taiwanese business-related persons and their families reside in China, with 3 million visits from Taiwanese to the mainland annually. The strategy of China is to facilitate this investment and allow Taiwanese companies to earn higher profits. However, Taiwan's ruling Democratic People's Party is concerned about security implications and the displacement of domestic investment. Taiwan's growth rate has dropped to about 3%, while China's development is giving Beijing more confidence and less incentive to use the Taiwan issue for nationalism. Growing investment and business relations between Taiwan and mainland China are leading to further ties between the two governments. Initiatives like one-way air charters between Shanghai and Taipei have been started, with pressure to expand transportation, direct mail, and trade links. Foreign direct investment is speeding up China's integration processes. Foreign direct investment in China is accelerating its integration into the global economy and modernization of industries by providing technology, management skills, and easing constraints on foreign exchange. It contributes to economic growth and modernization, including in the military. FDI also creates pressure groups with financial interests in maintaining stability, Sino-foreign relations, and liberalized trade. Taiwanese FDI may be impacting hostilities along the Taiwan Strait as the economies become more integrated. As the Taiwanese economy integrates more with mainland China, there are pressures to ease restrictions and resolve the current stalemate. Data on foreign direct investment inflows, China's competitiveness in world trade, U.S. FDI position in China, and total foreign direct investment in China are provided in various appendices. Investment in China from 1990-2001 totaled billions of dollars according to data from the U.S.-China Business Council and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation."
