    "content": "The Act may be cited as the National Invasive Species Council Act and includes a statement of policy regarding federal duties. Federal agencies are prohibited from actions that could introduce or spread invasive species unless the agency head determines that benefits outweigh potential harm and measures are taken to minimize risks. Guidelines for analysis will be developed by the Council for Environmental Quality and the Invasive Species Council. The National Invasive Species Council is established. The National Invasive Species Council is established as an independent entity within the executive branch to provide leadership and coordination among Federal agencies, State, and local governments in minimizing the impacts of invasive species on the economy, ecology, and human health. The Council consists of various Secretaries from different government departments. The National Invasive Species Council includes members such as the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development. Additional members can be appointed by the Chair of the Council. The Secretary of the Interior serves as the chair for a three-year period. The National Invasive Species Council members rotate as chair every three years among the Secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, and Interior. The Council must meet at least semiannually, and the President appoints the Executive Director with consultation from relevant Secretaries and specific qualifications required. The Executive Director of the National Invasive Species Council must have training in natural resources, ecology, or agriculture, and experience in dealing with public policy on invasive species. They serve a six-year term and are compensated at the maximum rate of basic pay for GS-15. SEC. 4. DUTIES. The Executive Director of the National Invasive Species Council must have training in natural resources, ecology, or agriculture, and experience in dealing with public policy on invasive species.

The National Invasive Species Council ensures coordinated, effective, and cost-efficient efforts on invasive species. It coordinates with various organizations and develops recommendations for international cooperation on prevention methods. The National Invasive Species Council develops guidelines and guidance for Federal agencies to prevent the introduction and export of invasive species. They also establish an information sharing system for coordination among agencies and the public.

SEC. 5. NATIONAL INVASIVE SPECIES MANAGEMENT PLAN. The National Invasive Species Council develops a National Invasive Species Management Plan through a public process and in consultation with various stakeholders. The plan includes recommendations for preventing the introduction of invasive species using cost-efficient and science-based approaches. The National Invasive Species Council develops a National Invasive Species Management Plan through a public process and in consultation with various stakeholders. The plan includes recommendations for preventing the introduction of invasive species using cost-efficient and science-based approaches, such as evaluating risks, identifying pathways, cooperating with other nations, and rapidly detecting and responding to incipient threats. The National Invasive Species Council's plan includes managing invasive species by eradicating or controlling them, monitoring populations accurately, restoring native species and habitats, evaluating impacts on the economy and environment, conducting research, and developing prevention technologies. The National Management Plan aims to prevent the introduction and manage invasive species, promote public education, and identify necessary resources and personnel. The existing plan from 2001 will serve as the National Management Plan until a new one is issued. The National Management Plan must be issued by December 31, 2003, and updated biennially. Federal agencies must report to Congress on actions recommended in the plan within 18 months of issuance. SEC. 6. INVASIVE SPECIES ADVISORY COMMITTEE. The Invasive Species Advisory Committee, appointed by the chair of the Council, provides information and advice on minimizing the impacts of invasive species on Federal programs. The advisory committee recommends plans at various levels to achieve goals of the National Management Plan. Existing committees can continue under this section. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is required to submit a budget analysis of all Federal programs related to invasive species to Congress and the Council annually by March 31. Definitions for the document are also provided. SEC. 8.
