    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Prematurity Research Expansion and Education for Mothers who deliver Infants Early Act\" or the \"PREEMIE Act.\" Premature birth is a serious problem with increasing rates, leading to high mortality and long-term health consequences for infants. It also poses a significant financial burden on healthcare due to hospital stays for premature babies. In 2000, hospital stays for premature/low birthweight infants cost $11.9 billion. The average lifetime medical costs for a premature baby are estimated at $500,000. African-American mothers have a higher proportion of preterm births compared to white mothers. Smoking during pregnancy doubles the risk of giving birth to a low birthweight baby. To reduce rates of preterm labor and delivery, research is needed on underlying causes, treatments for prevention, and improving outcomes for preterm infants. The purpose of this Act is to reduce preterm labor rates, establish evidence-based care for at-risk pregnant women and preterm infants, and decrease infant mortality and disabilities from prematurity. Expansion and coordination of research related to preterm labor, delivery, and infant mortality is addressed in Section 3 of the Public Health Service Act. This includes a focus on improving outcomes for preterm and low birthweight infants. The Director of NIH will expand research on preterm labor, infant mortality, and care for preterm infants. Networks for Maternal-Fetal Medicine and Neonatal Research will be established. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2004-2008. The Health Service Act is amended to expand CDC activities on preterm labor, infant mortality, and assisted reproduction technologies. Studies on the impact of assisted reproduction technologies and the relationship between prematurity and birth defects are mandated. The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will conduct a study on the relationship between prematurity, birth defects, and developmental disabilities. A report on the study results must be submitted to Congress within 2 years. Additionally, a review of the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring Survey will be conducted to track pregnancy outcomes and reduce instances of preterm birth. The Director of the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will collaborate with the Institute of Medicine to conduct a study on the health and economic consequences of preterm birth in the United States. The study will focus on reviewing the epidemiology of premature birth, low birthweight, maternal and child health effects, and disparities based on gestational age, plurality, maternal age, and racial or ethnic factors. The study will assess the health and economic impacts of premature birth in the US, including disparities, disability, costs, and implications for national health policy. It will also provide recommendations for monitoring economic and quality of life burdens associated with prematurity. The Institute of Medicine will provide recommendations on preventing premature births and suggest areas for further research to decrease prematurity rates in communities. They will also consider the allocation of public funds for research, preventive interventions, public health, and access to healthcare. The report is due within 1 year of the contract being entered into. The Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration will assess national core performance measures under the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant to include known risk factors of low birthweight and prematurity, such as smoking during pregnancy. The Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration will submit a report to Congress within a year of the enactment of the Act, detailing the evaluation results on pregnant women who smoked during pregnancy. SEC. 399O of the Public Health Service Act amends Part P of title III to provide public and health care provider education and support services. The Secretary will conduct a demonstration project to improve information on prematurity for health professionals and the public, including programs on preterm labor signs, infection screening and treatment, nutrition counseling, and smoking cessation education. The Secretary will conduct programs to improve treatment for premature babies, including evidence-based care for pregnant women at risk of preterm labor. NICU Family Support Programs will be funded to address emotional and informational needs of families with infants in neonatal intensive care units. Activities under projects for premature babies include providing books and videos to families in neonatal intensive care units for emotional support. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2004 through 2008. The Interagency Coordinating Council on Prematurity and Low Birthweight is established. The purpose of this section is to promote research and collaboration among agencies to reduce prematurity and low birthweight. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish an Interagency Coordinating Council on Prematurity and Low Birthweight, composed of members appointed by the Secretary from various agencies and health care organizations. The Interagency Coordinating Council on Prematurity and Low Birthweight, composed of members from various agencies and health care organizations, will report on Departmental activities, plan conferences, establish research plans, and make recommendations to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and Congress. The Interagency Coordinating Council on Prematurity and Low Birthweight will oversee the implementation of this Act, including activities determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2004 through 2008 is provided to carry out this Act."
