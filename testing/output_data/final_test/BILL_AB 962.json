Offenses like rape and spousal rape under specific circumstances will result in imprisonment for 15 to 25 years to life in the state prison. The amended Penal Code specifies punishment for various offenses including spousal rape, sexual penetration, lewd acts, sodomy, oral copulation, and continuous sexual abuse of a child. The Penal Code specifies punishment for offenses such as spousal rape, sexual penetration, lewd acts, sodomy, oral copulation, and continuous sexual abuse of a child, including cases involving developmentally disabled victims. The Penal Code outlines punishment for offenses like spousal rape, sexual penetration, lewd acts, sodomy, and oral copulation involving developmentally disabled victims. Repeat offenses result in stricter penalties. The defendant committed the present offense under circumstances that substantially increased the risk of harm to the victim. The defendant inflicted bodily harm on the victim, used a dangerous weapon, or committed the offense during a burglary. The defendant committed offenses against multiple victims, tied or bound victims, administered drugs, and violated specific sections of the law. If only the minimum required circumstances for a specific punishment have been proven, they will be used as the basis for imposing the greater term provided by law. Additional circumstances can lead to additional punishments. The presence of additional circumstances can result in the imposition of further punishments authorized by law. The court shall not strike any allegation, admission, or finding of specified circumstances for those subject to punishment under this section. Probation or sentence suspension is not allowed for individuals under this section. Consecutive sentences must be imposed for offenses involving separate victims or the same victim on separate occasions. Any person convicted of specified offenses against a child under 14 years of age under certain circumstances faces life imprisonment without parole or 25 years to life in state prison. Probation or sentence suspension is not permitted, and consecutive sentences are required for offenses involving separate victims or occasions.

Subdivisions (l) and (m) apply to offenses including rape, spousal rape, sexual penetration, sodomy, and oral copulation. Rape in violation of Section 261 with a developmentally disabled victim can result in enhanced penalties. Sexual penetration, sodomy, and oral copulation with a developmentally disabled victim can result in enhanced penalties if proven in court. Enhanced penalties apply if crimes specified in subdivision (c) are committed against vulnerable individuals, including those who are elderly, disabled, or under 14 years old, with the knowledge of the perpetrator. Each violation results in a one-year enhancement. Any person who commits a violation of specified crimes shall receive a two-year enhancement for each violation in addition to the sentence provided under Section 667. The specified crimes include oral copulation, sexual penetration, and burglary of the first degree. \"Developmentally disabled\" is defined as a severe, chronic disability affecting various areas of life activity.
