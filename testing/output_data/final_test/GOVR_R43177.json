    "content": "The Public Health Service Act (PHSA) in Title VII supports education and training for professionals in medical, dental, public health, and allied health professions through grants and contractual agreements to institutions. It also provides direct assistance to individuals for academic preparation. Title VII programs support individuals in health professions through scholarships, loans, and fellowships. The ACA created the National Health Care Workforce Commission and State Health Care Workforce Development Grants. The ACA also mandates health insurance coverage for most U.S. citizens, leading to increased demand for health services and providers. The Medicare Graduate Medical Education (GME) program provides significant annual funding for residents' salaries and teaching costs. In comparison, Title VII programs contribute a smaller amount to education and training for health professionals. The report describes federal support for education and training activities for various health professionals, authorized in Title VII of the PHSA. It outlines eligibility requirements for institutions and individuals applying for grants and assistance. The second part provides details on statutory requirements and preferences within Title VII, with references to the Secretary of HHS. Appendix A summarizes two ACA provisions related to Title VII. Title VII of the PHSA authorizes grants, contracts, and agreements for education and training in the medical, dental, public health, and allied health workforce. It also provides scholarships, loans, and loan repayments for health professions education. Additionally, health workforce advisory groups monitor related programs. Part A specifies requirements for agreements between the Secretary of HHS and eligible institutions for federally-supported school loan funds. Title VII of the PHSA authorizes grants, contracts, and agreements for education and training in health professions schools. Part A establishes preferences for primary care medical students and individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. Part B authorizes programs to increase workforce diversity. Part C authorizes grants for capacity-building programs in primary care medicine and dentistry. Part D supports recruitment and retention activities, interdisciplinary groups, and capacity building in geriatrics and allied health professions. Part E establishes the National Center for Health Workforce Analysis and authorizes grants for data collection. Part F of Title VII specifies requirements for participants, including preferences, prohibitions against discrimination, fund usage, and eligibility criteria for grants and contracts. Eligible entities include health professions schools, academic health centers, states, local governments, and nonprofit or for-profit groups. They must meet general and specific eligibility requirements, such as accreditation by a recognized association. Title VII programs have specific eligibility requirements, including collaboration with the Secretary to develop curricula and research projects. Eligible individuals in health professions may receive support through scholarships, loans, or loan repayments. Preferences may be given to underrepresented minority groups. Table 1 summarizes Title VII by part in the order presented in the PHSA. Title VII authorizes programs for health care workforce education and training. Part A includes the HEAL program for student loans. Subpart II outlines requirements for school-administered student loan funds. Each subpart sets rules for borrowing and lending. The HEAL program insured loans for health professions students from 1978 to 1998, allowing borrowing up to $80,000 for certain fields. Refinancing continued until FY2004, with a current outstanding loan portfolio of $609 million. Title VII also includes requirements for health professions institutions operating student loan funds.

Third- and fourth-year medical school students can borrow additional loan amounts to pay off qualified loan balances. Repayment can be done in equal or graduated installments over 10 to 25 years. If the borrower dies or becomes permanently disabled, the liability to repay the loan is cancelled. Loans must have a 5% interest rate and can only be transferred to another school participating in a Title VII loan program. The Secretary can collect defaulted loans, with collected amounts deposited into the school's student loan fund. Civil actions regarding student loans are referred to the Attorney General.
