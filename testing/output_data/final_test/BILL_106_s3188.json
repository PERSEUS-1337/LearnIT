    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cyber Security Enhancement Act\". It includes findings related to cybersecurity. Congress finds that obtaining information on threats and risks to critical infrastructure, whether public or private, domestic or foreign, is crucial for US security and economic well-being. Private sector and non-Federal agencies are willing to share sensitive information on infrastructure vulnerabilities with the government, provided it is protected from unrestricted disclosure. The public interest is best served by preserving the confidentiality of critical infrastructure information submitted to the Federal Government to protect it from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Federal law does not currently provide clear assurance to private sector and non-Federal agencies that their submitted information on threats and risks to critical infrastructure will be protected. President Clinton has highlighted the national security risks posed by cyber vulnerabilities in the United States, emphasizing the need to be prepared for potential attacks on critical infrastructure. Information sharing among private sector organizations is crucial for identifying and addressing threats to information networks. Currently, there are concerns about antitrust penalties hindering cyber security information sharing among organizations. The maximum penalties for Federal computer crimes are insufficient to deter serious cyber attacks, which often involve false IP addresses to mask the origin of the attack. Standardization among law enforcement agencies is lacking, making it difficult to gather information effectively during cyber crime investigations. SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN SENSITIVE INFORMATION UNDER THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT. Limitation on disclosure of critical infrastructure information under the Freedom of Information Act if submitted voluntarily by a non-Federal source to a designated critical infrastructure protection office or program. The President or head of a Federal agency can designate an element within the agency for this purpose. The head of a Federal agency cannot delegate authority. The agency must publish a notice in the Federal Register before designating an element as a critical infrastructure office. A person seeking protection of information must mark it accordingly for consideration under the Cyber Security Enhancement Act. The Cyber Security Enhancement Act allows requests for information or records to be made only by the person who submitted them to the Federal Government. The Act does not limit the Federal Government's ability to obtain critical infrastructure information independently. Information protected under the Act shall be controlled by the United States. The Cyber Security Enhancement Act ensures that information protected from disclosure by the Federal Government remains under its control, even if shared with State or local governments. State or local disclosure laws do not apply to federally protected information. Voluntarily submitted information does not fulfill requirements to submit information to a Federal agency under other laws. Requests for protection of information or records can be withdrawn. Withdrawal of a request for information protection can be done at any time, taking effect upon receipt by the Federal agency. Information protection expires after five years but can be extended for an additional five years. Protection of information or records can be extended for an additional 5 years. After expiration, the Federal agency will determine if the person wants to continue the protection. If not, the protection will cease. Penalties for unauthorized disclosure may include an investigation by a court. The Federal agency must investigate violations of information protection laws and may take disciplinary action if necessary. This section does not prevent agencies from sharing critical infrastructure information for protection purposes. SEC. 4. ANTITRUST MATTERS. The antitrust laws do not apply to conduct related to cybersecurity problem responses or information sharing, except for agreements involving boycotts, market allocation, or price fixing. The exemption is to be narrowly construed. SEC. 5. FRAUD AND RELATED ACTIVITY IN CONNECTION WITH COMPUTERS. SEC. 5. FRAUD AND RELATED ACTIVITY IN CONNECTION WITH COMPUTERS. Enhanced penalties for fraud in connection with computers are increased from 5 to 10 years, and from 10 to 20 years for certain offenses. Chapter 223 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to allow the Attorney General to issue administrative subpoenas in cyber crime cases involving specific violations. This includes requiring electronic communication service providers to disclose certain subscriber information. The Attorney General can issue administrative subpoenas in cyber crime cases to obtain subscriber information, service details, and types of services used by a customer. The disclosed information cannot include the content of electronic communications. Witnesses summoned under this section will be compensated for their attendance. The Attorney General can issue administrative subpoenas in cyber crime cases to obtain subscriber information and service details. Enforcement provisions for investigative demands apply to subpoenas issued under this section. \"SEC. 7. Standardized requests for electronic information and records.\" The Attorney General must submit a plan to standardize requests for electronic information from ISPs and other entities for investigating computer-related crimes within six months of this Act. Consultation with relevant agencies and public comment are required in the plan's preparation. SEC. 8. PREVENTION OF INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS SPOOFING. The Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce will submit a plan to Congress and the President to encourage Internet service providers to prevent the use of false Internet protocol addresses (IP spoofing). They will consult with other federal agencies, state governments, and interested parties in preparing the plan. In preparing the plan, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce will seek public notice and comment. SEC. 9. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"agency\" is defined as specified in section 551 of title 5, United States Code. The term \"antitrust laws\" includes laws from the Clayton Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act, as well as any similar State laws. \"Critical infrastructure\" refers to essential physical and cyber-based systems, facilities, or services vital to the United States or its economy. The term \"critical infrastructure information\" pertains to threats, vulnerabilities, risks, and mitigation strategies for critical infrastructure. Additionally, the term \"critical infrastructure protection office or program\" refers to a Federal agency element designated for protecting critical infrastructure from intentional harm. \"Cyber security\" is defined as measures taken to protect against cyber threats. Cyber security refers to the vulnerability of computing systems and critical infrastructure to interference via unauthorized means, violating laws or threatening public health. \"Voluntary\" means submitting information to the Federal Government without mandate or as a condition of doing business."
