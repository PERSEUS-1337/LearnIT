It wasn't until 1885 that federal workers in other parts of the country received holiday benefits. The June 28, 1870 act established the first federal holidays for employees in the District of Columbia. The June 28, 1870 act established federal holidays in the District of Columbia, including New Year's Day, Independence Day, Christmas Day, and days recommended by the President. In 1879, George Washington's Birthday was added as a bank holiday. Representative Burton Cook explained Congress's intent in creating a bank holiday for financial transactions. The Uniform Monday Holiday Act in 1968 shifted Washington's Birthday to the third Monday in February. Contrary to popular belief, the Act did not mandate changing the holiday name to Presidents Day. Decoration Day (now Memorial Day) became a federal holiday in 1888. Decoration Day was likely created for federal employees who were also members of the Grand Army of the Republic, a Union Civil War veterans' organization. They wanted to honor those who died in the conflict without losing a day's wages. The \"Uniform Monday Holiday Act\" in 1968 changed Memorial Day to the last Monday in May. Labor Day, created in 1894, honors the country's labor force. Labor Day was created in 1894 to honor the nation's labor force and emphasize the importance of labor by giving people a day of rest and recreation. The House Committee on Labor believed that celebrating Labor Day would maintain the nobility of labor and encourage honorable emulation among different crafts.

The House Committee on Labor believed that celebrating Labor Day would maintain the nobility of labor and encourage honorable emulation among different crafts. In 1938, Armistice Day was declared a federal holiday to commemorate the close of World War I, with a focus on peace activities rather than war glories. In 1954, Armistice Day was officially changed to Veterans Day to honor all American veterans, broadening the commemoration beyond World War I. This legislation aimed to bring the federal government in line with the sentiment in the United States, recognizing the sacrifices of all veterans on a single day. In 1968, Veterans Day was designated as one of five holidays celebrated on a Monday, with the date changed to the fourth Monday in October. In 1975, Congress returned Veterans Day to November 11 after opposition to the change from veterans' organizations and 46 states. If November 11 falls on a Saturday, the holiday is observed on the preceding Friday, and if it falls on a Sunday, it is observed on the following Monday. The evolution of Thanksgiving Day as a federal holiday began with President George Washington's proclamation in 1789. It wasn't until 1863 that the nation started observing it annually, with President Abraham Lincoln establishing the last Thursday of November as the official day of thanksgiving. Subsequent Presidents continued to set the date for the celebration each year. President Franklin D. Roosevelt changed the tradition of celebrating Thanksgiving to the third Thursday in November between 1869 and 1939 to boost retail business. Despite protests, he repeated this in 1940, but by May 1941, the Administration decided to return Thanksgiving to the fourth Thursday in November. President Roosevelt signed a joint resolution on December 26, 1941, establishing Thanksgiving Day as a federal holiday on the fourth Thursday in November to avoid future confusion. In 1957, Inauguration Day became a permanent federal holiday in the Washington, DC area, with the following day also considered a holiday if Inauguration Day fell on a Sunday. In 1968, Columbus Day was made a federal holiday to honor Columbus's voyage and the courage of immigrants in America. President Ronald Reagan signed legislation in November 1983 creating a federal holiday to commemorate Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, ending a 15-year debate. Reagan praised Dr. King as a man who deeply impacted the nation. Proposals for the holiday began after Dr. King's 1968 assassination, with the House of Representatives almost approving a bill in 1979. In November 1979, the House voted for a bill designating January 15 as a federal holiday in honor of Dr. King, but fell short of the required two-thirds majority. In August 1983, the House passed legislation making the third Monday in January a federal holiday starting in 1986. The Senate passed the bill in October, and President Reagan signed it into law. Congress had previously approved the Uniform Monday Holiday Act in June 1968. The Uniform Monday Holiday Act changed the dates of Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Veterans Day, and Columbus Day to be observed on specific Mondays to provide benefits to the nation's spiritual and economic life, increase family time, allow for more recreational activities, and promote visits to historic sites. The Monday Holiday bill proposal aimed to increase participation in historical events, promote leisure activities, and boost industrial production by shifting holidays to Mondays. Public opinion polls showed strong support for the concept of uniform Monday holiday legislation. The 1880 legislation signed by President Hayes addressed a grievance filed by federal employees who were denied holiday pay, aiming to place them on equal footing with other government departments. In 1903, Acting Attorney General James C. McReynolds supported the House Committee on Printing's reasoning regarding legal holidays for federal employees in the District of Columbia. He noted that it was customary to close Executive Departments in Washington on five holidays declared by District laws. This historical practice indicated that these holidays were only recognized as public holidays in the District, leading McReynolds to conclude that federal employees in the District had already been paid for the holiday. In 1885, Congress extended holiday benefits to all federal employees, including per diem workers, by approving legislation that made five holidays applicable to employees on duty in Washington or elsewhere in the United States. The decision to pay federal workers for other holidays was made at various times. In 1870, Thanksgiving Day became a paid holiday for some federal workers after Congress granted the President the power to designate a day of thanksgiving. Legislation has been introduced in recent Congresses to create new federal holidays or add celebrations to existing ones, such as \"Cesar E. Chavez Day.\" Another proposal in H.R. 108 (112th Congress) by Representative John Conyers would establish a new holiday. John Conyers introduced a bill to establish \"election day\" in November for even-numbered years. Another proposal by Representative John Yarmuth aimed to create a holiday for voting in federal elections. Legislation has also been introduced to add individuals like Susan B. Anthony to existing holidays. H.R. 856 aimed to add Susan B. Anthony to the list of individuals celebrated on George Washington's Birthday, but no further action was taken."
