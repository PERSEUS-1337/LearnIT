    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Secure And Fair Enforcement Banking Act of 2017\" or the \"SAFE Act of 2017.\" It provides a safe harbor for depository institutions. A Federal banking regulator is prohibited from terminating deposit insurance for institutions serving cannabis-related businesses or discouraging them from providing financial services. A Federal banking regulator cannot recommend or incentivize a depository institution to deny financial services to cannabis-related legitimate businesses or their account holders. A Federal banking regulator cannot take adverse action on a loan made to an owner of a cannabis-related legitimate business or real estate leased to such a business. Federal law provides protections for loans made to owners of cannabis-related legitimate businesses or real estate leased to such businesses. In states allowing cannabis activities, depository institutions providing financial services to cannabis-related businesses are protected from liability under federal law. This includes investing income from these services and having a legal interest in collateral for loans to such businesses. Owners or operators of cannabis-related legitimate businesses, as well as those leasing or selling real estate or equipment to such businesses, are protected from criminal, civil, or administrative forfeiture of their legal interests under Federal law for providing financial services. The Act does not mandate depository institutions to offer financial services to cannabis-related legitimate businesses. Section 5318(g) of title 31, United States Code, is amended to include requirements for financial institutions reporting suspicious transactions related to cannabis-related legitimate businesses. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network will issue appropriate guidance to ensure compliance without hindering financial services provision to such businesses in a State.
