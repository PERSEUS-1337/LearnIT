    "content": "The Bush Administration released The Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2009 on February 4, 2008, containing detailed budget information, policy proposals, and economic forecasts for FY2008 through FY2013. It also addresses long-term fiscal issues and historical budget data. The Bush Administration's budget for FY2009 foresees a steady improvement in the federal government's fiscal position, with a surplus of $29 billion projected for FY2013. The on-budget deficit for FY2013 is projected at $201 billion, with deficits expected to rise rapidly after FY2020. Major proposals include tax cut extensions, limited increases in domestic spending, and addressing the alternative minimum tax. Medicare and Medicaid growth is expected to slow. The congressional budget process begins once the Administration submits its budget to Congress. The Administration submits its budget to Congress for deliberation. The House and Senate pass budget resolutions with amendments, including an alternative minimum tax fix. A conference committee is formed, and a budget conference report is filed. The House and Senate passed budget resolutions for FY2009, leading to the consideration of the conference agreement. The Senate passed the conference report on a 48-45 vote, followed by the House passing it on a 214-210 vote. The House passage automatically raised the debt limit through legislation transmitted to the Senate. Budget estimates for FY2009 from CBO, OMB, and Congress varied due to different assumptions and techniques. Budget estimates for FY2009 from various sources were expected to change due to economic conditions. The economic slowdown that began in 2007 continued to impact projections. CBO predicted slower growth in 2008 with recovery in 2009, while the President's budget forecasted strong growth for both years. However, the economy weakened in 2008, leading to adjustments in revenue forecasts and increased spending. CBO's September 2008 estimate for FY2009 revenues was $2.817 trillion. CBO's September 2008 baseline estimate for FY2009 revenues was $97 billion below its January figure, while the estimate for outlays was $143 billion above the January estimate. Spending is shown in terms of outlays, which are federal funds disbursed in a given time period. Budget authority reflects the amount of money federal agencies are legally allowed to spend. Outlay data are more convenient for assessing the macroeconomic effects of federal budgets, while budget authority figures are used by analysts focusing on specific federal programs. Appropriations legislation is generally framed in terms of budget authority. The report focuses on federal outlays rather than budget authority to show the broader effects of the federal budget on the economy. CBO's first budget report for the FY2009 cycle projected a deficit of $198 billion, slightly higher than the previous year. The projection assumed lapsing AMT relief and slightly lower costs for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The baseline projection showed a surplus emerging in FY2012. The CBO baseline projections show a surplus of $87 billion in FY2012, expected to rise to $223 billion in FY2018. Key assumptions include constant discretionary spending, expiration of 2001 and 2003 tax cuts after 2010, and lapsing of the AMT \"patch\". These assumptions explain the declining deficit and surpluses projected. The declining deficit and emerging surpluses over the 10-year forecast window are mainly due to zero spending in real terms. However, without major policy changes, federal deficits are expected to grow rapidly beyond this window, driven by increasing healthcare costs and the retirement of baby boomers. CBO's January report also included estimated budgetary effects of selected policies on revenues and outlays, such as the costs of making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent. In February 2008, CBO updated its economic projections due to slower economic activity, interest rate cuts, and the economic stimulus package. The revised estimates showed faster growth in FY2008 but slower growth in FY2009. Troop reductions in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other Global War on Terror postings could save $250 billion over FY2009-FY2013. The economic stimulus package and slower economic growth lead to increased federal budget deficits in the short run. CBO's preliminary analysis of the President's FY2009 Budget in March 2008 projected higher deficits for FY2008 and FY2009 due to the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008. Lower interest rates boosted economic growth rates and reduced borrowing costs. CBO estimated smaller short-run deficits compared to OMB, mainly due to lower defense cost estimates. President Bush's FY2009 budget proposed extending tax cuts and other provisions, which would further raise the deficit. The President's proposals would increase the deficit by $692 billion between FY2009 and FY2013, and by $2.7 trillion between FY2009 and FY2017. The proposals aim to reduce mandatory spending by $96 billion over 5 years and by $309 billion over 10 years. The budget includes a cost estimate of $637 billion over 10 years for proposed personal accounts for Social Security. The introduction of personal Social Security accounts is responsible for most of the projected increase in spending. The Administration's budget provided limited information for years beyond FY2013, with estimates of proposed revenue and spending changes up to FY2018. The President proposed eliminating or reducing 151 programs to save $18 billion in FY2009 compared to FY2008. CBO estimates spending totals for discretionary appropriations legislation. CBO estimates spending totals for discretionary appropriations legislation, including new budget authority and outlays for non-emergency and emergency spending. Both CBO baseline projections and Administration forecasts show a budget surplus in FY2012, the first surplus since FY2001. Independent analysts caution that these forecasts are based on specific assumptions for budgetary scorekeeping, not for predicting future outcomes. The President's budget proposes no real growth in discretionary spending over the five years, assuming a larger portion of middle-income taxpayers will be subject to the alternative minimum tax. Budget projections depend on economic models and assumptions about tax and program changes, with changes in economic conditions affecting the budget. Budget estimates and projections are influenced by factors such as economic growth, inflation, and policy changes. Technical components of budget models may evolve with changes in the economy and advancements in econometric techniques. Forecasts are constructed to estimate the costs of policy changes consistently, leading to potential differences between baseline estimates and actual outcomes. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analyzes its budget estimates and provides explanations for forecast variations in its publications. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) provides detailed explanations for forecast variations in its budget publications. Differences between projections are broken down into legislative, economic, and technical factors. For example, budget estimates consider stable trends like population demographics, such as the upcoming retirement of baby boomers affecting Medicare and Social Security spending. However, factors like future productivity are harder to predict. Budget estimates are influenced by factors like future productivity growth and business cycles, as well as volatile elements such as financial market trends. Small changes in economic conditions can lead to significant variations in budget projections. For instance, a 0.1% decrease in real GDP growth rate could increase deficits by $61 billion over 5 years and $273 billion over 10 years, according to CBO estimates. Government policies, like extending military operations or allowing tax cuts to expire, also impact budget outlook. Budget projections are inherently uncertain, with measures of forecast quality including statistical unbiasedness. The President's FY2009 budget includes measures to assess the accuracy and statistical bias of previous forecasts. Forecast accuracy generally decreases as the forecast window extends to later years due to potential policy and economic changes. OMB has analyzed budget estimates since FY1982, estimating a standard deviation of $70 billion for the current fiscal year and $140 billion for the budget year estimate. The standard deviation of Administration budget year deficit/surplus estimates for FY1994-FY2001 was $77 billion and $237 billion for FY2002-FY2007. The four-years-ahead forecast had a standard deviation of $284 billion, four times larger. OMB used this estimate to calculate upper and lower bounds for deficit projections, showing a gap of over $1.1 trillion after five years. The House and Senate Budget Committees reported budget resolutions on March 7, 2008, with the House passing an amended version on March 13 and the Senate approving its version on March 14. The House and Senate Budget Committees approved budget resolutions in March 2008. The House resolution included reconciliation instructions for the AMT fix, while the Senate resolution did not. The House had $25.4 billion more in non-emergency discretionary budget authority than requested by the President for FY2009, while the Senate had $21.8 billion above the requested level. The Senate version assumed the extension of key 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. The Senate resolution included a $35 billion economic stimulus package and extended the credit beyond the scheduled 2010 expiration date. Approval of House and Senate budget resolutions cleared the way for negotiations for a conference agreement. The House approved an amended version of S.Con.Res. 70 on May 14 without objection, leading to a conference committee. The conference report (H.Rept. 110-659) was filed on May 20, and the House approved H.Res. 1214 the next day, paving the way for consideration of the conference agreement. The House approved H.Res. 1214 on May 21, clearing the way for consideration of the conference agreement. The Senate passed the S.Con.Res. 70 conference report on June 4, and the House passed it on June 5. The budget resolution included raising the debt limit to $10.615 billion and projected FY2009 outlays of $3,107 billion. Both the Administration and CBO issued future federal outlay projections. In January 2008, baseline projections showed outlays rising to 20.4% of GDP in FY2009 before falling to 19.3% in FY2013. Revised projections in March 2008 estimated outlays at 20.4% of GDP for FY2008 and 20.3% for FY2009. CBO's assumptions suggest discretionary spending decreases as a percentage of GDP over time. Analysts believe current-law baseline estimates may underestimate future growth in discretionary spending. September 2008 CBO projections indicated federal outlays would increase by $295 billion over FY2009-FY2013, excluding war costs. CBO projects that discretionary defense spending in Iraq and Afghanistan would increase by $295 billion over FY2009-FY2013 if spending grows with the economy. However, if spending remains fixed at FY2008 levels, federal outlays would decrease by $420 billion. The projections are based on enacted budget authority for current fiscal year programs, adjusted for inflation. Congressional funding for war-related activities can impact baseline projections throughout the year. Discretionary defense spending in Iraq and Afghanistan is projected to increase significantly over the next few years, according to CBO baseline projections. The projections show a rise from $549 billion in FY2007 to $572 billion in FY2008, and further increases to $645 billion in FY2013 and $723 billion in FY2018. Despite the increase in spending, discretionary defense spending as a percentage of GDP is expected to decrease from 4.0% in FY2007 to 3.2% in FY2018. CBO has also analyzed the budgetary effects of reducing the number of troops deployed in these regions. In alternative scenarios, troops deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, and related operations would be reduced. One scenario withdraws all but 30,000 troops by 2010, saving $425 billion in projected spending. Another scenario withdraws troops more slowly, reaching 75,000 by 2013, adding $225 billion in projected spending. CBO projects nondefense discretionary spending to increase from $493 billion in FY2007 to $520 billion in FY2008. Non-defense discretionary spending is projected to rise from $493 billion in FY2007 to $637 billion in FY2018. As a percentage of GDP, it is expected to decrease from 3.6% in FY2007 to 2.8% in FY2018. Mandatory spending is projected to increase from $1,577 billion in FY2008 to $2,725 billion in FY2018, with little change in its share of GDP. The CBO baseline projections show that mandatory spending will increase slightly from 11.1% of GDP in FY2008 to 12.2% in FY2018. The Administration's budget proposed a rise in outlays from $3,107 billion in FY2009 to $3,399 billion in FY2013, with a focus on defense and homeland security spending. Measures were proposed to slow the growth of Medicare and Medicaid, while total mandatory spending would still increase. Additionally, $30 billion was proposed for personal Social Security accounts in FY2013. The proposed FY2009 outlays exceeded the Administration's baseline by $114 billion. Mandatory spending would be $18 billion below baseline. Net interest payments were projected to increase due to federal borrowing. Outlays were expected to increase to 20.7% of GDP in FY2009. By FY2012, outlays were projected to fall to 18.5% of GDP. The $176 billion increase in outlays from FY2008 to FY2009 was attributed to various factors including program adjustments, population growth, and increased military spending. The Administration's proposed FY2009 budget includes increased spending on military and veterans' programs, policy changes, and higher costs due to inflation. Most of the discretionary spending increase is for \"security\" activities, such as defense, homeland security, and foreign affairs. The additional security funding is mainly for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Medium-term projections show a decrease in defense spending after FY2009. Congress approved $86.8 billion in supplemental funding for FY2008, with an additional $102.5 billion requested by the Administration pending approval. Additionally, $70 billion in emergency supplemental funding for FY2009 has been requested. The Administration has requested $70 billion in emergency supplemental funding for FY2009, with the House and Senate approving bills for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Department of Defense accounts for the majority of spending in the national defense category, which also includes Department of Energy programs and military retirement contributions. The Administration proposed $670.7 billion in spending for FY2009, with $393.0 billion in net \"non-security\" discretionary funds. The Administration proposed $393.0 billion in net \"non-security\" discretionary budget authority for FY2009, slightly above the enacted FY2008 level. This implies a proposed cut in real terms equal to the inflation rate. The Administration also proposed $482 billion in \"non-security\" discretionary outlays, with projections showing a decline to $429 billion in FY2013. Future federal health care spending is expected to remain close to 5.3% of GDP. Federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid is projected to increase significantly, reaching 19% of GDP in 2082. Mandatory spending is expected to grow by 5.5% from FY2008 to FY2009. The budget includes proposals to reduce mandatory outlays by $17.1 billion in FY2009, with larger reductions in later years. The Administration proposed reducing mandatory spending, including Medicare and Medicaid, to cut $178 billion over FY2009-FY2013. This would account for about 2% of total mandatory spending, which is projected to exceed $9 trillion. Despite the cuts, mandatory spending would still be the largest category of federal spending. Additionally, federal debt is growing rapidly, leading to higher net interest outlays. The Administration's proposals aim to reduce mandatory spending, including Medicare and Medicaid, by $178 billion over FY2009-FY2013. This would represent about 2% of total mandatory spending, which is projected to exceed $9 trillion. Despite these cuts, federal debt is increasing, leading to higher net interest payments in the future. The Administration estimates that net interest payments will amount to about 1.7% of GDP over the next five years. Defense and nondefense discretionary spending as a share of GDP are expected to decrease from FY2008 to FY2013 according to the Administration's proposals. The projected decline in defense and nondefense discretionary spending relative to GDP after FY2009 depends on assumptions of reduced nondefense discretionary spending and no additional spending for military operations overseas. The President's proposed limited reductions in mandatory spending aim to keep it stable as a share of GDP, but introducing private Social Security accounts in FY2013 would increase mandatory spending relative to GDP. Historical data on outlays since FY1990 and projections through FY2018 are shown in Figure 2. The Administration's outlook includes actual outlays as a percentage of GDP for FY2000 through FY2007 and proposed reductions in discretionary spending. By FY2012, spending as a percentage of GDP would be at the same level as in FY2001. CBO projections show President's spending levels lower than current-law baseline projections in FY2011 and later years. The alternative CBO estimate includes assumptions that increase outlays above baseline projections, leading to a higher deficit and federal debt. This estimate factors in higher net interest payments and changes in receipts, mainly reflecting increased net interest payments. Federal spending is classified by superfunction, function, and subfunction of government, with outlay effects mainly reflecting higher net interest payments. Functional breakdowns of federal spending direct resources towards specific goals, with the National Defense function including spending by parts of the Department of Energy. Some outlays, like Coast Guard patrols in major ports, do not neatly fit into subfunctions. Figure 3 shows FY2008 outlays by function as estimated by the Administration. National defense accounts for the largest share of federal spending in FY2008, followed by Social Security and Medicare. Federal receipts have seen rapid growth in recent years, influenced by economic conditions. Receipts as a percentage of GDP increased from FY2004 to FY2007. Federal receipts have increased as a percentage of GDP since FY2004, reaching 18.8% in FY2007. Slower economic growth is expected to impact federal receipts, especially corporate tax and capital gains receipts. The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 will temporarily reduce federal revenues' share of GDP. Both CBO and OMB predict a drop in federal revenues as a share of GDP in FY2008, followed by a gradual increase. The President's proposals aim to extend and make permanent expiring tax cuts, leading to a 36% increase in nominal receipts over FY2008 in the next five years. The Administration's economic stimulus proposals will increase federal receipts to 17.6% of GDP in FY2008, projected to rise to 18.8% in FY2013. Corporate income taxes are expected to decline slowly to 2.1% of GDP by FY2013. Social insurance receipts will remain stable at 6.4% of GDP through FY2013. Individual income taxes are projected to rise to 9.4% of GDP in FY2013. Making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent would reduce cumulative receipts by $635 billion between FY2009 and FY2013 and by $2,076 billion between FY2008 and FY2017. The budget proposes revenue reductions of $228 billion in the first 5 years and $233 billion over 10 years. A one-year fix to limit AMT expansion in 2008 is estimated to cost $46.7 billion. Without further action, the AMT will affect more middle-class taxpayers. CBO estimates indexing AMT thresholds for inflation would cost $72.4 billion annually over 10 years, plus $18.9 billion in debt financing costs. The President's budget aims to limit AMT's reach. The President's budget aims to limit the growing reach of the AMT, but omits estimates of the five-year cost of such a fix. This omission increases federal receipts substantially above what they would be with an AMT fix. Total receipts in the budget are expected to remain near their 40-year average of 18.3% of GDP. CBO's baseline revenue estimates are larger, rising to 20.0% of GDP in FY2012. CBO's preliminary analysis projected slightly lower revenues in FY2008 due to recent fiscal stimulus legislation. CBO baseline revenue estimates for the Administration's budget were close to OMB projections. Revenue projections changed due to the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 and changing economic conditions. CBO projects receipts to rise after the expiration of tax cuts, reaching 20.0% of GDP in FY2012. Alternative revenue estimates consider extensions of tax cuts and AMT reform, which could lead to greater revenue losses. The CBO estimates that alternative revenue policies, such as extending tax cuts and AMT reform, would result in slower growth in receipts compared to the current-law baseline. Permanently extending tax cuts and indexing the AMT for inflation would increase the future deficit by $692 billion and $313 billion respectively over a five-year period. The costs of these policies interact in significant ways, with the costs of tax cuts being larger if the AMT does not cover as many households. The CBO projects that alternative revenue policies, like extending tax cuts and AMT reform, would slow down receipt growth compared to the current-law baseline. Revenue projections for FY2008 show higher revenues before the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 passage. CBO estimates for FY2011 and beyond are higher than the President's budget projections. The CBO projects that federal receipts will rise to 20.3% of GDP in FY2018, higher than future revenue projections in the President's budget. Trends in federal revenue sources show fluctuations due to economic conditions and legislative changes. Deficits occur when federal spending exceeds receipts, with individual income taxes being the largest revenue source. The federal government can enact policies that lead to deficits or surpluses, affecting government debt and interest payments. Surpluses reduce debt and interest payments, while deficits increase them. Economists suggest running surpluses during economic growth and deficits during economic downturns to stabilize fluctuations. The last surplus was in FY2001, but projections show increasing deficits post FY2020 due to rising outlays and health care spending. The FY2007 total deficit was $162 billion, below the Administration's estimate in the FY2008 budget. The FY2008 deficit was projected at $410 billion with a small surplus of $29 billion in FY2013. Surpluses were expected in FY2010 due to no policy changes, earlier than the budget's surplus projection. The increase in deficits in FY2008 and FY2009 was due to fiscal stimulus measures, higher military spending, and legislative changes. The Administration aims to reduce deficits by limiting discretionary spending growth and slowing entitlement spending. The President's proposals may increase spending or reduce receipts, requiring larger spending reductions in other areas of the budget. The Administration opposes using tax increases to reduce the deficit. If war costs remain high, deficit reduction efforts will face additional challenges. CBO's baseline projections assume optimistic assumptions for revenue and outlay growth. The CBO's baseline projections assume that discretionary spending will grow at the rate of inflation, while mandatory spending will increase with eligible populations and cost-of-living adjustments. Alternative assumptions show a more pessimistic fiscal outlook than the shrinking deficits and future surpluses indicated by current-law baseline projections. Revised projections in March 2008 incorporated costs of the Economic Stimulus Act, showing a deficit of $357 billion in FY2008, a surplus in FY2013, and a larger surplus in FY2018. The federal deficit was projected to decrease after FY2010, both in dollar terms and as a percentage of GDP, through FY2018. The CBO projected deficits for FY2008 and FY2009, with estimates rising in September 2008. If Congress passes an AMT \"patch,\" deficits would increase further. The projections did not include potential costs from the deprivatization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The total federal deficit includes off-budget and on-budget deficits or surpluses. Social Security surpluses have reduced the total deficit since FY1985. Projections show no on-budget surplus in the next 5 or 10 years. The FY2007 on-budget deficit was $344 billion. OMB, CBO, and GAO agree that current federal fiscal policies are unsustainable due to the aging population and rising healthcare costs. The rising cost of healthcare, particularly for programs like Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid, is causing federal deficits to increase. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) warns that without significant changes, the federal budget is on an unsustainable path. Maintaining current spending levels would require drastic cuts in all areas except for these key programs. By 2030, spending on Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid alone is projected to reach 15% of GDP, necessitating major budget cuts elsewhere to keep overall spending at around 20% of GDP. The United States will face fiscal challenges due to the retirement of the baby-boom generation, leading to a growing demand for resources to finance mandatory programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Fiscal stability in the future may require reductions in spending growth and possibly higher taxes. The current structure of major entitlement programs will create an unsustainable burden on the budget by 2050. By 2050, spending on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid is projected to exceed 15% of GDP, more than twice the spending on all other programs combined. Estimates show different challenges for each program's long-term fiscal position, with Medicare presenting a larger fiscal gap than Social Security. Assumptions about productivity growth and interest rates greatly impact these long-term fiscal imbalances. The long-term outlook for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid is sensitive to interest rates, productivity growth, and medical inflation. Unexpected events like economic downturns can impact short-term budget projections. The retirement of the baby boom generation and rising healthcare costs will put pressure on the federal budget, potentially overwhelming other programs without policy changes. The growth of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid could strain the budget and limit the government's flexibility, potentially overwhelming the economy's resources."
