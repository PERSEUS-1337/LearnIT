The Congress finds that the United States faces challenges in long-term health care needs, with a lack of comprehensive support system. Unpaid caregiving activities have increased, and a majority of people over 85 require care. Medicare spending on home health care has decreased, putting a burden on State Medicaid programs. SEC. 224 allows for a deduction on eligible long-term care insurance premiums paid by individuals for coverage under a qualified long-term care insurance contract. The applicable percentage for the deduction is determined based on a table provided.

The amendment removes subsection (c) from Section 106 of the Internal Revenue Code, allowing deductions for premiums on qualified long-term care insurance contracts. A new credit for taxpayers with long-term care needs is introduced in Section 25C. Effective dates for these changes vary, with most applying after December 31, 2004. The new Section 25C introduces a credit for taxpayers with long-term care needs, allowing a credit against the tax imposed for the taxable year based on the number of applicable individuals and the applicable credit amount determined by a table. The applicable credit amount for taxable years starting in 2005 ranges from $1,000 to $3,000. The credit is reduced by $100 for each $1,000 of modified adjusted gross income exceeding the threshold amount. Adjusted gross income is defined as adjusted gross income increased by any amount excluded from gross income under specific sections. The threshold amount is $150,000 for joint returns and $75,000 for other cases. Dollar amounts are indexed for taxable years after 2005 based on medical care cost adjustments. The term 'applicable individual' is defined as someone certified by a physician as needing long-term care for at least 180 consecutive days. If any increase in care costs is not a multiple of $50, it will be rounded down to the nearest multiple of $50. An applicable individual must require long-term care for at least 180 consecutive days within the taxable year. Individuals must meet specific age and inability criteria to qualify for long-term care needs certification by a physician. An applicable individual must require long-term care for at least 180 consecutive days within the taxable year.

They must be unable to engage in age-appropriate activities or perform at least 2 activities of daily living without substantial assistance. This includes eating, transferring, or mobility, and may also involve the need for specific durable medical equipment due to severe health issues. Taxpayers can be eligible caregivers for individuals they can claim a deduction for, including themselves, their spouse, or dependents needing specialized care. An individual may qualify for certain tax benefits if they meet specific criteria related to exemption amounts, standard deductions, and additional deductions. An individual may qualify for tax benefits if they meet residency requirements, including having their principal place of abode at the taxpayer's home and being a member of the taxpayer's household for over half the taxable year. If more than one individual is an eligible caregiver for the same person in a calendar year, the taxpayer can claim the credit if each caregiver (other than the taxpayer) declares in writing that they will not claim the credit for that person. If multiple individuals are eligible caregivers for the same person in a year, the taxpayer can claim the credit if each caregiver (except the taxpayer) agrees in writing not to claim it. If individuals fail to file a written declaration, the one with the highest income will be considered the eligible caregiver. For married individuals filing separately, the determination of the eligible caregiver follows the same rules. No credit allowed under this section without taxpayer including name, taxpayer identification number, and physician identification number of applicable individual on tax return. Credit not allowable for taxable year less than 12 months, except in case of taxpayer's death. Conforming amendments made to Internal Revenue Code. The text chunk discusses amendments to the Internal Revenue Code regarding the inclusion of a correct TIN or physician identification on a tax return for the credit for taxpayers with long-term care needs.
