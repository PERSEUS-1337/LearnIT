    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Black Canyon Conservation Act of 1993\". The Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Monument and adjacent Federal lands are significant for their resources, offering opportunities for ecological interpretation, recreation, and expanding the monument's purposes. The lower Gunnison Gorge lands have been recommended for wilderness designation. The Gunnison River was studied by the Bureau of Land Management in 1979 and found eligible for wild and scenic designation. The fishery in the Gunnison River flowing through the Gunnison Gorge is recognized as a \"Gold Medal Stream\" and \"Wild Trout Water.\" The creation of a national park, conservation area, and designation of the Gunnison River as a wild and scenic river is necessary to protect the Black Canyon and surrounding natural resources. The National Monument will be redesignated as a National Park. The Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Monument is redesignated as the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park to protect and promote the gorges formed by the Gunnison River. The national park will include the existing monument area, with funds and existing rights transferred accordingly. The Secretary of the Interior will administer the park in accordance with applicable laws. The Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park is established under the Acts of 1916 and 1935. The designation does not include a reservation of water rights beyond those specified in the Act. Establishment of the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Conservation Area under Section 4. The Gunnison Gorge National Conservation Area is established to protect the unique recreational, geological, ecological, and scenic resources in Colorado. It consists of approximately 64,139 acres and is intended for the benefit of future generations. The legal description will be provided by the Bureau of Land Management. The Secretary will file a legal description of the conservation area with relevant committees. The description will be managed by the Bureau of Land Management to protect resources in accordance with the Act. The conservation area will be managed to protect resources in accordance with the Act and other laws. Federal lands within the area are withdrawn from various activities under public land laws. Hunting, trapping, and fishing are permitted in the area following applicable laws and regulations. The conservation area designated by the Act prohibits hunting or trapping in certain zones for public safety, administration, or public enjoyment. Grazing of livestock in the area must comply with specific regulations. The designation does not reserve water rights beyond those described in the Act. The Act allows motorized vehicles in designated routes of the conservation area, with limits set by the Secretary for resource protection. Violators may face fines or imprisonment. SEC. 5. DESIGNATION OF WILDERNESS WITHIN THE CONSERVATION AREA. Within the conservation area, the Gunnison Gorge Wilderness of approximately 21,038 acres is designated as wilderness and part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. The Secretary will file a legal description of the wilderness area with the appropriate committees in Congress. The wilderness area designated by this Act will be administered by the Secretary in accordance with the Wilderness Act. Congress does not intend for buffer zones to be created around the wilderness area. Nonwilderness activities or uses visible or audible from within the wilderness area will not automatically be prohibited. The designated wilderness area will be administered according to the Wilderness Act. Non-wilderness activities within the area will not be automatically prohibited. The State of Colorado retains jurisdiction over wildlife and fish on public lands. Grazing of livestock in the conservation area will follow specific regulations. The Gunnison Gorge Wilderness designation does not reserve water rights beyond those described in the Act. SEC. 6. Designating the Gunnison River as a Wild and Scenic River, specifying the reach from the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Monument downstream to the North Fork confluence. Water development outside this reach is not considered adverse. No new water rights will be created. The Secretary must develop a comprehensive plan for the long-term protection and management of the conservation area within three years of this Act's enactment. The plan will outline appropriate uses and development consistent with the Act's purposes, incorporating decisions from previous management plans and wildlife habitat management plans. The Act defines \"public lands\" as per the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. Any non-Federal lands acquired after the Act's enactment will be managed within the conservation area. Federally owned lands within the area cannot be transferred out of Federal ownership. SEC. 8. APPROPRIATIONS. Such sums as necessary are authorized to carry out the Act's purposes."
