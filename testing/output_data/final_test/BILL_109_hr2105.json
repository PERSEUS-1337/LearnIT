    "content": "SECTION 1. USE OF SAFETY BELTS AND CHILD RESTRAINT SYSTEMS BY CHILDREN. In General, Subchapter I of chapter 1 of title 23, United States Code, is amended by adding a new section, Sec. 165, which defines child safety restraint laws and child safety seats for children under 16. Child safety seat is a specially designed seating system that meets Federal motor vehicle safety standards and is affixed to a passenger motor vehicle by a safety belt or universal attachment system. Motor vehicle is defined as a vehicle driven by mechanical power primarily for use on public streets, roads, and highways. Multipurpose passenger vehicle is a motor vehicle with specific characteristics. A multipurpose passenger vehicle is a motor vehicle designed to carry up to 10 individuals, constructed on a truck chassis or with special features for occasional off-road operation. Passenger car refers to a motor vehicle designed to carry up to 10 individuals, excluding multipurpose passenger vehicles, motorcycles, or trailers. Passenger motor vehicle includes passenger cars and multipurpose passenger vehicles. Safety belt is an occupant restraint system in open-body passenger motor vehicles. The text chunk discusses the requirements for occupant restraint systems in passenger motor vehicles to meet Federal motor vehicle safety standards. It also mentions the transfer of funds to states for implementing child and passenger protection education programs if they have not enacted a child safety restraint law by a certain date. The text chunk discusses the promotion of child and passenger safety through education programs on proper seating positions and the use of child restraint systems in motor vehicles. If a state has not enacted a child safety restraint law by specific dates in 2010 and 2011, funds will be transferred to implement these programs. If a state has not enacted a child safety restraint law, the Secretary will transfer a percentage of funds to be used for promoting child and passenger safety through education programs on proper seating positions and the use of child restraint systems in motor vehicles. The Federal share of project costs transferred under subsection (b) is 100 percent. The amount transferred may be derived from various apportionments of the State. If funds are transferred to a State under section 402, obligation authority will also be transferred for Federal-aid projects. The amount of obligation authority distributed to the State for Federal-aid highways and highway safety construction programs is determined by multiplying the funds transferred under section 402 by the ratio of the obligation authority distributed for the fiscal year to the total apportioned sums for Federal-aid highways. The obligation authority for Federal-aid highways and highway safety construction programs for the fiscal year is determined by multiplying funds transferred under section 402 by the ratio of obligation authority distributed for the fiscal year to total apportioned sums for Federal-aid highways. No limitation on obligations for highway safety programs under section 402 applies to funds transferred to a State under this section. Use of safety belts and child restraint systems by children."
