    "title": "AB 666",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 786 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended. Section 786 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to include provisions for the dismissal and sealing of records for minors who successfully complete probation or informal supervision programs. The court must order the dismissal of the petition, seal all related records, and specify a date for the destruction of sealed records. Agencies and officials must comply with the court's order to seal records and notify the court of their compliance. The minor and their counsel must also be notified of the court's actions. The court must notify the minor and their counsel of the dismissal and sealing of records, including the minor's right to nondisclosure of the arrest and proceedings. Upon the court's order of dismissal of the petition, all arrest and proceedings in the case are deemed not to have occurred. The individual can respond accordingly to inquiries about the arrest and proceedings from employers, educational institutions, or other entities. Satisfactory completion of supervision or probation is achieved if no new findings of wardship or convictions occur, and reasonable orders are followed. The period cannot be extended to delay dismissal of the petition and sealing of records. Unfulfilled restitution orders do not count as unsatisfactory completion. The court may seal records and dismiss petitions, including prior ones, if criteria are met. Offenses committed at age 14 or older listed in Section 707 cannot be sealed unless dismissed or reduced. An individual with an eligible record can request the court to seal it from public agencies for successful reentry. Sealed records can only be accessed by specific entities for limited purposes. The court can access information for verifying jurisdictional status of a ward or identifying previous court-ordered programs for a minor facing a new felony offense. This information is strictly used for determining eligibility for remedial programs and cannot be shared or used for imposing penalties. Upon subsequent adjudication of a minor with a sealed record, access to the record may be granted for the purpose of determining an appropriate juvenile court disposition for a felony offense. This access does not alter the court's order to dismiss the petition and seal the record in the prior case. Access to sealed records can be granted for evaluating a minor's fitness under juvenile court law, upon request by the person whose record is sealed. This access does not unseal the record or require notice to other agencies. The section allows for the enforcement of civil judgments for restitution even if a minor's records are sealed. Victims and collection programs can still enforce restitution orders after records are sealed. The Judicial Council will establish rules for standardized implementation by juvenile courts. If a minor successfully completes a program of supervision or probation, the court will dismiss the petition and seal all related records. Agencies and officials must comply with the court's order to seal and destroy records. The minor and their counsel will be notified of the court's actions. The court will notify the minor and their counsel of the dismissal of the petition and sealing of records, including the minor's right to nondisclosure. Upon the court's order of dismissal of the petition, all arrest and proceedings related to the case are considered not to have occurred. The individual can respond accordingly to inquiries from employers, educational institutions, or other entities regarding the arrest and proceedings. Satisfactory completion of supervision or probation is achieved if no new findings of wardship or convictions occur, and reasonable orders are followed. The period cannot be extended to delay dismissal of the petition and sealing of records. Unfulfilled restitution orders do not count as unsatisfactory completion. The court may seal records and dismiss petitions, including prior ones, if criteria are met. Offenses committed at age 14 or older listed in Section 707 cannot be sealed unless dismissed or reduced. An individual may request the court to seal a record held by a public agency other than law enforcement, probation, or Department of Justice. The court can grant the request if it will aid in the individual's reentry and rehabilitation. Access to sealed records is limited to specific entities for certain purposes. The court may access a ward's prior jurisdictional status for resuming jurisdiction. The probation department can access a minor's previous programs for felony offenses to determine eligibility for remedial services. Information obtained is confidential and used only for referral purposes, not for penalties or sanctions. Upon subsequent adjudication of a minor with a sealed record, access to the record may be granted for the purpose of determining an appropriate juvenile court disposition for a felony offense. This access does not reverse or modify the court's order to seal the record in the prior case. Access to sealed records can be granted for evaluating a minor's fitness under juvenile court law, upon motion by the prosecuting attorney. The person whose record is sealed can request access, and the probation department can access records for federal compliance purposes. Access to sealed records authorized by paragraph (1) does not unseal the record or require notice to other agencies. Courts can enforce civil judgments for restitution even if a minor's records are sealed. Victims and collection programs can still enforce restitution orders after sealing, and the juvenile court can access sealed records for enforcing civil judgments or restitution orders. The Department of Social Services can still monitor and evaluate federal programs under Title IV-B and Title IV-E. The Judicial Council will establish rules for juvenile courts to implement this section. Section 787 is added to the Welfare and Institutions Code for standardized implementation. Access to sealed records under Section 781 or 786 is allowed for data collection purposes by certain agencies, but personally identifying information cannot be released. Courts can authorize researchers to access sealed records for juvenile justice research. The court allows access to sealed records for research projects with confidentiality protection. Personally identifying information cannot be further released by researchers. The Legislature finds that in order to protect the privacy of children with sealed juvenile delinquency court records, related records held by law enforcement agencies and other public agencies should also be sealed or subject to sealing. Section 1.5 of the bill includes amendments to Section 786 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, contingent on the enactment of both this bill and Assembly Bill 989 by January 1, 2016. If the Commission on State Mandates determines that the act imposes state-mandated costs, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts will be provided according to the Government Code."
