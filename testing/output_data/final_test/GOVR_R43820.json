    "content": "California is facing severe water shortages due to a widespread drought. The Central Valley Project and State Water Project have had to reduce water deliveries to farmers and communities. Some areas are overdrafting local aquifers, and regulatory restrictions on water pumping from the Bay-Delta have led to supply cutbacks for water users. The ongoing drought in California has led to water supply cutbacks for CVP and SWP users, impacting various economic sectors and wildlife resources. Previous droughts in 2008-2010, 1987-1992, and 1976-1977 also caused severe water shortages. Legislation in the 113th Congress is addressing management of water systems in response to the current drought. Congress is facing the challenge of responding to increased water demands in 2015. In 2015, Congress is dealing with demands for increased water deliveries while considering environmental impacts and economic dependencies. Legislation like H.R. 5781 is being introduced to address California's water supply and drought issues, focusing on improving federal water delivery reliability and stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. The report analyzes H.R. 5781, the California Emergency Drought Relief Act of 2014, comparing it with previous bills. It discusses the impact of exceptional drought in California and the role of regulatory restrictions on water pumping. Some attribute the water shortage to man-made factors. Some refer to the California drought as \"Congress-made\" or \"man-made.\" Claims were made in 2009 and 2011 regarding water supply shortages and reduced water deliveries. Various factors, including operational constraints and water quality regulations, affect water deliveries for the Central Valley Project and State Water Project. The impacts of drought on water deliveries to contractors are exacerbated by water quality regulations, court orders, CVP allocations policies, and the state's water rights system. Differences in water rights priorities and allocation policies have led to unequal impacts on CVP and SWP water contractors during water shortages. Despite increased Delta exports, some CVP water contractors have faced significant allocation reductions. Legislation addressing the management of the CVP and SWP is controversial due to complex federal and state laws, water delivery contracts, and various agency policies. Achieving consensus on such legislation is challenging as changes can impact water availability and ecosystem health. H.R. 5781 raises questions about water supply sources, impacts on other users, and compliance with state water law. Proponents argue the bill addresses these concerns. H.R. 5781 aims to provide additional water supplies without changing environmental laws, allowing federal agencies flexibility to maximize water flows through the CVP and SWP. Opponents argue it would increase water outflows from the Bay-Delta for various uses, potentially harming water quality and altering protections for listed species under the ESA. The Obama Administration and Governor Brown's administration opposed H.R. 5781, citing concerns about conflicting mandates and potential environmental harm. The bill aims to increase water supplies without changing environmental laws, but opponents fear it could harm water quality and listed species under the ESA. H.R. 5781, along with other bills like H.R. 3964 and S. 2198, addresses water supply and management in California. It includes new provisions and subsections, aiming to maximize water supplies within existing regulations while protecting third parties from impacts. The Obama Administration and Governor Brown's administration opposed H.R. 5781 due to concerns about conflicting mandates and potential environmental harm. The House-passed bill H.R. 5781 aims to protect third parties from redirected impacts and involuntary water supply reductions. There have been limited hearings and debates on the bill, with uncertainties about the potential water gains and impacts on various interests. The full impact of the legislation will only be known once the Administration implements it. H.R. 5781, passed by the House, includes Title I for California Emergency Drought Relief, allowing increased water deliveries and pumping flexibility. Title II aims to protect third party water rights under state law. Title II of H.R. 5781 aims to protect California water rights priorities by adhering to state laws governing water rights and honoring senior water rights for the operation of the Central Valley Project. It includes specific California water code sections and addresses rights for senior water right holders in the Sacramento Valley. Additionally, it establishes a new water allocation schedule for agricultural water service contractors in the Sacramento River watershed. The sunset provision for H.R. 5781 is set for September 30, 2016, or the end of the California drought emergency declaration. Definitions for terms like CVP, Delta, State, SWP, salmonid biological opinion, and smelt biological opinion are provided in Section 101 of the bill. The table compares H.R. 5781 to earlier drought bills in the 113th Congress. The bill H.R. 5781 includes definitions for terms like CVP, Delta, State, SWP, salmonid biological opinion, and smelt biological opinion. It raises questions about potential conflicts between original and updated biological opinions and defines \"negative impact on the long-term survival\" as reducing the likelihood of a listed species' survival and recovery in the wild. The term \"species\" is defined in H.R. 5781 and raises questions about its implementation, particularly regarding the protection of critical habitat and species recovery. The definition does not mention critical habitat, which is crucial for species' long-term health. Questions arise about whether the term \"distribution\" in the definition adequately safeguards critical habitat or supports recovery efforts. The bill H.R. 5781 raises concerns about its impact on the implementation of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Some argue that it sets a new standard that could harm fish stocks, while others believe it still requires ESA compliance. Section 102(a) directs the Secretaries of Commerce and Interior to manage water supplies for the Central Valley Project (CVP) and State Water Project (SWP). The bill H.R. 5781 directs the provision of maximum water supplies possible for CVP agricultural, municipal, and industrial users, with priority given to existing water rights. It allows for additional water projects unless highly inefficient, and for emergency projects to be expedited. H.R. 5781 and S. 2198 give broad authority to approve water projects and operations to maximize water supplies for users, with limitations in place. The bills push agencies to prioritize water supply maximization, ensuring projects comply with laws and regulations and are implemented quickly. H.R. 5781 and S. 2198 authorize projects to maximize water supplies, with differences in approach. H.R. 5781 focuses on CVP and SWP operations, while S. 2198 does not specify sources for additional water supplies. H.R. 5781 and S. 2198 differ in their approach to authorizing projects to maximize water supplies. H.R. 5781 does not allow for \"highly inefficient\" projects, while S. 2198 grants the Secretary new authority to approve projects without congressional authorization. This could impact large water infrastructure projects like the Bay Delta Conservation Plan. Questions and issues may arise from these provisions in both bills. Section 102(a) of H.R. 5781 raises concerns about providing maximum water supplies to CVP and other contractors, with potential difficulties in determining compliance with laws and regulations. There are differing views on whether current actions are maximizing water quantities or not, leading to potential contentious issues in the future. Some advocates fear that maximizing water supplies under H.R. 5781 may lead to reduced reservoir levels and water shortages in the future, jeopardizing urban water supplies. Concerns exist about prioritizing water supplies for contractors over other considerations like water quality and habitat conservation. H.R. 5781 aims to maximize water supplies while ensuring compliance with laws and regulations. Section 102(b) outlines specific project-related actions in California, to be carried out in accordance with applicable laws. Section 102(b)(1) of H.R. 5781 directs the Secretary to keep the Delta Cross Channel Gates open as much as possible, timed for flood periods and water benefits. It aligns with SWRCB orders and uses salmon behavior data. S. 2198 also focuses on Delta Gates operations' impact on listed species, water quality, and supply. S. 2198 would assess data on water quality and supply, direct changes to CVP and SWP operations, and implement turbidity control strategies to protect delta smelt. It also mandates pump operation within specified ranges to safeguard listed species survival. The provision in Section 102(b)(3) of S. 2198 would require written justification for reducing water flows, limiting managers' discretion. It also mandates a 1:1 inflow-to-export ratio for increased San Joaquin River flows from water transactions, measured at Vernalis from April 1 to May 31 each year. H.R. 5781 addresses concerns about environmental effects of water transfers in the Delta by requiring a secretarial determination that the transfers comply with applicable laws, including the ESA. Unlike S. 2198, H.R. 5781 does not have a provision similar to Section 102(b)(3) but includes a directive for issuing necessary permits for temporary barriers or gates in Delta channels to improve water quantity. Section 102(b)(5)(A) of H.R. 5781 directs the Secretaries to complete all necessary NEPA and ESA requirements within 30 days of receiving a permit application for temporary barriers or operable gates in Delta channels to improve water quantity and quality. This provision aims to benefit species and protect in-Delta water quality without requiring formal Section 7 consultation under the ESA. Section 102(b)(5)(B) of H.R. 5781 allows for water transfer requests associated with fallowing to maximize water supplies for non-habitat uses, complying with federal law. The legislation aims to expedite water transfers, especially for listed species, by shortening NEPA and ESA requirements. It is unclear how much water may be available for export from the Delta under the expedited review process. Section 102(b)(6) permits North-of-Delta agricultural water service contractors with unused CVP water to receive this water through April 15 of the following year under certain conditions. S. 2198 and H.R. 3964 would direct rescheduled water supplies in the San Luis Reservoir to be held for use in the following year by water users, including refuges. The Secretaries are directed to meet Level 2 and Level 4 water supply needs of certain refuges through groundwater resources and water purchases. Multiple state and federally owned wildlife refuges in the Central Valley are currently served by surface water contract deliveries, wells, and water purchases. H.R. 5781 would redirect water to CVP contractors equal to that obtained for refuges from groundwater sources. Uncertainty exists regarding the impact on water supplies for other users and the suitability of groundwater quality for refuge management. Section 102(b)(8) directs the implementation of \"offsite upstream projects\" in coordination with state agencies. The provision in Section 102 of H.R. 5781 allows for projects to offset the effects of actions on ESA listed species, potentially including habitat restoration, water quality improvements, and flow adjustments. Funding for these projects is unclear, and federal agencies involved in approving projects under this bill must adhere to the provisions of Section 102. Upon request from California, expedited procedures can be used for final decisions related to these projects. The provision in H.R. 5781 allows expedited procedures for final decisions on federal projects in California related to water supply or emergency drought conditions. The Secretary of the Interior must convene a meeting with relevant federal agency heads to approve emergency water supply projects within 7 days of a resolution request. The Secretary of the Interior must convene a meeting within 7 days of a resolution request for final decision on water supply projects in California. A new \"temporary operational flexibility\" is authorized for 28 days after October 1 each water year, allowing certain high flow conditions on the Sacramento River triggering additional \"negative flows\" on the Old and Middle Rivers. The legislation allows for increased pumping by the CVP and SWP, directing flows that could lead to a daily average of -7,500 cfs over a 28-day period. This may result in additional water supplies for some contractors compared to current restrictions under ESA biological opinions for salmon and Delta smelt. Provisions are included to study and mitigate potential impacts, with a period of \"minimum duration\" at the start of each water year to lessen negative OMR flow and prevent smelt entrainment. Section 103 authorizes increased pumping by the CVP and SWP, allowing for a daily average of -7,500 cfs over a 28-day period. This may provide more water supplies for some contractors compared to current ESA restrictions. The Secretaries are required to meet the section's requirements during the temporary operational period without needing to justify their actions further. Section 103 authorizes increased pumping by the CVP and SWP, allowing for a daily average of -7,500 cfs over a 28-day period to provide more water supplies for some contractors. The Secretaries are required to meet the section's requirements during the temporary operational period without needing to justify their actions further. Additionally, the bill must be consistent with state law requirements like D-1641. Section 103(d)(2) allows for reduced OMR flows during sediment flush to benefit species and avoid smelt entrainment at pumps. Section 103(d)(3) ensures salmon biological opinion implementation from April 1 to May 31, except in emergencies. Section 103(d)(4) authorizes a monitoring program to identify negative impacts of temporary flexibility. Section 103(e) authorizes CVP and SWP operations with flows less negative than -7,500 cfs not counting towards the 28-day cumulative period. Section 103(f) directs the commissioner to use emergency ESA consultation procedures if needed to adjust BiOp criteria. Section 103(g) states that detailed support is not required beyond what is provided in this section for determinations by the Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce. The proposed temporary operational flexibility under Section 103 raises questions about additional water availability for CVP and SWP contractors, balancing with the Endangered Species Act, impact on species, and adherence to California state laws. Section 104 requires progress reports every 90 days after enactment. Section 105 of the legislation mandates updates on feasibility studies for water storage projects authorized under CALFED legislation, including timelines and environmental documents. Title II aims to protect California water rights priorities by directing adherence to state water laws. The title of the legislation aims to protect California water rights priorities and honor senior water rights for the operation of the Central Valley Project. It includes specific provisions related to water rights in the Sacramento Valley, which are more detailed than similar provisions in another bill. The specificity in this legislation may raise questions about what is not included in the water rights protection language. The legislation aims to protect California water rights priorities and honor senior water rights for the operation of the Central Valley Project. It includes provisions specifically protecting Friant water users and the American River Division. Section 201 addresses \"consistency determinations\" for the State Water Project (SWP) made by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, ensuring compliance with the California Endangered Species Act. The legislation directs the Secretary of the Interior to confer with DF&W on potential impacts to ESA/CESA consistency determinations for SWP operation. If DF&W imposes stricter requirements under CESA resulting in reduced water supply to SWP compared to BiOps, additional yield must be made available to offset losses. The legislation requires the Secretary of the Interior to consult with DF&W regarding potential impacts on ESA/CESA consistency determinations for SWP operation. If stricter requirements are imposed under CESA, reducing water supply to SWP compared to BiOps, additional yield must be provided to offset losses. The Coordinated Operations Act directs the Secretary to operate the CVP in line with state water quality standards for the Bay-Delta and in conjunction with the SWP. If the state revokes consistency, any reduction in water available to SWP compared to CVP must be offset. Section 202 of the legislation directs the Secretary of the Interior to adhere to California water rights laws, including honoring senior rights held by the United States for operation of the CVP. It provides more detail than S. 2198 regarding specific diversions protected and references specific sections of the California Water Code. Section 202(b) of the legislation ensures that any actions taken by the Secretaries must comply with California water rights laws, specifically protecting senior rights held by the United States for CVP operation. It also specifies that diversions from the Sacramento River or the San Joaquin River watersheds upstream of the Delta must not alter the water rights priorities established by California law. H.R. 5781 and H.R. 3964 both address protection of senior water rights holders and prioritize state water rights over impacts from ESA implementation. Section 202(c) ensures existing federal government obligations under ESA are not altered. Section 202(d) allows for meeting mandates through contracts with individuals and entities with water rights on the Sacramento River. Section 203(a) of the bill directs the Secretary of the Interior to ensure compliance with obligations imposed by the act, including consultation under the Endangered Species Act, through contracts with individuals and entities with water rights on the Sacramento River. The status of Sacramento River settlement contracts is currently being litigated. The language in Section 203(b) of the bill aims to prevent water supply reductions or fiscal impacts to water users from the Sacramento River watershed, the San Joaquin River watershed, or the State Water Project service area. It includes a savings clause for reductions in case of drought or other physical causes. Section 203(b) of the bill aims to protect public agencies and entities from incurring costs solely due to the Act, without addressing who should bear such costs or what type of costs would be involved. H.R. 3964 includes a similar provision to prevent involuntary costs on CVP contractors or any other entity. Section 203(c) ensures that the Act does not modify existing contract rights and obligations, including water allocations. Section 204 establishes new allocation criteria for CVP agricultural water service contractors in the Sacramento River Watershed. The bill includes provisions to protect public agencies and entities from incurring costs solely due to the Act. It also establishes new allocation criteria for CVP agricultural water service contractors in the Sacramento River Watershed, potentially affecting water rights holders and water supplies downstream. The proposed allocation schedule for CVP agricultural water service contractors in the Sacramento River Watershed may impact water storage levels, fish and wildlife, and future water supplies. Trinity River flows, although not directly connected to the Sacramento River watershed, could be affected by the allocation schedule. Section 204 includes limitations to protect water rights priorities, including those associated with Trinity flows. Section 204(a) of the schedule shall not modify M&I water shortage policy in water service contracts. Section 204(b) clarifies the Secretary's authority and exempts American River Division operations. Section 204(c) protects Friant Division contracts and mandates a rescheduling program for CVP Sacramento water service contractors. Section 301 addresses preemption of Reclamation law and the act's expiration. Section 301 of H.R. 5781 clarifies that existing Reclamation obligations under Reclamation law for operating the CVP must conform with state law, including water rights priorities. In contrast, H.R. 3964 would have preempted state law related to the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act. S. 2198's Section 7 declares that no state law in effect at the time of enactment, including water rights protections, will be preempted. Section 302 of the act specifies that it will expire on September 30, 2016, or when California's drought emergency declaration is lifted, giving the state control over the legislation's duration. The comparison of H.R. 5781 with H.R. 3964 and S. 2198 shows differences in provisions regarding the expiration of certain sections. H.R. 5781 serves as the base for comparison, with selected provisions inserted into the tables for analysis. If no comparable provision is found in H.R. 3964 and S. 2198, it is noted in the tables."
