    "content": "The Act titled \"Securing Care for Seniors Act of 2015\" makes improvements to the MA Risk Adjustment System. The Social Security Act is amended to include clauses for evaluating and revising the risk adjustment system to account for chronic conditions and improve accuracy, transparency, and regular updates. The Secretary will revise the system based on the number of chronic conditions for 2017 and periodically thereafter. The Secretary will evaluate the impact of including two years of data to compare risk adjustment models for determining risk scores under the system. Additionally, an evaluation on chronic kidney disease codes will be conducted. The Secretary will evaluate the impact of removing chronic kidney disease diagnosis codes in the risk adjustment model and analyze best practices of MA plans to slow disease progression. Additionally, the Secretary will assess the impact of including 10 percent of encounter data in payment computation for 2016. The Secretary will evaluate the use of encounter data in risk scores, analyze data accuracy, issue recommendations for improvement, and limit data usage unless results are made public. The Secretary will evaluate how data is weighted in risk scores, ensuring it reflects care coordination under MA plans. Evaluations will include an actuarial opinion from the Chief Actuary of CMS on the reasonableness of methods and conclusions. The Secretary will consult with stakeholders and complete evaluations and analyses for plan years starting after the enactment of this clause. The Secretary will make revisions to the risk adjustment system based on evaluations to better reflect the population served by the plan starting in 2017. The Secretary will submit periodic reports to Congress on revisions made to the risk adjustment system, including evaluations conducted every third year starting in 2017. Adjustments factors must align with national health policy goals. The Secretary ensures that changes to health status do not hinder Medicare Advantage organizations from activities aligned with national health policy goals, such as early detection, care coordination, health risk assessments, and chronic disease management. Public review and comment are required for adjustment factor changes effective from 2017 onwards. The Secretary must provide a 60-day review period and a 30-day public comment period before implementing changes to health status that may affect Medicare Advantage organizations' activities aligned with national health policy goals. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO MEDICARE ADVANTAGE RISK ADJUSTMENT. Congress believes that the Secretary of Health and Human Services should monitor and improve the Medicare Advantage risk adjustment model to accurately assess beneficiary risk, especially for those with complex chronic conditions. Additionally, the Secretary should ensure that plans caring for beneficiaries with significant healthcare needs receive adequate reimbursement to provide high-quality care and prevent costly complications and disease progression. Adjustments to the risk adjustment methodology should be made as needed based on data analysis. The Secretary of Health and Human Services should reconsider changes in the Medicare Advantage risk adjustment methodology finalized for 2016 and use the methodology finalized in 2015 for one additional year."
