The Congress finds that China's defense industry benefits from integration with its civilian economy and technology sector, with companies like Huawei, Datang, and Zhongxing maintaining close ties to the PLA. The United States China Commission raised national security concerns regarding China's telecom sector, highlighting the influence of the Chinese Communist Party on large Chinese companies. They emphasized the need to balance economic benefits with potential security risks of foreign investment in the U.S. telecom infrastructure. The United States China Commission raised concerns about foreign entities controlling components in the telecommunications industry, citing Chinese companies acquiring holdings in global telecom and technology firms. The extent of state control in the Chinese economy is challenging to measure, with some companies claiming to be private but influenced by the state. Notable examples include Huawei. General Michael Hayden and the FBI have raised concerns about Huawei, stating that the company shares intimate knowledge with the Chinese state, potentially giving them access to foreign telecommunications systems and U.S. business communications. Huawei's involvement in U.S. telecommunications networks is seen as a risk for national security. The FBI and General Michael Hayden have expressed concerns about Chinese Government-supported telecommunications equipment on U.S. networks, stating that it poses a threat to U.S. networks and business communications. China's cyber activity and intelligence services are seen as advanced persistent threats. China's cyber warfare strategy aims to control global communications network infrastructure.

The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control issued a subpoena to Huawei as part of a Federal investigation. Huawei received a subpoena as part of a Federal investigation into alleged trade restriction violations on Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria.
