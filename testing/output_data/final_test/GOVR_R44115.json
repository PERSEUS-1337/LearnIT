    "content": "The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) provides nutrition-rich foods, education, and referrals to low-income women, infants, and children up to five years old. Administered by USDA-FNS, WIC aims to improve health and prevent health problems during critical growth stages. In FY2016, around 7.7 million people participated in WIC monthly across various state agencies and tribal organizations. The WIC program, administered by USDA-FNS, serves low-income women, infants, and children up to five years old. Roughly half of all infants in the U.S. participate in WIC. This report provides an overview of the program, including administration, funding, eligibility, benefits, and cost containment policies. Congressional jurisdiction over WIC is typically exercised by the Senate Committee. Congressional jurisdiction over the Child Nutrition Act, including the WIC program, is typically handled by specific Senate and House committees. The most recent reauthorization of WIC and Child Nutrition Programs was in 2010 through the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. Reauthorization for WIC has not been completed in the current 115th Congress. The WIC program operates through a federal, state, and local partnership, with the USDA-FNS administering it at the federal level. Bills to reauthorize WIC are introduced in Congress, and the WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition Program is closely related to WIC. The USDA-FNS administers the WIC program at the federal level, providing cash grants for food and nutrition services to state agencies. States have flexibility in program operations, including food delivery and benefit redemption systems. States have discretion in choosing brands, types, and package sizes for WIC food packages within federal regulations. Local WIC agencies, typically state and county health departments, offer services through 1,900 agencies in 10,000 service sites. Federal government primarily funds WIC, with some states providing additional funding. Appropriations committees ensure enough funds for all eligible applicants. The WIC program relies on federal funding, primarily distributed by USDA-FNS to states based on allocation formulas. Adequate funding is crucial to serve all eligible participants, including pregnant women, infants, and children. Funds are typically available for two years and are allocated to maintain previous operating levels and caseloads. The WIC program relies on federal funding distributed by USDA-FNS to states based on allocation formulas. Funding is allocated to maintain previous operating levels and caseloads, with adjustments for inflation. Extra dollars are distributed to grantees receiving less than their \"fair share\" of funds. USDA-FNS may reallocate funding as needed. State-by-state allocation amounts can be found on USDA-FNS's website. WIC may carry over funds from the prior year and has a contingency fund for insufficient funds. Table 2 shows federal WIC obligations for three years. The bulk of WIC funding is provided as food grants and Nutrition Services and Administration (NSA) grants for states. Food grant funds cover retail grocery store payments, supplemental foods, and breast pumps. NSA grant funds cover certification costs, nutrition education, breastfeeding support, and administrative costs. Grantees can convert food funding to support NSA costs under federal guidelines. The WIC appropriation also includes federal funds for specified purposes like Management Information Systems and Breastfeeding Peer support. The WIC program receives federal funds for specific purposes such as Management Information Systems and Breastfeeding Peer Counselors. These funds are used for approved projects and activities, including cost containment measures like approved food lists and vendor selection based on competitive prices. Eligibility for WIC assistance involves federal and state requirements, including categorical, financial, and nutritional risk tests. Participants must be categorically eligible to receive benefits. In FY2016, WIC served women during pregnancy and up to six weeks post-delivery, breastfeeding women up to one year post-delivery, non-breastfeeding women up to six months postpartum, infants, and children up to age five. Approximately 24% of participants were women, 24% were infants, and 52% were children under age five. Applicants must meet specific income guidelines, with the maximum allowable gross family income set at 185% of the federal poverty level. Currently, all WIC state agencies set the income limit at the maximum of 185% of the federal poverty level. Applicants can qualify for WIC by showing income below this threshold or through participation in certain means-tested programs. Family income is considered, and state agencies can choose the income time frame for applicants. The WIC program offers two pathways for income eligibility: counting certain types of military income or qualifying through adjunctive eligibility based on participation in means-tested programs like SNAP, Medicaid, or TANF. Recent data shows that Medicaid is the most common source of adjunctive eligibility for WIC participants. In April 2014, 72.8% of WIC participants' income eligibility was determined through adjunctive eligibility. In 2014, 1.6% of WIC participants had incomes above 185% of the federal poverty level, with the majority (74.1%) at or below the poverty level. Applicants must be at nutritional risk to qualify for WIC benefits, with medically and diet-based risks recognized. The WIC program requires applicants to be at nutritional risk, with risks including health conditions like anemia, underweight, maternal age, and history of pregnancy complications. A medical and/or nutritional assessment by a professional authority is needed to determine eligibility. Participants must reside in the state where eligibility is determined and cannot be enrolled in multiple WIC clinics simultaneously. WIC state agencies may limit participation to U.S. citizens, nationals, and qualified aliens. Once certified eligible, participants receive tailored benefits and services. Participants in the WIC program must be recertified at the end of their certification period to continue receiving benefits. Certification periods vary by category, with pregnant women certified for the duration of their pregnancy and up to six weeks postpartum. Breastfeeding women are certified for six-month periods up to one year after delivery, while non-breastfeeding women are certified for up to six months after delivery. States have the option to certify infants through their first birthday and children for up to one-year periods. The WIC program offers certification options for infants up to one year old and children for up to one-year periods. Federal regulations mandate a priority system for managing waiting lists in case of limited funding. Funding constraints may lead to the creation of waiting lists by local agencies. The WIC program uses a priority system to manage waiting lists for applicants seeking benefits based on nutritional risk levels. Priority is given to those with medically based nutritional risks over diet-based risks, with higher priority for infants, pregnant women, and breastfeeding women. WIC provides grants to states for redeemable benefits like supplemental foods and services including nutrition education, breastfeeding support, and healthcare referrals. The WIC program provides grants to states for redeemable benefits like supplemental foods and services including nutrition education, breastfeeding support, and referrals to healthcare and social services. WIC participants receive vouchers/checks or an EBT card for specific supplemental foods tailored to their needs. Federal regulations and state policies determine the supplemental food package provided to participants. The WIC program provides grants to states for redeemable benefits like supplemental foods tailored to participant characteristics. State agencies create their eligible food lists within a framework, controlling costs and making grants go further. Participants receive specific foods and some may also get a cash value voucher for fruits and vegetables. The federal WIC program provides monthly dollar amounts for fruits and vegetables, with regulations periodically reviewed and updated since 2003. The Health and Medicine Division (HMD) of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) has been engaged by USDA-FNS to review and assess the WIC food package studies. An expert committee convened by HMD has produced three reports, with the third report expected to guide the next revision of the WIC food packages. Participants at WIC clinics are assigned to one of seven food packages by a \"competent professional authority\" based on medical and nutritional need, not household income. Food benefits are reassessed at each recertification or when a participant's status changes. The WIC program provides food package benefits to participants, with most states issuing benefits through paper checks/vouchers. However, 24 states have implemented an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) system. In addition to food benefits, WIC also offers nutrition education and support, including breastfeeding promotion and drug abuse education. States are required to ensure that nutrition education is available to all pregnant, postpartum, and breastfeeding participants. The WIC program provides nutrition education emphasizing the link between nutrition, physical activity, and health. It offers various education approaches like individual consultations and group counseling. WIC promotes breastfeeding and states must allocate funds for breastfeeding promotion. Breastfeeding promotion and support services, such as peer counselors and lactation consultants, have led to an increase in breastfeeding initiation among WIC infants. State and local WIC agencies also provide information on other health-related programs like Medicaid and SNAP. State agencies oversee the delivery of food benefits using vouchers or EBT cards. Currently, state agencies provide benefits through vouchers or EBT cards for redemption at authorized vendors. Most states use paper vouchers for WIC benefits, specifying approved foods that can be redeemed at vendors. Vendors send vouchers to states for reimbursement using food grant funds. WIC participants must redeem the entire group of approved foods in one transaction to avoid losing benefits. WIC's transition to electronic benefit transfer (EBT) by October 1, 2020 replaces vouchers with a card similar to a debit card. This allows for better tracking of benefits and individual or grouped redemption of food items. 24 state agencies have fully transitioned to WIC EBT as of March 2017. 4 Indian Tribal Organizations have fully transitioned to WIC EBT as of March 2017. The fruit and vegetable cash-value voucher is now referred to as a cash-value benefit. States control food costs by limiting participants' food-item selection to specific brands and economically priced package sizes. Average monthly food package costs ranged from $29 to $96 in FY2015, with states balancing cost containment and participant satisfaction. States control WIC food costs by limiting food-item selection to specific brands and package sizes. Manufacturers' rebates, especially for infant formula, help contain costs. Competitive bidding for infant formula has resulted in lower costs for states. Infant formula is the most expensive WIC food category, but rebates have reduced its costs significantly. The Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 1989 added the requirement for states to use cost containment systems for infant formula through a competitive bidding process. In a rebate contract, the state agency receives payments from the manufacturer based on the amount of infant formula purchased with WIC benefits, giving the manufacturer exclusive rights to sell formula to WIC participants. Some states bid separately for milk- and soy-based formulas. Infant formula rebates significantly reduce WIC program costs. Manufacturers offer discounts up to 98%, with some states receiving discounts of 95% or more. Competitive bidding for other foods is not required by law, but some states pursue rebate contracts for infant foods. According to March 2017 USDA-FNS data, eight WIC state agencies had rebate contracts for infant foods. WIC authorizes vendors, including supermarkets, convenience stores, and military commissaries, based on criteria like competitive pricing and minimum stocking requirements. State agencies are responsible for selecting and authorizing WIC vendors within federal regulations. WIC vendors must meet state criteria and undergo WIC training to enter into a vendor agreement with the state agency. WIC food benefits are provided as specific foods, posing challenges for program spending. States monitor vendors' pricing to contain costs, with federal law requiring the establishment of vendor peer groups and additional regulations for vendors with over 50% revenue from WIC transactions. These policies were added in the 2004 WIC law reauthorization. The 2004 WIC law reauthorization requires states to establish vendor peer groups based on factors like store size and location. Each group has competitive price criteria, with a Maximum Allowable Reimbursement Level (MARL) set for WIC transactions. Vendors with over half their revenue from WIC transactions have additional requirements and are known as \"WIC-only\" stores. The 2004 WIC law reauthorization established vendor peer groups based on store size and location, with competitive price criteria and a Maximum Allowable Reimbursement Level (MARL) for WIC transactions. Stores with over half their revenue from WIC transactions, known as \"WIC-only\" vendors, are subject to restrictions on incentives and reimbursements. Some states have imposed vendor moratoriums to address cost containment issues. Policymakers have shown interest in funding, eligible foods, and retail transactions within the WIC program. In light of budget laws' discretionary spending limits, congressional appropriators consider forecasted WIC need against other priorities. Policymakers may oversee the next update to WIC food package regulations and states' transitions to EBT. USDA revised the WIC food packages in 2009 to reflect updates in nutrition science, public health concerns, and cultural eating patterns. The USDA revised the WIC food packages in 2009 to align with nutrition science, public health concerns, and cultural eating patterns. The changes included a wider variety of foods, increased incentives for breastfeeding, and flexibility for accommodating cultural preferences. The last major revision before this was in the 1970s, and in 2003, the Institute of Medicine recommended significant changes to the food packages. The USDA revised the WIC food packages in 2009 to align with nutrition science, public health concerns, and cultural eating patterns. This included new optional food substitutions, a cash-value voucher for fruits and vegetables, and restrictions on white potatoes. The final rule was published in March 2014 after collecting over 7,500 comments on the interim rule. In 2015, legislative changes allowed the purchase of white potatoes in WIC food packages, overturning previous restrictions. This change was prompted by concerns raised by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) regarding starchy vegetable consumption and the widespread consumption of white potatoes. Congress enacted a law in December 2014 to include white potatoes in WIC food packages, prohibiting the exclusion of any vegetable without added sugar, salt, or fat. In response to legislative changes in 2015, white potatoes were allowed in WIC food packages, following concerns raised by the Institute of Medicine. The USDA conducted a review and issued policy guidance for states to implement the inclusion of white potatoes by July 1, 2015. HMD was engaged by USDA-FNS to review and assess the WIC food package studies. An expert committee produced three reports, with the final report expected to guide FNS's next revision of the WIC food packages. The first report addressed the inclusion of white potatoes, recommending their eligibility for purchase with the cash value voucher. The second report established a framework for evaluating the current WIC food packages, leading to the final report in the series. The final report by the HMD committee recommends changes to the current WIC food packages, including increasing cash value vouchers, whole grains, and seafood, while decreasing juice, milk, legumes, peanut butter, infant vegetables, fruits, and meats. Policy changes to promote partial breastfeeding are also suggested. The USDA has not published any rules to amend the WIC food package regulations based on scientific recommendations. The WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition Program (WIC-FMNP) provides grants to states for vouchers/coupons/EBT to purchase fresh produce at approved venues. Not all states participate in WIC-FMNP, with federal funds covering food costs and 70% of administrative costs. In FY2015, the WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition Program (WIC-FMNP) covered 1.7 million recipients, 17,900 farmers, 3,400 farmers' markets, and 2,900 roadside stands. Participants received an average benefit of $23, with total grant funding of approximately $20 million. FY2016 appropriations provided $18.5 million for WIC FMNP, which is included in the Commodity Assistance Program account."
