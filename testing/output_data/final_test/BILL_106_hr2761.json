    "content": "The Act aims to allow public secondary schools to hire a director of school safety, discipline, and student assistance to develop or enhance safety plans. Grants will be provided to designated agencies and State educational agencies for this purpose. To be eligible for grant awards under this Act, State educational agencies must submit applications to the Secretary. Local educational agencies need to submit applications to the State educational agency to receive subgrants. If a State educational agency does not apply for a grant, specially designated agencies can apply directly to the Secretary. An application for grant awards under this Act must include assurances that funds will be used to hire a director for school safety, supplementing state and local funds. The director will have authority to discipline students threatening safety and refer them to appropriate authorities. The applicant receiving funds under this Act must allocate no more than 1.5 percent for administrative expenses. They must also allow parents, students, faculty, and school administrators to provide input on the safety plan. Additionally, State educational agencies must evaluate the effectiveness of each public secondary school safety plan annually. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.
