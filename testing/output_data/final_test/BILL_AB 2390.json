    "title": "AB 2390",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 1179 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to release persons discharged from the Youth Authority Board or county probation department from penalties or disabilities related to their offenses, except for eligibility as a peace officer under certain conditions. A person may be appointed as a peace officer by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Division of Juvenile Justice if at least five years have passed since their honorable discharge with no misdemeanor or felony convictions, or if they were employed as a peace officer before January 1, 1983. Individuals under the jurisdiction of the department or county probation department cannot take the peace officer examination until honorably discharged by the Youth Authority Board. The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Division of Juvenile Justice or county probation department must certify the discharge of a person in writing upon final discharge or dismissal. The court will then dismiss the accusation and action pending against that person. Additionally, every person honorably discharged from the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Division of Juvenile Justice by the Youth Authority Board is subject to certain conditions. The Youth Authority Board or Board of Parole Hearings, Juvenile Division, or county probation department can release a person who has not been placed under their control during the period of supervision. Upon release from a state prison, individuals are relieved of penalties and disabilities from their committed offense. They can petition the court to set aside the guilty verdict, leading to dismissal of the accusation. This includes removal of any disqualifications for employment or occupational licenses. A person described by subdivision (a) may not be eligible for appointment as a peace officer if prohibited by Section 1029 of the Government Code. However, they can be appointed by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Division of Juvenile Justice if certain conditions are met. No person under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Youth Authority or county probation department can take an exam for a peace officer position with the Division of Juvenile Justice until honorably discharged. Convictions for certain offenses committed at 16 years or older are admissible in subsequent legal proceedings. The person, 16 or older, committed an offense listed in Section 707, tried as an adult, convicted, and committed to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The conviction can enhance punishment for future offenses. Discharged individuals from the Youth Authority Board are mentioned. Every person discharged from the Youth Authority Board, Board of Parole Hearings, Juvenile Division, or county probation department by the juvenile court must be informed in writing about the provisions of this section. \"Honorably discharged\" refers to those with a good record on parole or supervised release."
