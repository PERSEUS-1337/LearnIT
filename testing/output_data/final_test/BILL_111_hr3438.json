    "content": "The Act titled \"Access to Insurance for all Americans Act\" extends federal employee health insurance by amending Subpart G of title 5, United States Code. It includes a new chapter 89A for health insurance for non-federal employees, with defined terms and the Office of Personnel Management involved. The Office administers a health insurance program for non-Federal employees under chapter 89. It contracts with carriers to offer health benefits plans to eligible individuals. Eligibility for non-Federal employees is outlined in section 8924. Non-Federal employees can enroll in a health benefits plan under section 8924, except if they are already enrolled in a public health insurance program, chapter 89 plan, or are a member of the uniformed services. \"SEC. 8925. ALTERNATIVE CONDITIONS TO FEDERAL EMPLOYEE HEALTH BENEFITS PLANS.\" Rates and premiums for health benefits plans under this chapter may vary by geographic regions. No Government contribution is provided for individuals under this chapter. The Office ensures that individuals covered under this chapter are in a separate risk pool from those covered under chapter 89. Technical and Conforming Amendments include contract requirements and provisions for health benefits plans. The table of chapters for part III of title 5, United States Code, is amended to redesignate chapters 89A and 89B as chapters 89B and 89C, respectively, and insert a new chapter 89 after chapter 89. SEC. 3. DEDUCTION FOR PREMIUMS PAID BY FEHBP NON-EMPLOYEE ENROLLEES. Part VII of subchapter B of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new section 224 allowing deductions for premiums paid for FEHBP coverage by non-employee enrollees. In the case of an individual, a deduction is allowed for premiums paid during the taxable year for health insurance coverage for the taxpayer, spouse, and dependents under chapter 89A of title 5, United States Code. Special rules apply, including coordination with other deductions and the deduction not being allowed for self-employment tax purposes. The deduction allowed for premiums paid for health insurance coverage under chapter 89A of title 5, United States Code is not considered in determining an individual's net earnings from self-employment for tax purposes. Additionally, a deduction is allowed for FEHBP coverage premiums in computing adjusted gross income. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections in the tax code. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management will submit a plan to Congress for the extension of the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The plan will outline the implementation of amendments and include a schedule of actions. The amendments will apply to taxable years ending after the enactment date of the Act."
