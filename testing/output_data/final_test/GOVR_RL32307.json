The House and Senate approved a conference report on H.R. 4818 on November 20, which included appropriations for Energy and Water Development. The bill was signed into law on December 8 (P.L. 108-447). The Bush Administration's FY2005 budget request for Energy and Water Development Programs was $27.94 billion, compared to $27.26 billion for FY2004. The omnibus Consolidated Appropriations bill (H.R. 4818, P.L. 108-447) appropriates $28.488 billion, less an across-the-board rescission of 0.80%. Figures cited for funding in the omnibus bill do not reflect this reduction. The Energy and Water Development Appropriations for FY1998 to FY2005 show budget authority in billions of current dollars. The Administration's request for FY2005 focused on construction projects, with a decrease in funding for the Corps compared to FY2004. The Administration's request for FY2005 focused on construction projects, including priorities like the Florida Everglades. The omnibus bill increased funding to $4.71 billion before a rescission. The Department of the Interior programs requested $970 million, a decrease from FY2004. The House bill would have appropriated $1.021 billion, while the omnibus bill allocated $1.020 billion. The DOE programs in the bill had a request of $23.148 billion for FY2005, an increase from the previous year, with major activities in energy research, general science, environmental cleanup, and nuclear weapons programs. The FY2005 budget request for DOE programs included funding for fossil fuels, energy efficiency, and energy statistics. The House bill proposed $22.478 billion, while the omnibus bill allocated $23.003 billion with a rescission. Funding for independent agencies in Title IV was $232 million in the FY2005 request, $193 million in the House bill, and $292 million in the omnibus bill. The President's request for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers civil works program was $4.12 billion for FY2005. The FY2005 budget request for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers civil works program was $4.12 billion, a decrease of $460 million from the FY2004 appropriation. The budget justifications for FY2005 included an across-the-board rescission and additional funding from the House Appropriations Committee. The FY2005 budget request for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers civil works program was $4.12 billion, a decrease of $460 million from the FY2004 appropriation. The budget included unobligated balances for various projects, removal of funding for Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies account, and the President's request for construction projects in FY2005. The FY2005 budget request for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers civil works program was $4.12 billion, a decrease of $460 million from the FY2004 appropriation. The budget prioritized eight projects, including the New York and New Jersey Harbor Deepening project, restoration projects in the Florida Everglades, and projects in the Columbia River Basin. Three new projects with high economic and environmental return were funded, while funding for planning was limited to five new projects. Operation and maintenance funds were focused on projects supporting high traffic volume. The Corps' FY2005 budget prioritized projects supporting high traffic volume and announced a shift in funding responsibility for shoreline renourishment projects. The budget also excluded funds for non-traditional mission areas like wastewater treatment and irrigation, focusing instead on navigation, flood control, storm damage reduction, and ecosystem restoration. H.R. 4818 (P.L. 108-447) increases federal funding for navigation, flood control, storm damage reduction, and ecosystem restoration projects. It funds environmental infrastructure projects, beach renourishment activities, and controversial construction projects like the Dallas Floodway Extension and Yazoo Basin projects. The bill prohibits the Corps from making changes to shoreline protection policies without congressional authorization and does not fund new study or construction starts requested by the President. Congress provided more funds for the Continuing Authorities Programs than requested by the Administration. The conference report on H.R. 4818 (P.L. 108-447) includes authorization language and funding for various projects, such as the Upper Mississippi River-Illinois Waterway navigation and ecosystem restoration project. The bill provides $13.5 million for planning the navigation project and $17.5 million for the Environmental Management Program, less than the Administration's request. Funding for the Corps' civil works program has been a contentious issue, with final appropriations typically exceeding the Administration's requests. The FY2003 and FY2004 appropriations bills added funds above the Administration's request, with amounts $466 million (11%) and $370 million (9%) above the requested amounts. The FY2005 budget proposed a 10% cut from the enacted FY2004 appropriations, but H.R. 4818 (P.L.108-447) appropriates 14% more than the request. Concerns were raised by some Members of Congress that the Administration's request represented a reduction in each of the major Corps accounts during hearings in 2004. At hearings in 2004, Assistant Secretary of the Army Woodley discussed the Corps' use of a performance-based approach in budgeting. Some Members raised concerns about performance-based budgeting and OMB's role in delaying FY2004 funds for added projects. The Administration's FY2005 funding levels for navigation and beach renourishment faced criticism and support. The House and Senate Waterways Caucuses formed in May 2004, emphasizing the importance of waterways for trade and tourism. H.R. 4818 (P.L. 108-447) maintained FY2004 spending levels. H.R. 4818 (P.L. 108-447) maintained FY2004 spending levels for O&M, with some increases for specific projects like the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway and the Apalachicola, Chattahoochee, and Flint Rivers. The bill did not provide the requested $35 million reserve for emergency repairs but included reductions for Saving and Slippage to adjust for project delays or savings. The Administration proposes S&S rates for Corps accounts in the budget estimate, which Congress may modify during the appropriations process. Enacted S&S rates are generally applied to all projects in an account, with funds reprogrammed throughout the fiscal year based on project progress. Congress has provided guidance on fund reprogramming in the past, but there is no statutory language governing it. The conference report for H.R. 4818 (P.L. 108-447) outlines criteria for reprogramming of the construction account. Savings and slippage rates are specified, with proposed reforms for Corps processes and procedures discussed during the 108th Congress. Corps reform was not included in H.R. 4818 (P.L. 108-447). The conference report for H.R. 4818 (P.L. 108-447) does not include Corps reform provisions. The Army Corps of Engineers has an increasing role in environmental restoration programs, potentially affecting funding for other water resources activities. The Corps is heavily involved in the restoration of the Central and Southern Florida ecosystem. The Corps is heavily involved in planning, constructing, and operating facilities for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) authorized by the Water Resources Development Act of 2000. Funding for Everglades restoration comes from the Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill and Department of the Interior appropriations. The President's FY2005 request included $130 million for Corps construction projects in the region. The Everglades and South Florida ecosystem restoration project received $18.0 million and $27.0 million, respectively. The Central and Southern Florida project requested $85.6 million, with $67 million allocated for CERP. H.R. 4818 (P.L. 108-447) proposed $121.25 million for Everglades restoration, including $2.25 million for a Florida Keys Water Quality Improvement project. The Kissimmee River project would receive $18 million, while the Missouri River Management received attention in 2004. The provision to change a trigger for drought conservation measures on the Missouri River remained in S. 2804 for FY2005 appropriations. This measure would suspend navigational releases if reservoir storage falls below a certain level. H.R. 4818 (P.L. 108-447) does not include a similar provision. For more information on Missouri River management, refer to CRS Report RL32306 and CRS Issue Brief IB10120. The funding for Missouri River mitigation measures was the main issue in Energy and Water Development Appropriations. H.R. 4818 (P.L. 108-447) provided $19 million for fish and wildlife recovery, while the President's FY2005 budget requested $69 million for environmental measures to protect endangered species. The requested activities would cover habitat for the pallid sturgeon and shorebirds along the length of the Missouri River. The Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act of FY2004 allocated $18 million for mitigation measures along the Missouri River. The Corps reprogrammed $23 million in FY2004 funds for environmental measures related to the Missouri River Master Manual. The bill also provided funding for the Bureau of Reclamation and the Central Utah Project Completion Account. The President's FY2005 budget requested $48 million for the Central Utah Project Completion. The President requested $48.0 million for the Central Utah Project Completion Account for FY2005, an increase of $10.0 million from FY2004. The conference agreement also includes $48 million for the account. Budget justifications for FY2005 from the Bureau of Reclamation include various proposals and transfers of funds. The FY2005 budget request for the Bureau of Reclamation includes a request of $828.5 million for the Water and Related Resources Account, with a corresponding $956.3 million in Gross Current Authority. The request was later amended to account for a payment out of other government funds. The total budget authority for BOR in FY2005 is $922.3 million, which is $20.4 million less than the enacted amount for FY2004. The House bill (H.R. 4614) and the conference agreement include funding for the Bureau of Reclamation's Water and Related Resources Account, with the conference agreement allocating $859.5 million. This account covers various programs such as operations and maintenance, Dam Safety, Water and Energy Management, and Fish and Wildlife Management. The total current authority for BOR is $846.3 million, with a gross current authority of $973.2 million in the House bill. The Bureau of Reclamation requested $828.5 million for FY2005, $24.0 million less than enacted for FY2004. Initially, $34 million was requested for the Sumner Peck settlement, but it was later funded from another government account. BOR manages numerous dams and water diversion projects in 17 western states, primarily for irrigation purposes. The Bureau of Reclamation manages dams and water diversion projects in 17 western states, providing water to farmland and millions of people. They are the largest wholesale water supplier in the region and the second largest hydroelectric power producer in the nation. BOR facilities also offer flood control, recreation, and wildlife benefits, but their operations can be controversial due to impacts on sensitive species and conflicts among water users. Funding for the California Bay-Delta Restoration Account (CALFED) has been inconsistent since FY2000. The Administration requested $15 million for the CALFED program account for FY2005, but the House Committee on Appropriations recommended no funds be appropriated. However, the conference agreement provides $8.5 million for activities supporting the CALFED program, including $7.5 million for California Bay-Delta Restoration and $1.0 million for the Upper San Joaquin River Basin Storage investigation. Other activities receiving funding include Sites Reservoir planning and Shasta Dam enlargement. The CALFED program received $1.0 million for Sites Reservoir planning, $1.0 million for Shasta Dam enlargement evaluation, and $1.0 million for Los Vaqueros expansion planning. The reauthorization of the CALFED program in 2004 did not result in changes to appropriations language. Additionally, $43.2 million was requested for heightened safety and security efforts at BOR facilities in FY2005. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $43.2 million for site security in H.R. 4614, with funding for DOE's programs including renewable energy research, nuclear power, general science, environmental cleanup, and nuclear activities. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $43.2 million for site security in H.R. 4614, with funding for DOE programs in renewable energy, nuclear power, general science, environmental cleanup, and nuclear weapons programs. The Administration's FY2005 request for DOE programs in the Energy and Water Development bill was $23.148 billion, about $1.18 billion more than the amount appropriated for FY2004. The omnibus bill contains $23.003 billion for DOE programs. The FY2005 budget request aimed to promote breakthroughs in hydrogen fuel cells, develop advanced technologies for cellulosic biomass as an energy source, lower the cost of renewable energy systems, and curb greenhouse gas emissions. The request sought $374.8 million for renewables, including funds added to the Solar R&D account and a transfer of programs from Nuclear Energy to Other Defense Activities. DOE proposed to offset FY2005 appropriations with Nuclear Waste Fee collections for a net appropriation of zero. The FY2005 budget request aimed to promote breakthroughs in hydrogen fuel cells, develop advanced technologies for cellulosic biomass as an energy source, lower the cost of renewable energy systems, and curb greenhouse gas emissions. The request sought $374.8 million for renewables, including funds for Hydrogen, Program Direction, and a new National Climate Change Technology program. However, it would terminate Program Support, cut Biomass Utilization, and Concentrating Solar Power funding. Additionally, $90.9 million was requested for the Office of Electricity Transmission and Distribution, with a primary increase for High Temperature Superconductivity. The House approved $343.2 million for Renewable Energy in FY2005, which is $31.6 million less than the request. The major reduction is for Hydrogen, cutting support for hydrogen storage centers of excellence and DOE's proposed hydrogen education initiative. There is also a cut for the National Climate Change Technology Initiative and an increase for Concentrating Solar Power. The conference committee approved $389.1 million for Renewable Energy, including more funding for Biomass/Biofuels and Solar Energy. The conference committee approved $121.2 million for OETD in FY2005, which is $30.3 million more than the request. This includes increases for Biomass/Biofuels, Solar Energy, and Intergovernmental Program Support. Additionally, there is a $31.6 million increase for renewables, with more funding for hydrogen, Program Direction, and Solar Energy. There is a decrease in funding for Facilities and Infrastructure. The committee also approved $39.3 million more for OETD, with increases for R&D, Electricity Restructuring, and Program Direction. The conference report provides $513.3 million for research and development in nuclear energy, including advanced reactors and fuel cycle technology. This funding includes $124.3 million for managing the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), which is being transferred to the nuclear energy program. The House approved a funding increase of $51.2 million, totaling $463.8 million, to transform INEEL into the nation's leading center for nuclear power research. The DOE's nuclear research program has been criticized for providing wasteful subsidies to an industry opponents believe should be phased out. The Nuclear Power 2010 program aims to resolve barriers to deploying new nuclear power plants by 2010, with a budget of $50.0 million allocated. The program is expected to enable the industry to make a decision on deploying at least one new advanced nuclear power plant in the U.S. by 2005. The Nuclear Power 2010 program aims to facilitate the deployment of new nuclear power plants in the U.S. DOE is assisting utilities in seeking NRC approval for potential reactor sites. Industry consortia have applied for funding to design and license new nuclear plants. The House Appropriations Committee proposed cutting the program's budget in FY2005 due to concerns about spent nuclear fuel storage. The Administration should not issue new reactor licenses without a repository for spent nuclear fuel. The conference report includes $40.0 million for the Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Initiative, focusing on advanced reactors for deployment after 2010. The program is working on six advanced designs, some of which would use plutonium recovered from spent nuclear fuel. The Administration's National Energy Policy report supports plutonium recovery to reduce environmental impact of nuclear waste disposal and increase energy supplies. Opponents argue that separating plutonium poses environmental risks and undermines U.S. policy on nuclear weapons proliferation. The Generation IV program, related to the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative, received $68.0 million in funding to develop advanced, proliferation-resistant nuclear fuel cycle technologies. The DOE is exploring fuel cycle technologies to reduce the hazard of spent nuclear fuel and recover additional energy. This includes separating plutonium, uranium, and other radioactive materials for reuse in reactors or transmutation. The Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative, with a $9.0 million budget in FY2005, aims to use high-temperature nuclear reactors to produce hydrogen from water. The DOE is investing in nuclear-driven processes to produce hydrogen, which is only slightly more expensive than gasoline and results in less air pollution. The Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) is allocated $25.0 million for demonstrating hydrogen and electricity co-production. The Department aims to achieve hydrogen production and electricity generation by 2015 at the Idaho National Laboratory. Funding for the Nuclear Energy Research Initiative (NERI) remains unchanged, with projects to be pursued at the discretion of individuals. According to the budget justification, NERI projects will be pursued at the discretion of individual nuclear R&D programs. NERI received an appropriation of $11 million for FY2004. New funding was not requested for the Nuclear Energy Plant Optimization program (NEPO), which received $2.9 million in FY2004. The House Appropriations Committee agreed to provide no new funding for NERI and NEPO, but the conference report includes $2.5 million for each program. The DOE Office of Science conducts basic research in six program areas. The Department of Energy (DOE) is a major federal supporter of research, with a requested budget of $3.432 billion for Science in FY2005. The House bill provided $3.600 billion, and the conference agreement allocated $3.629 billion, representing a 3% increase from FY2004. The largest program, basic energy sciences, received $1.064 billion in funding, including $99 million for nanoscience construction. The FY2005 budget request for nanoscience included $99 million for constructing four Nanoscale Science Research Centers. The House bill allocated $1.077 billion for basic energy sciences, with an increase for nanoscience research. High-energy physics received $737 million in the FY2005 request, with a total of $742 million in the conference agreement. Collaboration between the Department of Energy and NASA on scientific spacecraft was supported. The conference agreement encouraged NASA to maintain schedules for three scientific spacecraft, with funding for biological and environmental research reduced by $140 million. The House bill provided $572 million, $75 million more than requested, but did not include $5 million for a new laboratory facility. The conference agreement allocated $587 million. The conference agreement allocated $587 million for universities, DOE laboratories, and others, with a 9% decrease from FY2004 mainly due to reduced funding for congressionally directed projects. It included $10 million for a new laboratory facility but criticized DOE's limited competition strategy. Funding for nuclear physics increased to $401 million, while fusion energy sciences received $264 million, a $2 million increase from FY2004. The FY2005 budget for fusion energy sciences was $264 million, with $7 million allocated for ITER preparations. The U.S. share for ITER construction is expected to be between $50 million to $100 million per year. The House bill provided $276 million for fusion energy sciences, $12 million more than the request. The House bill allocated $276 million for fusion energy sciences, $12 million above the request. The conference agreement also provided $276 million, with a 5% increase from FY2004. The smallest Science program, advanced scientific computing research, received $204 million in the FY2005 request, with the House bill providing $234 million. The $30 million increase recommended by the House was for supercomputing development. The conference agreement allocated $234 million for supercomputing development, a 15% increase from FY2004. The House language directed that no more than $25 million should be used for hardware. Both the House report and conference report discussed external regulation of laboratories, competition for new facilities, and facility operating time. They supported open competition for new research facilities and broader university participation. The House expressed strong support for external regulation of DOE Science laboratories. The House report commended the Office of Science for developing performance measures and receiving additional funding for facility operating time. Congress established the Stockpile Stewardship Program to preserve US nuclear weapons competencies, operated by the NNSA within the DOE. The Stockpile Stewardship Program, managed by the NNSA within the DOE, aims to maintain the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear stockpile. Activities are carried out at three laboratories and four production sites, with appropriations totaling $4,908.7 million for FY2001, $5,560.2 million for FY2002, and $5,961.3 million for FY2003. The program includes Directed Stockpile Work, Campaigns, and Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities. NNSA manages programs outside of Weapons Activities, including Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation and Naval Reactors. Table 8 shows funding for Weapons Activities. Source: U.S. Department of Energy. Office of Management, Budget, and Administration/CFO. FY 2005 Congressional Budget Request. Details may not add up due to rounding. Includes Secure Transportation. The FY2004 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill was passed by the House and Senate without amendments to the Weapons Activities funding. The conference report was printed on November 7, 2003. The FY2004 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act was signed into law on December 1, 2003 (P.L. 108-137). The FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act included an across-the-board rescission of 0.59 percent and was signed into law on January 23, 2004 (P.L. 108-199). The FY2005 request includes data from NNSA's Future Years Nuclear Security Program, projecting the budget through FY2009. Figures for the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator for future years are not available as they are in flux. The House Appropriations Committee approved the FY2005 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill, with no amendments to the Weapons Activities portion. The Senate did not report a bill to the full committee. The omnibus appropriations bill combined nine regular appropriations bills, with the Energy and Water Development bill being the most challenging to resolve. The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill faced challenges, particularly regarding funding for Yucca Mountain and nuclear weapons programs. The House and Senate had differing views on these issues, but a resolution was eventually reached to break the deadlock. The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill faced challenges regarding funding for Yucca Mountain and nuclear weapons programs. A resolution was reached by eliminating, reducing, or modifying several nuclear weapons programs. $800 million was freed up from the omnibus bill, with $577 million allocated for Yucca Mountain. Additional funding was provided for projects at Los Alamos National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories. $30.9 million was added for constructing a Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies at Kirtland AFB, NM. The FY2005 Directed Stockpile Work (DSW) program at Kirtland AFB, NM involves maintenance, refurbishment, and R&D on nuclear weapons in the stockpile. It supports life extension programs for four warheads and surveillance for nine warhead types. The FY2004 energy and water development conference report directed DOE and the Department of Defense to prepare a report on the stockpile plan through 2012. The FY2005 Directed Stockpile Work program at Kirtland AFB involves maintenance, refurbishment, and R&D on nuclear weapons in the stockpile. A classified report was delivered to Congress in June 2004 regarding adjustments to meet the requirements of the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty. The House Appropriations Committee recommended reducing DSW Life Extension Programs by $40.0 million, with the reduction taken against the life extension program for the W80 warhead. The omnibus bill provided $460.8 million for these programs. The omnibus bill allocated $460.8 million for various programs, including increasing funding for W76 to $236.4 million and reducing funding for W80 to $106.4 million. The House Appropriations Committee recommended reducing DSW Stockpile Systems by $40.0 million, with reductions to W80 and W87. Additionally, funds were allocated for the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP) and Advanced Concepts Initiative (ACI) studies. The Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP) is part of the Advanced Concepts Initiative (ACI) and received funding requests of $15.0 million for FY2003, $7.5 million for FY2004, and $27.6 million for FY2005. RNEP involves earth penetrators that burrow into the ground before detonating to destroy underground targets with less explosive yield. Supporters argue it is necessary to attack deeply buried targets, while critics fear it could lower the threshold for nuclear weapon use. The Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP) is a study examining feasibility and cost, with funding requests increasing significantly from FY2005 to FY2009. The plans include development engineering starting in FY2007 and production engineering in FY2009, assuming congressional authorization. The budget for the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP) program increased from FY2005 to FY2009, with funding allocated for development and production engineering. A placeholder was included in the budget to protect the option of proceeding with RNEP, allowing for prompt implementation without affecting other programs. No final decision has been made on the program's advancement. The Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP) program's budget increased from FY2005 to FY2009 for development and production engineering. No final decision has been made on whether to proceed with RNEP pending completion of a cost study. The total cost for the four-year study is estimated to be about $71 million. The cost study for the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP) beyond FY2006 is pending completion due to various reasons such as increased costs from additional project management requirements and better definition of study requirements. DOE requires increased surety for proposed weapon modifications. NNSA plans to enhance RNEP surety. The two Armed Services Committees recommended full funding for RNEP for FY2005. The House Appropriations Committee rejected the $27.6 million funding for RNEP for FY2005, viewing it as a diversion of resources from nuclear deterrent management. They directed NNSA to focus on maintaining the existing stockpile and eliminated funds for RNEP and ACI in the omnibus bill. Critics have also raised concerns about ACI. The omnibus bill eliminated funds for ACI, a controversial program aimed at developing a low-yield \"mini-nuke.\" Critics claimed it would make nuclear weapons more usable, while supporters argued it would help maintain weapons design expertise. The House provided no funds for ACI, prioritizing stockpile maintenance and countering WMD proliferation instead. The bill allocated funds for the Reliable Replacement Warhead program to improve existing weapons. The NNSA conducts campaigns to enhance the reliability and certifiability of existing weapons and components. These multi-year efforts provide specialized scientific knowledge and technical support for the nuclear weapons stockpile. The House Appropriations Committee commended NNSA for budgeting progress by weapons type but expressed concern about the accounting system not assigning campaign costs to specific warhead types. The NNSA conducts campaigns to enhance the reliability and certifiability of existing weapons and components. The Pit Manufacturing and Certification Campaign is a controversial effort involving the restoration of the U.S. ability to manufacture pits, which are crucial components of nuclear warheads. The United States has been unable to produce new nuclear warheads since suspending pit production in 1989. This campaign has five components for FY2005, including the W88 Pit. The Pit Manufacturing and Certification Campaign for FY2005 has five components: W88 Pit Manufacturing, W88 Pit Certification, Pit Manufacturing Capability, and Modern Pit Facility (MPF). The campaign aims to produce pits for the W88 warhead, certify their functionality without nuclear testing, develop manufacturing technologies for pits other than the W88, and establish a higher capacity for future pit production due to aging and potential defects. The Modern Pit Facility (MPF) is being planned to have a capacity of at least 125 pits per year, operational by FY2019 with a cost estimated at $2-4 billion. Critics question the need for the facility due to anticipated reductions in nuclear weapons and argue that the plutonium component of a pit deteriorates slowly. NNSA is conducting accelerated aging experiments to address these concerns. NNSA plans to conduct experiments at Nevada Test Site to support W88 pit certification, facing criticism for delays and cost overruns. Congressional committees express concerns about the schedule for certifying pits for the stockpile. The Committee expressed concerns about NNSA's funding requests and budget allocation for the W88 pit project. Despite receiving more funds than requested, the Committee had to reduce other budget items. The Administration sought a significant increase for the project in FY2004, but the House Appropriations Committee recommended substantial reductions, urging NNSA to control costs and reconsider plans for a Modern Pit Facility. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the amount requested for the campaign, but reduced funding for the Modern Pit Facility from $22.8 million to $10.8 million. The conferees agreed with the House Report that further decisions on the MPF should be postponed until the revised Stockpile plan is reviewed. The FY2005 request includes funding for W88 pit manufacturing and certification. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about proceeding with the Modern Pit Facility (MPF) until its need is validated. They will only consider a modern pit facility design after pit aging experiments are completed and future MPF requirements are determined. The committee favored accelerating efforts to expand capability at TA-55 in Los Alamos for pit manufacturing, adding $10.0 million to W88 pit manufacturing to accelerate this work. The omnibus bill allocated $10.0 million to W88 pit manufacturing to accelerate work, cut funding for MPF, and provided amounts for W88 pit certification and pit campaign support activities at Nevada Test Site. It focused on expanding pit production capability at TA-55 and reduced funding for W88 pit certification and pit manufacturing capability. Additionally, it decreased funding for MPF and specified that it cannot be used for selecting a construction site in fiscal year 2005. Other campaigns were also addressed in the omnibus bill. The omnibus bill addressed various campaigns, including the Primary Assessment Technologies Campaign seeking to certify safety without nuclear testing. The House reduced funding for this campaign but directed funding to maintain critical skills at the Nevada Test Site. The Nuclear Survivability Campaign was also reduced by $15.0 million. The House reduced the Nuclear Survivability Campaign by $15.0 million, leaving $9.5 million. The committee questioned the high level of funding for assessing weapons' ability during a nuclear exchange, calling it a waste of resources in the post-Cold War world. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) received $130.0 million for construction, with concerns raised about NNSA's commitment due to delays in ignition date. The committee directed no additional funds for NIF capabilities. The House reduced funding for the Advanced Simulation and Computing Campaign from $741.3 million to $666.3 million. The House Appropriations Committee aimed for transparency in NNSA progress. An amendment to transfer $30.0 million to renewable energy R&D was defeated. The omnibus bill provided $703.8 million for the program. Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities (RTBF) program received $1,021.7 million for infrastructure and operations at nuclear weapons complex sites. The RTBF program has six subprograms, with the largest being Operations of Facilities. Other subprograms include Program Readiness and Material Recycle and Recovery. Construction is a separate category, with an adjusted appropriation of $258.9 million for FY2004. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a reduction of $102.4 million from the FY2005 request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended adding $118.1 million to RTBF for FY2004, with increases allocated to Operations of Facilities, including various plant upgrades and construction projects. The conferees allocated funding for various facilities in FY2004, including $10.0 million for Y-12 Plant, $20.0 million for Kansas City Plant, $15.0 million for Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, $20.0 million for Los Alamos National Laboratory, and $8.0 million for Sandia National Laboratories. The total funding for RTBF was $1,664.2 million, with increases in Operations of Facilities, Special Projects, and a decrease in the Chemistry and Metallurgy Facility Replacement Project at Los Alamos. For FY2005, the House provided $1,652.5 million for RTBF, with a significant increase in Operations of Facilities. The House increased Operations of Facilities by $134.0 million, mainly for maintenance at Pantex Plant, Kansas City Plant, and Y-12 Plant. Program Readiness was reduced by $5.0 million, Construction increased to $260.3 million. The omnibus bill provided $1,670.4 for RTBF, with significant increases in Operations of Facilities and Highly Enriched Uranium Facility at Y-12 Plant. Weapons Activities include Secure Transportation Asset for safe transport of nuclear materials. The FY2004 adjusted appropriation for nuclear weapons transport was $113.5 million, with a request of $201.3 million for FY2005. Nuclear Weapons Incident Response had an adjusted appropriation of $89.2 million in FY2004, with a request of $99.2 million for FY2005. Facilities and Infrastructure Recapitalization Program focuses on maintenance and improvements for the nuclear weapons complex. The NNSA ensures facilities for programmatic workload activities are maintained. The FY2005 budget requests for Safeguards and Security is $316.2 million, and for Nuclear Testing and Test Readiness is $707.0 million. The Stockpile Stewardship Program aims to maintain weapons without nuclear testing, but there are concerns about reduced commitment. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Assistant Secretary of Defense J. D. Crouch discussed the U.S. stance on nuclear testing, emphasizing the importance of maintaining safe and reliable nuclear weapons without testing. The U.S. continues to oppose the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and adheres to a testing moratorium. Efforts are being made to reduce the readiness time for conducting a nuclear test from 24-36 months to 18 months. Studies funded by \"Enhanced Test Readiness\" aimed to reduce the time needed to conduct a nuclear test to 18 months. The Senate Armed Services Committee's bill for FY2004 national defense authorizations required an 18-month posture unless the Secretary of Energy determined otherwise. NNSA concluded in April 2003 that an 18-month posture was preferable, while funds in the \"Nevada Site Readiness\" account maintained a 24- to 36-month posture. No policy decision had been made on reducing the test readiness time. The Enhanced Test Readiness and Nevada Site Readiness accounts were kept separated due to no policy decision on reducing test time. The accounts were expected to merge into \"Test Readiness\" in FY2004, with appropriations of $15.0 million in FY2003 and $24.9 million for Test Readiness and $39.6 million for Nevada Site Readiness in FY2004. The House Appropriations Committee criticized the plan in its FY2004 report. The House Appropriations Committee sharply criticized the plan for enhanced test readiness in its FY2004 report and recommended eliminating FY2004 funds for it. The committee expressed concerns over the lack of budget analysis or program plan to evaluate the efficiency or effectiveness of the funding increase. They also noted the challenges in maintaining test readiness during a testing moratorium and questioned the decision to maintain an 18-month posture indefinitely. The Committee did not recognize the NNSA declaring a revised test readiness posture as a new requirement. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided the amount requested for Program Readiness, without mentioning nuclear test readiness. The conferees allocated $24.9 million for test readiness, expecting the NNSA to focus on restoring a rigorous 24-month test readiness program before seeking additional funds for an 18-month posture. The House Appropriations Committee reduced the funds for test readiness in the Primary Assessment Technologies campaign from $81.5 million to $66.5 million to limit the initiative to achieving a 24-month test readiness posture instead of the more aggressive 18-month goal. The Committee opposes the 18-month posture and refers to the fiscal year 2004 Conference Report for guidance. The omnibus bill provided $74.0 million for the Primary Assessment Technologies campaign, halfway between the House figure and the request. DOE's nonproliferation and national security programs received $1.4354 billion in funding for FY2005, distributed differently among various programs. The omnibus bill appropriated $225.7 million for the Nonproliferation and Verification R&D program, $154 million for Nonproliferation and International Security programs, and $258.5 million for International Materials Protection, Control and Accounting (MPC&A). The final omnibus bill appropriated $322 million for the MPC&A program, including the Megaports initiative with a $15 million funding for FY2005. The Russian Transition Initiative, combining IPP and NCI, received $41 million in FY2005, the same as in FY2004, in the final omnibus bill. The final omnibus bill appropriated $624 million for the Fissile Materials Disposition program in FY2005, compared to $653 million in FY2004. The program aims to dispose of U.S. surplus weapons plutonium by converting it into fuel for commercial power reactors. The House bill initially cut the funding to $483 million, but the final omnibus bill allocated $624 million. The omnibus bill (P.L. 108-447) allocates $7.51 billion in FY2005 for DOE's Environmental Management Program, which manages radioactive and hazardous wastes at former nuclear weapons sites. This funding is $80 million more than the Administration's request and $440 million more than the FY2004 appropriation. The program represents one third of DOE's total budget and is the largest waste management and environmental cleanup program in the country. The DOE's Environmental Management Program is the largest waste management and environmental cleanup program in the federal government. It has a lengthy history with many longstanding issues, particularly related to cleaning up environmental contamination from nuclear weapons production during the Cold War. The program has received significant funding, with $7.51 billion allocated in FY2005, making up one third of DOE's total budget. The DOE's Environmental Management Program focuses on cleaning up radioactive and hazardous waste sites to ensure safety for future use. It was established in 1989 to consolidate efforts in environmental restoration. DOE is responsible for complying with federal environmental laws and regulations, and has signed compliance agreements with the EPA and states for cleanup activities at 114 sites in 31 states and one U.S. territory. The DOE reports that there are 114 sites in 31 states and one U.S. territory contaminated by nuclear weapons production and research activities. Cleanup at 76 sites was completed by FY2003 at a cost of $70 billion. Cleanup at the remaining sites is estimated to be finished by 2035, costing $142 billion. DOE has revised its estimates for cleanup time frames and costs as part of a reform initiative launched in FY2003. The initiative aims to accelerate cleanup at major sites by assessing the risk of exposure to determine cleanup remedies. This could lead to decisions to contain waste on site to prevent exposure, rather than removing it. Some concerns have been raised about the DOE's risk-based approach to cleanup, as it may result in leaving more contamination on site rather than removing it. There are worries that the contamination left in place could migrate unexpectedly over time, leading to unforeseen pathways of exposure. The DOE's cleanup reform initiative in FY2005 includes funding under five accounts for Site Acceleration Completion, Defense, Non-defense, and Environmental Services. The initiative aims to complete cleanup and close contaminated facilities at a faster pace, supporting accelerated cleanup and closure efforts. The DOE's cleanup reform initiative in FY2005 includes funding under five accounts for Site Acceleration Completion, Defense, Non-defense, and Environmental Services. Of the $7.51 billion appropriation in omnibus H.R. 4818 (P.L. 108-447), $6.10 billion would be allocated to the Defense Site Acceleration Completion Account, $938 million to the Defense Environmental Services Account, $152 million to the Non-defense Site Acceleration Completion Account, $291 million to the Non-defense Environmental Services Account, and $499 million to the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund. The Environmental Management Program in FY2005 would receive $499 million out of a total appropriation of $7.98 billion, offset by a $463 million federal contribution to the Uranium fund. The most controversial issue was the \"High-level Waste Proposal\" to allocate $350 million for speeding up the closure of tanks storing radioactive and chemical wastes at various sites. The Department of Energy (DOE) has proposed to speed up the closure of tanks storing high-level radioactive and chemical wastes at sites like Hanford by classifying some waste as \"incidental to reprocessing\" and disposing of it as low-level waste. This proposal has faced opposition from Members of Congress, states, environmental organizations, and communities. Some Members of Congress, states, environmental organizations, and communities opposed DOE's proposal to leave tank wastes in place due to safety concerns. Others argued that removing all residues would create new hazardous waste. DOE has grouted high-level radioactive wastes in two tanks at the Savannah River site, facing legal challenges from NRDC. In 2003, the U.S. District Court ruled that DOE cannot classify tank wastes as anything other than high-level radioactive waste. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed a district court ruling in 2004, stating that DOE's challenge to Order 435.1 was not \"ripe\" for review. The court found that there was no present conflict with the NWPA as DOE had not yet applied Order 435.1 to a specific situation. This decision allowed DOE to continue activities under Order 435.1, with the possibility of legal action if violations of the law were believed to occur. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed a district court ruling in 2004, allowing DOE to continue activities under Order 435.1. The Secretary of Energy sought legislation to classify tank wastes as incidental to reprocessing, exempting them from disposal requirements. DOE may grout some tank wastes at Savannah River and the INEEL under P.L. 108-375, but not at Hanford where most leaking tanks are located. State regulatory agencies would need to approve tank closures. DOE may pursue grouting of tanks at Hanford under Order 435.1, but could face legal challenges. H.R. 4818 (P.L. 108-447) would provide $292 million for high-level waste projects, with $163 million for Savannah River, $97 million for INEEL, and $32 million for Hanford. Legal authority for grouting at Hanford is uncertain. The appropriation for Hanford would provide legal authority for grouting tank wastes at the site, despite uncertainties in waste disposal authority. Congress can validate unauthorized actions through appropriations acts by clearly indicating intent to alter pre-existing law. The conference report allocated $32 million for Hanford. The conference report allocated $32 million for waste incidental to reprocessing activities at the Hanford site in FY2005, without mentioning the grouting of tank wastes. Concerns have been raised in Congress about DOE's ability to accelerate cleanup and lower costs at former defense nuclear weapons complex sites. The committee raised concerns about DOE's delay in submitting a report to Congress on necessary statutory changes for accelerated cleanup. $78 million was appropriated for DOE's Office of Legacy Management in the conference agreement on H.R. 4818, with $47 million for defense sites and $31 million for non-defense sites. The office's primary function is to assess long-term stewardship needs post-cleanup. The Office of Legacy Management assesses long-term stewardship needs post-cleanup for DOE. Controversy arose over the Bush Administration's budget request for the civilian nuclear waste disposal program, with a proposed budget increase offset by revenue from nuclear waste fees. The controversy over the Bush Administration's budget request for the civilian nuclear waste disposal program led to a decision by the Senate Appropriations Committee's Energy and Water Development Subcommittee to provide $131 million in funding. Ultimately, a compromise was reached to allocate $577.0 million to the DOE waste program, maintaining the FY2004 funding level. The proposed increase was intended for the Yucca Mountain repository and a national waste transportation program. DOE argues that $1.3 billion per year is needed between FY2005 and FY2010 to meet the 2010 target date for nuclear waste shipments. The Bush Administration's budget request for the civilian nuclear waste disposal program faced controversy, leading to a compromise of $577.0 million in funding for FY2005. The target date for shipping nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain was dependent on DOE's submission of a repository license application, which was delayed until 2005. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 designates Yucca Mountain as the sole candidate site for a national geologic repository. The Yucca Mountain project was authorized to proceed to the licensing phase in July 2000. Funding for FY2005 comes from the Nuclear Waste Fund and general revenues. The House Appropriations Committee criticized the Administration for requesting a low appropriation and assuming Congress would enact a waste-fee offset proposal. The House panel criticized the Administration for making unwise budget calculations and assuming reclassification legislation would be enacted. The funding cutback for the nuclear waste program could lead to layoffs, delays in the repository license application, and opening the repository. The Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality approved a bill to enact the Administration's nuclear waste fee reclassification proposal. The Senate has not taken action on the nuclear waste fee reclassification proposal, which limits the use of waste fees for the repository program for the next five years. The 2010 target for opening a permanent repository is 12 years later than the Nuclear Waste Policy Act deadline of January 31, 1998. Utilities have won court decisions against the DOE for failing to meet the disposal deadline, with potential damages reaching $600 million if spent fuel is not taken before 2015. Further delays in the Yucca Mountain program are expected. Further delays in the Yucca Mountain program could result from a court decision in July 2004 that overturned a key aspect of the EPA's regulations for the repository. The DOE's Power Marketing Administrations were developed in the 1930s from the construction of dams and water projects for conservation and management purposes. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) were established in the 1930s from the construction of dams for water resources. They market excess power to electric utilities and federal agencies at low rates. PMAs do not own generating facilities but own transmission facilities. The 104th Congress debated the sale of PMAs in 1995. The 104th Congress debated the sale of PMAs in 1995, authorizing the divestiture of one PMA. Congress enacted funding levels for FY2004 and FY2005, with slight changes for the PMAs. BPA does not receive annual appropriations but funds activities through borrowing authority, which was increased in FY2003. BPA is not requesting additional borrowing authority in FY2005. BPA plans to use $487 million of its borrowing authority in FY2004 for various programs. Independent agencies funded by the Energy and Water Development bill include the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). The NRC requested a budget of $670.3 million for FY2005. The NRC inspector general's office is allocated $7.5 million, 7% above FY2004 funding. NRC focuses on safety regulation, licensing of nuclear reactors and waste facilities, and oversight of nuclear materials users. The omnibus conference report and House-passed energy and water bill provide full funding. NRC plans to increase spending by 18% on licensing activities for new commercial reactors. Funding will support early site permits, pre-licensing reviews, and certification of new reactor designs. The House Appropriations Committee prohibits NRC from issuing licenses for new nuclear power plants in FY2005. The committee report emphasized the need for a disposal path for spent nuclear fuel before licensing new reactors. The NRC's FY2005 budget includes increased funding for homeland security activities, focusing on security measures for nuclear power plants. NRC plans to conduct security exercises and require plants to update their security plans to address heightened threats. The NRC's budget for high-level waste regulation would more than double from FY2004 to review an anticipated DOE license application for a national nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The $69.1 million request includes safety testing of full-scale casks for transporting nuclear waste by rail and truck. The nuclear power industry had concerns about the fee structure, leading to changes in the FY2001 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act. The Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act (P.L. 106-377) included an NRC proposal to phase down the agency's fee recovery to 90% over five years. This means that 90% of the FY2005 NRC budget will be offset by fees on licensees, with $69.1 million appropriated from the Nuclear Waste Fund for waste repository licensing. The total net appropriation for NRC in the conference report is $129.2 million.
