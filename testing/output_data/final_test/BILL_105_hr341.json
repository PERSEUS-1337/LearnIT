    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Genetic Privacy and Nondiscrimination Act of 1997\". Congress finds that genetic information is highly personal and should not be disclosed without consent. Improper disclosure can lead to harm such as stigmatization and discrimination in various areas. Current legal protections for genetic information are inadequate and need further attention. Laws are needed to protect genetic privacy and regulate the collection, storage, and use of DNA samples and genetic information. The purpose of the Act is to define individuals' rights regarding disclosed genetic information, specify when disclosure is allowed, and prevent discrimination based on genetic information by insurers or employers. The Act aims to protect genetic privacy, regulate DNA sample collection, and prevent discrimination based on genetic information by insurers or employers. The Act defines key terms related to genetic information, such as DNA, DNA sample, employer, genetic information, and genetic test. The Act defines key terms related to genetic information, such as DNA, RNA, mitochondrial DNA, chromosomes, and proteins for diagnosing genetic characteristics. Insurer refers to entities regulated under State insurance laws, including self-funded health plans and those under ERISA. Secretary refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. SEC. 4. REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF GENETIC INFORMATION. Prohibition on disclosure of genetic information without authorization, except in specific authorized circumstances. Disclosure of individual information may be allowed under specific circumstances such as criminal investigations, court orders, establishing paternity, or providing genetic information for medical diagnosis to blood relatives of a deceased person. The prohibitions of this section apply to any redisclosure of genetic information by any entity after it has been disclosed. SEC. 5 prohibits employers from discriminating based on genetic information of employees or prospective employees. It also outlines enforcement procedures. SEC. 6 imposes requirements on insurers. Insurers are prohibited from using genetic information to affect health insurance decisions. Genetic tests cannot be used as inducements for insurance purchase. If a genetic test is requested for insurance purposes, the results must be disclosed to the applicant with their written authorization. This regulation applies to insurance policies issued after the enactment of this Act. The Act prohibits insurers from using genetic information in health insurance decisions for policies issued before or after the enactment date. The National Bioethics Advisory Commission will provide recommendations on enhancing protection for DNA samples and genetic information, as well as standards for genetic information acquisition and retention in all settings."
