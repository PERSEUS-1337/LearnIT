    "content": "Biotechnology is the application of biological systems to industrial processes, with its origins traced back to the discovery of DNA in 1944. The sequencing of the human genome in 2000 marked a significant milestone in biotechnology research. The industry has led to the development of various technologies such as diagnostic kits, DNA fingerprinting, protein synthesis, enzyme engineering, and transgenic plants and animals. The completion of the human genome project is expected to bring even more advancements in the future. The biotechnology industry is characterized by a high number of small businesses and significant research and development expenses. In 1998, there were 1,283 biotechnology firms in the market, with the majority employing fewer than 135 people. The biotechnology industry is research-intensive, with high R&D expenses. Small firms rely on venture capital and patent law to secure funding for technology transfer and capital infusion. The report discusses the importance of patent law in the biotechnology industry, focusing on its impact on small entrepreneurial companies. It covers the industry profile, R&D funding needs, patent system overview, patentability requirements, and legislative issues related to biotechnology patenting. Patents are highlighted as crucial for small firms in acquiring capital. The U.S. biotechnology industry, starting with Genentech, Inc. in 1976, has grown significantly, doubling in size between 1993 and 1999. It generated $20 billion in revenues in 1999 and employed over 150,800 people directly. Despite a few large companies dominating the market, most biotech R&D firms are small startups heavily invested in developing a few products or technologies. Investors may be cautious due to uncertainties surrounding patent rights, impacting capital infusions into the industry. The U.S. biotechnology industry is a global leader in biomedical research, creating jobs and benefiting the economy. It is diverse, with applications in medicine, industry, agriculture, and more. Cloning is a recent biotechnology technique introduced. Cloning involves using DNA from one animal to create a genetically identical animal. This technique can be used to produce cloned organisms by fusing cells from different organisms. Gene therapy is another method where genes are inserted into cells to correct genetic errors or introduce new functions. In 1990, the National Institutes of Health performed gene therapy on a human patient by introducing a functioning ADA gene into blood cells. Thousands of patients received gene therapy in the 1990s, but a patient's death in 1999 led to investigations and suspensions of gene therapy programs due to unacceptable scientific conduct and monitoring. The agricultural biotechnology industry utilizes gene therapy to create Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) by inserting genes from one organism into another, resulting in new properties. Examples include insecticide-producing crops and vitamin A-enriched rice. In the United States, GMOs are prevalent in crops like corn, soybeans, cotton, and canola oil. The Human Genome Project aims to identify all human genes, with the US launching the project in 1990. The Human Genome Project, initiated in 1990 in the United States, aimed to identify all human genes. Private enterprise Celera Genomics also worked on sequencing the human genome. By June 2000, the initial stage of the project was completed, leading to a better understanding of human genes and their functions. This knowledge is crucial for identifying genes associated with diseases and developing new approaches for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. DNA fragments can be used in research as probes for specific genetic sequences. Genetic probes, engineered organisms like the \"Harvard mouse,\" and therapeutic genetic inventions using isolated genes or protein products have broad applications in research and disease treatment. For example, human growth hormone can treat hormonal deficiencies. Biotechnologies, such as human growth hormone and DNA probes, are used for efficient manufacture of insulin, genetic screening for hereditary diseases, and diagnostic assays for various medical conditions. Antibodies and protein fragments are also utilized in diagnostic tests. The biotechnology industry has made technical advances impacting various fields, but funding is crucial for products intended for human medical use. Companies typically need $250 million to $500 million to fund a product from research to profitability, with regulatory approval contributing to expenses. Despite potential future developments, attracting investors has been challenging recently. The biotechnology industry is facing challenges in attracting investors due to the preference for quick payouts in other sectors. Biotech IPOs generated only a small fraction of the funding compared to Internet and software companies. A strong patent portfolio is seen as essential for securing capital in biotech, allowing firms to generate income from intellectual property through licensing or sales. The significance of patent rights in the biotechnology industry was highlighted by recent stock market movements. Investors sold shares in biotechnology companies like Human Genome Sciences and Incyte Pharmaceuticals due to concerns about weakened or uncertain patent rights. This reaction was triggered by a joint statement from President Bill Clinton and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair urging free access to human genome data for scientists worldwide. The Clinton-Blair announcement on patent policy did not affect U.S. patent policy, leading to increased stock prices for biotechnology companies. Market capitalization of biotechnology and high-tech companies has been impacted by patent-related developments, with examples like CellPro Inc. and Visx experiencing stock value fluctuations. Rambus Inc. gained substantially from a patent infringement lawsuit settlement with Hitachi. The strength of intellectual property rights impacts investment decisions in high technology markets like biotechnology. The rate of patenting in biotechnology has significantly increased in recent years, with a rise in patents related to genetic materials. On July 13, 2000, the Director of the Patent and Trademark Office reported that approximately 20,000 patent applications for genetic materials were pending. 6,000 gene-related patents had already been issued, including 1,000 for human genes. The patenting process involves submitting an application to the PTO, where examiners assess if the invention meets standards like novelty and nonobviousness. The patentability requirements for biotechnology inventions include novelty, nonobviousness, patent eligibility, and utility. There is a debate on whether living inventions and genetic material should be patentable. The utility requirement is met if the invention is operable and provides a tangible benefit. The utility requirement for patentability in biotechnology can be a significant obstacle, as biotechnicians may not always have precise knowledge of how their synthesized compounds will be used practically. Once a patent is allowed, the patent holder gains exclusive rights for twenty years to the patented invention. The Patent Act grants exclusive rights to patent holders in the United States, allowing them to enforce these rights in federal court. Patent owners have the right to exclude others from using their invention, but not the right to make or use it themselves. Regulatory agencies like the FDA, EPA, and Department of Agriculture also play a role in overseeing biotechnological inventions. The Patent Act grants exclusive rights to patent holders in the United States, allowing them to enforce these rights in federal court. Patent owners have the right to exclude others from using their invention. The patent right applies to unauthorized experiments involving the patented invention, with no \"experimental use\" defense. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has ruled that mere experimentation with the patented invention can be considered infringement if it has the potential to harm the patent holder. Only use of the invention for \"amusement, idle curiosity, or philosophical inquiry\" may be exempt from infringement liability. The Patent Act governs patentability determinations based on specific criteria like novelty, nonobviousness, statutory subject matter, and utility. The PTO does not consider issues like licensing for access by researchers when making patent decisions. The debate over patenting living organisms raises ethical and policy concerns under section 101 of current patent law. The Patent Act of 1952, under section 101, allows patents for processes, machines, manufactures, or compositions of matter. Biotechnologies typically qualify as compositions of matter or processes due to their complex chemical nature. The courts have traditionally crafted exceptions to patentability, such as not allowing patents on preexisting substances found in the wild. For example, a new plant variety discovered in a remote location cannot be patented. The courts have established that significant artificial changes to a product of nature may make it patentable, allowing for patents on altered products of nature in biotechnology, such as genetic materials and proteins. For example, in Amgen, Inc. v. Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., a patent was granted for a purified and isolated DNA sequence encoding human erythropoietin. The Supreme Court decision in Diamond v. Chakrabarty established that genetically engineered microorganisms are patentable, allowing for patents on living inventions. The Court rejected the argument that genetic technology was unforeseen at the time of the patent statute's drafting in the 1950s. The Court disagreed with the PTO decision, stating that unanticipated inventions should still be protected under patent law. Concerns over genetic research were dismissed, with the Court noting that researchers would continue their work regardless of patentability. The PTO Board also ruled that artificial animal life forms are patentable, citing a case involving a polyploid Pacific oyster. Commissioner Donald Quigg issued a notice affirming that non-naturally occurring, non-human multicellular living organisms can be patented. The PTO issued patents for non-naturally occurring, non-human multicellular organisms like the Harvard mouse genetically engineered for cancer susceptibility. The Constitution prohibits exclusive property rights in human beings. Claims for non-plant multicellular organisms, including humans, should specify \"non-human\" to avoid rejection. Objections to biotechnology patents have been raised. Many objections have been raised to patenting biotechnological inventions, particularly concerning human genetic materials and genetically modified organisms. Critics argue that granting proprietary rights in these inventions is degrading and inappropriate, citing ethical, moral, and theological concerns. Some believe that patenting biotechnology devalues living beings and equates to ownership rights over sentient beings, akin to slavery. Others argue for a fundamental right to biological integrity, with activists like Jeremy Rifkin expressing worries about the reduction of genetic materials through patents. Jeremy Rifkin and Reverend Wesley Granberg-Michaelson raise concerns about patenting genetic materials, arguing that it reduces living beings to mere information and erodes reverence for life. They emphasize the responsibility to preserve the integrity of creation and its intrinsic values, highlighting the theological implications of viewing living beings as industrial products. The doctrine of trust in legal terms emphasizes the responsibility to preserve the integrity of creation and its intrinsic values. Concerns are raised about biotechnology patenting potentially leading to large multinational control over genetically modified animals and seeds, impacting traditional agricultural practices. This could result in farmers depending on others for seeds and reduce the number of farmers needed due to increased production efficiencies. Production efficiencies will reduce the number of farmers needed. Concerns over biotechnology patenting include worries about commercial development and legitimacy. President Clinton highlighted common concerns about genetic information during the human genome project. The potential misuse of genetic information and biotechnologies, such as genetically modified organisms and the Harvard mouse, raises concerns about privacy, discrimination, and animal suffering. Critics argue that patents on genetically modified organisms can lead to animal health issues and increased suffering. The use of biotechnology, such as genetically modified organisms like the Harvard mouse, raises concerns about disease, suffering, and genetic diversity. Critics warn of potential long-term consequences, including depletion of genetic stock and environmental hazards. The release of artificial entities may lead to unpredictable interactions with other organisms. Proponents of biotechnology patenting argue that patent rights allow exclusion of others from using claimed inventions, but not the right to market the technology. They believe that denying patents on biotechnologies may reduce research efforts but would not suppress biotechnology. Professor Robert P. Merges suggests that the patent system's goal is to promote science and arts, not to assess technology. Professor Merges believes that potential social consequences of biotechnologies are better addressed through regulatory regimes like the FDA reviewing health and environmental hazards. Measures such as establishing seed banks and protocols for privacy concerns are unrelated to patents. Courts have historically granted patents on living inventions, as seen in Louis Pasteur's 1873 patent on yeast. Microbiological processes have been used for centuries in various applications. Attorney James R. Chiapetta believes that denying patent protection for biotechnologies would not deter innovation but may lead inventors to keep their technologies as trade secrets. He explains that patents aim to enhance industrial efficiency by promoting innovative advances and notes that biotechnologies are not the only industry affecting traditional farming viability. Many factors are leading to fewer and larger farms in the United States, and biotechnology should not be singled out in patent law. Proponents argue that patenting plants and animals is not worrisome given current social norms. Scientific commentators dismiss the notion of species integrity as specious, citing similarities in genomes among mammalian species. Dr. Smithies observed natural inter-species genetic transfer through viral and microbial agents, indicating genetic plasticity in all species. Some experts argue that artificial genetic transfers do not violate genetic integrity norms, as traditional breeding programs can perpetuate genetic defects. Genetic engineering offers the potential to express desirable traits without selecting unwanted genetic traits. Some proponents argue that biotechnology can reduce animal suffering by genetically engineering transgenic chickens resistant to avian leukemia virus, leading to healthier birds and cost savings for the industry. They also believe that patent protection in biotechnology encourages innovation and product development, focusing on treating human diseases and alleviating human suffering as a primary moral imperative. The issue of biotechnology patenting is being debated, with a patent application filed for creating chimeras from human and animal embryo cells. The application has been rejected by the PTO on grounds of ineligible subject matter. The debate on the patentability of living inventions may be taken to the judicial system. The Patent Act requires patents to issue only to \"useful\" inventions, with utility defined as achieving a pragmatic result. Justice Story's instructions in Lowell v. Lewis and Bedford v. Hunt emphasize the importance of utility in US patent law, stating that inventions should not be frivolous or harmful to society. The word \"useful\" is contrasted with mischievous or immoral, with the focus on whether the invention is beneficial to society. The utility requirement in patent law focuses on the practical benefit of an invention, with historical cases invalidating patents for immoral or fraudulent inventions like gambling devices. The market, rather than patent law mechanisms, determines the value of an invention. The utility requirement in patent law focuses on the practical benefit of an invention, with historical cases invalidating patents for immoral or fraudulent inventions like gambling devices. Inventions designed to mislead consumers are similarly invalidated. The modern view is that as long as an invention can be put to a single lawful use, it possesses utility within the patent statute. An example is the case of Juicy Whip, Inc. v. Orange Bang, Inc., where a patent for a post-mix dispenser was invalidated for lack of utility because it deceived consumers. The Federal Circuit reversed a decision regarding the utility requirement in patent law, stating that the ability to alter a product to resemble another is a specific benefit that satisfies the statutory requirement. This decision clarified that the utility requirement does not involve issues of product safety or deceptive trade practices, which are handled by other agencies. The utility requirement in patent law is often important in biotechnology and chemistry, where inventors may create new compounds without knowing their specific utility at the time. There are incentives for biotechnicians to obtain patent protection on compounds of interest quickly, especially in fields like medical treatments and food. In biotechnology and chemistry, inventors seek patent protection on compounds of interest promptly, even without full understanding of their utility. The Supreme Court case Brenner v. Manson highlighted the challenge of meeting the utility requirement for patents, as seen in Manson's patent application for a known steroid compound with unclear utility. The Patent Office Board rejected Manson's application for a steroid compound due to lack of identified utility. However, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals reversed the decision, emphasizing that Manson's claimed process steps would produce the desired steroid. The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals reversed the rejection of Manson's application for a steroid compound, stating that the claimed process would produce the desired steroid. The Supreme Court, however, disagreed with the utility requirement being fulfilled solely by the absence of social undesirability. They imposed a requirement that an invention must show a specific benefit in its current form before being patentable. The Court was concerned about the broad proprietary interest that could result from claims like Manson's, stating that a patent should only be granted once the process has been developed to produce a useful product. The Court emphasized the importance of utility in patent applications, stating that a patent should only be granted when an invention shows a specific benefit in its current form. They cautioned against granting patents that could block scientific development without benefiting the public. The Federal Circuit reversed the PTO's rejection of an application for lack of utility, stating that an inventor does not need to wait for a disease to naturally occur before finding a cure. The PTO argued that there was no proof of actual treatment of the disease in live animals, but the Federal Circuit found that evidence of medical effects in standard experimental animals was sufficient for utility. This decision suggests a shift in the Federal Circuit's approach to patent utility requirements. The Federal Circuit's approach to the utility requirement for patents has shifted, as seen in cases like Brenner v. Manson and Brana. The PTO applies this requirement to biotechnology, where inventors often seek protection for biological compounds like cDNA and ESTs. These compounds are usually discovered before their functions are known due to the unpredictable nature of the field. The PTO has raised the bar for patent applicants regarding the utility requirement for genetic materials like cDNA and ESTs. The 1999 utility guidelines mandate applicants to explicitly identify a specific, substantial, and credible utility for their inventions. The Patent Office has increased the standards for genetic patent applications, requiring a clear and credible utility for inventions like cDNA and ESTs. Director Dickinson emphasized the importance of demonstrating a real-world use for genes to avoid rejection by the USPTO. The Patent Office now requires genetic patent applications to demonstrate a specific and substantial utility for inventions like cDNA and ESTs to avoid rejection. Specific utility is defined as being particular to the claimed subject matter, while substantial utility must define a real-world use without the need for further research. The new PTO Utility Guidelines have been well-received by key figures in the scientific community, including Dr. Harold Varmus, Dr. Francis Collins, and Dr. Craig Venter, who all support the emphasis on defining specific and substantial utility for genetic patents. The new PTO Utility Guidelines are raising the bar on genepatents, with compatibility with governing case law. Concerns have been raised about proprietary interests impeding research efforts. Professors Heller and Eisenberg have invoked the \"tragedy of\" in line with Brenner v. Manson. In Brenner v. Manson, Professors Heller and Eisenberg argue against patenting genetic materials by invoking the \"tragedy of the anticommons.\" This concept mirrors the tragedy of the commons, where multiple owners have the right to exclude others from a resource, leading to underuse due to transaction costs and cognitive biases. Professors Heller and Eisenberg warn that granting intellectual property rights to early research results in biomedical research could lead to a tragedy of the anticommons. They explain how patents on gene fragments can hinder innovation by creating overlapping patent claims that increase costs and slow down product development in the biomedical field. The use of reach-through license agreements in biomedical research can lead to an anticommons as upstream owners stack overlapping claims on downstream products, potentially hindering innovation and increasing costs. Professors Heller and Eisenberg argue that granting intellectual property rights to early research results could slow down product development in the biomedical field. Allowing patents only on final products could lead to industry concentration as independent researchers may have to join large companies. This could chill the market for preliminary genetic materials and diminish research. Research tools have a lively market in the biotechnology industry, with many enterprises interested in purchasing them. Some argue that research products do not present a special case and should not be subject to a more porous utility standard. Attorney Scott A. Chambers disputes the notion that these products are merely philosophical. Patented products and processes can have additional valuable uses beyond the original patent. For example, nitroglycerine was initially developed as an explosive but later found to be useful as a heart medication. Arguments similar to those made by Professors Heller and Eisenberg have been made in the past regarding the potential of inventions to serve as the basis for later developments. Patents in the biotechnology industry play a crucial role in facilitating capitalization for entrepreneurs and small firms, supporting technological advancement. Concerns about monopolization of basic compounds in polymer chemistry have not materialized, and similar issues are unlikely in biotechnology. Legal uncertainties surrounding biotechnology patents may impact their effectiveness. Legal uncertainties surrounding biotechnology patents may impact funding for research and development efforts. Concerns exist over patenting living inventions, genetic materials, and biotechnologies with unknown utilities. Patent reform legislation could address these concerns, focusing on patent eligibility and utility requirements. International agreements, such as NAFTA, also influence the patentability of living inventions. The NAFTA and TRIPS Agreement confirm broad patent eligibility under U.S. law but allow exemptions for higher life forms. They permit exclusion of plants and animals from the patent system. The TRIPS Agreement allows exemptions for patents on living entities other than microorganisms, such as bacteria and viruses. Signatories may deny patents on higher life forms and processes deemed \"essentially biological.\" The TRIPS Agreement allows exemptions for patents on living entities other than microorganisms, such as bacteria and viruses. Signatories may deny patents on higher life forms and processes deemed \"essentially biological.\" U.S. law already requires biotechnological inventions to involve artificial invention for patentability, but Congress could choose to make certain biotechnologies unpatentable. Numerous patent applications have been filed for biotechnological inventions, resulting in issued patents that have been litigated in court. Legislation affecting these patents could raise concerns over governmental takings under the Fifth Amendment. Limiting biotechnology patenting would counter prevailing trends within the patent community both domestically and abroad. Biotechnologies are generally patentable in Japan and the European Parliament has approved biotechnology patents after years of debate. The utility requirement in patent law is judge-made, with concerns within the biotechnological industry about calibrating it appropriately. Congress may consider legislative specification of the definition of patentable utility, particularly for expressed sequence tags (\"ESTs\"). Factors such as mRNA sequence knowledge, protein coding sequence, sequence polymorphisms, protein function, gene mutation phenotype, mRNA tissue distribution, and tissue-specific expression levels could be included in the Patent Act. This could address concerns within the research community regarding potential disincentives for further research and inconsistencies in case law. The patentable utility of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) could be clarified by legislative specification, considering factors like mRNA sequence knowledge, protein coding sequence, sequence polymorphisms, protein function, gene mutation phenotype, mRNA tissue distribution, and tissue-specific expression levels. Some concerns exist regarding abstract utilities specified by patent applicants and the need for technical detail in law to keep pace with evolving technologies."
