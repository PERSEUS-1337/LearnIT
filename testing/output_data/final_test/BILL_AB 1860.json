    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 1464 of the Penal Code is amended to levy a state penalty of ten dollars for every ten dollars imposed for criminal offenses, excluding parking offenses. The penalty imposed by Section 1464 of the Penal Code includes fines for criminal offenses, excluding parking violations, and may be included in bail schedules for non-mandatory personal appearances. The state penalty for multiple offenses is based on total fines or bail amounts. Deposited bail for applicable offenses must include the state penalty. Judges have the discretion to waive the state penalty if payment would cause hardship. After court determination of amount due, penalty collected by clerk and sent to county treasury. Part for Chapter 12 of Government Code goes to county fund, 70% to State Treasury's Penalty Fund, 30% to county general fund. State Penalty Fund moneys distributed accordingly. The State Penalty Fund distributes funds as follows: 0.33% goes to the Fish and Game Preservation Fund for employee education/training, and 32.02% goes to the Restitution Fund in accordance with the Government Code. Once a month, a percentage of state penalty funds is transferred into various training funds: 23.99% to the Peace Officers\u2019 Training Fund, 25.70% to the Driver Training Penalty Assessment Body-worn Camera Fund, and 7.88% to the Corrections Training Fund. Money in the Corrections Training Fund is not continuously appropriated and requires approval in the Budget Act. Once a month, a percentage of state penalty funds is transferred into various training funds, with specific amounts allocated to different funds. The Local Public Prosecutors and Public Defenders Training Fund receives 0.78% of the funds, capped at $850,000 per fiscal year, with the excess going to the Restitution Fund. The Victim-Witness Assistance Fund receives 8.64% of the state penalty funds. Once a month, 0.66 percent of state penalty funds is transferred into the Traumatic Brain Injury Fund, capped at $500,000 for the 1996-97 fiscal year. Funds can be used by the State Department of Mental Health for existing or new projects related to traumatic brain injuries in subsequent fiscal years. Title 14 of the Penal Code establishes a Body-Worn Camera Grant Program for local law enforcement. The program aims to provide funds for purchasing body-worn cameras, data storage, equipment, and hiring personnel to operate the program. The Body-Worn Camera Fund is created for the Board of State and Community Corrections to use for purchasing body-worn cameras. If federal funds are available, the Board will adjust the grant program to maximize competitiveness for obtaining funds. Section 566 of the Penal Code is amended. Section 566 of the Penal Code is amended to make it a felony for an unauthorized person to possess or use containers, cabinets, or dairy equipment marked with a registered brand worth over $950.
