This paper introduces the SuperChat method for generating conversational responses in open domain dialogues, with high-quality results on a public dataset. The method will be demonstrated at a workshop, with code available on github soon. Dialogue systems play a crucial role in enabling machines to communicate naturally with humans, with previous works utilizing encoder-decoder architectures and attention schemes. The recent work introduces the SuperChat method for generating conversational responses in open domain dialogues using encoder-decoder architectures with attention schemes. The models used in the decoder and encoder typically adopt RNN networks like bidirectional GRU, LSTM, and bidirectional LSTM. However, the time complexity of the encoding part is high. The Super Characters method achieves state-of-the-art results for text classification in various languages. It involves drawing characters onto an image and using two-dimensional CNN models for classification. The SuperChat method for dialogue generation skips the encoding phase and fine-tunes the decoder from pretrained CNN models. The SuperChat method for dialogue generation is inspired by the Super Characters method, using two-dimensional embedding for input sentences and partial responses. It aims to address conversational dialogue generation by treating input and partial response sentences as one combined text input. The SuperChat method for dialogue generation uses two-dimensional embedding to predict response sentences sequentially. The SuperChat image, created by embedding input and partial response sentences, is fed into a CNN model to predict the next response word. The SuperChat method uses a CNN model fine-tuned from pretrained ImageNet models to predict the next response word in dialogue generation. The training data labels each SuperChat image with its next response word, and the cut-length of sentences is related to the font size of characters. The cut-length of sentences in SuperChat method is related to the font size of characters on the image. It should be configured based on sentence length distribution and can vary for input and response text. The font size for each part does not need to be the same and can be applied to different languages. The SuperChat method involves converting sentences into square shapes for various languages like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. The dataset used is Simsimi, a Chinese chitchat database with 454,561 dialogue pairs. The top five frequency characters are \",\", \"\u6211\" (I), \"\u4f60\" (you), \"\u7684\" (of), and \"\u662f\" (is). Beam search BID2 is used for soft prediction in generating dialogue responses. The SuperChat method converts sentences into square shapes for languages like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. The dataset used is Simsimi, with 454,561 dialogue pairs. The top five frequency characters are \",\", \"\u6211\" (I), \"\u4f60\" (you), \"\u7684\" (of), and \"\u662f\" (is). The input and response sentences in SuperCharacter images are limited to 18 characters each, resulting in 178,192 pairs of dialogues and 989,087 images generated. Characters with frequency less than 1000 appearances are excluded. In this experiment, a total of 989,087 SuperCharacter images are generated using an image size of 224x224 grey image with three channels. A margin area is added for the four edges in the SuperChat image, with the first character starting from (m, m) instead of (0, 0). The remaining area is 192 pixels, resulting in a font size of 32 pixels for each character. The dataset is split into 75% for training and 25% for testing, with 739,289 training samples and 249,798 testing samples. SE-net-154 is used, initialized with a pretrained model on ImageNet. The pretrained model on ImageNet is fine-tuned for dialogue response generation using the SuperChat method. The model is initialized with a pretrained two-dimensional CNN model and modified for a response vocabulary size of 528. The training curve shows rapid progress initially, reaching 60% quickly and then saturating at 64%. The method decodes input and partial response sentences iteratively to predict the next word. The pretrained two-dimensional CNN model is fine-tuned with SuperChat images for high-quality response generation. An interactive demonstration at the workshop showcases sample response sentences generated by the SuperChat method on the Simsimi dataset. In a conversation, various topics are discussed such as boredom, sadness, origins, food preferences, honesty, beauty, sleep, rooster crowing, tiredness, missing someone, knowledge, communication issues, dislikes, and apologies. The conversation touched on topics like boredom, sadness, origins, food preferences, honesty, beauty, sleep, rooster crowing, tiredness, missing someone, knowledge, communication issues, dislikes, and apologies. One person mentioned \"Dislike you\" and \"I dislike anyone who dislikes me\" in response to a question about their zodiac sign being Gemini."
