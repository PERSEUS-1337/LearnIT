    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Veterans Health Care Trust Fund Act\". Congress acknowledges the unpredictable nature of war and the long-term health care costs associated with conflicts. An independent estimate predicts that the costs for health care and disability compensation related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan will exceed $970 billion over the next few decades. This is supported by the increasing treatment costs for conditions like Agent Orange exposure in Vietnam Veterans, Gulf War Syndrome in Gulf War Veterans, and burn pit exposure in Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans. Addressing these costs now ensures that Congress considers them when deciding on military actions. The use of military force ensures our Nation can better address the long-term health care needs of veterans. SEC. 3. WAR TRUST FUNDS. Section 119 of title 38, United States Code, establishes war trust funds in the General Fund of the Treasury for each war. Funds collected through the Internal Revenue Code related to the war are deposited into the fund and can be used for veterans' hospital care, disability compensation, and other benefits during that war. The Secretary can determine other programs and benefits related to veterans' health care. If multiple wars occur concurrently, separate trust funds are established for each war. Reports must be submitted to relevant committees every 30 days after the first withdrawal from a trust fund, detailing the use of the withdrawn amounts. The Comptroller General conducts audits of financial statements for funds withdrawn by the Secretary for veterans' programs. The term 'war' is defined in the section to include wars declared by Congress or authorized under the War Powers Resolution.
