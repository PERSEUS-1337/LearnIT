    "content": "South Korea's President Lee Myung-bak, from the Grand National Party, took office in 2008 with a focus on economic growth and improving relations with the US. He shifted from the previous policy of unconditional engagement with North Korea to a more reciprocal approach. The Lee administration faced political setbacks, including the 2008 agreement to lift the U.S. beef ban, hindering key policy objectives like enhancing the alliance with the U.S. Despite improved approval ratings due to economic performance, Lee's support is fragile. Issues are attributed to his handling and the complexities of South Korean politics post-authoritarianism, marked by participatory democracy and a critical media. South Korea's democratic development includes a free media, active civil society, and use of the Internet for public demonstrations. The legislative branch is weak compared to the presidency, with leaders facing the risk of becoming lame-ducks. Political parties in South Korea are regionally-based and centered around charismatic personalities. The South Korean political system is regionally-based and centered around charismatic personalities. The fractious nature of the system complicates policymaking, especially on issues involving North Korea and the United States. There is a growing movement to revise the constitution for structural improvements. South Korea's evolution from an authoritarian state to a mature democracy is marked by tensions between traditional insecurities and aspirations for advanced nation status. South Korea's tensions with the United States have consequences for its foreign policy. Public attitudes towards the U.S. have improved, and there are efforts to manage alliance issues. President Lee's conditional relationship with North Korea has aligned South Korea with the U.S. and Japan in pressuring Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear program. Failure to maintain this approach could jeopardize public support and the U.S.-South Korea alliance. President Lee's political standing is crucial for strengthening the U.S.-South Korea alliance. He has faced challenges that have damaged his popularity and hindered his policy priorities, including revitalizing alliance ties with the United States. Trouble began with anti-government protests in 2008, dropping Lee's approval ratings significantly. Maintaining his political standing until his term ends in February 2013 is essential for the alliance. In the 2007 presidential election, the former mayor of Seoul won with 49% of the vote. Lee's approval ratings saw a slight increase in 2009 due to improved economic forecasts. The 2008 beef protests, fueled by various factors, paralyzed policy-making in Seoul. The 2008 beef protests in South Korea were fueled by public safety concerns, economic issues, and political motivations. The protests significantly hindered President Lee's ability to implement his policy agenda. President Lee's ambitious policy initiatives, including a plan for a \"grand canal\" and efforts to upgrade the U.S.-South Korean alliance, have been hindered by his weakened political position. Economic growth goals have been impacted by energy prices and the global economic slowdown, leading to challenges in achieving GDP growth targets. Korea's economy was hit hard by the global financial crisis, with GDP growth turning negative in late 2008 and unemployment reaching nearly 4% in May 2009. South Korean banks, heavily reliant on foreign borrowing, faced credit shortages. Trade plummeted, the South Korean won depreciated, and the Bank of Korea lowered interest rates to a record low of 2%. The government implemented large-scale stimulus packages and secured a multi-billion dollar line of credit with the U.S. Federal Reserve. Since the spring of 2009, signs indicate that the Korean economy's downturn has stabilized. With a 2.3% quarterly growth in the second quarter of 2009, forecasts predict a 2% real GDP growth for 2010. President Lee's approval ratings have increased by 10 percentage points due to improved economic prospects. However, his wavering popularity has not helped unite his divided party, the Grand National Party (GNP), which merged with a smaller conservative group to increase its parliamentary majority. The Grand National Party (GNP) has 167 seats in the National Assembly, but internal divisions highlight President Lee's weakened position. The merger with a faction loyal to Park Geun-hye has caused tension, as she is more conservative than Lee. Additionally, Lee's relationship with the Liberty Forward Party has been contentious, putting pressure on him from his conservative flank. President Lee is facing pressure from his conservative flank due to internal divisions within the Grand National Party. Park Geun-hye and her 50 supporters could defect from the party, undermining Lee's support in the National Assembly. Lee appointed Park as a special envoy to Europe in an attempt to reconcile with her. The beef controversy and former President Roh Moo-hyun's suicide have added to Lee's domestic political problems. President Lee is facing pressure from internal divisions within the Grand National Party, with Park Geun-hye and her supporters potentially defecting. The beef controversy and former President Roh Moo-hyun's suicide have added to Lee's domestic political problems. Many South Koreans believe the investigation into Roh was politically motivated, leading to a nationwide tribute with 5 million mourners blaming Lee. Lee has been criticized for appearing aloof during this national tragedy and for potentially undermining freedom of speech to shield his administration from media scrutiny. The ruling GNP passed a controversial amendment allowing major businesses and newspapers to own stakes in TV networks, which is seen as favoring left-of-center policies. The main opposition Democratic Party fiercely opposed the amendment, even physically preventing a vote in the National Assembly. The Democratic Party (DP) leader launched a hunger strike and legislators resigned in response to a bill passage that would give conservative supporters of Lee a monopoly on news coverage. The political left in South Korea has struggled to unify since 2005, with no clear leader emerging after the death of former president Kim Dae-jung in 2009. Since 2005, the political left in South Korea has faced challenges in unifying, with no clear leader emerging after the death of former president Kim Dae-jung in 2009. President Lee emphasized enhancing cooperation with the United States, leading to improved relations and a hard-line stance toward North Korea. Opposition parties have limited influence in shaping legislation under South Korea's parliamentary system, further marginalizing liberals in the current Assembly. President Lee emphasized improving relations with the United States and adopted a more hard-line stance towards North Korea, insisting on reciprocity in relations and linking inducements to progress on denuclearization. The increase in North Korea's belligerent actions in 2008 and 2009 led to closer strategic coordination between the U.S. and South Korea, symbolized by the successful summit between Presidents Obama and Lee in June 2009. The alliance between the United States and South Korea has evolved to include cooperation on various global issues such as climate change, energy security, and human rights promotion. Despite a solid foundation, differences in priorities, particularly regarding North Korea, could potentially strain the relationship in the future. The relationship between the United States and South Korea has evolved to include cooperation on global issues. However, differences in priorities, especially regarding North Korea, could strain the alliance. Political vulnerabilities may hinder Lee's ability to push unpopular initiatives desired by the U.S., such as the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement. The Obama Administration has indicated a delay in enacting the agreement due to concerns about imbalances, particularly in the auto sector. Despite this, improved public perceptions in South Korea have helped enhance bilateral relations. Improved public perceptions in South Korea have helped enhance bilateral relations with the United States, reducing anti-American sentiments that were prevalent in the past. Public attitudes in South Korea towards the United States have significantly improved, with a 78% favorability rating, the highest in Asia. This positive shift is attributed to increased confidence in President Obama's leadership and the importance of the U.S.-ROK alliance, which now stands at 87%. This has created an opportunity for President Lee to strengthen ties with Washington in a less polarized atmosphere than before. The U.S.-ROK alliance's importance has risen to 87% due to increased threat perceptions from North Korea. South Koreans see the U.S. as their top political partner (62%), surpassing China (19%) and Japan (10%). Despite the positive outlook, public opinion in South Korea can change quickly. The presence of U.S. forces in South Korea is a sensitive issue for the Korean public and affects U.S. force levels on the Peninsula. In 2002, two Korean schoolgirls were accidentally killed by a U.S. military vehicle, sparking large-scale protests against the U.S. troop presence in South Korea. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld considered reducing the U.S. troop level from 37,000 to 25,000 by September 2008, but Secretary of Defense Robert Gates announced a halt at 28,500 troops. The plan also involved withdrawing a combat brigade, relocating troops, and sending some to Iraq. The relocation of the Second Division and 9,000 U.S. military personnel from Yongsan base in Seoul to Pyongtaek has been postponed to 2013 or beyond due to financial costs and construction delays. Secretary Gates announced that family members of U.S. military personnel will be allowed to live in South Korea, adding 35,000 to 40,000 to the American military community. South Korea agreed to pay 760 billion won for the stationing of 28,500 American troops in 2009, with increasing financial support each year. The U.S. and South Korea agreed on the stationing of 28,500 American troops in 2009, with increasing financial support each year until 2013. There is a plan to transfer wartime operational control from U.S. to South Korean command by 2012, which has divided the South Korean public. Polls show that 50% support the transfer as planned, while 35% believe it should be delayed. The OPCON transfer from U.S. to South Korean command by 2012 has divided the South Korean public, with 35% believing it should be delayed indefinitely. President Lee has hinted at the possibility of re-negotiating the agreement. The Pentagon supports the plan, but some American experts suggest a re-negotiation could occur. South Korea withdrew troops from Afghanistan and Iraq in 2007 and 2008 respectively. President Obama asked President Lee to send ROK troops to Afghanistan in 2009. Press reports indicate the Pentagon has urged South Korea to send military engineering units. South Korea withdrew its troops from Iraq in 2008 and agreed to provide aid to a U.S. military base in Afghanistan in 2009. President Lee considered deploying peace-keeping troops to Afghanistan, but only 30% of South Koreans support this idea. The fate of the KORUS FTA is a major economic issue on the bilateral agenda. The KORUS FTA is a trade agreement between the United States and South Korea, aimed at increasing bilateral trade and investment flows. It is seen as a way to transform the South Korean economy by making it more open, transparent, and competitive. Despite initial apprehension, the agreement has gained broad public support over time. Proponents believe it will strengthen the U.S.-South Korean alliance and boost the U.S. presence in East Asia. Approval from Congress is required for the agreement to enter into force. The Obama Administration has not indicated when it will send the draft implementing bill for the KORUS FTA to Congress. U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk has highlighted economic opportunities but also mentioned potential concerns. Presidents Obama and Lee have not committed to a timeframe for approving the agreement. In South Korea, the politics surrounding the KORUS FTA are likely to be complex. In South Korea, the politics of the KORUS FTA may make it difficult for the Lee government to agree to new U.S. demands, especially due to memories of the 2008 beef protests. The National Assembly is still debating whether to vote on the agreement before the U.S. Congress acts. Experts warn that if the U.S. Congress were to reject the KORUS FTA after its potential ratification in the National Assembly, it could have broader political and strategic consequences for the U.S.-ROK relationship. South Korea's diplomatic approach towards neighboring Northeast Asian nations shifted significantly after President Lee took office in 2008, aligning more closely with pro-engagement China in the Six-Party Talks on North Korea. The role of South Korea as a \"strategic balancer\" between pro-engagement and hard-line camps diminished under the Roh administration. President Lee's tougher stance towards North Korea repositions South Korea in the U.S.-led camp, enhancing coordination with Tokyo and Washington. This shift strained inter-Korean relations but led to a modest improvement in South Korea's foreign policy. President Lee's alliance-oriented approach to North Korea has improved South Korea's diplomatic outlook, easing tensions with Washington and fostering closer cooperation with Japan. Despite strained inter-Korean relations, Lee's active diplomatic outreach has not damaged ties with China, with Beijing showing no explicit discouragement of South Korea's repositioning. Smooth relations with China remain a priority for South Korea, despite increasing competition between the two countries. South Korea has enhanced its leadership role in multilateral institutions and regional fora, showcasing its leadership in the global financial crisis. President Lee hosted a summit with ASEAN nations, signing an investment-protection treaty and offering development assistance to deepen ties with the region. These steps aim at expanding South Korea's influence in a region dominated by China, Japan, and the United States. President Lee has made significant changes to South Korea's policy towards North Korea, emphasizing reciprocity and conditionality in relations. He has been critical of North Korea's human rights conditions and has linked progress in denuclearization to the continuation of inter-Korean projects. Lee's administration offers humanitarian assistance with the condition that North Korea requests it first. President Lee has implemented the \"3,000 Policy\" to raise North Korea's per capita income. North Korea reacted by tightening restrictions on inter-Korean activities, leading to the cessation of many programs. Since joining the Proliferation Security Initiative in 2009, South Korea has restricted visits to North Korea, except for those related to the Kaesong Industrial Complex. There have been signs of improved inter-Korean relations since August 2009, but it remains uncertain if this trend will continue. President Lee has downplayed speculation about a potential North-South summit. Public opinion in South Korea regarding relations with North Korea is mixed, with a majority favoring more reciprocity in inter-Korean relations. Despite this, most also support maintaining diplomatic and economic engagement with North Korea. The ambivalence among the public sets boundaries for South Korean policymakers. The main factors influencing opinion on North Korea policy are the perceived threat from North Korea, concerns about the US ignoring Seoul in Washington-Pyongyang relations, and the perception of China expanding its influence in North Korea at South Korea's expense. Relations between South Korea and Japan have improved. Relations between South Korea and Japan have improved significantly over the past year, with a focus on coordinating against North Korean provocations. Despite lingering disputes over the Dokdo/Takeshima islands, both countries are working together diplomatically. They have also pledged to re-launch negotiations on a proposed bilateral Free Trade Agreement. This relationship is crucial for U.S. strategic interests in Northeast Asia. During a bilateral summit meeting in Tokyo, South Korea and Japan discussed a proposed Free Trade Agreement and signed a new agreement to enhance military cooperation. Despite closer ties, the South Korean public remains wary of Japanese intentions, especially with historical issues likely to resurface in 2010. Japanese Prime Minister Hatoyama plans to visit Seoul to discuss reconciliation and potential goodwill gestures, including a visit by Emperor Akihito to South Korea. The Japanese Prime Minister's pledge not to visit the controversial Yasukuni Shrine has been well-received in South Korea, reflecting the complex nature of Sino-Korea relations. China has replaced the United States as South Korea's leading trade partner, with both nations seeking a cooperative relationship despite competitive rivalry in the global economy. South Korea's perceptions of China shifted in 2004 when Beijing claimed the ancient Korean kingdom of Koguryo as a suzerain state. This led to a nationalist backlash and a more cautious outlook on China's rise, with growing awareness of economic competition and concerns about China's economic penetration into North Korea. President Lee's diplomatic approach towards Beijing has been a balancing act. President Lee of South Korea has maintained a delicate balance in his relationship with China. While seeking a stable partnership, he has also distanced South Korea from Beijing's approach to North Korea. A strategic cooperative partnership was established in 2008 to enhance cooperation in various sectors, addressing Chinese concerns about South Korea's alliance with the United States. However, Lee is cautious of the growing competition between Korean and Chinese firms in global markets. Balancing economic competition with political and strategic cooperation with China remains a key challenge for Lee and his successors. South Korea also faces challenges in its relationship with Russia, as economic and political ties between the two nations are still relatively underdeveloped. President Lee has attempted to deepen ties with Moscow by proposing joint commercial and energy projects, including a gas pipeline linking the two countries. South Korea is planning a gas pipeline project with Russia across the Korean Peninsula, with the possibility of diverting gas to North Korea as an incentive for cooperation. However, analysts doubt the project's feasibility. This initiative reflects South Korea's efforts to secure energy resources abroad. U.S.-ROK relations are relatively stable but require careful diplomacy for long-term sustainability. The United States' involvement in Korea has a significant impact on South Korean sociopolitical spheres. While pursuing its own interests in the region, the U.S. must be mindful of South Korean sensitivities to prevent anti-American sentiments. Understanding South Korea's transition to a more independent international power is crucial for successful relations. South Korea desires greater respect from Washington as it gains more influence. The Bush Administration took steps to acknowledge South Korea's clout, such as negotiating the KORUS FTA and admitting South Korea into the U.S. Visa Waiver Program. U.S. involvement in South Korean domestic affairs is a concern, highlighted by the beef protests in 2008. The outcome of the beef protests in 2008 underscores the risks of a South Korean leader being too closely aligned with Washington. Experts warn that perceived U.S. interference in South Korean politics can damage bilateral relations. To maintain credibility, Washington should strengthen ties with opposition lawmakers. Coordination on North Korea policy between the Lee and Obama administrations, along with Japan, is crucial. The Obama administration's approach towards Pyongyang, in coordination with Japan, is to present a united front against North Korean provocations. There are concerns in Seoul that bilateral negotiations with North Korea may jeopardize close coordination with Washington. Experts advise continued consultation with Seoul during any bilateral talks with North Korea to demonstrate recognition of South Korea's stake in Korean Peninsula stability. Delicate bilateral issues include planned changes to the U.S.-ROK alliance, such as realigning U.S. military bases in Korea and transferring wartime operational command to South Korea. The U.S. military is planning to realign its bases in Korea and transfer wartime operational command to South Korean forces. This move aims to reduce the U.S. military's dominant presence in South Korea due to concerns about the sustainability of the U.S. strategic commitment. Analysts suggest close coordination with Korean policymakers to avoid a crisis in the alliance relationship. Some argue for a later timetable for the transfer to ensure South Korea's readiness. The fate of the U.S.-ROK Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA) is a concern for Congress, as its rejection or delay could have significant political repercussions in South Korea. The Administration's emphasis on the strategic value of the agreement may increase its chances of passage but also raise symbolic stakes. The fate of the U.S.-ROK Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA) is a concern for Congress as its rejection or delay could have significant political repercussions in South Korea. Increasing the stakes may boost the agreement's passage chances but also raise symbolic costs for the alliance. Renegotiating the current agreement could be an option to improve ratification prospects, but it would require delicate negotiations with Seoul and could impact President Lee's political standing. Despite challenges, the trajectory of U.S.-ROK relations seems promising in the long run, with South Korea's growing global influence offering new opportunities for the bilateral relationship. President Lee's plan for a \"Global Korea\" aligns with the \"Joint Vision\" signed with President Obama in 2009, aiming to elevate bilateral cooperation to a global level. South Korea's transition to democracy since the mid-1980s has deepened democratic institutions. The next challenge in the U.S.-ROK relationship is implementing the Joint Vision and identifying new areas for cooperation on the world stage. In South Korea, democratic institutions have deepened since the mid-1980s. Kim Dae-jung, a former dissident, was elected president in 1997, followed by Roh Moo-hyun in 2002. Lee Myung-bak's victory in 2007 marked a return to conservative leadership. The left-of-center candidates performed poorly in the election, with only around 30% of the vote. The power in South Korea is shared between the president and the 299-member National Assembly. The Assembly's powers were enhanced in the 1987 constitution, allowing it to criticize and inspect the executive branch. The next national legislative elections will be held in April 2012. The National Assembly in South Korea has gained more transparency in policy-making through branch officials appearing before committees. Opposition parties have used Assembly proceedings to block presidential initiatives, such as the 2004 impeachment of President Roh Moo-hyun, which was later overturned by the Constitutional Court. Despite this, the president and state bureaucracy remain dominant in policymaking due to limitations on the Assembly's ability to initiate major legislation. The National Assembly in South Korea has limited power, with only three full-time staff in legislative offices and the prime minister nominated by the president. The Assembly has faced boycotts by opposition parties, showing its weakness. Efforts have been made to strengthen the Assembly through the creation of the National Assembly Budget Office and Research Service. Bills can be introduced by members or the executive branch in the Assembly. The National Assembly in South Korea may introduce bills, which are sent to the executive for presidential promulgation. The president can veto a bill, but if the Assembly overrides the veto with two-thirds majority, the bill becomes law. The Assembly's consent is required for the appointment of Supreme Court justices, ratification of treaties, declaration of war, dispatch of troops abroad, and stationing of foreign troops in South Korea. Political parties in South Korea are regionally-based and regularly form, disband, and merge. Presently, South Korea has three major political parties: President Lee Myung-bak's conservative GNP, the opposition center-left Democratic Party, and the hard right Liberal Forward Party. These parties are regionally-based and often centered around charismatic personalities rather than substantive issues. The GNP and Democratic Party are divided by competing factions and ideological differences, especially regarding policies towards North Korea and the United States. South Korean politics are highly regionalized, with the GNP's base in the southeastern Kyongsang region. Lee won over 60% of the vote in the 2007 election, with conservative candidates winning around 80% of the Yongnam vote. The Democratic Party's base is in the southwestern Cholla region, where its candidate won nearly 80% of the vote. The greater Seoul area has become a crucial swing vote in presidential elections, and there is discussion of combating regionalism in the National Assembly. NGOs have increased dramatically in South Korea since the end of military rule. NGOs in South Korea have significantly increased in the past decade, operating at local and national levels on various issues like environment, corruption, disability and women's rights, and U.S. forces' crimes. These NGOs have professionalized their operations, impacting domestic and foreign policies. They form temporary coalitions for large-scale protests and have shifted from militant protests to more organized activities. The formation of umbrella organizations in South Korea has enabled successful citizen activism through pooling resources and utilizing the internet for coordination. Decentralization of power in the country has also played a role in empowering civil society groups, leading to increased political consciousness and activism. Increased local autonomy in South Korea since the 1950s has led to greater political consciousness and activism. Seoul remains the center of political power due to limited authority of local governments. Former President Roh aimed to decentralize power by granting more autonomy to provinces and relocating certain executive offices outside of Seoul."
