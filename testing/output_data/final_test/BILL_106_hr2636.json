    "content": "The Act titled \"Taxpayer's Defense Act\" mandates a congressional review of certain rules in the United States Code. The \"Taxpayer's Defense Act\" requires congressional review of rules that establish or increase taxes before they can take effect. Rules under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 are exempt from this requirement. Agencies must submit a report to Congress explaining the part of the rule that triggers this review. Section 815 requires agencies to submit a report for each rule they promulgate, including a concise statement of the rule's basis and purpose. Section 817 outlines the process for introducing a bill in Congress based on the agency's report. Section 817 outlines the procedure for introducing a bill in Congress, stating that any Member of the House may introduce a bill within 7 legislative days after the Majority Leader's deadline. The bill is then referred to the relevant Committees in each House for consideration without amendment, to be reported within 30 calendar days of its introduction. A motion to discharge a committee from further consideration of a bill can be made by a Member favoring the bill after a designated time. Debate is limited to one hour, divided equally between the proponent and opponent, with the previous question ordered on the motion without interruption. After a bill is reported or a committee has been discharged from further consideration, a motion can be made for the House to resolve into the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for bill consideration. If the report has been available for at least one calendar day, all points of order against the bill are waived. Motion to reconsider the vote on a motion is not allowed. In the Committee of the Whole, the first reading of the bill is skipped. General debate is limited to one hour, with equal time for proponents and opponents. The bill is then open for amendment under the five-minute rule. After consideration, the Committee reports the bill to the House without interruption. The previous question is ordered for final passage of the bill. In the House, bills are ordered to final passage without reconsideration. Appeals on rules are decided without debate. In the Senate, bills are referred to committees and must be reported without amendment within 30 days. When a bill is introduced in the Senate, committees must report on it within 30 days, or they will be discharged from further consideration. Bills from the House are placed on the Calendar without committee referral. Motion to proceed on a bill is nondebatable and cannot be reconsidered. The Senate must proceed to vote on a bill after 10 hours of consideration, with a single motion to extend for an additional 5 hours allowed. Time for debate is limited under this paragraph. The time for debate on the disapproval bill is divided between the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader. A motion to recommit a bill is not allowed. If the Senate has read a bill for the third time, they can proceed to consider a bill with the same special message from the House of Representatives. The Senate has limited time for consideration of motions, amendments, or appeals on a House message to 4 hours. Debate on each motion or amendment is limited to 30 minutes, and on any appeal or point of order to 20 minutes. Time for debate is equally divided and controlled. The time for debate on motions, amendments, appeals, or points of order is equally divided and controlled by the proponent and the majority manager, unless the majority manager is a proponent, in which case the minority manager takes control of the opposition time. Technical amendments are made to Chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, including the addition of \"SUBCHAPTER I--DISCRETIONARY CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW\" and changes to section 804. New sections 815, 816, and 817 are added for mandatory Congressional review of certain rules."
