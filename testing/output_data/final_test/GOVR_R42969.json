However, there are also illegal cargo entries, unauthorized migrants, human trafficking victims, and drug smuggling activities that pose challenges to the Department of Homeland Security's border security mission. The Department of Homeland Security and Congress must balance priorities to enhance security and resilience of global movement systems and combat transnational smuggling and trafficking across the U.S. border. Key questions include how to allocate resources for enforcement programs, border security measures, and personnel deployment to address various threats. Intelligence operations and cooperation with enforcement agencies away from the border also play a crucial role in enhancing overall border security. The Department of Homeland Security and Congress must balance priorities to enhance security and resilience of global movement systems and combat transnational smuggling and trafficking across the U.S. border. DHS's border enforcement strategy is based on risk management, requiring regular reassessment of the effectiveness of U.S. border security policy and the costs and benefits of competing approaches. The goal of risk management in border security is to target enforcement resources to specific threats based on the gravity of the risk and cost-effectiveness of the response. Assessing border threats is a critical step in DHS's planning process and for policymakers overseeing enforcement. The report discusses the types of threats the United States faces at its borders and how risk management methodologies can be used to analyze these threats. It also explores how Members of Congress and others can assess the risks associated with border threats and draw conclusions about current risk levels. The report concludes by placing threat assessment within the broader context of border security policymaking. The history of U.S. border security dates back to 1798, with laws authorizing the arrest or deportation of dangerous aliens. Throughout the 20th century, laws were passed to exclude security threats such as anarchists, communists, and terrorists. The focus of U.S. border enforcement has evolved over time, with the establishment of the U.S. Border Patrol in 1924. Beginning in the 1970s, the United States intensified efforts to combat illegal migration and drug flows at the Southwest border. Border patrol staffing increased significantly, and spending by the DEA also rose. Counterterrorism became a third focus of U.S. border security following incidents like the World Trade Center bombing in 1993. In the 1990s, counterterrorism became a key focus of U.S. border security, alongside immigration control and counter-narcotics. After 9/11, it became the top concern. The Homeland Security Act defined DHS's border security responsibilities to include preventing entry of terrorists and weapons, securing borders, immigration enforcement, and customs enforcement. DHS's mission includes preventing unauthorized migrants, combating criminal networks, and identifying potential terrorists at borders. Border security efforts by the Department of Homeland Security encompass various goals, including preventing illegal migration, criminal networks, and terrorism at U.S. borders. These efforts also extend beyond the border through international partnerships and within the United States. The department's overall homeland security mission includes combating unauthorized migration, drugs, criminal networks, and terrorism. The diagram in Figure 1 illustrates the overlapping elements of DHS's border security mission, including criminal networks, unauthorized migrants, and terrorists. Different threats have distinct regions within the diagram, highlighting unique characteristics and possible relationships between them. The core of the diagram shows where these threats converge, such as drug smugglers, unauthorized aliens, and terrorists using the same smuggling routes or techniques. Peripheral areas of each circle are also important as threats encompass distinct features, requiring specific policy responses. Certain threats, such as unauthorized migrants, drug smugglers, and potential terrorists, have unique characteristics and require specific policy responses. While there may be some overlap among these threats, the majority of unauthorized migrants do not fall into the other categories. Enforcement tools targeting illegal migration focus on personnel and infrastructure between ports of entry, while illicit drugs are often smuggled into the United States hidden within cargo containers or vehicles. Enforcement measures targeting illegal migration, worksite enforcement, visa overstay analysis, and combating terrorism may not effectively reduce narcotic smuggling. Border threats include threat actors like potential terrorists, transnational criminals, and unauthorized migrants, as well as threatening goods such as weapons of mass destruction, illegal drugs, counterfeit products, and harmful products brought into the United States illegally. This report focuses on physical risk management methodologies for analyzing these threats. This report focuses exclusively on physical threats at U.S. borders, including dangerous people and goods. Threat actors may include transnational terrorists, transnational criminals, and unauthorized migrants, categorized by motives and behavior. The Immigration and Nationality Act prohibits admission of aliens engaged in terrorist activity. The Immigration and Nationality Act prohibits the admission of aliens engaged in terrorist activity or likely to engage in terrorist activity. Terrorists are motivated by grievances and adopt extremist ideologies. They have goals beyond personal gain, including the destruction of political or economic systems. The Immigration and Nationality Act prohibits admission of aliens engaged in terrorist activities such as hijacking, violence against individuals, assassination, and use of weapons of mass destruction. Terrorists aim to instill fear, gain recruits, and promote their causes through propaganda. The Act also bars admission of criminals, including those with serious criminal records. Criminals, including aliens with serious criminal convictions, controlled substance traffickers, and money launderers, are motivated by profit rather than ideology. Criminal organizations like MS-13 attract members with promises of belonging, drugs, alcohol, and sex, as well as through kinship, ethnic ties, and friendship. Profit incentives drive criminals to provide illegal goods and services, involving activities like defending turf, smuggling, eliminating rivals, and laundering money. Violence is used to generate profits and send messages to rivals, but it is rarely driven by ideology. Criminals secure access to illegal markets through various means. Criminals may gain access to illegal markets by corrupting public officials or intimidating them, influencing state activities, or even having states cooperate with criminals. The INA defines inadmissible aliens, including those with health or foreign policy concerns, potential public charges, certain employment-based immigrants without labor certification, and unauthorized migrants seeking better economic opportunities or family connections. Unauthorized aliens may be involved in immigration-related offenses or become associated with transnational criminals during migration or employment. They are distinguished from terrorists by their lack of extremist ideologies and lack of engagement in terrorist activities. Unlike criminals, unauthorized aliens do not seek to profit from illegal markets or services, nor do they use violence for profit. Illegal goods smuggled into or out of the United States pose security risks, falling into two categories: weapons, drugs, and counterfeit goods are always illegal, while others become illegitimate by avoiding specific laws. U.S. law enforcement aims to prevent various illegal activities. The U.S. law enforcement focuses on preventing illegal goods, including high-consequence weapons of mass destruction (WMD), from entering or leaving the country. Concerns arise over terrorists or criminal networks smuggling WMD or related materials across the border. Mexican drug trafficking organizations are also a concern for purchasing firearms in the U.S. and smuggling them out. Trafficking organizations buy firearms in the United States and smuggle them into Mexico, fueling drug trafficking-related violence. Illegal drugs are another challenge for U.S. border security, with a multi-billion dollar industry fueled by drug demand in the U.S. Border security seizes an average of 13,717 pounds of drugs daily. Border Protection seized an average of 13,717 pounds of drugs daily in FY2011. Counterfeit and pirated goods smuggling into the U.S. by criminal organizations threatens national security and economy. In FY2011, ICE and CBP had 24,792 seizures of counterfeit goods worth over $178 million, with 80% originating from China. Illegally smuggled goods pose various threats even if not categorically prohibited. Illicit smuggling of alcohol, tobacco, and other goods poses significant financial losses and threats to national security. In Michigan alone, illegal alcohol imports cost the state $14 million annually in lost taxes. Cigarettes, comprising 80% of tobacco shipments in the U.S., are smuggled internationally and linked to funding terrorist operations. Federal authorities are concerned about the cross-border movement of illicit proceeds. The movement of illicit proceeds across U.S. borders, particularly through bulk cash smuggling, is a significant concern for federal authorities. Estimates suggest that between $20 billion and $25 billion in bank notes are smuggled into Mexico annually. In FY2011, CBP seized an average of $345,687 in undeclared or illicit currency each day, totaling over $126 million. The complexity of border threats and the challenges in border security policymaking are addressed through risk management approaches. DHS and analysts use risk management and probabilistic risk models to analyze potential threats. Risk management involves choosing the best response to a hazardous situation by comparing costs and benefits. Probabilistic risk assessment focuses on high-consequence, low-probability risks and has influenced DHS's response strategies. After the 9/11 attacks, DHS adopted a risk-based approach influenced by probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) for responding to terrorism threats. The Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP) distributes funds based on risk assessments to states and metropolitan areas for effective response planning. The DHS utilizes risk management programs like CBP's Automated Targeting System (ATS) to screen cargo and passengers for potential threats based on threat scenarios. Travelers, vehicles, and cargo containers are assigned risk scores, with those above a certain threshold targeted for secondary inspection at ports of entry. Additionally, DHS collaborates with intelligence agencies to enhance security measures as mandated by the Project BioShield Act of 2004 and White House directives. The DHS, in collaboration with various agencies, has developed formal models to assess the risks of terrorist attacks using CBRN weapons. These models estimate the likelihood and consequences of different attack scenarios. The threat assessments were last published in 2010-2011, with updates planned every four years. Additionally, DHS led the 2011 Strategic National Risk Assessment in response to White House directives. The Strategic National Risk Assessment (SNRA) was conducted in response to a White House directive to establish a national preparedness system. It evaluated risks of various national-level events, excluding chronic societal concerns. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) published its first Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Report (QHSR) in 2010, outlining a homeland security strategy and priority mission areas. The QHSR outlines threats and challenges to homeland security, including WMD, terrorist networks, and illegal flows of people and goods. CBP and USBP use risk management in border security planning, focusing on criminal and terrorist exploitation and illegal flows between ports of entry. CBP's objectives include risk management to secure borders and ensure efficient trade and travel. The USBP's 2012-2016 strategic plan emphasizes using risk management principles to allocate resources across different border sectors in response to evolving threats. DHS's Risk Lexicon and Risk Management Fundamentals aim to facilitate communication and promote a common understanding of risk management within the department and its partners. Risk Management Fundamentals aims to establish organizational practices for risk management within DHS components. It outlines a six-step risk management process, including defining the decision-making context, identifying risks, assessing and analyzing risks, developing alternatives, implementing risk management strategies, and evaluating outcomes. Risk assessment involves estimating the likelihood and consequences of threats. Risk models define risk as a function of likelihood and consequences, where risk increases with higher likelihood and severe consequences. Events with low likelihood and consequences are low-risk threats, while events with high likelihood and severe consequences are high-risk threats. DHS risk assessments often use this model to evaluate threats. Several DHS risk assessments use a likelihood-times-consequences framework to estimate risk, calculating risk based on different formulas and scenarios. The assessments consider the threat, critical infrastructure, population density, vulnerability, and consequences of an attack to determine risk levels. DHS has conducted risk assessments for various homeland security purposes. The DHS has conducted risk assessments for homeland security threats, but lacks overarching planning documents for border security priorities. This leads to disagreements on how to prioritize preventing illegal flows versus facilitating lawful trade and travel, allocating resources, and measuring border security effectiveness. The DHS lacks clear metrics for measuring border security, leading to calls for a comprehensive strategy. Risk management could provide a framework for addressing these issues, starting with understanding border threats. The use of a likelihood-times-consequences framework to evaluate risk in this context is somewhat controversial. In finance industries, risk projections are probabilistic and uncertain. Predicting border threats is even more challenging, especially with strategic adversaries like terrorists and criminals. Traditional risk management approaches may not be sufficient for border security, as the consequences of threats can impact American society in complex ways. The report explores these challenges and uses a likelihood-times-consequences approach to assess selected border threats. DHS uses the likelihood-times-consequences approach to assess border threats, defining likelihood as the chance of something happening based on historical trends or analytic predictions. Frequency of threat events occurring within a given time period helps estimate probability, such as the likelihood of a category 5 hurricane occurring. Analysts use historical data to estimate the probability of border threats, such as unauthorized migration and illegal drug flows, by using proxies like apprehensions and survey data. However, deriving probabilities from historical observations poses challenges in accurately counting illegal flows. Historical frequencies focus on illegal incidents like illegal crossings, drug smuggling, and unauthorized migration. These threats vary in frequency across different parts of the border and modes of entry. Past frequencies are only known estimates and do not reflect actual flows. For example, data from the National Seizure System show seizures of over 1.7 million kilograms of illegal drugs along the Southwest border in 2010, but this does not represent the total amount smuggled into the United States. Estimates of illegal inflows, including drugs, migrants, and terrorism, are difficult to predict accurately due to the rarity of events like terrorist attacks. Historical analysis is limited in predicting rare events, leading to qualitative descriptions of likelihood by the intelligence community. Past performance does not guarantee future incidents. Some scientists and social scientists argue that historical analysis may not accurately predict rare events like severe weather or terrorism due to changes in underlying models and dynamics. For example, climate change may have altered the accuracy of probability models for extreme weather events. Similarly, labor market changes and increased enforcement may have fundamentally altered immigration dynamics. Historical frequency may not capture the likelihood of certain threats, as it only measures past events. The likelihood of rare events like terrorism or smuggling WMD into the United States cannot be accurately predicted using historical frequency alone. Subject field experts supplement past frequency observations to make more informed predictions about future events, considering factors like threat actors' motives, organizational structures, capabilities, and broader social and political impacts. Law enforcement and intelligence analysts help estimate the likelihood of terrorist attacks by analyzing various aspects beyond historical frequency. Intelligence analysts and social scientists use data to estimate future illegal activities like drug flows and migration. They develop indicators to warn of increased likelihood, such as terrorist groups recruiting specialists for smuggling operations. Warning systems aim to turn uncertainties into puzzles by identifying key indicators along the path to potential threats. Intelligence analysts use indicators to monitor potential threats, such as terrorist recruitment for smuggling operations. These indicators help gauge the likelihood of an attack and are continuously reevaluated as new information comes in. Valid and reliable information related to the threat's evolution is crucial for effective threat analysis. The visibility, uniqueness, and persistence of indicators make them valuable for decision-makers. The visibility and uniqueness of indicators are crucial for effective threat analysis. Unique indicators are easier to identify upon achievement, while indicators that are not unique can be consistent with various activities. This poses challenges in estimating the likelihood of a terrorist group's actions. The likelihood of border threats is difficult to estimate due to definitional and measurement problems, as well as the adaptive nature of threat actors like unauthorized migrants and criminal organizations. Risk models for border security differ from other risk models, requiring consideration of evolving security conditions. Some suggest using game theory instead of decision-theoretic risk assessment for border security. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) should rely on game theory for evaluating border threats, focusing on terrorists' preferences and strategic goals. Policymakers may disagree on how to assess potential consequences, involving defining the threat scope, measuring impact, and assigning value. Congress members may differ in their conclusions at each evaluation stage. DHS defines consequence as the effect of an incident, event, or occurrence, whether direct or indirect. Traditional risk assessment methods often limit analysis to concrete criteria. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) uses traditional risk assessment methods that focus on concrete criteria for evaluating potential consequences. However, DHS also considers a wider scope of consequences in its Strategic National Risk Assessment, including loss of life, injuries, direct economic costs, social displacement, psychological distress, and environmental impact. This broader definition allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the potential impacts of threats. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) considers a wide scope of consequences in its risk assessment, including loss of life, injuries, economic costs, social displacement, psychological distress, and environmental impact. Measuring the potential impact of threats poses challenges, especially in defining and quantifying psychological and sociological effects. The consequences of different scenarios, such as a person overdosing on cocaine supplied by a trafficker, can vary in terms of immediacy and impact. Questions arise about how to measure consequences, including economic impacts and psychological effects. The Department of Homeland Security considers various consequences in its risk assessment, including loss of life, injuries, economic costs, social displacement, psychological distress, and environmental impact. The economic costs of theft extend beyond retailers to include security spending, lost tax revenues, and potential funding of criminal activities. Analysts disagree on the consequences of different threats, with potential links to terrorist organizations. Estimates of net effects vary widely for unauthorized migration, with challenges in measuring potential consequences of unknown future threats. Disagreements exist on the impact of growing language diversity in American schools. The judgment of consequences depends on the evaluator, such as the impact of a smuggler bringing counterfeit medication into the United States. A smuggler bringing counterfeit medication into the United States impacts various individuals, from law enforcement officers to consumers and legitimate manufacturers. Consumers are concerned about health consequences, while manufacturers focus on economic losses and reputational costs. The security challenges at the border can be seen in terms of different motives, with terrorists aiming to cause harm and drug traffickers seeking profit. The section discusses how defining the scope of border threats and weighing different consequences is subjective. It highlights using a framework based on likelihood and potential consequences to assess risks. The information on border threats is often incomplete and subjective. The likelihood and impacts of threats like criminal networks smuggling drugs into the United States are uncertain due to incomplete information. Estimating the frequency of such incidents involves additional uncertainty and requires model-based data and intelligence analysis for better understanding. The consequences of illegal drugs being smuggled into the United States are complex and multifaceted. Analysis should consider not only the loss of life but also economic, social, and psychological impacts. Despite challenges, broad conclusions about border threats are presented in Table 1. The table presents historic frequencies and financial costs associated with threats at the border, offering a framework for policymakers to assess risks. Understanding security issues related to the flow of people and goods across U.S. borders is crucial for effective policy-making. The complexity of threat assessment at U.S. borders does not diminish its importance for policymaking. Border threats shape security policies beyond the border region, impacting other government initiatives and law enforcement activities. Enforcement activities at the border, such as investments in DHS equities like port infrastructure, CBP officers, and inspection scanners, are crucial for addressing illegal drug flows. Counterterrorism efforts also require investments in information systems like the CBP Automated Targeting System and intelligence collection programs. These investments compete with other border priorities like fencing and surveillance equipment. Border investments complement law enforcement activities beyond the border, such as combating traffickers' money. The U.S. government's border security policy involves partnerships with allies abroad to combat terrorism and drug trafficking. Resource availability shapes decision-making, with a focus on immigration control, drug enforcement, and counterterrorism. Congressional and DHS budget considerations impact the approach to border security. The U.S. government faces trade-offs in border security mission due to budget constraints. Policymakers must prioritize and allocate resources effectively. Questions arise on defining a secure border and measuring progress. The Secure Fence Act sets a high standard for operational control, but achieving 100% interdiction rate is debated. Clear policy goals are essential for developing effective metrics. Effective metrics and benchmarks are crucial for measuring the success of policies aimed at reducing unauthorized migration. Key questions include the impact of recent DHS policies on illegal inflows and how the economy's recovery may affect unauthorized flows. Policymakers must consider whether the U.S. approach to border threats is too narrow or broad, and whether policies should target specific issues or aim to prevent all forms of unauthorized migration and illegal activities. Members of Congress may evaluate policies by considering where DHS may get the most effective return on its enforcement investments. Some may prioritize resiliency in addition to terrorism prevention, while others may question the balance of enforcement and non-enforcement investments in U.S. drug policy. The focus may also be on countering the movement of bulk cash, counterfeit goods, and other smuggled items across the U.S. Countering the movement of bulk cash, counterfeit goods, and other smuggled items across the U.S. borders may require a decision on investing in enforcement personnel at the border or focusing on international cooperation and domestic intelligence collection."
