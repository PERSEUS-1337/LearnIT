    "content": "The \"Restoring Authority to Schools Act of 2004\" aims to give public schools more control over education, limit federal court oversight to what is necessary, and empower state and local officials to address funding and resource allocation issues. The \"Restoring Authority to Schools Act of 2004\" limits prospective relief in civil actions regarding violations of Federal law in public schools to only what is necessary to correct the violation of a particular plaintiff's Federal right. The relief must be narrowly drawn, least intrusive, and consider adverse impacts on other students or the school community. The \"Restoring Authority to Schools Act of 2004\" restricts prospective relief in civil actions involving Federal law violations in public schools to what is essential to correct the violation of a Federal right. The relief must be narrowly tailored and consider adverse impacts on the school community. The court may issue temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctive relief in civil actions involving Federal law violations in public schools. Relief must be narrowly drawn, least intrusive, and consider adverse impacts on the school community. Preliminary relief expires after 90 days unless findings for prospective relief are met. In civil actions involving Federal law violations in public schools, prospective relief may be ordered and made final before the 90-day period expires. Relief can be terminated upon motion of any party or intervener, either 2 years after the court granted it, 1 year after an order denying termination, or in certain cases specified by the Restoring Act. Before the Restoring Authority to Schools Act was enacted in 2004, relief in civil actions regarding violations of Federal law in public schools could be terminated 2 years after the enactment date. Parties can agree to terminate or modify relief before it is terminated. Immediate termination of prospective relief is allowed if the court did not find it narrowly drawn, extending no further than necessary, and the least intrusive means to correct the violation. Prospective relief in civil actions for Federal law violations in public schools can continue if necessary to correct ongoing violations, as long as it is narrowly drawn and least intrusive. Parties can seek modification or termination of relief before it is legally terminable. Settlements can also be reached in such cases. In civil actions for Federal law violations in public schools, settlements must comply with limitations on relief. Private settlement agreements can be made outside court enforcement, allowing reinstatement of civil proceedings if needed. Private settlement agreements can be enforced in State court if breached, allowing parties to seek remedies under State law. Limitations on remedies in Federal law violations do not apply to relief granted by State courts based on State law claims. Courts must promptly rule on motions to modify or terminate prospective relief in civil actions regarding Federal law violations in public schools, with mandamus available for delays. Motions to modify or terminate relief under subsection (b) automatically stay proceedings. The court may postpone the automatic stay for up to 60 days for good cause, without delays due to court congestion. Any order blocking the automatic stay must be promptly addressed. In any civil action in a Federal court regarding violations of Federal law in public schools, a special master may be appointed to balance the needs of the school community against the requested relief. Orders suspending the automatic stay are appealable under section 1292(a)(1) of title 28, United States Code. In civil actions regarding violations of Federal law in public schools, a special master may be appointed to balance the needs of the school community against the requested relief. The court appoints a special master during the remedial phase only if it is deemed sufficiently complex. If necessary, the court requests lists of potential special masters from both defendant State officials and plaintiffs, with each party having the opportunity to remove candidates from the opposing party's list. The court selects a special master from a list provided by both parties in civil actions regarding violations of Federal law in public schools. Parties have the right to appeal the selection based on partiality. The special master's compensation is based on an hourly rate not exceeding that of court-appointed counsel, plus reasonable costs. The appointment is subject to regular review. In civil actions involving violations of Federal law in public schools, a special master is appointed by the court and their services are reviewed every 6 months. The special master's powers include conducting hearings and preparing findings of fact on the record, but they are not allowed to make any findings or communications ex parte. In civil actions involving violations of Federal law in public schools, a special master appointed by the court may assist in developing remedial plans and can be removed at any time. The term \"consent decree\" refers to court relief based on parties' consent, excluding private settlements. The term \"public schools\" refers to public elementary or secondary schools as defined in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. \"Private settlement agreement\" is an agreement among parties not subject to judicial enforcement other than reinstatement of the civil proceeding settled. \"Prospective relief\" includes all relief except compensatory monetary damages. The term \"special master\" refers to a person appointed by a Federal court to exercise the powers of a master. \"Relief\" encompasses all court-approved forms of relief, including consent decrees but excluding private settlement agreements."
