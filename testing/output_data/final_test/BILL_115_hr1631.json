INCLUSION OF EARNINGS OVER $300,000 IN SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFIT FORMULA. The amendment to the Social Security Act includes earnings over $300,000 in the determination of primary insurance amounts. This involves calculating 3 percent of the individual's excess average indexed monthly earnings. Additionally, the definition of excess average indexed monthly earnings is clarified by specifying basic wages and basic self-employment income.
