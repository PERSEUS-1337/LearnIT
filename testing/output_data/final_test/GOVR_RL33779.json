    "content": "Increasing numbers of animal and plant species face possible extinction due to habitat loss, development, changes in land management practices, competition from invasive species, and other factors. The 1973 Endangered Species Act (ESA) is controversial for its strict provisions that can impact the use of federal and nonfederal lands. Congress must balance economic, political, and social interests with the protection of endangered species and ecosystems. The 1973 Endangered Species Act (ESA) aims to protect endangered and threatened species and their ecosystems. Despite strong support and opposition, the ESA has not been reauthorized since 1992. Congressional efforts in the 110th Congress focused on addressing specific controversial features of the ESA and oversight concerns regarding decision-making science and critical habitat designation. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) protects plants and animals at risk of extinction, with species listed as endangered or threatened. Threatened species receive more flexible management. Some populations of salmon in certain states are listed under ESA, while others in Alaska are not. Legal tools like penalties and citizen suits aid in species recovery and habitat protection under ESA. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is administered by the Department of the Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). As of October 20, 2008, there were 1,183 animal species and 749 plant species listed as endangered or threatened under the ESA, with the majority occurring in the United States and its territories. Recovery plans cover 86.0% of the 1,358 U.S. species listed. Conservation efforts for endangered species in the U.S. are focused on recovery plans and critical habitat designation. Conservationists emphasize ecosystems over individual species, as declining species can indicate larger environmental issues. Controversies often arise in efforts to protect listed species, highlighting resource scarcity and ecosystem changes. The Endangered Species Act focuses on protecting species based on scientific information, public participation, and without considering economic effects. Conservation efforts prioritize ecosystems and recovery plans, with controversies arising over resource allocation and ecosystem changes. The Endangered Species Act prioritizes protecting species based on scientific information and public participation, without considering economic effects. The listing of species may lead to the designation of critical habitat, with exceptions for cases where publication may pose risks. As of October 20, 2008, there were 283 species on the list of candidate species. The Endangered Species Act prioritizes protecting species based on scientific information and public participation. Critical habitat designation is not commonly done due to limited resources, despite its value in species recovery. Legal challenges have been faced by FWS for not designating critical habitat, with some asserting its importance in enhancing species recovery. The Keystone Center's ESA Working Group on Habitat released a report on habitat protection and ESA, emphasizing the importance of identifying species recovery habitat during recovery planning rather than at the time of listing. Adverse modification of critical habitat (CH) is enforceable, although it is often misunderstood as restricting private landowners' authority. The duty to avoid adverse modification of CH sheds light on whether harm has occurred. The duty to avoid adverse modification of critical habitat (CH) is an express obligation for federal agencies and actions with a federal nexus. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits the \"take\" of endangered species, which includes actions that may harm or harass the species. There are civil and criminal penalties for violations of the ESA, and habitat modification is considered a form of harm. Agencies and individuals must contact the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) or National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to initiate the permitting process to avoid ESA violations. Under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), federal agencies must consult with FWS or NMFS to avoid violations and obtain permits for actions that may impact listed species. Actions must not jeopardize the species' existence or modify critical habitat. Consultation is required to assess potential effects on listed species and critical habitat. Under the Endangered Species Act, federal agencies must consult with the appropriate Secretary to avoid harm to listed species or critical habitat. The Secretary may suggest alternatives to prevent harm and issue a biological opinion allowing incidental take of species. If jeopardy cannot be avoided, an exemption may be sought from the Endangered Species Committee. Permits may be issued for actions without a federal nexus under Section 10 of the ESA. The appropriate Secretary may issue permits under Section 10 of ESA to allow incidental take of species during lawful actions. An applicant must submit a habitat conservation plan showing impact, mitigation steps, funding, alternatives considered, and any other required measures. Streamlined procedures are provided for activities with minimal impacts. Critics question the proposal allowing federal agencies to independently decide on harm to ESA-listed species. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows for exemptions from jeopardy for federal actions, decided by the Endangered Species Committee. Only one exemption has been granted so far (Grayrocks Dam, WY). The committee must accept the President's determination in declared disaster areas and grant an exemption if the Secretary of Defense deems it necessary. The Secretary of Defense can grant exemptions for national security under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The Department of Defense (DOD) has not requested any exemptions yet, but other statutes allow for waivers of ESA provisions. The Secretary of Homeland Security can waive the ESA to expedite construction of barriers and roads at the border. In the 110th Congress, H.R. 6895 proposed exempting nuclear facility construction from ESA regulations. Emergency procedures under ESA allow for informal consultations during emergencies, with more thorough consultations afterward. FWS stated that hurricane-related activities in disaster areas trigger emergency ESA consultations. Restoring hurricane-damaged infrastructure to its original footprint may not require ESA consultation. Recovery plans are required for endangered species conservation under ESA. Recovery plans for endangered species under the Endangered Species Act are guidelines, not binding on federal agencies. A 1988 amendment prohibited favoritism towards specific taxonomic groups. In 2008, FWS introduced a crediting framework allowing federal agencies to offset adverse effects on listed species by funding conservation efforts on private land. This creates conservation \"banks\" to offset activities like military training or oil exploration. The Endangered Species Act allows the federal government to acquire land for species conservation and authorizes funding for land acquisition. The appropriate Secretary must cooperate with states and enter into agreements to assist in endangered species programs. States may receive federal funds with a 25% match requirement. Under the 1988 amendments, the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund provides state grants with annual appropriations required. Provisions include exemptions for captive raptors, regulations on subsistence activities by Alaskan Natives, and rules for establishing experimental populations. The Endangered Species Act is the domestic legislation for international agreements on wildlife preservation. The Western Hemisphere Convention, signed by the United States in 1940, parallels the Endangered Species Act (ESA) but uses three categories to classify species based on trade risks. ESA makes violations of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) violations of U.S. law within U.S. jurisdiction. CITES COP meets every two to three years to vote on amendments and review progress. The most recent COP was held in June 2007 in The Hague. In June 2007, the CITES COP discussed various species listings, including sawfish and European eel, denied proposals for whales, sharks, and coral, approved some ivory trade, and addressed tiger farming and illegal logging. The House Committee on Natural Resources in the 110th Congress held hearings on the impact of illegal wildlife trade, estimated at over $10 billion annually, leading to species decline, disease spread, and invasive species proliferation. The United States is a major importer of illegal wildlife. The United States is a major importer of illegal wildlife and wildlife products. Policy mechanisms like CITES and the Lacey Act address the illegal wildlife trade. Legislative proposals in the 110th Congress aimed to establish a list of acceptable species for import and increase enforcement capacity. The Multinational Species Conservation Fund supports conservation efforts for tigers, rhinoceroses, elephants, marine turtles, and great apes. P.L. 110-132 reauthorized the African Elephant Conservation Act and the Rhinoceros Conservation Act. In the 110th Congress, legislation reauthorized conservation acts for African elephants, rhinoceroses, tigers, and Asian elephants. Bills were introduced to expand conservation efforts for great cats, rare canids, and cranes. Hearings and reports were conducted on these bills in 2007 and 2008. In 2008, various bills were reported and passed by the House and Senate committees, including H.R. 1771 and H.R. 1497 which aimed to extend protection to plants illegally harvested outside the US. Additionally, H.R. 4455 focused on international wildlife management programs, and H.R. 5756 and S. 3490 were related to reauthorizing conservation efforts for various species. The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations reported S.Res. 598 on the need for international efforts to prevent species extinction. H.R. 6862 aimed to reauthorize the Marine Turtle Conservation Act. 48 species have been delisted under the ESA in the past 25 years. In the past 25 years, 48 species have been delisted under the ESA for reasons such as recovery, extinction, and original data errors. Recovered species include alligators, Yellowstone grizzly bear, bald eagle, brown pelican, peregrine falcons, and three species of kangaroos. Extinct species include the dusky seaside sparrow, Guam broadbill, and two small fish. It can be challenging to determine if rare species are truly extinct, as seen with the rediscovery of the ivory-billed woodpecker. Some view the ESA as a failure due to only 17 species being delisted as recovered. The ESA has been criticized for only delisting 17 species as recovered, with concerns about habitat loss and invasive species hindering full recoveries. However, studies show that 41% of listed species have improved or stabilized their populations after being listed. Species like red wolves and California condors may not exist without ESA protection. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has been criticized for delisting only 17 species as recovered, with concerns about habitat loss and invasive species hindering full recoveries. However, studies show that 41% of listed species have improved or stabilized their populations after being listed. Species like red wolves and California condors might not exist without ESA protection. The House Committee on Resources released a report on the implementation of the ESA in 2005, reviewing ways to measure recovery progress. The Government Accountability Office found that funding allocation for species recovery is influenced by factors other than priority ranking. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) lacks a process to assess funding decisions for species recovery. In 2006, GAO studied the recovery of 31 species and highlighted the importance of recovery plans. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) reauthorization has been a legislative focus since 1992, with various issues addressed in Congress, such as land use effects, species recovery promotion, and regional conflicts. The 110th Congress considered proposals for compensation to landowners providing habitat for endangered species. Critics argue that Critical Habitat designation places burdens on landowners with little conservation benefit. FWS and NMFS have misinterpreted and failed to enforce the current statute. Section 15303 of P.L. 110-246 allows deductions for endangered species recovery expenditures. The 110th Congress considered proposals for compensation to landowners providing habitat for endangered species. Legislation such as S. 700, H.R. 1422, S. 2223, and others aimed to provide tax credits for habitat protection agreements. Some bills prioritized habitat protection for rare, threatened, and endangered species in agricultural conservation programs. The Endangered Species Act requires species status determinations based on scientific and commercial data. Critics have raised concerns about the scientific rigor of Endangered Species Act (ESA) actions, citing disputes over species like the Florida panther, Klamath River Basin suckers and coho salmon, and Sonoran Desert bald eagles. Limited resources and lack of research on many species facing extinction pose challenges. Some suggest prioritizing species conservation, while others advocate for different considerations. Some argue that factors beyond species conservation should be considered in ESA actions, including changing the role of science. Limited resources and lack of research on lesser-known species complicate the acquisition of complete data. The protective purpose of ESA suggests giving the benefit of the doubt to dwindling species, as stated in the FWS/NMFS Endangered Species Consultation Handbook. The \"best information available\" language allows FWS to issue biological opinions even with incomplete information, giving the benefit of the doubt to species. In the 110th Congress, an oversight hearing was held on political influence and scientific integrity in ESA implementation. Several bills were introduced, including H.Res. 487 expressing the sense of. In the 110th Congress, oversight hearing held on political influence and scientific integrity in ESA implementation. Bills introduced include H.Res. 487 recognizing contributions of modeling and simulation technology. H.R. 3459 proposed amending ESA to require FWS to publish a summary statement of scientific basis for listing decisions. OMB issued government-wide guidelines for information quality. Interior and FWS issued additional guidelines for correction of information. The FWS and NMFS have established guidelines for information quality and peer review procedures under the Endangered Species Act. They receive information from various sources, ranging from informal to peer-reviewed scientific studies, and ensure that it is reliable and credible for ESA implementation. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires agency biologists to use the best scientific and commercial data available, document their evaluations, and use primary sources for recommendations. Agency managers review the work of biologists to ensure quality science. Expert opinions and peer reviews are solicited to ensure the best information for listing decisions. The Endangered Species Act requires agencies to use the best scientific and commercial data available for listing decisions. Expert opinions and peer reviews are sought to reduce scientific uncertainty. Agencies must not ignore available biological information or treat species differently. Conservation measures should be taken before a species is conclusively headed for extinction. The Endangered Species Act mandates the use of the best scientific data for listing decisions, ensuring conservation measures are taken before a species faces extinction. Judicial review helps prevent arbitrary decisions and ensures regulations address the decline of species. In Arizona Cattle Growers Association v. United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the court emphasized the low evidentiary bar FWS must meet when issuing Incidental Take Permits under Section 10(a). The ruling on Incidental Take Permits under Section 10(a) requires agencies to show a species is present before regulating it and prove the connection between land use and harm. Environmental groups are considering using the Endangered Species Act to limit greenhouse gas emissions by listing animals affected by climate change. The Center for Biological Diversity has already petitioned to list species like the polar bear. The Endangered Species Act could be used to limit greenhouse gas emissions by listing species affected by climate change, such as the polar bear. This could lead to negotiations for greenhouse gas-limiting terms and conditions for sources of substantial emissions. Efforts to address climate change through the ESA may face obstacles. Efforts to address climate change through the Endangered Species Act (ESA) may encounter obstacles, including the debate over the causal link between greenhouse gas emissions and habitat harm. The ESA offers tools like Section 4(d) \"special rules\" for threatened species to minimize conflicts. The listing of the polar bear as threatened in 2008 brought Section 7, Section 9, and 4(d)-rule mechanisms to the forefront. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) expressed opposition to using the ESA to address climate change, issuing a 4(d) rule that excludes incidental takings of polar bears from the Section 9 prohibition. This exemption could impact activities like coal-fired power plants. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service argued that coal-fired power plants do not \"take\" polar bears through their greenhouse gas emissions. They stated that there is no established causal connection between specific sources of emissions and impacts on polar bears or their habitat. Proposed amendments to consultation regulations in 2008 would make it even less likely for consultation to be triggered by greenhouse gas emissions. Legislation in the 110th Congress aimed to provide funding for habitat conservation for species vulnerable to climate change impacts. Legislation in the 110th Congress aimed to allocate funds to the Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered species programs and assist species in adapting to climate change. The House and Senate passed different versions of bills related to this funding, with the Senate also considering amendments to the Endangered Species Act regarding global climate change. The curr_chunk discusses the controversy surrounding the Bureau of Reclamation's decision not to release water from its Klamath irrigation project, impacting approximately 200,000 acres of farmland. This decision is part of the broader issue of conserving species and their habitats in the face of resource crises and economic conflicts. The Bureau of Reclamation's decision not to release water from its Klamath irrigation project has sparked controversy. The operational change aimed to benefit endangered sucker species and threatened coho salmon, but has faced opposition from upstream farmers citing contractual rights to water. The Klamath Project, straddling the Oregon/California border, has become a focal point for complex water management issues involving various stakeholders. The Bureau of Reclamation's decision regarding water release from the Klamath irrigation project has sparked controversy. The issue revolves around meeting irrigation contract obligations without jeopardizing listed fish species. Criticisms and defenses have been made regarding operation plans and biological assessments. Political intervention allegations have been raised, leading to a proposed agreement among Klamath River stakeholders. The proposed agreement aims to address conflicting water management objectives in the Pacific Northwest, particularly regarding salmon protection. NMFS officials are working with various stakeholders to implement recovery measures for threatened or endangered Pacific salmon and steelhead trout populations. Recent controversies focus on biological opinions related to the Federal Columbia River Power System and the potential removal of dams on the lower Snake River. In 2007, NMFS's hatchery listing policy was ruled invalid by a federal court for including hatchery-raised fish in protection measures for wild fish. Federal court decisions in Oregon invalidated NMFS's approach to evaluating jeopardy to salmon from dam operations on the Columbia and Snake Rivers, ordering increased water spills to aid juvenile salmon transit. P.L. 110-114 mandated a feasibility study for fish passage improvements in Oregon, with additional measures for salmon restoration. Several measures were introduced in the 110th Congress for salmon restoration, including H.R. 24, H.R. 4074, S. 27, and Title X of S. 3213. Hearings were held for H.R. 24 and S. 27, with reports on H.R. 4074 and S. 27. Additionally, H.R. 860 and S. 493 aimed to designate salmon restoration areas in California, while H.R. 1507 sought scientific analysis of federal efforts to restore salmon and steelhead. H.R. 1769 aimed to authorize the taking of California sea lions on the Columbia River to protect ESA-listed salmon. S. 1696 directed the Department of the Interior to implement provisions identified in the NMFS and FWS Upper Snake River Basin Biological Opinions. S. 3608 proposed a Salmon Stronghold Partnership program to protect wild Pacific salmon. The Delta smelt, a threatened species in California, has seen a significant decline in recent years due to various factors such as water pumps, competition from exotic fish, contaminants, habitat changes, and food supply alterations. The exact cause of the decline is debated, with some pointing to water pumps as the main culprit. This decline has implications for water projects in the region. The Central Valley Project (CVP) and State Water Project (SWP) in California supply water, but changes in pump operations may be needed to protect the Delta smelt under the ESA. FWS issued a no-jeopardy BiOp in 2004, reissued in 2005, but in 2007, it was found non-compliant. Consultation is ongoing while the Bureau implements interim measures. In 2007, the House Natural Resources Subcommittee held a hearing on Delta smelt in the Bay-Delta ecosystem. H.R. 6940 proposed a fish hatchery program for Delta smelt and exemptions for pumping plants from ESA restrictions. Counterpart regulations allow action agencies to determine impact on listed species without full consultation. The U.S. EPA issued counterpart pesticide regulations under ESA Section 7 for regulatory actions on pesticides. These regulations allowed EPA to decide on potential adverse effects on listed species without FWS consultation. In 2006, a court overturned these regulations for not aligning with ESA Section 7's intent, which led to federal action agencies being excused from consultation. The court upheld the \"optional formal consultation\" process for federal action agencies, allowing NMFS or FWS to adopt EPA effects determinations. National Fire Plan (NFP) counterpart regulations were established by various agencies, eliminating the need for informal consultation with FWS or NMFS for certain actions. The District Court ruled that the Alternative Consultation Agreement did not bypass ESA Section 7. The NFP counterpart regulations found deficiencies in projects reviewed by NMFS and FWS, with conflicts arising between ESA and property owners despite mechanisms to soften impact. Critics argue that ESA restrictions infringe on property rights, but the Fifth Amendment prohibits property takings without compensation. The Supreme Court struggles to define government actions that constitute a \"taking\" of private property without just compensation. Government actions are considered a taking if they result in a permanent physical occupation of property or a total elimination of its economic use. A three-factor balancing test is used when only part of the property's use or value is affected. Property impact must be severe for a taking to occur, and it is assessed in relation to the property as a whole. About 20 court decisions have addressed challenges to ESA restrictions on property, with most finding no takings. Challenges to ESA restrictions on property have mostly resulted in no takings, with cases involving timber cutting, water delivery reductions, and prohibitions on endangered species transport. Claims often failed due to being filed in the wrong court or not meeting the \"ripe\" requirement. When reaching the court, taking claims were rejected due to insufficient economic impact or the government not being liable for wild animal actions. Only two decisions favored property owners, one of which was later overturned. The judge repudiated a decision regarding in-stream flows for listed fish. The United States is seeking reconsideration of a ruling on water rights and fish ladders. Critics suggest amending the ESA to provide compensation for property impacts. Previous bills included provisions for compensation, but recent ones have not. Opponents argue against an explicit compensation standard for the ESA. The 110th Congress enacted P.L. 110-229, including Section 515 authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to participate in the Platte River Recovery Implementation Program for Endangered Species. On May 1, 2007, the Senate designated May 18, 2007, as \"Endangered Species Day\" and also supported \"American Eagle Day\" on June 20, 2007. The 110th Congress considered various ESA issues, including a Coast Guard report on protecting endangered sea turtles and marine mammals, a hearing on listing polar bears as threatened, and bills prohibiting leasing in the Chukchi Sea. The 110th Congress considered bills related to protecting polar bears, including prohibiting oil and gas leasing in the Chukchi Sea and allowing the importation of polar bear trophies from Canadian sport hunts. The 110th Congress considered bills related to protecting polar bears, including allowing the importation of polar bear trophies from Canadian sport hunts. H.R. 1917, S. 658, S. 424, H.R. 2530, H.R. 3156, and S. 1860 proposed various amendments to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to address species listing, delisting, recovery planning, and enforcement of ESA compliance costs. Hearings were held on these measures to discuss their impacts on endangered species and the gas industry. The 110th Congress considered bills related to protecting polar bears and addressing endangered species offenses, research for southern sea otter recovery, and amending ESA provisions during droughts. Additionally, there were proposals to conserve endangered large whales, reduce vessel collisions with North Atlantic right whales, and designate a day for endangered species awareness. S.Res. 520 designated May 16, 2008, as \"Endangered Species Day,\" while S.Res. 583 designated June 20, 2008, as \"American Eagle Day\" to celebrate the recovery of the bald eagle. Bills like S. 3189 and H.R. 7169 aimed to extend authorizations for endangered fish recovery programs. Appropriations are crucial for funding ESA activities and consultations for federal projects. President Bush signed P.L. 110-161 (H.R. 2764, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008) into law, providing over $236 million for FWS's ESA and related programs. The FY2009 budget request included more than $230 million for ESA-related programs within FWS, with a decrease in funding compared to FY2008. Total FWS funding for all ESA-related programs would decrease by about $6.09 million (2.57%) from the previous year. Continuing appropriations for FWS were provided at the FY2008 level until March 6, 2009, with a decrease of $6.09 million (2.57%) compared to the previous year."
