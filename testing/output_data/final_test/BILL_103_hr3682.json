    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bucket Drowning Prevention Act of 1993\" and includes labeling standard requirements. Established on October 1, 1994, a consumer product safety standard under the Consumer Product Safety Act requires warning labels on 4 to 6-gallon buckets to prevent infants from falling into liquid. Labels must be permanent, in English and Spanish, and meet specific size requirements. The label on 4 to 6-gallon buckets must be 3 1/2 inches in width, centered below the handle, with a border for contrast. It should include a warning in English and Spanish about the danger of children falling into the bucket and drowning, with a safety alert symbol. The label on 4 to 6-gallon buckets must be clear and conspicuous with contrasting colors. It should include a picture of a child falling into liquid with an encircled slash symbol superimposed over it. The picture should be positioned between the signal word panel and the message panel. SEC. 3. CERTAIN BUCKETS NOT AFFECTED.\n\nThe standard established by section 2 applies only to buckets manufactured or imported on or after the effective date of such standard. Buckets manufactured or imported before this date can be sold without the warning label required by section 2, even if sales occur after the effective date. The Consumer Product Safety Commission may prohibit stockpiling of buckets that would have been subject to safety standards under section 2. \n\nSEC. 4. PROHIBITED ACTS. SEC. 4. PROHIBITED ACTS.\n\nIt is prohibited to cover, obstruct, tear, deface, or remove the label once placed on a bucket according to the standard in section 2. This act is considered a violation of the Consumer Product Safety Act. The standard in section 2 is a consumer product safety standard under the same Act. SEC. 5. EXISTING LABELS.\n\nAny bucket label in use on September 1, 1993, that meets the requirements of section 2 can continue for 12 months after this title's enactment. Buckets must have both English and Spanish labels after the standard set by section 2.\n\nSEC. 6. AMENDMENTS.\n\nSection 553 of title 5 applies to any changes to the bucket labeling standard in section 2, exempt from sections 7 and 9 of the Consumer Product Safety Act.\n\nSEC. 7. RESPONSIBILITY FOR LABELING. SEC. 7. RESPONSIBILITY FOR LABELING. The manufacturer is responsible for labeling buckets as per the standard set by section 2. Buckets must have labels before entering the market. The Consumer Product Safety Commission must establish a performance standard for buckets within 30 days of this title's enactment to address drowning hazards. The standard must be in effect within 15 months and may consider existing voluntary standards. Labeling requirements do not apply to buckets certified by the Consumer Product Safety Commission as meeting the performance standard for addressing drowning hazards. SEC. 9. CONSULTATION. The Consumer Product Safety Commission must consult with relevant Federal agencies within 30 days of this Act's enactment to prevent conflicting labeling. SEC. 10. REQUIREMENT FOR CPSC STUDY. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will conduct a study to determine consumer use patterns and incidents of death or injury related to 4- to 6-gallon steel and metal buckets. The study will focus on household, residence, and school use and must be completed within 12 months of enactment, with follow-up studies for two years. If necessary, the study will be repeated to track changes in use patterns or incidents. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will exempt metal containers from labeling requirements for 4- to 6-gallon containers. The exemption will be considered a consumer product safety standard, and the CPSC will review the results of a study to decide whether to continue the exemption, require compliance, or conduct further study in the future."
