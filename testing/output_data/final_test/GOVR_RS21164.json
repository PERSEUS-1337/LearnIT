    "content": "The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) changed the budget framework for federal highway and transit programs by creating new budget categories and setting statutory limitations on obligations. It amended the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to establish two new budget categories: highways and mass transit, with predetermined funding levels for core highway programs. Additionally, TEA-21 introduced a mechanism called RABA to adjust highway account amounts based on trust fund tax revenues, excluding the transit account from this process. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) established budget categories for highway and transit programs with guaranteed funding levels. The RABA process links tax revenues to highway spending, ensuring funds are used for highway programs. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) evaluates revenues in the highway account annually. The \"look-back\" and \"look-ahead\" adjustments in the highway account evaluate revenues compared to predicted levels in TEA-21. Funding adjustments lead to changes in program spending, with apportionment changes applied to core highway programs and other federal aid programs. Funds are reserved proportionally for programs allocated by the FHWA. The TEA-21 legislation initially predicted revenue growth exceeding highway authorization, with estimates of additional funding up to $3.5 billion. However, actual revenue increases surpassed expectations during FY2000 - FY2002, leading to a current debate on unexpected revenue downturns. The revenue stream for the highway trust fund responded to the direction of the domestic economy, with Americans driving more each year and using more fuel. Trust fund revenues declined during the economic slowdown in 2000 and 2001, especially affecting the trucking industry. Gasohol use was increasing during this period. Gasohol use increased as a substitute for MTBE, leading to a decrease in revenue to the trust fund. The recession in 2002 caused a negative RABA adjustment in the President's FY2003 budget proposal. The federal-aid highway program is slow due to the nature of capital infrastructure projects. The federal-aid highway program is slow in spending due to being a reimbursable program, with funds not being disbursed until work is completed. The Administration's FY2003 budget suggested that the slow spending nature of the program would protect against economic consequences from a reduction in highway obligations. However, the highway construction industry and states disagreed, believing that a proposed reduction in obligations would have a significant impact. The proposed year-over-year reduction in highway spending raised concerns about its impact on recovery from the recession. Congress had options to address the situation, with the initial support to maintain the status quo. The President's FY2003 budget assumed the downward adjustment in spending, but additional highway spending could increase the overall deficit. Additional spending for highways could potentially increase the overall deficit in the President's budget, despite the existence of a separate budget category for the highway trust fund with a significant unobligated balance. Legislation introduced in the 2nd Session of the 107th Congress aimed to restore FY2003 funding to the guaranteed level specified in TEA-21. The \"Highway Funding Restoration Act\" bills, H.R. 3694 and S. 1917, were introduced simultaneously on February 7, 2002, directing an increase in spending by $4.369 billion by utilizing the unexpended balance in the Highway Trust Fund. These bills were introduced by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, with support from a majority of both the House and Senate. An amended version of H.R. 3694 and S. 1917, introduced in the 2nd Session of the 107th Congress, aimed to increase highway funding by $1.3 billion. Some Governors and highway interest groups viewed these bills as a good start but sought a larger increase to reach the same level of highway spending as FY2002. Congress agreed with this argument, considering the impact on the overall unified budget deficit. The appropriations committees must balance various transportation funding needs. The authors of RABA expected it to provide additional money to the highway program, with peak RABA levels benefiting the program in bonus years. A provision in the FY2002 emergency supplemental appropriations bill blocked a downward RABA adjustment for FY2003, setting the program at its authorized $27.7 billion level. The Senate Committee on Appropriations later proposed increasing spending to the FY2002 level. Congress decided to retain funding at the FY2002 level by passing the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003 (P.L.108-7) early in the 108th Congress. Supporters of increasing the FY2003 limitation on obligations pointed to the unexpended balance in the Highway Trust Fund as a potential source of additional funds. However, not all of this balance is actually available due to a significant portion being reserved to meet future obligations, as required by the \"Byrd Rule\". TEA-21 must be reauthorized before FY2004 for the program to continue. The debate over RABA is highlighting the need to review trust fund revenue sources, especially regarding gasohol. Gasohol use is expected to increase, but lower tax levels could decrease trust fund revenues. The push for alternative fuel sources in the automobile industry is also a concern. When TEA-21 was signed in late 1998, the highway trust fund had a growing unexpended balance expected to exceed $24 billion by the end of FY1999. The higher spending levels in TEA-21 and the creation of the RABA spending mechanism aimed to prevent continued growth in the trust fund balance. The unexpended balance is now trending downward, potentially making it difficult to support significant program growth during reauthorization without new funding sources. The unexpended balance in the Highway Trust Fund is decreasing, which may hinder significant program growth during reauthorization without additional funding sources. Some refer to the unexpended balance as \"the surplus.\""
