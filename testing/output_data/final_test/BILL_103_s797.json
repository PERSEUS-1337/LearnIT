    "content": "The \"Federal Employees' Optional Early Retirement Act\" aims to reduce Federal Government civilian payrolls in a voluntary manner, accommodate the retirement plans of employees who do not meet age and service requirements, allow early retirement to avoid budgetary issues, and provide job protection and opportunities for employees, especially women, minorities, and young workers. Section 8336 of title 5, United States Code, is amended to allow early retirement options for federal employees based on age and years of service. The amendment to Section 8336 of title 5, United States Code, allows federal employees to retire early based on age and years of service. Employees meeting specific criteria are entitled to an annuity, with exceptions for certain positions as determined by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management. SEC. 4 amends section 8339(h) of title 5, United States Code by including (n) in addition to (j) for annuity computation. SEC. 5 applies these amendments to other federal government retirement systems. The President extends the application of certain retirement system amendments to participants in the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement System, Foreign Service Retirement System, and federal employees under chapter 84 of title 5, United States Code. The President extends retirement system amendments to employees of the Executive branch who are participants in any Federal Government retirement system and their survivors. SEC. 6. EXEMPTION FOR ESSENTIAL OCCUPATIONAL CATEGORIES. An officer or employee retiring under section 8336(n) of title 5, United States Code is not entitled to an annuity if serving in an exempt occupational category, working on an exempt project, or in an exempt location designated by the President. The President can designate certain officers or employees as exempt from early retirement if they are working on essential projects for the Federal Government or in difficult-to-fill locations. This designation must be made in writing before the optional early retirement period begins and cannot affect more than 25% of eligible officers and employees in an Executive agency.

HOLDOVER OF ESSENTIAL EMPLOYEES. An officer or employee in the Executive branch is not entitled to an annuity under certain conditions. This includes serving as an essential employee designated under subsection (b) and separating from Federal Government employment immediately upon the termination of the designation.

An officer or employee in the Executive branch may be entitled to an annuity under certain conditions, even if separation occurs after the designated period. The head of an Executive agency can designate essential personnel for critical projects or responsibilities, but the designation is limited to 6 months. SEC. 8. LIMITATION ON REPLACEMENT OF RETIREES.

Noncompliance will be reported to Congress. SEC. 11. PROGRAM REPORT.

The report should include the number of retirees by agency, age group, and position classification, as well as details on exempt occupational categories, projects, and locations designated under section 6(b). The Director of the Office of Personnel Management may request information from federal agencies to prepare a report for Congress on essential employees, appointments under waiver authority, and cost savings from the implementation of the Act.
