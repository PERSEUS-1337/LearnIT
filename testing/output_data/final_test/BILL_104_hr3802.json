    "content": "The Act titled \"Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996\" is abbreviated as such. It includes findings and purposes outlined in Section 2. The Congress finds that the purpose of the Freedom of Information Act is to make agency information available to the public, leading to transparency and accountability in the Federal Government by disclosing waste, fraud, and abuse. The Freedom of Information Act aims to identify unsafe products, enhance public access to agency records, foster democracy, improve compliance with time limits, and maximize the usefulness of government information. The Freedom of Information Act is amended to include electronic format information, expanding the definition of agency and record to encompass all formats, including electronic. Information in electronic format must be made available and indexed for public access. Section 552(a)(2) of title 5, United States Code is amended to include provisions for indicating deletions in records made available to the public. The amendment to Section 552(a)(2) of title 5, United States Code requires agencies to provide copies of released records likely to be requested again, along with a general index accessible by computer by December 31, 1999. Additionally, agencies must make records created after November 1, 1996 available within one year of creation. Each agency must make records available by electronic means, including computer telecommunications, by a specified date. SEC. 5. HONORING FORM OR FORMAT REQUESTS. Section 552(a)(3) of title 5, United States Code is amended to require agencies to provide records in any requested form or format if readily reproducible. Agencies must make reasonable efforts to maintain records in reproducible forms and search for records electronically when responding to requests, except when it would significantly interfere with their systems. The term 'search' is defined as reviewing agency records to locate those responsive to a request, without interfering with the agency's automated information system. SEC. 6 amends Section 552(a)(4)(B) of title 5, United States Code, to require courts to give substantial weight to agency affidavits regarding technical feasibility and reproducibility. SEC. 7 focuses on ensuring timely responses to requests. (a) Multitrack Processing.--Section 552(a)(6) of title 5, United States Code, allows agencies to create regulations for multitrack processing of record requests based on workload. This includes giving requesters the option to narrow their request for faster processing. This does not affect the requirement for due diligence. (b) Unusual Circumstances.--Section 552(a)(6)(B) is amended to address unusual circumstances in processing requests. In certain cases, time limits for processing record requests can be extended due to unusual circumstances by providing a written notice to the requester. The extension cannot exceed ten working days, except in specific situations. If the request cannot be processed within the extended time limit, the agency must inform the requester and offer the opportunity to narrow the scope of the request for timely processing. The agency may extend time limits for processing record requests in unusual circumstances, such as the need to search for records in separate locations or examine a large volume of records. If the request cannot be processed within the extended time limit, the requester can modify the request or arrange an alternative time frame. Refusal to do so may be considered in determining exceptional circumstances. The agency may extend time limits for processing record requests in unusual circumstances, such as the need for consultation with another agency or aggregation of requests by the same requestor. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters shall not be aggregated. The amendment to Section 552(a)(6)(C) of title 5, United States Code, clarifies that \"exceptional circumstances\" do not include delays due to predictable agency workload unless progress is made in reducing backlog. Refusal to modify a request or timeframe may be considered in determining exceptional circumstances. SEC. 8. TIME PERIOD FOR AGENCY CONSIDERATION OF REQUESTS. Expedited Processing: Agencies must create regulations for expedited processing of record requests in cases of compelling need or as determined by the agency. Determinations must be made within 10 days of the request, with prompt consideration of appeals. An agency must process requests for expedited processing promptly. Judicial review is available for denials or delays in response. District courts cannot review denials after a complete response is provided. 'Compelling need' is defined as a failure to obtain requested records. The text chunk discusses the criteria for expedited processing of records requests, including situations where there is a threat to life or urgency to inform the public. It also extends the time period for agencies to determine compliance with requests. The text chunk amends Section 552(a)(6) of title 5, United States Code to require agencies to estimate the volume of denied records and provide this estimate to the requester, unless it would harm a protected interest. SEC. 9 amends Section 552(b) of title 5, US Code to require indicating the amount of information deleted in released records, unless it would harm a protected interest. SEC. 10 requires agencies to report denied record volume estimates to requesters. Section 552(e) of title 5, United States Code is amended to require agencies to submit an annual report to the Attorney General, detailing the number of record request denials, appeals, reasons for denials, and statutes used to withhold information. The agency must report the number of pending record requests, processing times, fees collected, staff dedicated to processing requests, and expenses incurred. Each agency must make this report available to the Attorney General annually. Each agency must make their report on record requests available to the public electronically. The Attorney General will consolidate these reports into a single electronic access point and notify relevant congressional committees. The Attorney General, in collaboration with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, will develop reporting guidelines for required reports by October 1, 1997. Additional requirements may be established as deemed useful. The Attorney General must submit an annual report by April 1 of each year, detailing cases under this section, exemptions, case dispositions, and associated costs. The report should also outline efforts by the Department of Justice to ensure agency compliance. SEC. 11. REFERENCE MATERIALS AND GUIDES.\n\nEach agency head must provide reference materials or guides for requesting records or information, including an index of information systems, descriptions of record locator systems, and a handbook for obtaining public information.\n\nSEC. 12. EFFECTIVE DATE. SEC. 12. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act will take effect 180 days after enactment, with Sections 7 and 8 becoming effective one year after enactment."
