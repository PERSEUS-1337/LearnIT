    "title": "AB 1124",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Legislature intends for the Administrative Director of the Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation to establish an evidence-based drug formulary for the workers\u2019 compensation system. The formulary will include guidelines for pain management medications, access to off-label prescription drugs when medically necessary, and the use of generic drugs based on evidence-based practices. Emergency department and inpatient care are exempt from the formulary. The Labor Code is amended to require dispensing generic drug equivalents, with exceptions for unavailability or physician's written request for a nongeneric drug. \"Dispense\" is defined as in the Business and Professions Code. Section 4600.2 of the Labor Code is amended to allow prescribing physicians who also dispense medication to provide generic drug equivalents, with exceptions for unavailability or physician's request for a nongeneric drug. This provision applies to medicines dispensed before the drug formulary's operative date. Section 4600.2 allows self-insured employers, insurers, or pharmacy networks to provide medicines and medical supplies to injured employees as prescribed in the contract. Medicines must adhere to the drug formulary and cannot limit availability based on pharmacy services location. Section 5307.27 of the Labor Code is amended to allow employee-selected physicians to prescribe medicines and medical supplies as needed for injured employees, subject to the drug formulary. Contracts must comply with standards set by the administrative director to reduce pharmaceutical costs and ensure access to a nearby pharmacy for injured employees. The Labor Code is amended to include a medical treatment utilization schedule that incorporates evidence-based standards of care and a drug formulary using evidence-based medicine by July 1, 2017. Variance for medications not in the formulary is allowed with demonstrated need. The drug formulary implementation includes a phased approach for workers injured before July 1, 2017. It applies to all prescribers and dispensers serving injured workers. Stakeholders must be consulted before establishing the formulary. The administrative director will provide interim reports on the creation of the drug formulary starting July 1, 2016. Quarterly updates will be made to the formulary to include new medications. The administrative director will establish an independent pharmacy and therapeutics committee to review evidence of drug safety and effectiveness for updating the drug formulary. Changes to the formulary will be made through exempt orders and published online. The committee consists of six members and the Executive Medical Director of the Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation. Members must be medical doctors or doctors of osteopathy with relevant expertise in prescribing, dispensing, monitoring, drug use review, and evidence-based medicine. Committee members must not have financial ties to pharmaceutical companies, pharmacy benefits management companies, or companies developing pharmaceutical formularies for commercial sale. They must also adhere to standards set by the administrative director regarding conflicts of interest and keep proprietary information confidential."
