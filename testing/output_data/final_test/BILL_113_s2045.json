Section 101 of title 17, United States Code, is amended to include definitions related to auctions and sales of works of visual art. An auction is defined as a public sale run by an entity that sold not less than $1,000,000 of works of visual art in the previous year. The definition of \"price\" is clarified as the total amount paid for a work of visual art at auction. The term \"sale\" is also defined for specific sections of the code. The definition of \"work of visual art\" is clarified as a painting, drawing, print, sculpture, or photograph, existing in limited editions with the author's signature and consecutively numbered. The definition of a \"work of visual art\" includes limited edition pieces with the author's signature or identifying mark. SEC. 3. EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS. Section 106 of title 17, United States Code is amended to include the collection of a royalty for the sale of a work of visual art for a price of $5,000 or more through an auction. The royalty amount is calculated based on specific criteria outlined in the subsection. The amended Section 106 of title 17, United States Code includes the collection of a royalty for the sale of a work of visual art priced at $5,000 or more through an auction. The royalty amount is determined as the lesser of 5 percent of the price paid or $35,000, with adjustments for inflation annually. The collection of the royalty must occur within 90 days after the sale. The entity conducting the auction must collect and pay the royalty to a visual artists' copyright collecting society within 90 days. The society then distributes the net royalty to the author after deducting reasonable administrative expenses. The royalty provided for under this subsection must be paid to the author of a work of visual art within 90 days by the entity conducting the auction. Failure to pay the royalty constitutes copyright infringement and is subject to statutory damages and liability for the full royalty amount. The right to collect the royalty cannot be sold, assigned, or waived except as provided in section 201. The royalty must be paid to the author of a visual art work within 90 days by the auction entity. Failure to pay constitutes copyright infringement with statutory damages. The right to collect the royalty cannot be sold, assigned, or waived except as provided in section 201. Payment shall be made to the author of a visual art work who is a citizen of the United States, a country with resale royalty rights, or whose work was first created in the United States or a country with resale royalty rights, or to the successor as copyright owner of such author. Section 401 of title 17, United States Code, is amended to exclude works of visual art from the provisions of this section. Additionally, there is a new section regarding the Copyright Office. Section 701(b) of title 17, United States Code, is amended to issue regulations governing visual artists' copyright collecting societies, establishing a process for designation and authorization to administer royalty collections and distributions for visual art copyrights. The amendment to Section 701(b) of title 17, United States Code, establishes regulations for visual artists' copyright collecting societies, requiring authorization from a significant number of authors of visual art to license rights under section 106. An entity cannot be designated as a visual artists' copyright collecting society if it fails to meet certain criteria over a 5-year period. The visual artists' copyright collecting society must determine royalties to be distributed to authors, set administrative expenses, and establish a process for requesting royalties from entities conducting transactions. Authors represented by a collecting society can request a list of their art sold at auctions and obtain information on royalties paid to the society on their behalf. SEC. 6. STUDY REQUIRED. The Register of Copyrights must conduct a study on the effects of this Act on the art market in the US and consider expanding its provisions to cover art dealers. A report with recommendations must be submitted to the Senate and House Judiciary Committees. SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE. The Act and its amendments will become effective one year after enactment."
