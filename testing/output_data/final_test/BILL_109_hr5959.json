    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"TEAM up for Energy Independence Act\" and aims to encourage alternatively fueled vehicle manufacturing for energy independence. Climate change poses a threat to the planet with rising temperatures, shifting weather patterns, shrinking ice sheets, and rising sea levels due to human activities emitting heat-trapping gases. The need for energy independence in the United States is reinforced by rising gas prices and instability in oil producing regions. Developing alternatively fueled vehicles, such as biodiesel and E-85 ethanol fueled cars, can help combat climate change and reduce petroleum fuel usage. Currently, there are only 6,000,000 E-85 capable vehicles on US roads compared to 230,000,000 gasoline and diesel fueled vehicles. Currently, there are only 556 fueling stations in the United States providing E-85 fuel and 450 retail pumps offering biodiesel fuel, which is less than one percent of all fueling stations. Congress needs to do more to make alternative fueled vehicles more accessible to everyone. SEC. 3. EXCISE TAX ON AUTOMOBILES SOLD IN UNITED STATES THAT ARE NOT ALTERNATIVE FUELED AUTOMOBILES. An excise tax is imposed on the 1st retail sale of each passenger automobile that is not an alternative fueled automobile. The tax amount is determined by the applicable percentage of the sale price, with exceptions for alternative fueled vehicles. The applicable percentage for passenger automobiles sold in different years is as follows: 5 percent in 2007, 10 percent in 2008, 20 percent in 2009, 40 percent in 2010, and 80 percent in 2011 or thereafter. The term 'passenger automobile' is defined as per section 32901(a)(16) of title 49, US Code, including parts and accessories. An 'alternative fueled automobile' is defined as one using a fuel with greenhouse gas emissions less than 80% of those from petroleum-derived fuel. The text discusses amendments to section 32901 of title 49, US Code, related to emissions standards for passenger automobiles and alternative fueled automobiles. The amendments involve substituting '10,000 pounds' for '6,000 pounds' in certain paragraphs. Additionally, there are conforming amendments to the heading of part I of subchapter A of chapter 32 of the Code. The text discusses amendments to emissions standards for passenger automobiles and alternative fueled automobiles. It involves changing the weight limit in certain paragraphs and updating the heading for non-alternative fuel vehicles and gas guzzlers. The amendments apply to automobiles sold after December 31, 2006. The Secretary of Energy will provide grants from a trust fund for alternative fuel refueling infrastructure projects at fueling stations owned by entities with 10 or fewer businesses. The trust fund, established in the Treasury, will receive funds collected for this purpose. The trust fund will receive all tax amounts collected under section 4061 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Definitions for \"alternative fuel\" and \"E-85 fuel\" are provided. The trust fund consists of 85 percent ethanol and gasoline, and the term \"trust fund\" refers to the fund established under subsection (b). SEC. 5 of the Automobile Information Disclosure Act is amended to include information disclosure related to alternative fueled automobiles, specifying whether the automobile is capable of operating on alternative fuels as defined in title 49, United States Code."
