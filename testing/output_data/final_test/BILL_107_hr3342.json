    "content": "The \"Access for Afghan Women Act of 2001\" may be cited as such. The findings of the Act are outlined in Section 2. Before 1996, women in Afghanistan had basic human rights and were active in various professions. Over 90% of Afghan men and women support women's rights, including education and work. Women make up over 75% of refugees in Afghanistan, with organizations providing critical services. Women's organizations and refugees have the experience to assist the US in delivering relief aid to women. Women's active participation in Afghanistan's government, economy, and society is crucial for lasting peace. Women have played key roles in maintaining local economies and rebuilding them after conflicts, emphasizing the need for development and reconstruction assistance that considers women as economic leaders. SEC. 3. REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO UNITED STATES ACTIVITIES IN CENTRAL ASIAN COUNTRIES. Activities in Afghanistan and Central Asia must comply with specific requirements. For peace negotiations in Afghanistan, representatives of women's organizations and human rights experts must be consulted. The government of Afghanistan should ensure that women's human rights are included in the constitution by involving women in the drafting process. Post-conflict reconstruction efforts should support Afghan women's organizations and promote women-centered economic development programs. Increase women's access to productive assets, provide financial assistance for education, build health infrastructure, integrate education and training for former combatants, and support awareness efforts. Support educational efforts to increase awareness and facilitate the removal of landmines, provide services to individuals with disabilities caused by landmines, and assist in rehabilitating children affected by conflict, especially child soldiers. Take necessary steps to protect and ensure the safety of women refugees fleeing from the conflict in Afghanistan and other countries of Central Asia. Women refugees in camps, urban areas, and villages in Afghanistan are receiving food aid, shelter, and other services from US-sponsored programs. Steps are being taken to ensure access to quality health services, especially for reproductive, maternal, and child health. Efforts are also being made to facilitate the voluntary return of refugees to their place of origin with safety, dignity, and protection of their rights. Peacekeeping operations in Afghanistan and Central Asia are also being addressed. In preparation for peacekeeping missions in Afghanistan and Central Asia, training and materials on women's protection and rights are provided to military, police, and civilian personnel. Consultation with women's organizations is encouraged for developing appropriate training content. Other countries of Central Asia include Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. The President must submit a report to Congress within 60 days of this Act's enactment, documenting the progress in implementing the requirements of section 3, including gender-disaggregated data."
