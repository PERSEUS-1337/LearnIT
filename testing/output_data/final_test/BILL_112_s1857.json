    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act\" and includes a numerical limitation to any single foreign state. The \"Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act\" makes amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act, specifically in section 202 and 203, by adjusting numerical limitations and rules for countries at ceiling. The \"Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act\" includes special rules for countries at ceiling regarding the allocation of immigrant visa numbers to natives of those countries. The \"Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act\" amends the Chinese Student Protection Act of 1992 to change subsections and effective dates. It also establishes transition rules for employment-based immigrants, including visa allocation percentages for fiscal year 2012. For fiscal year 2013, a percentage of immigrant visas under section 203(b) will be allotted to natives of states with lower numbers of lawful permanent residents in previous years. For fiscal year 2014, 10 percent of immigrant visas under section 203(b) will be reserved for natives of foreign states or dependent areas that did not have high numbers of lawful permanent residents in fiscal year 2012. Per-country visa levels restrict the number of visas for any single foreign state or area to 25. For fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014, a maximum of 25 percent of immigrant visas can be allocated to natives of any single foreign state under section 203(b). Unused visas will be allotted to immigrants from any single foreign state based on a specific calculation. The number of immigrant visas available for a fiscal year is 70% of the total visas under section 203(b). Rules for chargeability to a foreign state apply for determining visa allocation."
