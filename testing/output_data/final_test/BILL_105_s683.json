    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Library of Congress Bicentennial Commemorative Coin Act of 1997\" and outlines coin specifications. The \"Library of Congress Bicentennial Commemorative Coin Act of 1997\" authorizes the minting of $5 gold coins and $1 silver coins with specific weights, diameters, and compositions. Additionally, the Secretary of the Treasury may mint up to 100,000 $5 platinum coins instead of gold coins. The coins minted under the \"Library of Congress Bicentennial Commemorative Coin Act of 1997\" are legal tender and considered numismatic items under specific sections of the United States Code. The Secretary obtains gold for minting coins from existing authorities and silver only from stockpiles established under a specific Act. The design of the coins is specified in the Act. The design of coins minted under this Act shall be emblematic of the Library of Congress, with specific inscriptions and designations. The design will be selected by the Secretary in consultation with the Library of Congress and other entities, and reviewed by a committee. Coins will be issued according to the Act. Coins minted under this Act will be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities at a single United States Mint facility. The Secretary can only issue these coins between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2000. Additionally, the Secretary must consult with the Library of Congress for promotion and marketing, and may enter into a contract with them for this purpose. SEC. 6. SALE OF COINS. The coins issued under this Act will be sold by the Secretary at a price equal to the face value, surcharge, and cost of designing and issuing. Bulk sales will be offered at a discount, and prepaid orders will be accepted with a reasonable discount. All sales will include a surcharge. The Secretary will establish surcharges for the $5 coin at $35 per coin and for the $1 coin at $5 per coin. SEC. 7 of the Act waives procurement regulations for goods and services needed for the Act, except for equal employment opportunity laws. SEC. 8 addresses the distribution of surcharges for specific coins. SEC. 8 of the Act directs all surcharges from coin sales to the Library of Congress Trust Fund Board for bicentennial programs and educational outreach. The Comptroller General can audit the Trust Fund Board's expenditures. SEC. 9 of the Act ensures that minting and issuing coins will not cost the government. Payment for coins must be made in full, with satisfactory security or guarantees in place."
