He surveyed routes for roads in Virginia and met Albert Gallatin, a proponent of federal involvement in infrastructure development. By the end of the 18th century, most roads in the US were local, connecting farms to nearby areas. In the late 18th century, most roads in the United States were local paths connecting farms to villages. Ebenezer Zane built Zane's Trace in exchange for land, later improved and incorporated into the National Road. Albert Gallatin proposed exempting federal land sales from taxation. In 1802, Gallatin proposed exempting federal land sales from taxation and allocating a percentage of proceeds for road building, which was adopted in the Ohio Statehood Enabling Act. This act set aside 5% of land sale proceeds for roads in Ohio, later amended to allocate 3% for state roads and 2% for roads to and through Ohio. This federal assistance was extended to all states with public lands. In 1807, Gallatin was directed to report on existing and proposed roads and canals in the US, recommending early federal aid. The Federal Government is recommended to aid in building roads and canals to improve communication and unity across the vast territory of the United States. This interconnected system was proposed in 1806 but faced opposition in Congress and was never implemented. President Thomas Jefferson signed the Cumberland Road Act in 1806, directing the construction of a road from Cumberland, MD, to the Ohio River funded by the Ohio 2% fund. The road, also known as The National Road, required permission from Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania legislatures before construction began. President James Madison proposed federal funding for internal improvements in 1816, seeking an amendment to allow the government to finance and construct projects. President Madison vetoed a bill in 1817 to finance internal improvements with funds from a bonus payment from the Bank of the United States due to the lack of a constitutional amendment. The Cumberland Road deteriorated from heavy traffic and lack of maintenance, leading to Congress passing legislation in 1822 to collect tolls for repairs. President Monroe vetoed this, citing it as an overreach of federal power. Funding for road repairs was eventually provided after Andrew Jackson's election in 1828. After Andrew Jackson became President in 1828, there was a belief that he would support internal improvements. Jackson vetoed legislation to extend the Cumberland Road, stating that such projects were the responsibility of the states. State operation of the road as a toll road was considered as an alternative. In 1831 and 1832, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia agreed to maintain their sections of the Cumberland Road. Jackson believed that the federal government had authority to construct internal improvements in the territories. More federal funds were spent on internal improvement projects during Jackson's Administration than in all previous administrations, focused on territories and the District of Columbia. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, private companies built toll roads with state encouragement and investment in the United States and the District of Columbia. These roads were often financially unsuccessful unless they connected city pairs or provided a farm-to-market route with sufficient traffic. Secretary Albert Gallatin highlighted the importance of transportation costs being lower on improved routes compared to natural routes for the nation's benefit. The boom in turnpike construction in the late 18th and early 19th centuries led to the building of over 8,000 miles of toll roads in the United States. Despite financial difficulties and high failure rates for investors, toll roads played a significant role in freight and passenger movement between cities and towns. However, with the expansion of railway networks, toll roads lost most of their passenger traffic. By 1900, most turnpike companies had gone out of business as railway networks spread, leading to toll roads losing their passenger and freight business. State and local governments took over some roads, while others were abandoned by failing turnpike companies. State legislation in the late 19th century included provisions for the dissolution of toll companies and the transfer of responsibility to government entities. Resistance to federal financial involvement in road construction was based on constitutional concerns, budgetary constraints, and state/regional rivalries. The budget of the United States relied on tariff revenues and some feared that investing in roads could overwhelm the budget. Sectional differences and rivalries also played a role in the opposition to federal spending on roads. The National League for Good Roads was established in 1892 to advocate for better road conditions, as the popularity of bicycles grew but road conditions remained poor. The National League for Good Roads was established in 1892 to coordinate the Good Roads Movement and lobby for road improvements. Initially, farmers were not involved in the movement, but they joined after road lobbyists worked with the Post Office on Rural Free Delivery. This movement influenced states to provide state aid for highway departments. Benjamin Harrison signed the 1894 Department of Agriculture Appropriations Act, allocating $10,000 for road research. The Department of Agriculture allocated $10,000 in 1894 for road research to improve transportation for farmers. The Office of Road Inquiry (ORI) was created to collect and disseminate information, and later added a program to build short road stretches using contributed labor. The ORI was renamed the Office of Public Road Inquiries (OPRI) in 1899, with increasing appropriations for roads every year until 1912. The Office of Public Roads (OPR) was established in 1905 to provide expert advice on road building and investigate road-making materials. Various organizations pushed for federal aid to roads, leading to the introduction of over 60 bills during the 62nd Congress session from December 1911 to May 1912. The Post Office Department Appropriations Act 1913 allocated $500,000 for rural post road improvement, with 13 states and 28 counties participating in building approximately 455 miles of road. This led to the decision that federal aid should only go to states, not counties. A Joint Committee on Federal Aid in the Construction of Post Roads was established to address road maintenance. The committee released a report titled Federal Aid to Good Roads in 1914, supporting more federal funds for road construction. State highway officials formed AASHO to assist the government on highway-related matters. The demand for supplies during World War I overloaded the nation's railroad system. During World War I, the demand for supplies overwhelmed Canada's railroad system, leading to the rapid growth of the trucking industry in the United States. In response, the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1916 was passed, providing federal financial assistance for the construction of rural post roads. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1916 provided federal financial assistance for the construction of rural post roads. The Act of 1921 divided highways into primary and secondary categories and established the Bureau of Public Roads to administer federal funding for road construction. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1938 provided federal funding for highway construction, with primary and secondary categories designated by each state. It increased funds for road building in response to economic downturns, amending the 1916 Act to allocate $50 million in addition to previous appropriations. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1938 allocated funds for highway construction, with primary and secondary categories designated by each state. In 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed the National Interregional Highway Committee to study the creation of a unique highway system to meet wartime and post-war traffic needs. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1944 established the National System of Interstate Highways, not to exceed 40,000 miles, with no funds authorized for the system. Instead, $225 million was allocated for primary roads in the first three post-war years, $150 million for secondary roads, and $125 million for urban federal-aid highway construction. The act also set apportionment formulas for each state. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1952 authorized funds for the Interstate system on a federal-state matching basis. President Dwight D. Eisenhower played a key role in implementing the Interstate Highway System with a national defense dimension. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1954 allocated funds for the interstate system in a federal-state matching ratio. In 1956, the Federal Aid Highway and Highway Revenue Acts authorized significant funding for highways, creating the Highway Trust Fund. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 created the Highway Trust Fund to finance the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways through tax revenues from excise taxes on highway motor fuel and truck-related taxes. Prior to this, federal financial assistance for highways came from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury. The act set the expiration date for the crediting of these funds to highway funding at the end of FY1972, but subsequent legislation extended this. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1959 extended the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways to Alaska and Hawaii, with the intent to reimburse states for highways absorbed into the Interstate System. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1962 created the 3C transportation planning process, requiring long-range highway plans in urban areas. The Highway Safety Act of 1966 mandated safety measures in each state. The Highway Safety Act of 1966 required states to have a highway safety program to reduce deaths, injuries, and property damage. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1970 increased the federal share of non-interstate highway projects to 70% and created the Special Bridge Replacement Program. This act also directed the Secretary to inventory bridges on the national highway system and assign priorities for replacement. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1973 authorized funds for the completion of the Interstate Highway System and established the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways. It also allocated funds for bus lanes, highway traffic control devices, and allowed states to use a portion of highway funds for bicycle lanes and pedestrian walkways. Additionally, states could request funding for fixed-rail transit facilities instead of highway construction. The act set a national policy for road priorities and provided up to 75% federal funding for bridge replacement projects. The 1976 Federal-Aid Highway Act established the \"resurfacing, restoration, and rehabilitation\" program using funds from the general fund. The 1978 STAA expanded the Special Bridge Replacement Program into the Highway Bridge Replacement Program, authorizing appropriations for resurfacing interstate highways in use for more than five years. The eligibility requirements for the 3R program were revised in the 1981 Federal-Aid Highway Act. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1981 (P.L. 97-134, 95 Stat. 1701) established provisions for the Interstate System funding, while the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 (1982 STAA) extended advance construction funds for bridge projects and allowed fund transfers between urbanized areas. Additionally, the act reduced highway funds for states without proof of heavy vehicle use tax payment and implemented a Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBEs) program to allocate 10% of project funds to economically or socially disadvantaged businesses. The 1982 STAA focused on the Highway Trust Fund, with features like a gas tax increase and the establishment of a mass transit account. It also allocated emergency relief funds and authorized appropriations for bridge projects and hazard elimination. The STURAA of 1987 authorized appropriations for highway assistance projects from FY1988 to FY1993, and was the only highway bill vetoed by President Reagan but passed by Congress. The Intermodal Surface Transportation and Equity Act of 1991 (ISTEA) was passed over President Reagan's veto, increasing emergency relief grants and allowing states to use Interstate Highway funds for planning and research. ISTEA declared the last authorizations for the completion of the Interstate Highway System and established the Surface Transportation Program (STP) for various transportation projects. The Surface Transportation Program (STP) allowed spending on roads previously considered below federal responsibility. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) reauthorized Highway Trust Fund revenue streams and authorized approximately $218 billion for highway program funding from FY1998 to FY2003. Minimum guarantee ensured each state received at least 90.5% of its contributions to the highway trust fund. TEA-21 amended the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 by creating firewalls for highway and transit funds. Of the $218 billion authorized, 81% was for highways and highway safety programs, with the remaining 19% for transit. Each state was guaranteed at least 90.5% share returns on funds paid into the trust fund, and interest payments on the unexpended balance were eliminated. TEA-21 eliminated interest payments and transferred the unexpended balance of the Highway Trust Fund to the general fund. The Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) ensured that highway spending was directly proportional to highway revenues. RABA provided an additional $9 billion for highway spending between FY2000 and FY2002, but in FY2003, after the RABA adjustment, the amount available for highway spending dropped 30%. Congress raised highway spending for FY2003 to $31.8 billion in response. The Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) modified and extended funding guarantees from TEA-21. It adjusted the RABA based on actual receipts and receipt projections, distributing funds only in FY2007. SAFETEA-LU allowed states to use tolling on interstate highways and clarified the use of HOV lanes. The Equity Bonus Program replaced the Minimum Guarantee Program. The Equity Bonus (EB) Program replaced the Minimum Guarantee (MG) Program from TEA-21, ensuring states receive a minimum annual percentage floor. Pilot programs include the Truck Parking Facilities Program, Highways for Life Program, Real-Time System Management Information Program, and Future Strategic Highway Research Program. These programs aim to address parking shortages, improve safety, reduce congestion, and research highway infrastructure renewal. The program for highway infrastructure renewal aims to minimize traffic delays, prevent crashes, reduce travel times, and expand highway capacity. It received $205 million for FY2006-FY2009 and has been operating on authorization extension acts since October 1, 2009."
